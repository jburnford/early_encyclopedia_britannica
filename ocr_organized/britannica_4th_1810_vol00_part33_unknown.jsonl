In this history we would propose that the author should describe the crimes peculiar to different nations in the different stages of society, and the changes which they undergo in the progress of civilization. After having arranged the historical facts, he might, by comparing them with the religion and the knowledge of the people, deduce some important general conclusions, which would lead to a discovery of the cause of crimes, and of the remedy most proper to be applied. Some crimes are peculiar to certain stages of society, some to certain nations, &c.\n\nSuicide is one of those crimes which we are led to believe not common among savage nations. The first instances of it recorded in the Jewish history are those of Saul and Ahithophel; for we do not think the death of Samson a proper example. We have no reason to suppose that it became common among the Jews till their wars with the Romans, when multitudes slaughtered themselves that they might not fall alive into the hands of their enemies. But at this period the Jews were a most desperate and abandoned race of men, had corrupted the religion of their fathers, and rejected that pure system which their promised Messiah came to Jerusalem to announce.\n\nWhen it became remarkable among the Greeks, we have not been able to discover; but it was forbidden by Pythagoras, as we learn from Athenaeus, by Socrates and Aristotle, and by the Theban and Athenian laws. In the earliest ages of the Roman republic it was seldom committed; but when luxury and the Epicurean and Stoical philosophy had corrupted the simplicity and virtue of the Roman character; then they began to seek shelter in suicide from their misfortunes or the effects of their own vices.\n\nThe religious principles of the brahmins of India led them to admire suicide on particular occasions as honourable. Accustomed to abstinence, mortification, and the contempt of death, they considered it as a mark of weakness of mind to submit to the infirmities of old age. We are informed that the modern Gentoos, who still in most things conform to the customs of their ancestors, when old and infirm, are frequently brought to the banks of rivers, particularly to those of the Ganges, that they may die in its sacred streams, which they believe can wash away the guilt of their sins. But the maxims of the brahmins, which have encouraged this practice, we are assured by Mr Holwell, are a corruption of the doctrines of the Shaftah, which positively forbid suicide vol. ii. under the severest punishment. The practice which Hindu's religion or affection has established among the Gentoos, for women at the death of their husbands to burn themselves alive on the funeral pile, we do not think ought to be considered as suicide, as we are not anxious to extend the meaning of the word; for were we to extend it thus far, it would be as proper to apply it to those who choose rather to die in battle than make their escape at the expense of their honour. Thus we should condemn as suicides the brave Spartans who died at Thermopylae in defence of their country; we should also be obliged to apply the same disgraceful epithet to all those well-meaning but weak-minded Christians in this island, who in the last century chose rather to die as martyrs than comply with commands which were not morally wrong. According to the Gentoo laws, \"it is proper for a woman after her husband's death to burn herself in the fire with his corpse. Every woman who thus burns shall remain in paradise with her husband three crore and fifty lacks of years. If she cannot, she must in that case preserve an inviolable chastity. If she remain chaste, she goes to paradise; and if she do not preserve her chastity, she goes to hell.\"\n\nA custom similar to this prevailed among many nations on the continent of America. When a chief died, a certain number of his wives, of his favourites, and of his slaves, were put to death, and interred together with him, that he might appear with the same dignity in his future station, and be waited upon by the same attendants. This persuasion is so deeply rooted, that many of their retainers offer themselves as victims; and the same custom prevails in many of the negro nations in Africa.\n\nIf we can believe the historians of Japan, voluntary death is common in that empire. The devotees of the Amida drown themselves in his presence, attended by their relations and friends, and several of the priests, who all consider the devoted person as a saint who is gone to everlasting happiness. Such being the supposed object of the honours appropriated to a voluntary death, it is not surprising that the Japanese anxiously cherish a contempt of life. Accordingly it is a part of the education of their children \"to repeat poems in which the virtues of their ancestors.\"\nancestors are celebrated, an utter contempt of life is inculcated, and suicide is set up as the most heroic of actions.\n\nA notion seems also to have prevailed among the ancient Scythian tribes, that it was pusillanimous and ignoble for a man whose strength was wasted with disease or infirmity, so as to be useless to the community, to continue to live. It was reckoned an heroic action voluntarily to seek that death which he had not the good fortune to meet in the field of battle. Perversion of moral feeling does not spring up, we hope, spontaneously in any nation, but is produced by some peculiarities of situation. A wandering people like the Scythians, who roamed about from place to place, might often find it impossible to attend the sick, or to supply from their precarious store the wants of the aged and infirm. The aged and infirm themselves, no longer able to support the character of warriors, would find themselves unhappy. In this way the practice of putting to death such persons as were useless to the community might originate, and afterwards be inculcated as honourable; but he who put an end to his infirmities by his own hand, obtained a character still more illustrious.\n\nThe tribes of Scandinavia, which worshipped Odin the \"father of slaughter,\" were taught, that dying in the field of battle was the most glorious event that could befall them. This was a maxim suited to a warlike nation. In order to establish it more firmly in the mind, all were excluded from Odin's feast of heroes who died a natural death. In Asgardia stood the hall of Odin; where, seated on a throne, he received the souls of his departed heroes. This place was called Valhalla, signifying \"the hall of those who died by violence.\" Natural death being thus deemed inglorious, and punished with exclusion from Valhalla the paradise of Odin, he who could not enjoy death in the field of battle was led to seek it by his own hands when sickness or old age began to assail him. In such a nation suicide must have been very common.\n\nAs suicide prevailed much in the decline of the Roman empire, when luxury, licentiousness, profligacy, and false philosophy pervaded the world, so it continued to prevail even after Christianity was established. The Romans, when they became converts to Christianity, did not renounce their ancient prejudices and false opinions, but blended them with the new religion which they embraced. The Gothic nations also, who subverted the Roman empire, while they received the Christian religion, adhered to many of their former opinions and manners. Among other criminal practices which were retained by the Romans and their conquerors, that of suicide was one; but the principles from which it proceeded were explained, so as to appear more agreeable to the new system which they had espoused. It was committed, either to secure from the danger of apostasy, to procure the honour of martyrdom, or to preserve the crown of virginity.\n\nWhen we descend to modern times, we lament to find so many instances of suicide among the most polished nations, who have the best opportunities of knowing the atrocity of that unnatural crime. The English have long been reproached by foreigners for the frequent commission of it; and the \"gloomy month of November\" has been stigmatized as the season when it is most common. But this disgraceful imputation, we think, may be justly attributed, not to the greater frequency of the crime in England than in other places, but to the custom of publishing in the newspapers every instance of suicide which is known. Mr Moore, who lately published a full inquiry into this subject, was at great pains to obtain accurate information concerning the perpetration of this crime in different countries. Mercier, who wrote in 1782, says, that the annual number of suicides in Paris was then about 150. He does not tell us how he came by the information; but we have the name authority of the Abbé Fontana for asserting, that more persons put an end to their lives in Paris than in London. The Abbé had this information from the lieutenant-general of the police. Mr Moore was informed by one neva, &c., of the principal magistrates of Geneva, that in that city, which contains about 25,000 inhabitants, the average number of suicides is about eight. The average number of suicides, from what causesoever, for the last 28 years, has been 32 each year for London, Southwark, and Westminster. In Edinburgh, which contains 80,000 inhabitants, we are convinced the average number of suicides does not exceed four. Mr Moore found, from the accounts with which he was favoured by the several coroners of the county of Kent, that for the last 18 years the number has been upwards of 32 each year. Kent is supposed to contain 200,000 inhabitants, and London 800,000. It is easy therefore to see, that in the metropolis many instances of suicide must occur which are never the subject of legal inquiry, and consequently never made known to the world. Whereas in the country towns and villages of Kent it is scarcely possible to conceal such an action as self-murder from the knowledge of the whole neighbourhood. The calculation therefore respecting Kent we may receive as true, while we must increase the average number in London very considerably. Mr Moore computes the average number of suicides in England every year at a thousand; but the principles on which he founds this opinion are so imperfect and vague, that we do not think it can be depended on as coming near the truth.\n\nIt might lead to some interesting conclusions to compare together, not only the number of suicides in different countries, but also the rank and principles, the sex situation and age, of those unhappy persons by whom it has been committed. Mercier says, that at Paris it was the lower ranks who were most commonly guilty of it; that it was mostly committed in garrets or hired lodgings; and that it proceeded from poverty and oppression. A great many, he says, wrote letters to the magistrates before their death. Mr Moore's correspondent from Geneva informed him, that from the year 1777 to 1787 more than 100 suicides were committed in Geneva; that two-thirds of these unfortunate persons were men; that few of the clerical order have been known to commit it; and that it is not so much the end of an immoral, irreligious, dissipated life, as the effect of melancholy and poverty. By the information obtained from the coroners of Kent, it appears, that of the 32, three-fourths have destroyed themselves by hanging; that the proportion of males to females has been about two-thirds of the former; that no one season of the year is more distinguished for this crime than another; and that suicide is upon the increase. Our accounts respecting the city of London are very imperfect; but we think ourselves intitled to conclude, that suicide is more common among the great and wealthy.\nwealthy than among the lower ranks, and that it is usually the effect of gaming and dissipation.\n\nThose who have inquired into the causes of suicide in Britain have enumerated many physical as well as moral causes. They have ascribed it to the variable effects of our climate, to the great use of animal food, to strong spirituous liquors, to tea, and to the sulphurous exhalations of the pit coal used as fuel, which are said to produce a depletion of spirits and nervous affections. Of our climate, we have no cause to complain, nor have we any reason to impute any of our vices to its influence. There are many climates much more unfavourable where suicide is scarcely known. That an excessive quantity of gross animal food, or of strong liquors, or of tea, will powerfully affect the human constitution, we will not deny; but before we consider these as causes, it must first be determined, whether those who are guilty of self-murder be much addicted to them; and if they are, whether there be not other causes much more violent in their nature which have operated on their mind; for we ought not rashly to attribute vicious effects to any of those things which seem to have been created on purpose for the comfort or convenience of man. We are rather surprised to find that coal is mentioned even as a diluent cause of suicide; for it is one of the blessings of our island; and a good coal fire we have always found rather conducive to good spirits than injurious to them.\n\nAmong the moral causes which are supposed to cooperate in producing suicide in Britain, the freedom of our constitution and laws is reckoned one. That rational liberty should have any tendency to encourage crimes of any kind, a Christian philosopher can never allow; for such an opinion is totally disfavourable to enlightened views of nature. Mercier has ascribed the frequency of suicide in Paris to the oppression of the late government. Now it appears somewhat extraordinary, that suicide in one country should be occasioned by liberty, and in another by the want of it. One of these opinions must be false, and it is surely not difficult to distinguish which.\n\nHumanity would in most cases dispose us to conclude, that suicide is the effect of infamy, were there not so many instances of cool deliberate self-murder. That suicide is an unnatural crime, which none but a madman would commit, compassion indeed may suppose; but the murder of a wife, a father, or a child, are also unnatural; yet compassion does not teach us in all cases to ascribe such a crime to madness. Passion may often arise to such a height of outrage as to be scarcely distinguishable from madness in its symptoms and its effects; yet we always make a distinction between that madness which arises from disease and that which is owing to a violent perturbation of mind. If a person be capable of managing his worldly affairs, of making a will, and of disposing of his property, immediately before his death, or after he formed the resolution of dying by his own hands, such a man is not to be considered as insane.\n\nBut though a regard for truth prevents us from ascribing suicide in all cases to insanity, we must ascribe it either to insanity or to vicious passion. These two divisions, we imagine, will comprehend every species of it, whether arising from melancholy, tedium vitae or ennui, disappointment in schemes of ambition or love, pride, gaming, or a desire to avoid the shame of a public execution; passions which are often increased by false views of God, of man, and of a future state, arising from deformity and infidelity. If these be the causes of suicide in modern times, what a disgraceful contrast do they form to those principles which actuated many of the ancient philosophers, the Gentooes, the Japanese, and the worshippers of Odin? When they committed suicide, they committed it from principle, from a belief of its lawfulness, and the hope of being rewarded for what they judged an honourable sacrifice. But in modern times, we are sorry to say, when it is not the effect of madness, it is the effect of vice; and when it is the effect of vice, it proves that the vicious passions are then indulged to the highest degree; for there is no crime which a man can commit that is so strong a symptom of the violence of particular passions. It is from not attending to this circumstance, that it has been found so difficult to refute the arguments in favour of suicide. If the criminality of suicide be confined merely to the violent action, many apologies may be made for it; but if it be considered solely as the effect of vice, as the strongest symptom of ungoverned passion, he who undertakes its defence must undertake the defence of what all men will loudly condemn (A).\n\n---\n\n(A) Several of the heathens entertained a very just sense of the atrocity of suicide. Quintus Curtius introduces Darius with the following speech, when he had lost his empire: \"I wait (says the unfortunate monarch) the issue of my fate: you wonder, perhaps, that I do not terminate my own life; but I choose rather to die by the crime of another than by my own.\n\nWe cannot refuse ourselves the pleasure of presenting to our readers the following beautiful passage upon this subject from Fitzboorne's letters*: I am prevailed (says this elegant writer) this disgust of life is frequently indulged out of a principle of mere vanity. It is esteemed as a mark of uncommon refinement, and as placing a man above the ordinary level of his species, to seem superior to the vulgar feelings of happiness. True good sense, however, most certainly confutes not in despising, but in managing our stock of life to the best advantage, as a cheerful acquiescence in the measures of Providence is one of the strongest symptoms of a well constituted mind. Self-weariness is a circumstance that ever attends folly; and to condemn our being is the greatest, and indeed the peculiar infirmity, of human nature. It is a noble sentiment which Tully puts into the mouth of Cato, in his Treatise upon old Age; Non luet mihi (says that venerable Roman) deplorare vitam, quod multi, et ii docti, sepe fecerunt; neque me uicisse penitet: quoniam tua visi, ut non frustra me natum existimem.\n\n* It is in the power, indeed, of but a very small portion of mankind to act the same glorious part that afforded such high satisfaction to this distinguished patriot; but the number is yet far more inconsiderable of those who cannot, in any station, secure themselves a sufficient fund of complacency to render life justly valuable. Who is it that is placed out of the reach of the highest of all gratifications, those of the generous affections, and that cannot provide\nIt is unnecessary then to enter particularly into the arguments of those causitists who have undertaken the disputable office of advocates for the crime of suicide. Their talents might surely have been employed more usefully to the world, and more honourably to themselves, than in pleading for a crime, which, if it were committed by every man to whom their principles would make it lawful, would totally destroy some of the noblest virtues, fortitude, patience, and resignation; nay, would destroy society itself, and teach us to despise the opinion that this world is a state of preparation for another. \"I came into life without my own consent, and may I not quit it at pleasure?\" (say the advocates for suicide). If, because we came into life without our own consent, we might quit it at pleasure, why may we not spend our life also as we please? Why may we not rob and murder, and commit every kind of crime, if mere inclination is to be the rule of action! Thus upon the principles of suicide the highwayman and murderer may reason, and every man may find a sufficient apology for any crime which he is tempted to commit. Or this absurdity may be otherwise answered: As we came into life without our own consent, we must have come with the consent of some other being; and logic says, that with the consent of that Being only can we lawfully quit it.\n\nIt is sufficient shortly to say, that suicide is contrary to the strongest principle of the human constitution, self-preservation; that it is rebellion against God; that it is cruelty to the feelings and reputation, and often takes away the subsistence of a wife, a child, or a father; that it proves a want of fortitude to brave misfortunes; that it delivers only from imagined to plunge into real evils. We may add, that almost every instance of suicide of which we have heard was rash, imprudent, and premature, interrupted a useful life, or prevented a more honourable death. Had Cato's pride permitted him to yield himself to the generosity of Caesar, his character and his influence might have contributed to retard the slavery of his country, which his death tended to hasten. Had Brutus and Cassius not executed the fatal resolution which they had formed, of dying by their own hands in case of misfortune, the battle of Philippi might have had a very different issue. Had Hannibal surrendered himself to the Romans, instead of swallowing poison, he would have gained more glory in braving their tortures than he won in the battle of Cannae; for to die innocently and heroically is the greatest exertion of human fortitude.\n\nAs suicide was deemed a crime by the most illustrious and virtuous of the Greek and Roman philosophers, it was considered as a crime by the laws, and treated with ignominy. By the law of Thebes suicides were to have no honours paid to their memory. The Athenian law ordained the hand which committed the deed of the Greeks to be cut off, and burned apart from the rest of the body. The body was not buried with the usual solemnities, but was ignominiously thrown into some pit. In the Leges Cea and Massilia (the ancient Marseille), it was considered as a crime against the state; and it was therefore necessary for those who wished to destroy themselves to obtain permission from the magistrates. Plutarch acquaints us, that an unaccountable passion for suicide seized the virgins of Miletus; from indulging which they could not be prevented by the tears and entreaties of parents and friends: but what persuasion and entreaty could not effect was accomplished by very different means. A decree was issued, \"that the body of every young woman who hanged herself should be dragged naked through the streets by the same rope with which she had committed the deed.\" This wife edict put a complete stop to the extraordinary frenzy, and suicide was no longer committed by the virgins of Miletus.\n\nIn the early part of the Roman history there seems to have been seldom occasion for framing any laws against suicide. The only instance recorded occurs in the reign of Tarquinius Priscus. The soldiers who were appointed to make drains and common sewers, thinking themselves disgraced by such servile offices, put themselves to death in great numbers. The king ordered the bodies of all the self-murderers to be exposed on crosses, and this put an effectual stop to the practice. It is doubtful whether there was any standing law against suicide during the existence of the republic; but during the reign of the emperors it was thought proper to lay it under certain regulations, though not absolutely to condemn it as a crime. In Justinian's Digests there is a law, by which it was enacted, \"that if persons accused, or who had been found guilty, of any crime should make away with themselves, their effects should be confiscated.\" But this punishment only took place when confiscation of goods happened to be the penalty appointed by the law for the crime of which the self-murderer was accused or found guilty, and was not inflicted for suicide committed in any other circumstances.\n\nWhen the Christian church had extended its jurisdiction in the Roman empire, it was decreed in the fifth century, that no commemoration should be made in the eucharist for such as destroyed themselves: neither should their\n\nfor his own happiness, by contributing something to the welfare of others? As this disease of the mind generally breaks out with the most violence in those who are supposed to be endowed with a greater delicacy of taste and reason than is the usual allotment of their fellow creatures, one may ask them, whether there is any satiety in the pursuits of useful knowledge? or, if one can ever be weary of benefiting mankind? Will not the fine arts supply a lasting feast to the mind? or, can there be wanting a pleasurable enjoyment, so long as there remains even one advantageous truth to be discovered or confirmed? To complain that life has no joys, while there is a single creature whom we can relieve by our bounty, afflit by our counsels, or enliven by our presence, is to lament the loss of that which we possess, and is just as rational as to die for thirst with the cup in our hands. But the misfortune is, when a man is settled into a habit of receiving all his pleasures from the mere selfish indulgences, he wears out of his mind the relish of every nobler enjoyment, at the same time that his powers of the sensual kind are growing more languid by each repetition. It is no wonder, therefore, he should fill up the measure of his gratifications long before he has completed the circle of his duration; and either wretchedly sit down the remainder of his days in discontent, or rashly throw them up in despair.\"\ntheir bodies be carried out to burial with psalms, nor have the usual service said over them. This ecclesiastical law continued till the reformation, when it was admitted into the statute code of England by the authority of parliament. As an additional punishment, however, confiscation of land and goods seems to have been adopted from the Danes, as we learn from Bracton.\n\nAt present the punishment consists in confiscating all the personal property of a felo de se for the use of the crown, and in excluding his body from interment in consecrated ground. The warrant of the coroner requires that the body should be buried in some public highway, and a stake driven through it to increase the ignominy.\n\nTo inquire into the prevalence and causes of crimes, in order to discover the most judicious methods of preventing them, is the duty of the Patriot and the Christian. Suicide, we find, is a common and an increasing evil; but it is a difficult matter to find an effectual remedy; for what motives can be held out sufficient to influence that man's mind who is deaf to the voice of nature speaking within him, and to the voice of nature's God declaring that he is stationed at a post which it is his duty to maintain? His reputation and property are indeed within the reach of the laws, his body may be treated with ignominy, and his property confiscated; but this punishment will not be a preventive, even if it could be always inflicted; and that it is seldom inflicted, though the laws have decreed it, is well known. The humanity of the present age disposes us to sympathise with the relations of the deceased, instead of demanding that the sentence of the law should be executed. It is a generally received opinion, and a just one, that punishments decreed by human laws should be directed only against such crimes as are injurious to society; but when it is hence inferred, that suicide ought not to be subject to the cognizance of human laws, every rule of logic is violated. There is no man, however mean in station and in talents, whose life may not, on some occasions, be useful to the community at large; and to conclude, that a person who fancies himself useless may therefore lawfully put a period to his life, is as false reasoning as it would be to conclude, that by killing a poor man, who lives on the public, we should perform an action not only innocent but meritorious, as we should thereby free society from one of its burdens.\n\nSUIDAS, a Greek writer, according to some, flourished in the 11th century, under the reign of the emperor Alexius Comnenus; according to others, before the 10th century. He wrote in Greek an Historical and Geographical Dictionary or Lexicon; a work which, though not always strictly accurate, is nevertheless of great importance, as it contains many things taken from the ancients that are nowhere else to be found. The best edition of Suidas is that of Kuitler, in Greek and Latin, with notes, printed in 3 vols. fol., which has been much improved by Toup.\n\nLAVIS SUILLUS. See Swine-Stone, Mineralogy Index.\n\nSUIT, is used in different senses; as, 1. Suit of court, or suit-service, which is an attendance the tenant owes to his lord's court. 2. Suit-covenant, where a person has covenanted to do service in the court of the lord. 3. Suit-custom, which is where one and his ancestors have owed suit time out of mind. 4. It is used for a petition to the king or any person of dignity, where a lord distrains his tenant for suit, and none is due. In this case, the party may have an attachment against him to appear in the king's court.\n\nSuit, in Law, the same with action. The Romans introduced pretty early set forms for actions and suits into their law, after the example of the Greeks; and made it a rule, that each injury should be redressed by its proper remedy only. \"Ad homines, (say the Pandects) compositae sunt quibus inter se homines disceperant, quas actiones ne populus prout velit infligere, certas solemnitatesque effe voluerunt.\" The forms of these actions were originally preserved in the books of the pontifical college as choice and ineffable secrets, till one Cneius Flavius, the secretary of Appius Claudius, stole a copy and published them to the people. The concealment was ridiculous: but the establishment of some standard was undoubtedly necessary to fix the true state of a question of right; lest, in a long and arbitrary process, it might be shifted continually, and be at length no longer discernible. Or, as Cicero expresses it, \"sunt jura, sunt formules, de omnibus rebus constitute, ne quis aut in genere injuriae, aut in ratione actionis, errare posset. Expressit enim jure ex unicuiquedam danno, dolore, in commodis, calamitate, injuria, publice a pretore formule, ad quas privata lis accommodatur?\" And in the same manner Bracton, speaking of the original writs upon which all our actions are founded, declares them to be fixed and immutable, unless by authority of parliament. And all the modern legislators of Europe have found it expedient, from the same reasons, to fall into the same or a similar method. In England, the several suits, or remedial instruments of justice, are, from the subject of them, distinguished into three kinds; actions personal, real, and mixed.\n\nPersonal actions are such whereby a man claims a debt, or personal duty or damages, in lieu thereof; and likewise whereby a man claims a satisfaction in damages for some injury done to his person or property. The former are said to be founded upon contracts, the latter upon torts or wrongs: and they are the same which the civil law calls \"actiones in personam, quae adversus cum intendantur qui ex contractu vel delicto obligatus est aliquid dare vel concedere.\" Of the former nature are all actions upon debt or promises; of the latter are all actions of trespasses, nuisances, assaults, defamatory words, and the like.\n\nReal actions (or, as they are called in the Mirror, feudal actions), which concern real property only, are such whereby the plaintiff, here called the demandant, claims title to have any lands or tenements, rents, commons, or other hereditaments, in fee-simple, fee-tail, or for term of life. By these actions formerly all disputes concerning real estates were decided; but they are now pretty generally laid aside in practice, upon account of the great nicety required in their management, and the inconvenient length of their process; a much more expeditious method of trying titles being since introduced, by other actions personal and mixed.\n\nMixed actions are suits partaking of the mixture of the other two, wherein some real property is demanded, and also personal damages for a wrong sustained. As for instance, an action of waste: which is brought by him who hath the inheritance, in remainder or reversion, against the tenant for life, who hath committed waste therein.\ntherein, to recover not only the land wasted, which would make it merely a real action; but also treble damages, in pursuance of the statute of Gloucester, which is a personal recompense; and so both, being joined together, denominate it a mixed action.\n\nThe orderly parts of a suit are these: 1. The original writ. 2. The process. 3. The pleadings. 4. The issue or demurrer. 5. The trial. 6. The judgement and its incidents. 7. The proceedings in nature of appeals. 8. The execution. See these articles.\n\nSULLY. See BETHUNE.\n\nSULPHATE, in Chemistry, denotes a compound of sulphuric acid with some base.\n\nSULPHUR, a well known inflammable substance. See Chemistry and Mineralogy Index.\n\nSULPHUR-Wort. See PEUCEDANUM, Botany Index.\n\nSULPHURIC acid, the name now adopted for the vitriolic acid. See Chemistry Index.\n\nSULPICIUS, an ancient Roman poetess, who lived under the reign of Domitian, and has been much admired as to be termed the Roman Sappho. We have nothing, however, left of her writings but a satire, or rather the fragment of one, against Domitian, who published a decree for the banishment of philosophers from Rome; which satire is to be found in Scaliger's Appendix Virgiliana. She is mentioned by Martial and Sidonius Apollinaris; and is said to have addressed a poem on conjugal love to her husband Calenus, a Roman knight.\n\nSULPICIUS SEVERUS, an ecclesiastical writer who flourished about the beginning of the 4th century, and was contemporary with Rufinus and St Jerome. He was the disciple of St Martin of Tours, whose life he has written; and the friend of Paulinus bishop of Nola, with whom he held an intimate correspondence. The principal of his works is his Historia Sacra, from the creation of the world to the consulate of Silicho and Aurelian, about the year 400; in which his style is elegant beyond the age he lived in.\n\nSULTAN, or SOLDAN, a title of appellation given to the emperor of the Turks.\n\nVattier will have the word Turkish, and to signify king of kings; adding, that it was first given to the Turkish princes Angrolipex and Malgud, about the year 1055; others will have it originally Persian, alleging, in proof thereof, an ancient medal of Cohor; others derive it from soldanus, quasi solus dominus; others from the Hebrew שֶׁלֶט, shelat or sheleth, \"to rule, reign.\"\n\nIt had its rise under Mahmoud, son of Sebecteghin, the first emperor of the dynasty of the Gaznevides, towards the close of the fourth century of the era of the Hegira: when that prince going to Segedan to reduce Kalaf governor of that province, who affected the sovereignty, Kalaf was no sooner advertised of his coming than he went out to meet him, delivered the keys of his fortresses, and owned him his Sultan, that is, his lord or commander. The title pleased Mahmoud so well, that he assumed it ever afterwards; and from him it passed to his descendants, and to other Mahometan princes. It is chiefly confined to the Turkish and Persian monarchs.\n\nSULZER, M. a celebrated philosopher, was born at Winterthur, in the canton of Zurich, October 16, 1720. He was the youngest of 25 children. His early education did not promise much, though it was by no means neglected. He had little inclination for what is called in the schools the study of humanity, and made but a small progress in the learned languages, which were to prepare him for the study of theology, for which profession his parents designed him. At the age of 16, when he went to the academical school of Zurich, he had not the smallest notion of the sciences, or of elegant literature, and consequently no taste for study. The first incident that developed a hidden germ of philosophical genius, was his meeting with Wolf's Metaphysics; this was the birth of his taste for science; but he wanted a guide. The clergyman with whom he lodged was an ignorant man; and the academical prelections were, as yet, above the reach of his comprehension. On the other hand, a sedentary life was not the thing he liked, nor to which he had been accustomed; and, moreover, a sociable turn of mind led him often into company, where he lost much time in frivolous amusements, yet without corrupting his morals. Who, that observed him at this period, says Mr Ferney in his Eulogium, would have thought that Sulzer would one day be numbered among the most knowing and wise men of his time? The learned Gessner was the instrument of Providence that rendered Sulzer's inclination to study triumphant over his passion for amusement and company. Animated by the counsels and example of this worthy and learned man, he applied himself to philosophy and mathematics with great ardour, and resumed the pursuit of Grecian literature and the Oriental languages. The contemplation of nature became his noble and favourite passion. An ecclesiastical settlement in a rural scene, that exhibited happy objects and occasions for this delightful study, began to render his days happy and useful; and he published, in 1741, Moral Contemplations of the Works of Nature; and the year following an Account of a Journey he had made through the Alps; which showed, at the same time, his knowledge of natural history and the taste and sensibility with which he surveyed the beauties of nature, and the grandeur and goodness of its Author. He afterwards became private tutor to a young gentleman at Magdeburg. This procured him the acquaintance of Messrs Maupertuis, Euler, and Sack, which opened to his merit the path of preferment, and advanced him successively to the place of mathematical professor in the King's College at Berlin, in 1747, and to that of member of the Royal Academy in 1750.\n\nIn this last quality he distinguished himself in a very eminent manner, enriched the cause of speculative philosophy with a great number of excellent memoirs, and was justly considered as one of the first-rate metaphysicians in Germany. But his genius was not confined to this branch of science. His Universal Theory of the Fine Arts is a valuable production. A profound knowledge of the arts and sciences, and a perfect acquaintance with true taste, are eminently displayed in this work, and will secure to its author a permanent and distinguished rank in the republic of letters. The first volume of this excellent work was published in 1771, and the second in 1774. We shall not here give a catalogue of the writings of M. Sulzer; but we cannot help mentioning his Remarks on the Philosophical Essays of the late Mr Hume as a work of real merit, which does justice to the acuteness, while it often detects the sophistry, of the British Bayle. The moral character of M. Sulzer was amiable and virtuous; sociability and benevolence\ncence were its characteristic lines; and his virtues were animated by that sacred philosophy that forms the Christian, ennobles man, and is the only source of that heart-felt fervency and steadfast fortitude which support humanity, when every other object of confidence fails. His dying moments were calm, humble, and sublime; and when he expired, the placid and composed air of his countenance made his mourning friends doubt, for some time, whether it was death or sleep that had suspended his conversation. He had no enemy; and his friends were numerous, affectionate, and worthy of the tender returns he made them.\n\nThe king of Prussia distinguished him by repeated marks of munificence and favour. But his royal protector had never seen him before the end of the year 1777, though he had been member of the academy from the year 1750. The audience, indeed, though late vouchsafed, was honourable to M. Sulzer, with whom the monarch conversed for a long time with great condescension.\n\nSUM signifies the quantity that arises from the addition of two or more magnitudes, numbers, or quantities together.\n\nSUMACH. See Rhus, Botany Index.\n\nSUMATRA, an island of Asia, the most western of the Sunda islands, and constituting on that side the boundary of the Eastern Archipelago. Its general direction is nearly north-west and south-east. The equator divides it into almost equal parts, the one extremity being in 5° 33' N. and the other in 5° 56' S. Lat. Acheen Head, at the north extremity of the island, is in longitude 95° 34' east. It lies exposed on the south-west side to the Indian ocean; the north point stretches into the bay of Bengal; to the north east it is divided from the peninsula of Malacca by the straits of that name; to the east by the straits of Banca, from the island of that name; to the south-east by the commencement of what are called the Chinese seas; and on the south by the straits of Sunda, which separate it from the island of Java. It is about 920 miles in length, but from 100 to 150 only in breadth. No account had been given of this island by any Englishman till the year 1778, when Mr Charles Miller (son of the late botanical gardener) published an account of the manners of a particular district, in the 63rd volume of the Philosophical Transactions. These were the Battas, a people who live in the interior parts, called the Caffia Country. They differ from all the other inhabitants in language, manners, and customs. They eat the prisoners whom they take in war, and hang up their skulls as trophies in their houses. He observes, however, that human flesh is eaten by them in terror, and not as common food, though they prefer it to all others, and speak with peculiar raptures of the soles of the feet and palms of the hands. They expressed much surprise that the white people did not kill, much less eat, their prisoners. From this country the greatest part of the caffia that is sent to Europe is procured. It abounds also with the camphire trees, which constitute the common timber in use; and in these trees the camphire is found native, in a concrete form. It is remarkable that, in this state it is sold to the Chinese at the price of 250l. or 300l. per cent. but these dexterous artists contrive to furnish the Europeans with it at about a quarter of that price. In 1783, Mr Marfden, who had been secretary to the president and council of Fort Marlborough, published a History of Sumatra, with very copious particulars of the island. He represented it as surpassed by few in the beautiful indulgences of nature. A chain of high mountains runs through its whole extent; the ranges in many parts being double and treble; their altitude, though great, is not sufficient to occasion their being covered with snow during any part of the year. Between these ridges are extensive plains, considerably elevated above the surface of the maritime lands. In these the air is cool; and from this advantage they are esteemed the most eligible portion of the country, are the best inhabited, and the most cleared from woods, which elsewhere, in general, throughout Sumatra, cover both hills and valleys with an eternal shade. Here too are found many large and beautiful lakes, that facilitate much the communication between the different parts. The heat of the air is far from being so intense as might be expected from a country occupying the middle of the torrid zone; and it is more temperate than many regions within the tropics; the thermometer at the most sultry hour, about two in the afternoon, generally fluctuating between 82 and 85 degrees. Mr Marfden divides the inhabitants into Malays, Acheenes, Battas, Lampoons, and Rejangs; and he takes the latter as his standard of description, with respect to the persons, manners, and customs, of the inhabitants. They are rather below the middle stature; their bulk in proportion; their limbs for the most part slight, but well shaped, and particularly small at the wrists and ankles; and, upon the whole, they are gracefully formed. Their hair is strong, and of a shining black. The men are beardless, great pains being taken to render them so when boys, by rubbing their chins with a kind of quicklime. Their complexion is properly yellow, wanting the red tinge that constitutes a copper or tawny colour. They are in general lighter than the Mellees, or half-breed, of the rest of India; those of the superior class, who are not exposed to the rays of the sun, and particularly their women of rank, approaching to a degree of fairness. If beauty consisted in this one quality, some of them would surpass our brunettes in Europe. The major part of the females are ugly, many of them even to disgust; yet among them are some whose appearance is strikingly beautiful, whatever composition of person, features, and complexion, that sentiment may be the result of. Some of the inhabitants of the hilly parts are observed to have the furred neck or goitre; but they attempt no remedy for it, as these wens are confluent with the highest health. The rites of marriage among the Sumatrans consist simply in joining the hands of the parties, and pronouncing them man and wife without much ceremony, excepting the entertainment which is given upon the occasion by the father of the girl. The customs of the Sumatrans permit their having as many wives as they can purchase, or afford to maintain; but it is extremely rare that an instance occurs of their having more than one, and that only among a few of the chiefs. This continence they owe, in some measure, to their poverty. The dictates of frugality are more powerful with them than the irregular calls of appetite, and make them decline an indulgence from which their law does not restrain them. Mothers carry their children, not on the arm as our nurses do, but straddling on the hip, and ideally supported by a cloth which ties in a knot on the opposite shoulder. The children are nursed but little; are not confined\nconfined by any swathing or bandages; and being suffered to roll about the floor, soon learn to walk and shift for themselves. When cradles are used, they swing suspended from the ceilings of the rooms.\n\nThe Sumatrans are fond of cock-fighting, that a father on his deathbed has been known to desire his son to take the first opportunity of matching a cock for a sum equal to his whole property, under a blind conviction of its being invulnerable. When a cock is killed or runs, the other must have sufficient spirit and vigour left to peck at him three times on his being held up to him for that purpose, or it becomes a drawn battle; and sometimes an experienced cocker will place the head of his vanquished bird in such an uncouth situation as to terrify the other, and render him unable to give this proof of victory.\n\nThe wild beasts of Sumatra are tigers, elephants, rhinoceroses, bears, and monkeys. The tigers prove to the inhabitants both in their journeys and even their domestic occupations most destructive enemies. The number of people annually slain by these rapacious tyrants of the woods is almost incredible. Whole villages have been depopulated by them; yet from a superstitious prejudice, it is with difficulty they are prevailed upon, by a large reward which the India Company offers, to use methods of destroying them, till they have sustained some particular injury in their own family or kindred. The size and strength of the species which prevails on this island is prodigious. They are said to break with a stroke of their fore paw the leg of a horse or a buffalo; and the largest prey they kill is without difficulty dragged by them into the woods. This they usually perform on the second night, being supposed on the first to gratify themselves with sucking the blood only. Time is by this delay afforded to prepare for their destruction, either by shooting them, or placing a vessel of water strongly impregnated with arsenic near the carcass, which is fastened to a tree to prevent its being carried off. The tiger having satiated himself with the flesh, is prompted to allay his thirst with the tempting liquor at hand, and perishes in the indulgence. Their chief subsistence is most probably the unfortunate monkeys with which the woods abound. They are described as alluring them to their fate by a fascinating power, similar to what has been supposed of the snake; and, says Mr. Marden, \"I am not incredulous enough to treat the idea with contempt, having myself observed, that when an alligator or a crocodile, in a river, comes under an overhanging branch of a tree, the monkeys, in a state of alarm and distraction, crowd to the extremity, and, chattering and trembling, approach nearer and nearer to the amphibious monster that waits to devour them as they drop, which their fright and number render almost unavoidable.\" These alligators likewise occasion the loss of many inhabitants, frequently destroying the people as they bathe in the river, according to their regular custom, and which the perpetual evidence of the risk attending it cannot deter them from. A superstitious idea of their sanctity also preserves them from molestation, although, with a hook of sufficient strength, they may be taken without much difficulty. The other animals of Sumatra are buffaloes, a small kind of horses, goats, hogs, deer, bullocks, and hog-deer. This last is an animal somewhat larger than a rabbit, the head resembling that of a hog, and its shanks and feet like those of the deer. The bezoar-flone found on this animal has been valued at ten times its weight in gold; it is of a dark brown colour, smooth on the outside; and the coat being taken off, it appears still darker, with strings running underneath the coat; it will swim on the top of the water. If it be infused in any liquid, it makes it extremely bitter: the virtues usually attributed to this stone are cleansing the stomach, creating an appetite, and sweetening the blood.\n\nOf birds they have a greater variety than of beasts. The coo-ow, or Sumatran pheasant, is a bird of uncommon beauty. They have storks of prodigious size, parrots, dung-hill fowls, ducks, the largest cocks in the world, wood-pigeons, doves, and a great variety of small birds, different from ours, and distinguished by the beauty of their colours. Of the reptiles, they have lizards, flying-lizards, and chameleons. The island swarms with insects, and their varieties are no less extraordinary than their numbers. Rice is the only grain that grows in the country; they have sugar-canes, beans, pease, radishes, yams, potatoes, pumpkins, and several kinds of pot-herbs unknown to Europe; and here are to be found most of the fruits to be met with in other parts of the East Indies, in the greatest perfection. Indigo, Brazil-wood, two species of the bread-fruit tree, pepper, benjamin, coffee, and cotton, are likewise the produce of this island, as well as caffia and camphire mentioned above. Here also is the cabbage-tree and silk cotton tree; and the forests contain a great variety of valuable species of wood, as ebony, pine, sandal, eagle or aloes, teak, manchineel, and iron-wood, and also the banyan tree. Gold, tin, iron, copper, and lead, are found in the country; and the former is supposed to be as plentiful here as in Peru or Mexico. The finest gold and gold-dust are found in the country of Limong, immediately contiguous to the presidency of Fort Marlborough, to which the merchants repair annually for the purchase of opium, and such other articles as they may be in want of, and give for them gold of so pure a nature as to contain little or no alloy. The native indolence of the Malay Asiatic disposition prevents them from collecting more than is necessary, sufficient to supply the few and simple wants of a race of men as yet unenlightened by civilization and science, and ignorant of the full extent of the advantages of the country inhabited by them. The roads leading to this golden country are almost impassive; affording only a scanty path to a single traveller, where whole nights must be passed in the open air, exposed to the malignant influence of a hostile climate, in a country infested by the most ferocious wild beasts. These are circumstances that have hitherto checked curiosity; but perseverance and studied precaution will surmount the obstructions they furnish, and such discoveries might be made as would amply compensate for the difficulties leading to them. The gold merchants who come from the neighbouring and less rich countries, give us such accounts of the facility of procuring gold as border nearly on the marvellous, and would be altogether incredible, if great quantities of that metal produced by them did not in some degree evince the certainty of their accounts.\n\nThis great abundance of gold in Sumatra induces Mr. Marden to suppose that island to be the Ophir of Solomon; a conjecture which, in his opinion, derives no small force from the word Ophir's being really a Malay substantive, of a compound sense, signifying a mountain containing\nSumatra containing gold. The natives, he confesses, have no oral tradition on the subject; and we have elsewhere made it probable, that Ophir was situated in a different quarter of the world (see Ophir). Besides the metals and different species of wood which we have mentioned, Sumatra produces sulphur, arsenic, saltpetre, and beeswax, with edible birds-nests, which are there commodities of great importance (see Birds-Nests).\n\nThe English and Dutch have factories on this island; the principal one of the former being Fort Marlborough, on the south-west coast. The original natives of Sumatra are Pagans; but it is to be observed, that when the Sumatrans, or any of the natives of the eastern islands, learn to read the Arabic character, and submit to circumcision, they are said to become Malays; the term Malay being understood to mean Mussulman. See Aceh.\n\nSUMMARY, in matters of literature. See ABRIDGEMENT.\n\nSUMMER, the name of one of the seasons of the year, being one of the quarters when the year is divided into four quarters, or one half when the year is divided only into two, summer and winter. In the former case, summer is the quarter during which, in northern climates, the sun is passing through the three signs Cancer, Leo, Virgo, or from the time of the greatest declination, till the sun come to the equinoctial again, or have no declination; which is from about the 21st of June till about the 22nd of September. In the latter case, summer contains the six warmer months, while the sun is on one side of the equinoctial; and winter the other six months, when the sun is on the other side of it. It is said that a frosty winter produces a dry summer, and a mild winter a wet summer.\n\nSUMMER-Islands. See BERMUDAS.\n\nSUMMER Red-Bird.

From this pond a pipe is laid, through which, when it is full sea, the water runs into a well adjoining to the saltern; and from this well it is pumped into troughs, through which it is carried to the cisterns, in order to be ready to supply the pans. See SALT.\n\nSUMP, in Mining, denotes a pit sunk down in the bottom of the mine, to cut or prove the lode still deeper than before; and in order to slope and dig it away if necessary, and also to drive on the lode in depth. The sump principally serves as a basin or reservoir, to collect the water of a mine together, that it may be cleaned out by an engine or machine.\n\nSUMPTER-HORSE, is a horse that carries provisions and necessaries for a journey.\n\nSUMPTUARY LAWS (Leges Sumptuariae), are laws made to restrain excess in apparel, costly furniture, eating, &c.\n\nMost ages and nations have had their sumptuary laws; and some retain them still, as the Venetians, &c. But it is observed, that no laws are worse executed than sumptuary laws. Political writers have been much divided in opinion with respect to the utility of these laws to a state. Montefouillieu observes, that luxury is necessary in monarchies, as in France, but ruinous to democracies, as in Holland. With regard to England, whose government is compounded of both species, it may still be a dubious question, says Judge Blackstone, how far private luxury is a public evil; and as such cognizable by public laws.\n\nThe sumptuary laws of the ancient Locrian legislator Zaleucus are famous: by these it was ordained, that no woman should go attended with more than one maid in the street except she were drunk: that she should not go out of the city in the night, unless she went to commit fornication: that she should not wear any gold or embroidered apparel, unless she professed to be a common strumpet; and that men should not wear rings or tassels except when they went a whoring, &c.\n\nAmong the Romans, the sumptuary laws were very numerous: By the Lex Orchia, the number of guests at feasts was limited, though without any limitation of the charges: by the Fannian law, made 22 years afterwards, it was enacted, that more than 10 asses should not be spent at any ordinary feast: for the solemn feasts, as the Saturnalia, &c. an hundred asses were allowed; ten of which, Gellius informs us, was the price of a sheep, and a hundred of an ox. By the Didian law, which was preferred 18 years after, it was decreed, that the former sumptuary laws should be in force, not only in Rome, but throughout all Italy; and that for every transgression, not only the master of the feast, but all the guests too, should be liable to the penalty.\n\nThe English have had their share of sumptuary laws, chiefly made in the reigns of Edward III. Edward IV. and Henry VIII. against those with long points, short doublets, and long coats; though all repealed by statute 1 Jac. I. c. 25. As to excess in diet, there remains still one law unrepealed. Under King Henry IV. Camden tells us, pride had got so much into the foot, that it was proclaimed, that no man should wear shoes above six inches broad at the toes. And their other garments were so short, that it was enacted, 25 Edward IV. that no person, under the condition of a lord, should from that time, wear any mantle or gown, unless of such length, that, standing upright, it might cover the lower part of the trunk of his body.\n\nSUN, Sol, O, in Astronomy, the great luminary which enlightens the world, and by its presence constitutes day.

The particular names of the islands are Borneo, Sumatra, Java, Bally, Banca, &c.\n\nSUNDAY, or the Lord's day, a solemn festival observed by Christians on the first day of every week, in memory of our Saviour's resurrection. See Sabbath.\n\nIn the breviary and other offices we meet with Sundays of the first and second class. Those of the first class are, Palm, Easter, Advent, and Whitunday; those of Quadragesima and Quadragesima. Those of the second class are the common Sundays. Anciently each Sunday in the year had its particular name, which was taken from the introit of the day; which custom has only been continued to some few in Lent; as Reminiscere, Oculti, Lectare, Judica.\n\nSome are of opinion that the Lord's day, mentioned in the Apocalypse, is our Sunday; which they believe was so early instituted by the apostles. Be this as it will, it is certain a regard was had to this day even in the earliest ages of the church; as appears from the first apology of Justin Martyr, where he describes the exercise of the day not much unlike to ours.\n\nBut it was Constantine the Great who first made a law for the proper observation of Sunday; and who, according to Eusebius, appointed it should be regularly celebrated throughout the Roman empire. Before him, and even in his time, they observed the Jewish Sabbath as well as Sunday; both to satisfy the law of Moses and to imitate the apostles, who used to meet together on the first day.\n\nBy Constantine's laws, made in 321, it was decreed, that for the future the Sunday should be kept a day of rest in all cities and towns; but he allowed the country people to follow their work. In 538, the council of Orleans prohibited country labour; but because there were still many Jews in Gaul, and the people fell into many superstitious uses in the celebration of the new Sabbath, like those of the Jews among that of the old, the council declares, that to hold it unlawful to travel with horses, cattle, and carriages, to prepare food, or to do any thing necessary to the cleanliness and decency of houses or persons, favours more of Judaism than of Christianity. See Sabbath-Breaking.\n\nSunday-Schools, See Sunday-Schools.\n\nSUOVTETURILLIA, an ancient Roman sacrifice, so called because it consisted of a pig (Jus), a sheep or rather ram (ovis), and a bull (taurus). They were all males, to denote the masculine courage of the Roman people. It was likewise called solitaurillia, because the animals offered up were always solida, whole or uncut.\n\nSUPERCARGO, a person employed by merchants to go a voyage, and oversee their cargo or lading, and dispose of it to the best advantage.\n\nSUPERCILIUM, in Anatomy, the eye-brow. See Anatomy, No. 142.\n\nSUPEREROGATION, in Theology, what a man does beyond his duty, or more than he is commanded to do. The Romanists stand up strenuously for works of supererogation, and maintain that the observance of evangelical councils is such. By means hereof, a stock of merit is laid up, which the church has the disposal of, and which she distributes in indulgences to such as need.\n\nThis absurd doctrine was first invented towards the close of the 12th century, and modified and embellished by St Thomas in the 13th; according to which, it was pretended that there actually existed an immense treasure of merit, composed of the pious deeds and virtuous actions which the saints had performed beyond what was necessary for their own salvation, and which were therefore applicable to the benefit of others; that the guardian and dispenser of this precious treasure was the Roman pontiff; and that of consequence he was empowered to assign to such as he thought proper a portion of this inexhaustible source of merit, suitable to their respective guilt, and sufficient to deliver them from the punishment due to their crimes.\n\nThe reformed churches do not allow of any work of supererogation; but hold with the apostles, that when we have done our best, we are but unprofitable servants.\n\nSUPERFETATION, in Physiology, a second or after-conception, happening when the mother, already pregnant, conceives of a latter coition; so that the bears at once two foetuses of unequal age and bulk, and is delivered of them at different times. We meet with instances of superfetations in Hippocrates, Aristotle, Du Laurens, &c.; but they are said to be much more frequent in hares and swine.\n\nSUPERFICIES, or Surface, in Geometry, the outside or exterior face of any body. This is considered as having the two dimensions of length and breadth only, but no thickness; and therefore it makes no part of the substance or solid content or matter of the body.\n\nThe terms, or bounds, or extremities, of a superficies, are lines; and superficies may be considered as generated by the motions of lines. Superficies are either rectilinear, curvilinear, plane, concave, or convex. A rectilinear superficies is that which is bounded by right lines. Curvilinear superficies is bounded by curve lines. Plane superficies is that which has no inequality in it, nor risings, nor sinkings, but lies evenly and straight throughout, so that a right line may wholly coincide with it in all parts and directions. Convex superficies is that which is curved and rises outwards. Concave superficies is curved and sinks inward. See Geometry.\n\nSUPERFINE, in the manufactories, a term used to express the superior fineness of a fluff; thus a cloth, a cambric, &c., are said to be superfine when made of the finest wool, &c., or when they are the finest that can be made.\n\nSUPERFLUOUS INTERVAL, in Music, is one that exceeds a true diatonic interval by a semitone minor. See Interval.\n\nSUPERINTENDANT, denotes an ecclesiastical superior in several reformed churches where episcopacy is not admitted; particularly among the Lutherans in Germany, and the Calvinists in some other places.\n\nThe superintendent is similar to a bishop; only his power is somewhat more restrained than that of our diocesan bishops. He is the chief pastor, and has the direction of all the inferior pastors within his district or diocese. In Germany they had formerly superintendents general, who were superior to the ordinary superintendents. These, in reality, were archbishops; but the dignity is sunk into disuse; and at present none but the superintendent of Würtemberg assumes the quality of superintendent general.\n\nSUPERIOR, a person raised above another in rank, office, or talents.\nSUPERIOR, in Scots Law. See LAW, No clxiv. 3. clxv. 2. and clxvi.\n\nSUPERLATIVE, in Grammar, one of the three degrees of comparison, being that inflection of adjective nouns that serves to augment and heighten their signification, and shows the quality of the thing denoted to be in the highest degree.

In several of the offices are supernumerary clerks, to be ready on extraordinary occasions.\n\nSUPERPARTICULAR PROPORTION, or Ratio, is that in which the greater term exceeds the less by unit or 1. As the ratio of 1 to 2, or 2 to 3, or 3 to 4, &c.\n\nSUPERPARTIENT PROPORTION, or Ratio, is when the greater term contains the lesser term once, and leaves some number greater than 1 remaining.

From its resemblance in sound to the Latin word superflus, \"a survivor,\" it is evidently derived from it, and different attempts have been made to trace their connection in signification. Balbus, in the dialogue De Natura Deorum of Cicero, says, that they who prayed and sacrificed whole days that their children might survive them, were called superstitious. Laetantius censures this etymology, and says they were not called superstitious who wished that their children might survive them (for this we all wish), but because they who survived their parents worshipped their images. Others again say, that superstition is derived from superflus, because it consisted in conferring the dead as if they were alive. But these etymologies are solely conjectural; and we consider conjectures as absurd in philology as we do in science; they may mislead, but are seldom of any benefit. The usual meaning affixed to the word superstition, both in the Latin and English languages, is so different from superflus, that its change of meaning must be owing to some accident which it is in vain to inquire after. If we had not known that the word paganus \"a pagan\" was derived from pagus \"a village,\" because the heathens in a certain period of the Christian history lived in villages, the whims and fancies of etymologists would not have thrown much light on the subject.\n\nWithout labouring, from the aid of etymology, to define superstition, which is a word of a very extensive signification, we will consider what objects it is applied; and then, by observing what is common to them all, we shall be enabled to fix with some degree of precision the meaning the term. We apply it to the idolatry of the heathens; we apply it also to the Jews, who made the will of God of no effect by their traditions, and substituted ceremonies in place of the religion of their fathers. We say also that Christians are guilty of superstition; the Roman Catholics, who believe in transubstantiation and in the efficacy of prayers to saints; and those Protestants who esteem baptism and the Lord's supper, and the punctual performance of other ceremonies, without regard to morality, as sufficient to ensure salvation. Those persons are also reckoned superstitious who believe, without any evidence, that prophecies are still uttered by the divine inspiration, and that miracles are still performed. The word is also extended to those who believe in witchcraft, magic, and apparitions, or that the divine will is declared by omens or augury; that the fortune of individuals can be affected by things indifferent, by things deemed lucky or unlucky, or that diseases can be cured by words, charms, and incantations.\n\nThrough all the particulars which we have enumerated, there runs one general idea, the belief of what is false and contrary to reason. From this, however, we must not suppose that whatever is false and contrary to reason may be denominated superstition. We think that it is false and irrational to suppose that there ever lived on earth a race of men who walked on one leg, and had their eyes in their breast; or that there were giants 90 feet high: yet we do not call the philosopher who believes these chimeras superstitious, but credulous. Superstition has always a reference to God, to religion, or to beings superior to man. We do not however distinguish all false and irrational opinions in religion by the name of superstition. We do not, for instance, apply this name to the opinions which some of the ancients entertained, that God is the soul of the world, and that men are only portions of him separated for a time, or that the soul after death lives successively in different bodies. If we examine the subject with more attention, we shall discover that the foundation of superstition is ignorance of the moral attributes of God; for we never say a man is superstitious for entertaining erroneous opinions of the natural attributes of God. Some of the Socinians have denied the preexistence of God; and a French philosopher has not only rejected the belief that He is a spirit, but has presumed to say that He is composed of a species of crystals. The first of these opinions discovers very imperfect ideas of God, and the second is the height of impiety and absurdity; yet the Socinians have not been accused of superstition, nor can this French philosopher be suspected of it. We do not call every false opinion concerning the unity or moral attributes of God by the name of superstition, as, for instance, the opinion which some sceptics have supported, that God is not good; for, as was mentioned before, superstition always involves the idea of credulity. It does not consist in falsely denying that God possesses any particular moral attributes, but in believing more than what is true concerning them; in forming mean, unworthy ideas of them; in supposing that he is guided by blind passion like mankind, and enjoins upon his creatures commandments which are irrational and absurd.\n\nAs superstition arises from ignorance and credulity in the understanding, so it has also a seat in the passions. Fear has been commonly considered as the passion of the human mind from which it chiefly derives its origin;\nand there is no doubt that more superstition has arisen from fear united with ignorance and credulity than from any other passion. Yet it would certainly be improper to exclude all other passions. We cannot account for the superstition of the Egyptians, without supposing that much of it arose from gratitude. They worshipped the Nile, because it distributed fertility and abundance over the land of Egypt; and they worshipped some animals, merely because they prevented the increase of other animals which were noxious. Thus they adored the ibis, because it destroyed the eggs of the crocodile.\n\nHaving thus endeavoured to analyze the ideas comprehended under the word superstition, we may sum them up in a few words. It respects God and beings superior to man, and extends to our religious opinions, worship, and practices; and may be defined absurd opinions and actions arising from mean and defective ideas of the moral attributes of God. Let us apply this definition to the different species of superstition already mentioned.\n\nBut before entering upon this application, it may be proper to observe, that superstition involves the idea of a blamable inattention to reason, or a credulity arising from an indolence of understanding. We generally make a distinction between the imperfect opinions which a savage, from the necessary effects of his situation, forms of the attributes of God, and those which civilized nations entertain. We say the savage is ignorant, and we ascribe his ignorance to his situation; but we call the Roman Catholic superstitious, and we blame him for not having those just ideas of God which he might have obtained by opening his Bible, or by the exercise of his understanding in the favourable situation in which he is placed. Superstition then does not originate so much from the natural weakness of the human understanding, as from a misapplication or a neglect of it (A).\n\nWe cannot therefore with any propriety apply the name superstition to polytheism in general; for what all the ancient philosophers, after much study and reflection, concluded to be true, could never proceed from credulity and inattention, but from their situation. We speak very properly, however, when we call idolatry by the name of superstition; because there is no man so devoid of understanding as not to be capable of discovering, that a piece of metal, or wood, or stone, can neither hear nor answer petitions. Superstition was a name which the ancient philosophers gave to those who entertained mean opinions of the gods, or did foolish things to obtain their favour. According to Theophrastus, the superstitious man is one who, having walked his hands, and sprinkled himself all round, leaves the temple with a laurel leaf in his mouth, with which he walks about the whole day. Or, if a weasel should cross the road, he will not advance a step till he has thrown three stones over the road. If he find a serpent in his house, he rears a place of devotion on the spot. He purifies his house often, will not sit upon a grave, or touch a dead person. He is anxious about the interpretation of his dreams, will not offer a sacrifice unless his wife go along with him, or, if she is engaged, he takes the nurse and the little children. He purifies himself with onions; and when he sees a mad or an epileptic person, he spits in their bosom. Such was the character of superstition in the days of Theophrastus. All these whimsical ceremonies were done to prevent mischief, and to avert the wrath of the gods; and therefore perfectly correspond with the definition given above.\n\nIt is only necessary to consider a little the superstitious opinions and practices among Jews and Christians, to be sensible that they have all arisen from mean and absurd ideas of the moral attributes of God; for they have generally entertained noble opinions of his natural attributes. The Jews considered God as a partial Being, who had a predilection for their nation in preference to all others, and preferred external homage and ceremony to moral purity. If the Roman Catholics think confitently, they must esteem God as a Being who can be prevailed upon by the importunity of one dead man to assist another, or as a Being whose patience would be fatigued with hearing prayers constantly. Hence their practice of praying to saints. They in effect believe, however they may deceive themselves, that God is unjust, or they could not believe transubstantiation; for it supposes that God can give commands directly contrary to those principles of belief with which he has endued the human mind. They consider a strict adherence to a variety of ceremonies, to forms, to pomp, and show, as essential to the worship of God; this is treating God as a vainglorious Being. They thought it their duty to extirpate heretics: this was supposing God a cruel and revengeful Being. Even among Protestants, we are sorry to say, a great deal of superstition remains: we have not yet learned to consider God as a spirit, who is to be worshipped in spirit and in truth, as a pure moral benevolent Being; and hence arise all the superstitious practices which prevail among us.\n\nBesides those superstitious opinions and practices which entirely respect our duty to God, there are others which may be termed vulgar superstitions. These also arise from imperfect and mean ideas of the moral attributes of God. To believe vulgar prophecies, which are always the effusions of madness or knavery, is to suppose that God, who has drawn a veil over futurity, and only delivers prophecies to accomplish some great moral purpose, sometimes gives them for no purpose at all, or to gratify idle curiosity, or to disclose such a knowledge of what is to happen as is inconsistent with the free agency of man and the moral administration of the world. Nor is it less superstitious to believe in vulgar miracles. To believe in them, is to believe that God suspends the laws of nature for the most trivial purposes, or to countenance fraud and worldly ambition: it is to receive the most extraordinary facts upon the most unsatisfactory evidence. The belief of witchcraft, of apparitions, and the second sight, may be resolved into the same principle, To suppose that God would communicate the power of doing mischief, and of controlling his laws, to any being merely for gratifying their own passions, is unworthy of God. The belief of apparitions is equally inconsistent with the goodness of God (see SPECTRE). The fame\n\n(A) We do not pretend to say that this is the sense in which superstition is always used, because it is often used improperly.\nSupposition.\n\nfame objection rises against the second sight as against the belief of vulgar prophecies, and may also be extended to omens, to astrology, to things lucky and unlucky, to fortune-telling, &c. As to the different devices and charms for preventing and curing disorders, they resemble in every respect false miracles.\n\nA judicious history of superstition would be a curious and entertaining work, and would exhibit the human character in a remarkable point of view. Superstition is most prevalent among men of weak and uncultivated minds; it is more frequent in the female sex than among men; and abounds more in the rude than in the refined classes of society. The general features of it have been the same in all ages; but it assumes certain peculiarities according to the diversity of character of different nations. It gained admission into the science of medicine at an early period. He who was endowed with superior genius and knowledge was reckoned a magician. Dr Bartolo was seized by the Inquisition at Rome in the last century, because he unexpectedly cured a nobleman of the gout. Diseases were imputed to fascination, and hundreds of poor wretches were dragged to the stake for being accessory to them. Mercatus, physician to Philip II. of Spain, a writer of uncommon accuracy and information, appears strongly inclined to deny the existence of fascinatory diseases; but he is constrained to acknowledge them for two reasons; firstly, because the Inquisition had decided in favour of their reality; and, secondly, because he had seen a very beautiful woman break a fleck-mirror to pieces, and blast some trees by a single glance of her eyes.\n\nAs the opinions concerning the cause of diseases were superstitious, those concerning the method of curing them were not less so. In the Odyssey we read of a cure performed by a song. Eleocharus relates, that he saw a certain Jew, named Eleazar, draw the devil out of an old woman's nostrils by the application of Solomon's seal to her nose in presence of the emperor Vespasian. Many different kinds of applications were used for expelling the devil. Flagellation sometimes succeeded admirably; purgatives and antipathodics were other modes of discharging him. Dr Mynight cured several bewitched persons with a plaster of asafoetida. How the asafoetida was so efficacious, was much disputed. Some thought the devil might consider so vile an application as an insult, and run off in a puff; but others very sagely observed, that as devils are supposed to have eyes and ears, it is probable they may have noses too.\n\nNor was it only in medicine these superstitious opinions were entertained; they prevailed also in natural philosophy. The pernicious effects in mines, which we now know are occasioned by noxious air, were confidently imputed to the demons of the mine. Even Van Helmont, Bodinus, Strozzi, and Luther, attributed thunder and meteors to the devil. Chemists were employed for centuries in search of the philosopher's stone, with which they were to do miracles. It was a common question among philosophers in the 17th century, whether the imagination could move external objects? A question generally decided in the affirmative.\n\nThough superstition be generally the mark of a weak mind, such is the infirmity of human nature, that we find many instances of it among men of the most sublime genius and most enlightened minds. Socrates believed that he was guided by a demon. Lord Bacon believed in witchcraft; and relates that he was cured of warts by rubbing them with a piece of lard with the skin on, and then nailing it with the fat towards the sun on the post of a chamber window facing the sun. Henry IV., one of the most illustrious of monarchs, was very uneasy before his assassination on account of some prophecies. Memoirs of Sully declares, that one of the considerations that kept him faithful to his master in the most unpromising state of his affairs, was a prediction of La Broche, that Henry would make his fortune. The astrologer Morin directed Cardinal Richelieu's motions in some of his journeys. The enlightened Cudworth defended prophecies in general, and called those who opposed the belief of witchcraft by the name of atheists; and the predictions of Rice Evans have been supported in the present century by the celebrated names of Warburton and Johnson. Dr Hoffman, the father of the Modern Theory and Practice of Medicine, in a dissertation published in the large edition of his works in 1747, says, that the devil can raise storms, produce insects, and act upon the animal spirits and imagination; and, in fine, that he is an excellent optician and natural philosopher on account of his long experience. Dr Johnston, the leviathan of literature, is supposed to have believed the second sight.\n\nWith respect to the effects of superstition on the human mind, they are indeed deplorable. It chains down the understanding, and sinks it into the most abject and forlorn state, and keeps it under the dominion of fear, and sometimes of cruelty. Where once it takes possession, it has a tendency to become extreme, and generally becomes so intolerable, that men of reflection and learning confine its destruction. The Christian religion gave a violent shock to the heathen superstition; the reformation in a great measure demolished the superstition of the church of Rome; and the superstition which remained among Protestants after their separation from that church has been gradually yielding to the influence of enlightened reason, or to the bold and daring attacks of infidelity and deism. We behold the prospect of its ruins with pleasure, and thank the deists for their zeal; but it is from the firm hope that the religion of Jesus will arise in all its beauty and simple majesty, and be admired and respected as it deserves: for mean and contemptible as superstition certainly is, we would rather see men do what they reckon their duty from superstitious principles, than see anarchy and vice prevail, even though attended with all the knowledge and liberality of sentiment which deism and infidelity can inspire.\n\nSUPERVISOR, a surveyor or overseer.\n\nSUPINATION, in Anatomy, the action of a supinator muscle, or the motion whereby it turns the hand so as that the palm is lifted up towards heaven.\n\nSUPINE, in Latin grammar, part of the conjugation of a verb, being a verbal substantive of the singular number and the fourth declension.\n\nThere are two kinds of supines: one, called the first supine, ending in um of the accusative case, which is always of an active signification, and follows a verb of motion; as abit deambulatium. The other, called the last supine, and ending in u of the ablative case, is of a passive signification, and is governed by substantives or adjectives; as, facile dieb, &c.\n\nThey have their name, says Probus, and after him Voissius.\nSUPPER, the evening repast.—Suppers that are heavy should be avoided, because the stomach is more oppressed with the same quantity of food in an horizontal posture than in an erect one, and because digestion goes on more slowly when we sleep than when we are awake. They should be eaten long enough before bedtime, that they may be nearly digested before going to sleep; and then a draught of pure water will dilute that which remains in the stomach.\n\nDefinition. SUPPER of the Lord, otherwise called the Eucharist, is a sacrament ordained by Christ in his church, of which the outward part is bread and wine, and the inward part or thing signified the body and blood of Christ, which the majority of Christians believe to be in some sense or other taken and received by the faithful communicants. See SACRAMENT.\n\nThere is no ordinance of the gospel which has been the subject of more violent controversies between different churches, and even between different divines of the same church, than this sacrament; and though all confess that one purpose of its institution was to be a bond of love and union among Christians, it has, by the perverters of mankind, been too often converted into an occasion of hatred. The outward and visible sign, and the inward and spiritual grace, have equally afforded matter of disputation to angry controversialists. Many members of the church of Rome condemn the Greek church and the Protestants for using leavened bread in the Lord's Supper, contrary to the example set them by our Saviour; whilst the Greek church in general, and some Protestant societies in particular, unite with the church of Rome in condemning all churches which mix not the wine with water, as deviating improperly from primitive practice. See EUCHARIST.\n\nThat it was unleavened bread which our Lord blessed and brake and gave to his disciples as his body, cannot be questioned; for at the time of the passover, when this ordinance was instituted, there was no leavened bread to be found in Jerusalem*. For the mixed cup, the evidence is not so decisive. It is indeed true, as we have observed under the article EUCHARIST, that the primitive Christians used wine diluted with water; and if we may believe Maimonides†, it was the general custom of the Jews, as well at the passover as at their ordinary meals, to add a little water to their wine on account of its great strength; but that this was always done, or that it was done by our Saviour in particular, there is no clear evidence. Origen indeed affirms‡, that our Lord administered in wine unmixed; and he was not a man to hazard such an affirmation, had there been in his days any certain tradition, or so much as a general opinion, to the contrary. On this account we have often heard with wonder the necessity of the mixed cup insisted on by those who without hesitation make use of leavened bread; for if it be essential to the sacrament, that the very same elements be employed by us that were employed by our Saviour, the necessity of unleavened bread is certainly equal to that of wine diluted by water.\n\nBut the mixed cup is said to be emblematical of the blood and water which flowed from the side of our Lord when pierced by the spear of the Roman soldier, while the absence of leaven is emblematical of no particular circumstance in His passion. This argument for the mixture is as old as the era of St Cyprian, and has since been frequently urged with triumph by those who surely perceived not its weakness. The flowing of the blood and water from our Saviour's side was the consequence either of the spear's having pierced the pericardium, or more probably of an aëtesis or hydrothorax, occasioned by his cruel and lingering death (see MEDICINE, No. 342, 343). But whatever was the cause of it, how can the mixing of wine with water in the sacrament be emblematical of the flowing of blood and water separately? Such a mixture surely bears a more striking resemblance to the reunion of the serum and coagulum, after they had been separated by whatever cause. See BLOOD.\n\nWe urge not these objections to the mixed cup from any dislike that we have to the practice. It is unquestionably harmless and primitive; and we with that greater regard were paid to primitive practices than the generality of Christians seem to think they can claim: frivolous, but let the advocates for antiquity be consistent; let them either reform, together with the mixed cup, the use of unleavened bread, or acknowledge that neither the one nor the other is essential to the sacrament. This last acknowledgement must indeed be made, if they would not involve themselves in difficulties from which they cannot be extricated. If either the mixed cup or unleavened bread be absolutely necessary to the validity of the sacrament, why not that particular kind of wine which was used by our Saviour? and where is that wine to be found?\n\nBut the controversies respecting the outward part or sign of the Lord's Supper are of little importance when compared with those which have been agitated respecting the inward part or thing signified; and of these we halten to give as comprehensive a view as the limits prescribed to such articles will admit.\n\nOur Blest Lord, in the same night that he was betrayed, \"took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.\" Such was the institution of the Lord's Supper as it is recorded in the gospel by St Matthew; and we have the same account of it, in almost the very same words, by three other inspired writers, St Paul, St Mark, and St Luke. That it was the bread which Christ blessed and brake that is here called his body, and the wine over which he gave thanks that he styles his blood of the new testament, will admit of no reasonable doubt (A); but in what sense they became so, has been the subject of many controversies.\n\nThe church of Rome, which holds, that after consecration of the church of Rome.\n\n(A) Some over-zealous Protestants have indeed affirmed, that it was not the consecrated bread and wine, but those\nSupper.\n\nJesús Christ, God and man, is really, truly, and substantially, contained under the outward appearances of the bread and wine, informs us, that about the middle of the mass, when the priest, taking into his hand, first the bread and then the wine, pronounces over each separately the sacred words of consecration, the substance of these elements is immediately changed by the almighty power of God into the body and blood of Christ; but that all the outward appearances of the bread and wine, and all their sensible qualities remain. This more than miraculous change is called transubstantiation; and is founded on the philosophy of Aristotle, which resolves all bodies into matter and form (see Metaphysics, No. 142-150); for it is only the matter or imperceptible substance which supports the forms or sensible qualities of bread and wine, that is changed into the substance or matter of the body and blood of Christ, so that this divine matter, coming into the place of the former earthly matter, supports the same identical forms which it supported. Hence we are told, \"that Jesus Christ, now present instead of the bread and wine, exhibits himself to us under those very same outward forms or appearances which the bread and wine had before the change.\"\n\nCould this doctrine be true, it would be abundantly mysterious; but to add to the mystery, we are farther informed, that under each kind is contained Jesus Christ whole and entire, his body and blood, his soul and divinity; so that when a man eats what has the appearance of a wafer, he really and truly eats the body and blood, the soul and divinity, of Jesus Christ; and when he afterwards drinks what has the appearance of wine, he drinks the very same body and blood, soul and divinity, which not a minute perhaps before he had wholly and entirely eaten! The ingenious author from whose work we have taken this account of the Roman doctrine concerning the real presence, may perhaps reject our inference that the orthodox members of his church must believe the soul and divinity of Christ to be eaten and drunk in the Lord's Supper; but he cannot deny that, according to his statement of the Catholic faith, the soul and divinity are both received whole and entire into the stomach of each communicant. He says indeed, that \"communion consists in receiving Jesus Christ whole and entire, his sacred body, his precious blood, his blest soul, and his adorable divinity, into our souls;\" but that which was formerly bread and wine unquestionably goes into the stomachs of the communicants; and hence, according to him, it is now the body and blood of Christ, the soul and divinity must go thither with it, for these four cannot be separated. This our author himself grants, \"The Scripture (says he) positively declares, that Christ rising again from the dead, death shall no more have dominion over him (Rom. vi. 9.) Consequently his body, his blood, and his soul, shall never more be separated from one another; and as the union of his divine and human natures can never more be broken, so neither can these, his two natures, united in his divine person, be ever separated. From this it necessarily follows, that wherever the body of Christ is, there also his blood, his soul, and his divinity, must of necessity be in like manner.\"\n\nNow, whether we suppose, with our author, that the soul and divinity of Christ directly carry his body and blood with them into the human soul, or, trifling, in some degree to the evidence of sense, believe that the body and blood carry the soul and divinity with them directly into the stomach of each communicant—is it credible, is it possible, that the high and lofty One, who inhabiteth eternity, and whom the oracles of truth assure us that even the heaven of heavens cannot contain, should be substantially received whole and entire into a finite spirit like the human soul, or into a body so limited as the human stomach? Our author says it is; declaring that, \"by the blest presence of Jesus Christ, whole and entire within us, are communicated to our souls all the heavenly graces which are the effects of the holy communion: such as the sanctification of the soul by an increase of justifying grace; the rendering of it more pure, more holy, more beautiful, more agreeable, in the eyes of God; the cleansing of the soul from all those venial sins and imperfections of which we repent, and preserving us from falling into mortal sins; the uniting of us in a most intimate manner with Jesus Christ, who comes to us in this holy sacrament on purpose to dwell in our souls and abide with us; and the giving us a pledge and earnest of a glorious immortality, to the enjoyment of which it brings us at last, if we persevere to the end in the grace of God.\"\n\nThe consequence of the doctrine of transubstantiation is the sacrifice of the mass, by which, it is said, God's acceptance of Christ's sacrifice on the cross is obtained for the actual benefit of those persons in particular for whom the mass is offered. In the work so often quoted, we are told, that \"Jesus Christ our redeemer, who is both our high-priest and our victim, who, in order to perfect the work of our redemption, and reconcile man with his offended Creator, offered himself once in a bloody\n\nthose elements, together with the whole action of taking them into his hands, blessing them, breaking the bread, and distributing the bread and wine to the disciples, that Christ calls his body and blood. This novel and singular opinion rests upon no better foundation than a very childish criticism. Our Saviour, after blessing and breaking the bread, gave it to the disciples, saying, in the original, Αὐτοῦς ὁμοίως τοῦτο ἐκλάπη τῷ σώματι μου. Now, say our critics, τοῦτο, in the neuter gender, can never agree with the antecedent αὐτοῖς; in the masculine, but must refer to all the circumstances of the action taken together, and considered as one complex neuter noun. But this noun, whether complex or simple, certainly denotes what could be eaten; and to suppose that our blest Lord desired his apostles to eat actions, is as repugnant to human reason as any doctrine of the church of Rome. The truth is, that the word τοῦτο, which is more properly a definite article than a demonstrative pronoun (see Grammar, Chap. II.), refers directly to the thing, whatever it was, which our Saviour held in his hand and gave to the disciples; and the clause, when completed, is τοῦτο ὁμοίως τῷ σώματι μου; this being, this substance, is my body. There was no necessity for characterizing that substance by any analogy to sex, in order that it might be distinguished from every other substance; for the apostles could not but see it in the hand of their Master.\nSapper bloody manner upon the cross, in order to communicate and apply to the souls of individuals those graces, which, by his death, he merited for mankind in general, continues to offer himself daily upon the altar in an unbloody manner, by the ministry of his priests, in the mass. The sacrifice of the cross and that of the mass are both one and the same sacrifice, because in both the victim is the same and the high priest the same, viz. Jesus Christ. The only difference is in the manner of offering. On the cross he offered himself in a bloody manner and actually died; whereas on the altar he is offered up to God in an unbloody manner, not actually dead, but under the appearance of death? So that the communicants not only eat the man Jesus Christ, but even eat him alive (B)!\n\nIt is known to all our readers that this doctrine of transubstantiation was one cause of the breach between the church of Rome and those various societies which call themselves reformed churches. The real and substantial change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of our Lord is rejected by every reformer as a change contradictory and impossible, and fraught with the most impious consequences; and volumes have been written to expose the weaknesses of those arguments which have so often been vainly urged in its support. It has been shown to imply numberless absurdities, such as, that the same thing can be in a million of different places, whole and entire, at the same instant of time; that it is above 1800 years old, and yet may be not more than one minute; that forms or sensible qualities are real things independent of their subject and the sentient beings who perceive them; that the infinite and eternal God, who created and sustains the universe, is himself wholly and substantially comprehended by the human soul; and that the half, or fourth, or tenth part of the body of Christ, is equal to the whole of that body. That these are necessary consequences of transubstantiation has been so completely proved in various works (C) to which every reader may have access, that it is needless for us to repeat arguments so hackneyed; but there are two objections to that doctrine, which, as we do not remember to have met with them elsewhere, and as they appear to us absolutely conclusive, it may be worth while to state in this place.\n\nThe advocates for the real presence in the Lord's Supper contend, that every word relating to that ordinance is to be taken in the strictest and most literal sense, and they affect to triumph over the Protestants, because their notions of the sacrament cannot be supported without having recourse to figure and metaphor. This however is a very vain triumph; for we hesitate not to affirm, that supposing transubstantiation possible, and even capable of proof, there is not in the whole New Testament a single word or a single phrase which, if interpreted literally, gives the slightest countenance to that wonderful doctrine. The reader will remember, that transubstantiation, as we have stated it from a dignitary of the Roman church, and as it is in fact stated by the council of Trent (D), consists in a change of the matter, imperceptible substance, or substance of the bread and wine into the matter, imperceptible substance, or substance of Christ's body and blood; for all parties agree that the sensible qualities of the bread and wine remain, and, according to the Romanist, are after consecration either supported by the matter of Christ's body and blood, or hung upon nothing. But the phrase τοῦτο σῖτον ἐστίν is contrary to Scripture,\n\n(B) This whole account of the Roman doctrine respecting the sacrament of the Lord's Supper is taken from a work in two small volumes, called *The Sincere Christian Instructed in the Faith of Christ, from the Written Word*. Its author is a man of learning, and great personal worth; and as he fills a high station in the church of Rome, we cannot doubt but that he has given a fair view of the doctrine of that church respecting this and every other article of which he treats. We are sorry however that his zeal should have compelled him, in a popular work, to write in the manner that he has done of the salvation of those who are not members of his church, or who cannot embrace all his opinions; for if his doctrine on this subject be implicitly received by those \"over whom he has the rule, and for whose souls he is appointed to watch,\" they must necessarily look upon the majority of their fellow-citizens as reprobates doomed to eternal perdition. Let this be our apology for treating some of those opinions, which he thinks so absolutely necessary to salvation, with less ceremony than perhaps we should have done, had he less positively pronounced our damnation for not having it in our power to embrace them. He is not indeed much less severe on the most virtuous heathens, though they never saw the New Testament, or heard the doctrines of his church preached. But perhaps this severity may be occasioned by the following question of Cicero: \"Cum fruges, Cereum; vinum, Liberum dicimus, genere nos quidem fermonis utinam usu: sed ecquem tam amentem esse putas, qui illud, quo vefcatur, deum credat esse?\" *De Natura Deorum*, lib. iii., cap. 16.\n\n(c) Among other works on this subject, we may confidently recommend to the reader a small tract published by Dr Abernethy Drummond, about thirty years ago, in the form of *A Dialogue between Philalethes and Benedictus*. In that treatise, together with a defence of it, which were both printed for Balfour and Drummond, Edinburgh, the absurd consequences which we have mentioned are, by arguments unanswerable, proved to flow from the doctrine of transubstantiation; and the artful sophistry, by which a very acute genius endeavoured to keep these consequences out of sight, is detected and exposed on acknowledged principles of the soundest metaphysics.\n\n(D) The canon of that council which establishes transubstantiation is thus translated by the author of *The Sincere Christian Instructed*: \"If any man shall say, that in the blessed sacrament of the Eucharist the substance of the bread and wine remains along with the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and shall deny that wonderful and singular conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the body, and of the whole substance of the wine into the blood, the appearances of the bread and wine only remaining, which conversion the Catholic Church calls transubstantiation, let him be anathema.\"\nSupper, μού, if taken in the literal sense, cannot possibly denote the consequence of such a change as this; for every person at all acquainted with the Greek language, especially the language of the Peripatetic school, knows that τὸ ὠμόνον μου signifies, not the matter or fulūratum of my body divested of its sensible qualities; but the body of me in its natural state, consisting of matter and qualities, or matter and form united. Unless therefore the sensible qualities, as well as the matter of the bread and wine, give place to the sensible qualities as well as the matter of our Saviour's body and blood, and unless he appear glorified on the altar as he appeared on the mount at his transfiguration, the words τὸ ὠμόνον μου must be interpreted figuratively. Had the apostles understood their Master's words in the sense in which they are understood by the church of Rome, they would have rendered them into Greek, not τὸ ὠμόνον τῷ ὠμόνον μου, \"this is my body,\" but τὸ ὠμόνον τῷ ὠμόνον τῷ ὠμόνον μου, \"this is the matter of my body.\" In like manner, when St John relates that Jesus said, \"Who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day,\" he had understood his adorable Master to speak of his flesh and blood in the Eucharist in the sense in which they are taught to be there by the church of Rome, he would have represented him as saying, not ὁ ἐσχάτῳ ἐν τῇ σαρκί, καὶ πίνω μεν τῷ αἵματι, ἀλλ' ὁ ἐσχάτῳ ἐν τῇ σαρκί, καὶ πίνω μεν τῷ αἵματι, \"whoso eateth the matter of my flesh, and drinketh the matter of my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\"\n\nBut further, supposing this singular conversion possible in itself, it cannot be rendered credible, however stated in any language that ever was or ever will be spoken by man. At first sight it may appear paradoxical to affirm, that a possible fact cannot be so related as to obtain credit; but that transubstantiation, if possible, is such a fact, will be apparent on the slightest consideration.\n\nThe relation that subsists between things and words is arbitrary; so that what is termed body in English, is σῶμα in Greek, and corpus in Latin; and the same thing might with equal propriety (had the authors of these languages so pleased) have been expressed in the first by soul, in the second by τοῦ, and in the third by anima. (See LANGUAGE, No. 3, &c.) The consequences of this are, that there is no universal language spoken; that the natives of one country understand not the speech of those of another; and that different men speaking the same language are perpetually liable to mistake each other's meaning. Between the fulūratum of bodies and their sensible qualities there is a relation founded in nature, so that the sensible qualities which indicate the substance to which they belong, to be gold, for instance, in one country, indicate the same thing in every other country, and have done so from the beginning of time. The sensible appearances of bodies therefore are an universal language, the language of the Author of Nature, by which he declares to his creature man, that though the ἰδια τρέπης, or primary matter of all bodies, may be the same kind of substance; yet the ἰδια τρέπης of one body, or the internal combination of its primary parts, differs from that of another; that gold, for instance, has a different fulūratum or basis from iron, lead, or silver; that the internal organization or structure of the body of an ox is different from that of a horse; and that the internal fulūratum or fulūratum which exhibits the appearances of bread and wine is different from that which supports the sensible qualities of flesh and blood (see METAPHYSICS, Part I., Chap. I. and Part II., Chap. I. and II.). Supposing therefore the doctrine of transubstantiation to be possible and even true, it would still be impossible, by any statement of it in human language, or by any argument urged in its support, to render that doctrine an object of rational belief; for if it be said that the words τὸ ὠμόνον τῷ ὠμόνον μου were spoken by a divine person, who could neither be deceived himself nor intend to deceive us, it may be replied, that the sensible appearances of bread and wine, which are confessed to remain, are likewise the language of a divine person, even of the Creator and Governor of heaven and earth; that this language addressed to the sight, the taste, the touch, and the smell, is equally intelligible to all nations; that since the creation of the world its meaning has never been mistaken by the scholar or the clown, the sage or the savage, except in this single instance of our Lord's flesh and blood exhibiting the sensible appearances of bread and wine; and that it is therefore infinitely more probable that the members of the church of Rome should mistake the meaning of the words τὸ ὠμόνον τῷ ὠμόνον μου, which, though spoken by Christ, are part of the language of men, and liable to all its ambiguities, than that all mankind should mistake the language of God himself, which is liable to no ambiguities, and which was never in any other instance misunderstood by a single individual. Should transubstantiation therefore be really true, its truth can never be proved or rendered probable, but by an immediate operation of the spirit of God on the mind of man; and he who is conscious of no such operation on his own mind, may rest assured that the Father of mercies, who knows whereof he is made, will never bring upon him, for his incredulity in this instance, any of the anathemas denounced by the church of Rome upon those who place implicit confidence in the universal language of Him who created them, in opposition to her figurative and contradictory interpretations of the written word. Of the transubstantiation of the elements a visible miracle would afford no proof. Had the water been changed into wine at the marriage in Cana of Galilee, for the express purpose of bearing testimony to this singular conversion, what must have been the consequence on the minds of those who witnessed that miracle? Nothing, we think, but skepticism or distrust of their own faculties; for they would have had the very same evidence that no substantial change was wrought on the elements, as that the water was actually turned into wine.\n\nThough the reformed churches unanimously reject the doctrine of transubstantiation, and of course the sacrifice of the mass, its inseparable consequence, they are far from being agreed among themselves respecting the nature of the Lord's Supper; and the notions of this ordinance entertained by some of them appear to us as untenable as any part of the doctrine of the church of Rome, of the Lutherans believe, that the body and blood of theramans in Christ are really and substantially present with the bread and wine; that the body is really and truly eaten, and Cogit. M. the blood really and truly drunk, by the communicants; and that whatever motion or action the bread hardin has, the body has the same. According to them, Theol. de Sacra Com.\ntherefore, the same sensible appearances are exhibited by two substances united in some inexplicable manner, which is neither a perfonal union, nor incorporation, nor the inclosure of the body within the bread; nor does it last longer than while the sacrament is celebrating. This union is generally called consubstantiation; but they reject the term, contenting themselves with afflicting the real presence, without presuming to define the mode by which the body and blood of Christ are united to the sacramental elements.\n\nIt would be superfluous to waste time in replying to this doctrine. Every reader sees that it implies the possibility of the same thing's being whole and entire in a million of places at one and the same instant of time, which has been so often urged as an unanswerable objection to the Romish doctrine; and it is fraught with this additional absurdity peculiar to itself, that two bodily substances may at once occupy the same place, which is directly contrary to our notions of solidity. It may be observed too, that whatever be the real sense of our Saviour's words, he says expressly, \"This is my body\"—this thing which I give you, and which you see and feel; whereas, had he meant what Luther and his followers teach, he would surely have said, \"With this bread receive my body, with this cup receive my blood.\"\n\nThe notions of some of the early Calvinists respecting the Lord's Supper are very mysterious, and expressed in language of which we are not sure that we understand the meaning. In the year 1561 an attempt was made in France to bring the Catholics and Protestants to an uniformity of doctrine on this great topic of controversy; and deputies were appointed by both parties to meet at Poissy, and debate the question in a friendly manner. The principal managers on the side of the Catholics were the cardinals of Lorraine and Touron; those on the side of the Protestants were Beza and Peter Martyr. After several meetings, disputes, and violent separations, the Protestant deputies declared their faith in the following words: \"We confess, that Jesus Christ, in the Supper, does truly give and exhibit to us the substance of his body and blood by the efficacy of his Holy Spirit; and that we do receive and eat spiritually, and by faith, that very body which was offered and immolated for us, so as to be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, to the end that we may be enlivened thereby, and receive what is conducive to our salvation. And because faith, supported by the word of God, makes these things present, which it apprehends, and by that faith we do in deed and reality receive the true natural body and blood of Christ, by the power of the Holy Spirit; by this means, we confess and acknowledge the presence of his body and blood in the Supper.\" One of the Catholic delegates expressing his dislike of this last clause, the Protestant ministers gave the following explanation of their sentiments: \"No distance of place can hinder us from communicating of the body and blood of Christ, for the Lord's Supper is a heavenly thing; and though on earth we receive with our mouths bread and wine, which are the true signs of his body and blood, yet by faith, and the efficacy of the Holy Ghost, our minds, which are fed with this food, are rapt up into heaven, and enjoy the presence of the body and blood; and that by this means it may be said that the body is truly joined to the bread, and the blood to the wine; but after the manner of a sacrament, and not at all according to place or natural position.\"\n\nIf the reader can discover the precise meaning of these passages, his sagacity exceeds ours. That the Protestant deputies believed, or professed to believe, that the natural body and blood of Christ are by the faithful received in the Lord's Supper, is indeed evident; but their notions respecting the manner of this reception are very unintelligible, if not contradictory. In the former quotation, they confess that Christ's body and blood are really present in the sacrament; that they are made present by faith (we suppose the faith of the communicants); and that the very body which was offered and immolated for us is eaten spiritually and by faith. In the latter quotation, they seem to lay that Christ's body and blood are in heaven, at a great distance from the true signs of them; that on earth the communicants receive only these signs, which are bread and wine; but that, by faith and the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, their minds, during actual communion, are rapt up into heaven, where they enjoy the presence of the body and blood; and that by this means the body and blood are truly joined to the bread and wine through the medium of the mind of the communicant, which is at once present both to the sign and to the thing signified. To this mysterious doctrine it is needless to urge objections. Every man who is accustomed to think, and to use words with some determinate meaning, will at once perceive that the authors of this declaration must have had very confused notions of the subject, and have pleased themselves with sound instead of sense, satisfied that they could not be wrong if they did not symbolize with the Lutherans or the Council of Trent.\n\nThe churches of England and Scotland, in their articles of belief, do not agree in the Lord's Supper, appear churches of to be Calvinistical; but the compilers of the Thirty-nine Articles and of the Confession of Faith must have been much more rational divines than Beza and Peter Martyr. They agree in condemning the doctrine of transubstantiation as contrary to common sense, and not founded in the word of God; they teach, that to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the sacrament, the bread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ, and the cup of blessing a partaking of the blood of Christ; and they add, that the body and blood of Christ are eaten and drunk, not corporally or carnally, but only after a heavenly and spiritual manner, by which the communicants are made partakers of all the benefits of his death. In one important circumstance these two churches seem to differ. The Confession of Faith, as we understand it, affirms, that in the Church of England there is no sacrifice made at all. The thirty-first article of the church of England likewise condemns the Popish sacrifice of the mass as a blasphemous form of fable and dangerous deceit; but in the order for the administration of the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion, chap. xxix., the celebrator \"beseeches God most mercifully to accept the alms and oblations of the congregation,\" and again \"to accept their sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving;\" from which petitions many have inferred that, in the Lord's Supper, that church offers a commemorative and eucharistical sacrifice. This inference seems not to be wholly without foundation. In the order for the administration of the Lord's Supper, according to the form of the Book of Common Prayer set forth by act of parliament...\nSupper. In the second and third years of King Edward the Sixth, the elements were solemnly offered to God as a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; and though the prayer containing that oblation was, at the review of the liturgy some years afterwards, removed from the prayer of consecration, to which it was originally joined, and placed where it now stands in the polt communion service; yet the very act of parliament which authorized that alteration, calls King Edward’s “a very godly order, agreeable to the word of God and the primitive church, and very comfortable to all good people desiring to live in Christian conversation.”\n\nThe English church, however, has not positively determined anything reflecting this great question; and whilst she condemns the doctrine of the real presence, with all its dangerous consequences, she allows her members to entertain very different notions of this holy ordinance, and to publish these notions to the world.\n\nAccordingly, many of her most eminent divines (e) have maintained that, in the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, the elements of bread and wine are offered to God as a sacrifice commemorative of Christ’s one sacrifice for the sins of the whole world; that these elements, though they undergo no substantial change, yet receive such a divine virtue by the descent of the Holy Ghost, as to convey to the worthy communicant all the benefits of Christ’s passion; that they are therefore called his body and blood, because being, after their oblation, eaten and drunk in remembrance of Him, they supply the place of his body and blood in the feast upon his sacrifice; and that it is customary with our Saviour to give to any thing the name of another of which it completely supplies the place, as when he calls himself the door of the sheep, because there is no entrance into the church or kingdom of God but by faith in him.\n\nThey observe, that the Eucharist’s being commemorative, no more hinders it from being a proper sacrifice, than the typical and figurative sacrifices of the old law hindered them from being proper sacrifices; for as to be a type doth not destroy the nature and notion of a legal sacrifice, so to be representative and commemorative, doth not destroy the nature of an evangelical sacrifice. To prove that, in the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, there is a real sacrifice offered to God as well as a sacrament received by the communicants, they appeal to St Paul, who says expressly (f), that “Christians have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle,” and who by contrasting the cup of the Lord with the cup of devils, and the table of the Lord with the table of devils, teaches plainly, that those cups and those tables had the same specific nature. That the table of devils spoken of by the apostle was the Pagan altars, and the cup of devils the wine poured out in libations to the Pagan divinities, will admit of no dispute; and therefore, say the advocates for the eucharistical sacrifice, the table of the Lord must be the Christian altar, and the cup of the Lord the wine offered to God as the representative of the blood of Christ; otherwise there would not be that absurdity which the apostle supposes, in the same person drinking the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils, and partaking of the Lord’s table and the table of devils. They observe further, that in all the ancient liturgies extant there is a solemn form of oblation of the sacramental elements, and that all the Christian writers from the second century downwards treat of the Lord’s Supper as a sacrifice as well as sacrificial feast, having indeed no value in itself, but acceptable to God as representing Christ’s one sacrifice for the sins of the world. Our limits will not permit us to give even an abstract of their arguments; but the reader who shall attentively peruse Johnson’s unbloody Sacrifice and Altar unveiled and supported, will discover that their notions are better founded than probably he supposes, and that they are totally irreconcilable with the doctrine of transubstantiation and the Poophilic sacrifice of the mass.\n\nOther English divines of great learning, with the celebrated Hoadley bishop of Winchester at the head of them, contend strenuously that the Lord’s Supper, so far from being a sacrifice of any kind, is nothing more than bread and wine reverently eaten and drunk, in remembrance that Christ’s body was broken and his blood shed in proof of his Father’s and his own love to mankind; that nothing is essential to the sacrament but this remembrance, and a serious desire to honour and obey our Saviour as our head; that the sacrament might be celebrated without uttering one prayer or thanksgiving, merely by a society of Christians, whether small or great, jointly eating bread and drinking wine with a serious remembrance of Christ’s death; that St Paul enjoins a man to examine himself before he eat of that bread and drink of that cup, not to discover what have been the sins of his past life in order to repent of them, but only that he may be sure of his remembering Christ’s body broken and his blood shed; that, however, it is his duty in that as in every other instance of religious worship to resolve to obey from the heart every precept of the gospel, whether moral or positive; and that to partake worthily of the Lord’s Supper is acceptable to God, because it is paying obedience to one of these precepts; but that no particular benefits or privileges are annexed to it more than to any other instance of duty. Bishop Hoadley acknowledges, that when St Paul says (g), “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?” he has been supposed by many learned men to affirm, that all the benefits of Christ’s passion are in the Lord’s Supper conveyed to the worthy communicant; but this (says he) is an idea which the apostle could not have in his thoughts as at all proper for his argument. The Greek word κοινωνία and the English communion signify only a partaking of something in common with others of the same society; and the apostle’s meaning (he says) can be nothing more, than that in the Lord’s Supper we do not eat bread and drink wine as at an ordinary meal, but as memorials of the body and blood of Christ, in honour to him as the head of that body of which we are all members. That the word κοινωνία is not meant to denote any inward or spiritual part of the Lord’s Supper, he thinks evident, because the same word is used with regard to the cup and the table of idols, where no spiritual\nspiritual part could be thought of, and in an argument which supposes an idol to be nothing.\n\nTo this view of the nature and end of the Lord's Supper, it must appear no small objection, that \"he who eateth and drinketh unworthily is said to be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, and to eat and drink a judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.\" No doubt it would be sinful to eat and drink a mere memorial of Christ's death without fervent dispositions; but we cannot conceive how a little wandering of the thoughts, which is all the unworthiness which the author thinks there can be on such an occasion, should be a sin of so deep a dye as to be properly compared with the guilt of those who murdered the Lord of life. Other divines, therefore, feeling the force of this and similar objections, steer a middle course between the mere memorialist and the advocate for a real sacrifice in the holy Eucharist, and insist that this rite, though no sacrifice itself, is yet a feast upon the one sacrifice offered by Christ and slain upon the cross. The most eminent patrons of this opinion have been Dr Cudworth, Bishop Warburton, and the present bishop of Chester; and they support it by such arguments as the following: \"In those ages of the world when victims made so great a part of the religion both of Jews and Gentiles, the sacrifice was always followed by a religious feasting on the thing offered; which was called the feast upon, or after the sacrifice, and was supposed to convey to the partakers of it the benefits of the sacrifice. Now Jesus (say they), about to offer himself a sacrifice on the cross for our redemption, did, in conformity to general practice, institute the last supper, under the idea of a feast after the sacrifice; and the circumstances attending its institution were such, they think, that the apostles could not possibly mistake his meaning. It was just before his passion, and while he was eating the paschal supper, which was a Jewish feast upon the sacrifice, that our blessed Lord instituted this rite; and as it was his general custom to allude, in his actions and expressions, to what passed before his eyes, or presented itself to his observation, who can doubt, when, in the very form of celebration, we see all the marks of a sacrificial supper, but that the divine institutor intended it should bear the same relation to his sacrifice on the cross which the paschal supper then celebrating bore to the oblation of the paschal lamb? If this was not his purpose, and if nothing more was intended than a general memorial of a dead benefactor, why was this instant of time preferred for the institution to all others throughout the course of his ministry, any one of which would have been equally commodious? Indeed any other time would have been more commodious for the institution of a mere memorial; for the paschal lamb and unleavened bread were certainly a sacrifice; and the words used by our Saviour, when he gave the bread and wine to the apostles, were such as must necessarily have led them to consider that bread and wine as bearing the same relation to his sacrifice that the paschal supper bore to the paschal sacrifice. At that Jewish feast, it was the custom of every father of a family to break the unleavened bread, and to give to every guest a portion, saying, 'This is the bread of affliction, which our fathers did eat in the land of Egypt:' a custom which, we may be sure, that Christ, as father of his family, would religiously observe. The apostles knew well that they were not eating the identical bread which their fathers did eat in Egypt, but the feast upon the sacrifice then offered in commemoration of their redemption from Egyptian bondage; and therefore when they saw their Master after supper break the bread again and give it to each of them, with these remarkable words, 'This is my body which is given for you, do this in remembrance of me,' they must have concluded, that his meaning was to institute a rite which should to the end of the world bear the same relation to his sacrifice that the paschal supper bore to the sacrifice of the paschal lamb.\"\n\nThis inference, from the circumstances attending the institution, Bishop Warburton thinks confirmed by St Paul's mode of arguing with the Corinthians, on their impiety and absurdity in partaking both of the Lord's table and the table of devils; for \"what (says he) had the eaters of the sacrifices to do with the partakers of the bread and wine in the Lord's Supper, if the Lord's Supper was not a feast of the same kind with their feasts? If the three feasts, Jewish, Pagan, and Christian, had not one common nature, how could the apostle have inferred that this intercommunity was inconsistent? Ye cannot (says he) drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and the table of devils. For though there might be impiety in the promiscuous use of Pagan and Christian rites of any kind, yet the inconsistency arises from their having a common nature, and consequently, as they had opposite originals, from their destroying one another's effects in the very celebration. Sacrifices, and feasts upon sacrifices, were universally considered as federal rites; and therefore the Lord's table and the table of devils being both federal rites, the same man could no more be partaker of both, than he could at once engage to serve both God and the devil. This is the apostle's argument to the wife men, to whom he appeals; and we see that it turns altogether upon this postulatum, that the Christian and Pagan feasts had the same specific nature, or were both feasts upon sacrifices. If this be admitted, it is easy to see why St Paul deemed those who ate and drank unworthily guilty of the body and blood of the Lord; for if the Lord's Supper be a feast upon his sacrifice, it must have been considered as the means of conveying to the communicants all the benefits of his death and passion; and the profanation of such a rite, by rendering his death ineffectual, might be fitly compared and justly equalled to the enormous guilt of those by whom his blood was shed.\" In reply to Bishop Hoadley's remarks upon the word κοινωνία, his brother bishop observes, that \"had the apostle meant what the learned writer makes him to mean, he would doubtless have said κοινωνία ἐν τῷ σώματι, 'your communion in the body—your eating it jointly.' St Paul (continues he) knew how to express himself properly, as appears from a passage in his epistle to the Philippians, where, professedly speaking of the joint participation of a blessing, he uses these words, κοινωνία ἐν τῷ σώματι, 'your communion in the gospel.' To the other remark, that no spiritual part could be thought of in the table of idols, because an idol is said by the apostle to be nothing, Bishop Warburton replies, 'that by St Paul the Gentiles are said to have sacrificed to devils, and those who ate of such sacrifices to have had communion with devils: now the devil (continues his Lordship) was in St Paul's opinion something.'\" But the inference which the\nthe apostle draws from the acknowledged truth, that\nthe cup of bleffing which we blefs is the communion of\nthe blood of Chrift, and the bread which we break the\ncommunion of the body of Chrift, puts his meaning, our\nauthor thinks, beyond all doubt. He says*, that the\npartaking of one bread makes the receivers of many to\nbecome one body. A just inference, if this rite be of\nthe nature of a feast upon the sacrifice; for then the\ncommunion of the body and blood of Chrift unites the re-\nceivers into one body by an equal dilution of one\ncommon benefit. But if it be only a general com-\nmemoration of a deceased benefactor, it leaves the receivers\nas it found them, not one body, but many separate pro-\nfessors of one common faith.\n\nThus have we given such a view as our limits would\npermit us to give, of the principal opinions that have\nbeen held reflecting the nature and end of the Lord's\nSupper. It is an ordinance which seems not to be ge-\nnerally understood; though, being intended to show\nforth the Lord's death till he come, it is surely of suf-\nficient importance to engage the attention of every fer-\nious Christian. The most considerable Protestant di-\nvines who have expressly written upon it are, Johnfon in\nhis Unbloody Sacrifice; Cudworth in his Discourse con-\ncerning the true Nature of the Lord's Supper; Hoadley\nin his Plain Account; and Warburton in his Rational\nAccount. The notions of Cudworth and Warburton are\nthe same, and perhaps they differ not so much from\nthose of Johnfon as many readers seem to imagine. At\nany rate, the arguments by which Warburton supports\nhis doctrine must have some force, since it is said that\nHoadley himself acknowledged they would be unan-\nswerable, if it could be proved that the death of Chrift\nwas a real sacrifice.\n\nSUPPLEMENT, in literature, an appendage to\nsupply what is wanting in a book. Books of various\nkinds require such an appendage; but none so much as\na dictionary of arts and sciences, which, from the pro-\ngressive course of physical science, cannot be completed\nwithout it.\n\nSUPPORTED, in Heraldry, a term applied to the\nuppermost quarters of a shield when divided into several\nquarters, these seeming as it were supported or sustained\nby those below. The chief is said to be supported when\nit is of two colours, and the upper colour takes up two-\nthirds of it. In this case it is supported by the colour\nunderneath.\n\nSUPPORTERS, in Heraldry, figures in an achieve-\nment placed by the side of the shield, and seeming to\nsupport or hold up the same. Supporters are chiefly\nfigures of beasts: figures of human creatures for the like\npurpose are called tenants.\n\nSUPPOSITION, in Music, is when one of the parts\ndwells on a note, while another part makes two or more\nlesser notes equivalent to it, by conjoint degrees.\n\nSupposition is defined by a late author the using of\ntwo succeeding notes, of the same value as the time; the\none whereof, being a discord, supposes the other a con-\ncord.\n\nThe harmony, Mr Malcolm observes, is always to be\nfull on the accented parts of the bar or measure; but,\non the unaccented, discords may transiently pass, with-\nout any offence to the ear. This transient use of dis-\ncords, followed by concords, make what we, after the\nFrench, call supposition.\n\nConcord by supposition are those where the conti-\nnued bass adds or supposes a new found below the fun-\ndamental bass; whence such concords always exceed the\nextent of the octave. Of these concords there are three\nsorts, all which are concords of the seventh: the first,\nwhen the added found is a third below the fundamental\nfound; such is the concord of the ninth: and if the\nconcord of the ninth is formed by the mediant, added\nbelow the sensible concord in the minor mode, then the\nconcord is called the superfluous fifth. The second kind\nis, when the supposed found is a fifth below the funda-\nmental found, as in the concord of the fourth or ele-\nventh; and if the concord be sensible, and the tonic be\nsupposed, this concord is called the superfluous seventh.\nThe third kind is that where the supposed found is be-\nlow a concord of the diminished seventh: if it is a fifth\nbelow, i.e. if the supposed found be the mediant, the\nconcord is called the concord of the fourth and super-\nfluous fifth: if it is a seventh below, i.e. if the supposed\nfound be the tonic, the concord is called the lesser sixth\nand superfluous seventh.\n\nSUPPOSITORY, a kind of medicated cone or ball,\nwhich is introduced into the anus for opening the belly.\nIt is usually composed of common honey, mixed up\nwith either soap or oil, and formed into pieces of the\nlength and thickness of the little finger, only pyrami-\ndal. To the composition is sometimes also added pow-\nder of scammony, euphorbium, colocynthis, falt, aloes,\n&c. according to the case of the patient.\n\nThe suppository was invented for the convenience of\nsuch as have an aversion to the taking of clysters; or\nto be used when the disease does not allow thereof.\n\nSUPPRESSION, in Medicine, is generally used to\nsignify a retention of urine or of the menes.\n\nSUPPURATION, the second way wherein an in-\nflammation terminates; being a conversion of the inflam-\nmated blood and the first adjacent parts, as the vellus and\nfat; into pus or matter; which disorder, when it has not\nyet found an opening, is generally called an abscess.\n\nSUPRACOSTALES, in Anatomy.

See SOVEREIGNTY.\n\nSUR, or SHUR, in Ancient Geography, a desert of\nArabia Petraea, extending between Palestine and the\nArabian gulf; into which the Israelites, after marching\nthrough the Red sea, first came (Exod. xv. 22.). Again (Numb. xxxiii. 8.), it is said, that from the sea they went three days journey into the Wilderness of Etham; whence some conclude that Etham and Shur are the same wilderness; or only differ as a part from the whole, Shur being the general name, and Etham that part of it lying nearest to the place of encampment of the same name. We know so little of the geography of these places, that there is more room for disputation than for decision. As to the route which the Israelites followed in their passage through the Red sea, Mr Bryant, we think, has given the most satisfactory account in his late work on the Plagues of Egypt.—Shur is now called Coronel.\n\nSURAT, a city of India, belonging to Britain, on the western coast of the peninsula, a little to the northward of Bombay, and about 16 miles up the river Tappee. It is but of modern date, and is a most remarkable instance of the power of trade to bring wealth and population to any spot where it can be brought to settle. Towards the middle of the 17th century, this place was only the resort of a few merchants, who, under the shelter of an old insignificant castle, laid the first foundations of a city now almost as large and fully as populous as London within the walls, and containing many fine buildings of Indian architecture, which is partly Gentoo and partly Moorish. Those of the greatest note are so contrived, that the gateway is defensible against any sudden irruption of a few armed men. The private apartments lie backwards for the convenience of the women, of whom the Moors are remarkably jealous. They are fond of having one room, in the midst of which a fountain keeps playing, and which, by its noise, lulls them to sleep, and refreshes the room by its coolness; but thus a damp is produced, which would be very dangerous to Europeans. They have also generally a falcon with fountains playing in it, which, with the variegated flower-beds, in which they are very curious, makes a beautiful prospect. During the intense heats of summer they have country retirements a little way out of town, where they reside, or go in parties to amuse themselves. The streets are irregularly laid out; but have one property which renders it agreeable to walk in them, viz. that a competent width being left at bottom, the upper stories of the houses project over one another in such a manner, that people may with ease converse from them; by which means the street is agreeably shaded, at the same time that a proper ventilation is not impeded, but rather promoted. The shops, notwithstanding the vast trade carried on in this great and populous city, have a very mean appearance, owing to the dealers keeping their goods in warehouses, and selling by samples.\n\nNo place is better supplied with provisions than the city of Surat while its communication with the country remains open. Besides the unbounded importation, by which every article is brought here in great abundance, the natural productions of the soil are excellent, though less cheap than in other parts of India, as at Bengal especially; yet in that place, though the cattle and poultry are bought originally at a very low rate, they turn out very dear by the time they are fed for the table. Here, however, all kinds of eatables may be had at a reasonable price, ready for immediate use, and as good as can be found anywhere. The wheat of Surat is famous all over India for its singular substance, whiteness, and taste; and its salads and roots are likewise of an excellent quality. There are also many kinds of wild-fowl and other game to be had at an easy rate; but for wines and spirituous liquors they depend mostly on importation.\n\nSurat was surrounded with a wall in a short time after it had assumed the form of a town. The fortification, however, was meant only to prevent the incursions of the Maharratas, who had twice pillaged it; so that the place was by no means capable of standing any regular siege. Even the cattle appears but a poor defence, being mounted with cannon here and there, without any order, or without anything like an attempt towards military architecture.\n\nIn this city, before the East India company became invested with the possession of Bombay, was the presidency of their affairs on the western coast. For this purpose they had a factory established there with great privileges by the Mogul government; and even after the presidency was established at Bombay, they continued a factory here at one of the best houses in the city; which yet not being spacious enough to contain their effects, they hired another at some distance from it, and nearer the water-side, which was called the new factory. In the mean time, the city flourished, and became the centre of all the Indian trade, being much more frequented for the sake of foreign merchandise than for either the natural productions or manufactures of the country, though they also made a considerable part of its commerce. In short, there was scarcely any article of merchandise but what was to be found at all times in Surat, almost as readily as in London itself. While the Mogul government was in its vigour, there was such a show of justice kept up, as induced merchants of all religions and denominations to take up their residence in the city. The Gentoo especially resorted thither, in order to avoid the oppressions of their own government. Great care indeed was taken that no very flagrant acts of oppression should be committed; so that, in what sometimes happened, appearances were at least kept up; and the oppressions of government were chiefly owing to the animosities and rivalryship of the merchants themselves. As an instance of the great extent to which commerce was pushed in Surat, we shall here quote from Mr Grofe, what is said by Captain Hamilton of a merchant named Abdulgafour, viz. \"That he drove a trade equal to the East India company: for he had known him fit out in a year above 20 sail of ships, between 300 and 800 tons, none of which had less of his own stock than 20,000l., and some of them 25,000l. After that foreign stock was sent away, it behoved him to have as much more of an inland stock for the following year's market.\" On the decease of this merchant, the government feigned a million of his money; and his grandson was not only deprived of all that he possessed, but barbarously murdered through the envy and treachery of his brother merchants, and the rapacity of the governor.\n\nThe city of Surat was taken and ruined by the Portuguese in 1520; and it was not till after this misfortune that it became such a celebrated emporium. All the Indian merchants who had been accustomed to trade thither contributed to re-establish it; but it was not till near a century after that it became the general staple of Indian\nIndian and European merchandise; when the Dutch Surcharge appearing in the Indian ocean, had deprived the Portuguese of all their conquests on that coast, and almost entirely ruined their trade. The English established a factory here in 1629, the Dutch in 1616, and the French in 1665. In process of time, the Indian seas being greatly infested by pirates, a naval officer was appointed by the Mogul to keep them in awe. This officer was named Siddee (a) Muffoot, who had been chief of an Ethiopian colony settled at Rajapore. Here he had collected some vessels of considerable force, and carried on some trade, till he was dispossessed by the Mahrattas; upon which he repaired to Bombay, and afterwards to Surat, where he was appointed admiral on that station to the Mogul, with a yearly revenue of about 36,000l. Sterling. Though he had no power, independent of the marine, he seized on the cattle, encroached on the town, and appropriated to himself a third part of its revenues, under pretence of arrears due in his appointed revenue. Another third was paid to the Mahrattas, to prevent their depredations upon trade in the open country; but they, not satisfied with this stipulation, watched an opportunity to plunder the town, which was kept in subjection by Siddee Muffoot, till his death which happened in 1756.\n\nSiddee Muffoot was succeeded by his son, who soon rendered himself very disagreeable to the inhabitants. In 1758 the English factory was greatly opprobried by him, and the black merchants treated still worse; on which the latter applied to Mr Ellis the English chief at that time, desiring him to recommend it to the presidency of Bombay to take the cattle by force out of the hands of the usurper. This proposal proving agreeable, Admiral Pococke, who was then with his squadron at Bombay, readily concurred in supporting the expedition. The enterprise was conducted with the usual success attending the British arms; and Captain Mainland the conductor took possession of the cattle with its revenue in name of the East India company, who were confirmed in the government by grants from the Mogul.\n\nSURCHARGE OF THE FOREST, is when a commoner puts more beasts in the forest than he has a right to. See Forest.\n\nSURCHARGE of Common, is a disturbance of common of pasture, by putting more cattle therein than the pasture and herbage will sustain, or the party hath a right to do. This injury can only happen where the common is appendant or appurtenant, and of course limitable by law; or where, when in grofs, it is expressly limited and certain; for where a man hath common in grofs, sans nombre, or without stint, he cannot be a surcharge. In this case indeed there must be left sufficient for the lord's own beasts.\n\nThe usual remedies for surcharging the common are by the lord's distraining the surplus number, or by his bringing an action of trespass, or by a special action on the case, in which any commoner may be plaintiff. The ancient and most effectual method of proceeding is by writ of admeasurement of pasture.\n\nWrit of Second SURCHARGE, de secunda superonera-\n\n(A) When the Abyssinian slaves are promoted to any office under the Mogul government, they are called Siddees.\nduced on it any perceptible effect. Sumatra, though not continually exposed to the south-east trade-wind, is not so distant but that its influence may be presumed to extend to it; and accordingly at Poolo Pefang, near the southern extremity of the island, a constant southerly sea is observed, even after a strong north-west wind. This incessant and powerful swell rolling in from an ocean, open even to the pole, seems an agent adequate to the prodigious effects produced on the coast; whilst its very size contributes to its being overlooked. It reconciles almost all the difficulties which the phenomena seem to present, and in particular it accounts for the decrease of the surf during the north-west monsoon, the local wind then counteracting the operation of the general one; and it is corroborated by an observation, that the surfs on the Sumatran coast ever begin to break at their southern extreme the motion of the swell not being perpendicular to the direction of the shore. This explanation of the phenomena is certainly plausible; but, as the author candidly acknowledges, objections may be urged to it. The trade-winds and the swell occasioned by them are remarkably steady and uniform; but the surfs are much the reverse. How then comes an uniform cause to produce unsteady effects?\n\nIn the opinion of our author it produces no unsteady effects. The irregularity of the surfs, he says, is perceived only within the remoter limits of the trade-winds. But the equatorial parts of the earth performing their diurnal revolution with greater velocity than the rest, a larger circle being described in the same time, the waters thereabout, from the stronger centrifugal force, may be supposed more buoyant; to feel less restraint from the sluggish principle of matter; to have less gravity; and therefore to be more obedient to external impulses of every kind, whether from the winds or any other cause.\n\nSURFACE. See SUPERFICIES.\n\nSURFEIT, in Medicine, a sickness with a sensation of a load at the stomach, usually proceeding from some error in diet, either with regard to the quantity or quality of the food taken. Sometimes, however, a surfeit is only a plethora from indolence and full diet: in which case periphrasis is defective; and eruptions appear on the skin.\n\nSURGERY.\n\nThe term surgery has been usually employed to signify that part of medicine which treats of the diseases of the human body which are to be cured or alleviated by the hand, by instruments, or by external applications.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nMedicine and surgery, formerly regarded as one and the same science, were exercised by the same persons during the most remote ages; and their separation, such as now generally exists, is to be considered as a modern institution. If we consider their origin and end, the knowledge which the practitioner of each requires, and the connection which naturally subsists between the diseases which are supposed peculiarly to belong to each department, it is probable that the first practitioners confounded them with one another; and it is easy to conceive how the same ideas should have passed from one generation to another. At last, however, the knowledge of the healing art being greatly enlarged, it became necessary to separate it into different classes, and to form it into distinct departments in practice. Accordingly there were not only some who confined themselves to surgery, but there were lithotomists, phlebotomists, oculists, aurists, dentists, &c.\n\nWe do not propose here to enter into any detail in attempting to show how this separation was made, and still less to make mention of the puerile disputes regarding the pre-eminence of medicine to surgery. There are...\nare few we believe who in our days do not feel that such a pre-eminence does not exist in nature; that medicine and surgery are one and the same science; that they are coeval with the human race; and to those who are able to appreciate them, they must appear of equal utility and importance. The healing art is one, its principles ought to be the same throughout, and the exercise of its different branches supposes the same fundamental knowledge; but it offers so the detail such a vast field for study, that few men are able to embrace the whole, and to cultivate all the parts with equal success. It becomes, therefore, an advantage to society that such parts as can be easily separated in practice be exercised by different individuals; and that a man who has acquired a general knowledge of the structure, functions, and diseases of the animal economy, practice in such departments as he finds his talents and acquirements point out.\n\nSome have opposed surgery to medicine by qualifying the first with the name of art, and in giving to the second that of science. To pretend that surgery is nothing but the art of treating diseases by external means or by manual operations, is to rank it among the mechanical professions; and to consider as a good surgeon, the man who can dress an ulcer, apply a bandage, reduce a fracture, amputate a limb, or perform such like operations, on the living body. We have already mentioned that the healing art is the same in all its branches; the internal organs of the body in a state of health are governed by the same general laws, and many of them are analogous in structure to the external parts; and the nature of a local disease can never be understood if we are not acquainted with all the deviations from the natural state, of which the whole animal system is susceptible. If a physician be called to treat a plague, he cannot expect to do it with success unless he have a sufficiently clear idea of the nature of inflammation, or at least of the principal symptoms which characterize it; of its consequences, and of the proper mode of applying the means to remove it. This knowledge is not less necessary to the surgeon who is called to treat an wound, the management of which depends chiefly on the precautions necessary to prevent and remove inflammation in the affected parts, without at the same time weakening too much the vital powers. The knowledge of the physician does not merit more the name of science, than that of the surgeon who is well acquainted with the functions of the animal economy, with morbid structure, and with the progress and termination of diseases.\n\nThe student of surgery has therefore to acquire, not only all that knowledge necessary for the well educated physician, but he has likewise to learn the manner of performing surgical operations. This, though no doubt an essential requisite to the surgeon, is by no means so important as a competent knowledge of those diseases and states of disease which require such means; and the young surgeon should endeavour not to cherish that love of operating which is observed in some, and which arises from the eclat which a dexterous operator generally receives.\n\nTo become an intelligent and expert operator, several qualifications are necessary; and some of these fall to the lot of few individuals. There are many people, whom, though they have acquired an extensive knowledge of diseases, have not that calmness of mind, that collectedness of thought, which is necessary for a good operator; and there are some who are even deficient in that mechanical dexterity, which, though not requisite in all, is yet necessary in several of the operations in surgery. These talents, however, are never given in such perfection as not to require cultivation. An early habit of being present, and of assisting at operations, prepares the student to act for himself; and a long and unremitting habit of using the knife, and of performing operations on the dead body, gives a facility in all the mechanical part of them, which even experience on the living body does not procure.\n\nHistory of Surgery.\n\nThat surgery was coeval with the other branches of medicine, or perhaps antecedent to any of them, will not admit of doubt. The wars and contentions which have taken place among mankind almost ever since their creation, necessarily imply that there would be occasion for surgeons at a very early period; and probably external injuries would for some time be the only diseases for which a cure would be attempted, or perhaps thought practicable. In the sacred writings we find much mention of balsams, particularly the balm of Gilead, as excellent in the cure of wounds; though at the same time we are informed that there were some wounds which this balm could not heal.\n\nConcerning the surgery practiced among the Egyptians, Jews, and Asiatic nations, we know little. The art descended from the Greeks to us, though they confessedly received it from the eastern nations. The first Greek surgeons on record are Æsculapius and his sons Podalirius and Machaon. Æsculapius flourished about 50 years before the Trojan war; and his two sons distinguished themselves in that war both by their valour and by their skill in curing wounds. This indeed is the whole of the medical skill attributed to them by Homer; for in the plague which broken out in the Grecian camp, he does not mention their being at all consulted. Nay, what is still more strange, though he sometimes mentions his heroes having their bones broke, he never takes notice of their being reduced or cured by any other than supernatural means; as in the case of Æneas, whose thigh-bone was broken by a stone cast at him by Diomed. The methods which these two famous surgeons used in curing the wounds of their fellow soldiers, seems to have been the extracting or cutting out the darts which inflicted them, and applying emollient fomentations or styptics to them when necessary; and to these they undoubtedly attributed much more virtue than they could possibly possess; as appears from the following lines, where Homer describes Euryalus as wounded and under the hands of Patroclus, who would certainly practise according to the directions of the surgeons.\n\nPatroclus cut the forked steel away;\nThen in his hand a bitter root he bruised,\nThe wound he wash'd, the styptic juice infused.\nThe cloathing fleth that instant ceased to glow;\nThe wound to torture, and the blood to flow.\n\nTill the days of Hippocrates we know very little of what was the practice of the Greek surgeons. From him, however, we learn, that the practice of blood-letting, cupping, and scarification, was known to them; al-\nSurgery.\n\nHistory. So the use of warm and emollient fomentations, flues made with hot irons, pellacies, injections, fumigations, &c. Hippocrates also gives directions with regard to fractures, luxations, ulcers, fistulas. He directs the extension, reduction, bandages, and splints, proper to be used in fractures and luxations of different bones, with several machines to increase the extension when necessary. He directs the laxity and tightness of the bandages; the intervals for unloosing and binding them on again; the position and repose of the fractured member, and the proper regimen; and he mentions the time when a callus is usually formed. He treats also of fractures of the skull, and the method of applying the trepan. In his treatment of ulcers, he speaks of reducing fungous flesh by means of echarotic, some of which are alum, nitre, verdigris, quicklime, &c.\n\nSurgery appears not to have existed in Rome, notwithstanding the warlike genius of the people, for more than 500 years. Archagathus, a Greek, was the first professor of the art in that city; and so frequently employed the knife, hot irons, and other cruel methods of cure, that he was branded with the opprobrious title of carnifex, and expelled the city, where no physician or surgeon of eminence again made his appearance for 180 years. At this time Aesculapius undertook the profession of medicine; but seems to have dealt little in surgery. Neither have we any thing of importance on that subject till the time of Celsus, who flourished during the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius.—In his work on surgery, all the improvements from Hippocrates to his own days are collected; the most minute and trifling diseases are not omitted. An eminent surgeon, of the moderns, emphatically exhorts every person in that profession “to keep Celsus in his hands by day and by night.” He describes the signs of a fractured skull, the method of examining for the fracture, of laying the skull bare by an incision in the form of the letter X, and afterwards of cutting away the angles, and of applying the trepan, mentioning also the signs of danger and of recovery. He observed, that sometimes, though very rarely, a fatal concussion of the brain might happen from the blood-vessels within the skull being burst, the bone remaining entire. After the operation of the trepan, sponges and cloths wetted with vinegar, and several other applications, were made to the head; and, throughout, severe abstinence was enjoined. In violent fractures of the ribs, he ordered venefication; low diet; to guard against all agitation of the mind, loud speaking, motion, and every thing that might excite coughing or sneezing. Cloths wetted with wine, roes and oil, and other applications, were laid over the fracture. The cure of fractures, in the upper and lower extremities, he said were nearly alike; that fractures differ in degree of violence and danger, in being simple or compound, that is, with or without a wound of the flesh, and in being near to the joint. He directs the extension of the member by afflatus; the reduction, by the surgeon’s hands, of the fractured bones into their natural situation; and to bind the fractured part with bandages of different lengths, previously dipped in wine and oil; on the third day fresh bandages are to be applied, and the fractured member fomented with warm vapour, especially during the inflammation. Splints, if necessary, are to be applied, to retain the bones in a fixed position. The fractured arm is to be suspended in a broad sling hung round the neck: the fractured leg is to be inclosed in a kind of case, reaching above the ham, and accommodated likewise with a support to the foot, and with straps at the side, to keep the leg steady: in the fractured thigh-bone, the case is to extend from the top of the hip to the foot. He describes the method of treating compound fractures, and of removing small fragments of splinters of bones; and the manner of extracting darts. In luxations of the shoulder, he mentions several methods of giving force to the extension, and of replacing the dislocated bone. One method similar to that of Hippocrates was, to suspend the patient by the arm; the fore part of the shoulder, at the same time, resting upon the top of a door, or any other such firm structure. Another method was to lay the patient supine, some afflatus retaining the body in a fixed position, and others extending the arm in the contrary direction; the surgeon, in the mean time, attempting, by his hands, forcibly to reduce the bone into its former place.\n\nIf a large inflammation was expected to ensue after a wound, it was suffered to bleed for some time, and blood was drawn from the arm. To wounds accompanied with considerable hemorrhage, he applied a sponge wet in vinegar, and constant pressure: if necessary, on account of the violence of the hemorrhage, ligatures were made round the vessels, and sometimes the bleeding orifice was seared up with the point of a hot iron. On the third day fresh dressings were applied. In considerable contusions, with a small wound of the flesh, if neither blood-vessels nor nerves prevented, the wound was to be enlarged. Abstinence and low diet, upon all such accidents, were prescribed; cloths wet with vinegar, and several other applications, were to be applied to the inflamed part. He observes, that fresh wounds may be healed without compound applications. In external gangrene, he cut into the sound flesh; and when the disease, in spite of every effort, spread, he advised amputation of the member. After cutting to the bone, the flesh was then separated from it, and drawn back, in order to save as much flesh as possible to cover the extremity of the bone. Celsus, though extremely diffuse in the description of surgical diseases, and of various remedies and external applications, treats lightly of the method of amputating; from which, comparing his treatise with the modern systems, we might infer that the operation was then seldom practised than at present. He describes the symptoms of that dangerous inflammation the carbuncle, and directs immediately to burn or corrode the gangrened part. To promote the suppuration of abscesses, he orders poultices of barley-meal, or of marshmallows, or the seeds of linseed and fenugreek. He also mentions the compositions of several repellent cataplasm. In the erysipelas, he applies ceruse, mixed with the juice of folanum or nightshade. Sal ammoniac was sometimes mixed with his plasters.\n\nHe is very minute in describing diseases of the eyes, ears, and teeth, and in prescribing a multitude of remedies and applications. In inflammation of the eyes, he enjoined abstinence, and low diet, rest, and a dark room: if the inflammation was violent, with great pain, he ordered venefication, and a purgative; a small poultice of fine flower, saffron, and the white of an egg, to be laid to the forehead to suppress the flow of pituita;\nthe soft inside of warm wheat bread dipped in wine, to be laid to the eye; poppy and roses were also added to his collyriums, and various ingredients too tedious to enumerate. In chronic watery defluxions of the eyes, he applied astringents, cupped the temples, and burnt the veins over the temple and forehead. He couched cataracts by depressing the crystalline lens to the bottom of the orbit. Teeth, loosened by any accident, he directs, after the example of Hippocrates, to be fastened with a gold thread to those adjoining on each side. Previous to drawing a tooth, he ordered the gum to be cut round its neck; and if the tooth was hollow, it was to be filled with lead before extraction, to prevent its breaking by the forces. He describes not only the inflammation, but likewise the elongation, of the uvula; he also describes the polypus, and some other diseases affecting the nose.\n\nHe describes several species of hernia or rupture, and the manual assistance required in those complaints. After the return of the intestines into the abdomen, a firm compress was applied to that part of the groin through which they protruded, and was secured by a bandage round the loins. In some cases, after the return of intestinal ruptures, he diminished the quantity of loose skin, and formed a cicatrix, so as to contract over the part, to render it more rigid and capable of resisting. He describes various diseases of the genital parts, the hydrocele or drop of the scrotum, a difficulty of urine, and the manner of drawing off the water by a catheter; the signs of stone in the bladder, and the method of founding or feeling for that stone. Lithotomy was at that time performed by introducing two fingers into the anus; the stone was then pressed forward to the perineum, and a cut made into the bladder; and by the finger or by a scoop the stone was extracted. He describes the manner of performing this operation on both the sexes, of treating the patient, and the signs of recovery and of danger.\n\nCelsus directed various corrosive applications and injections to fistulas; and, in the last extremity, opened them to the bottom with a knife, cutting upon a grooved instrument or conductor. In old callous ulcers, he made a new wound, by either cutting away the hard edges, or corroding them with verdigris, quicklime, alum, nitre, and with some vegetable elastics. He mentions the symptoms of caries in the bone; directs the bone to be laid bare, and to be pierced with several holes, or to be burnt or rasped, in order to promote an exfoliation of the corrupted part; afterwards to apply nitre and several other ingredients. One of his applications to a cancer was auripigmentum or arsenic. He directs the manner of tapping the abdomen in ascites, and of drawing blood by the lancet and cupping-glasses. His cupping-glasses seem not to have been so convenient as the modern: they were made either of brass or horn, and were unprovided with a pump. He cured varicose veins by suction or by incision. He gives directions for extracting the dead fetus from the womb, in whatever position it should present; and, after delivery, to apply to the private parts soft cloths wet in an infusion of vinegar and roses. In Celsus's works there is a great redundancy and superfluity of plasters, ointments, etc., charactories, collyriums, of suppuration and discutent cataplasm, and external applications of every kind, both simple and compound: Perhaps, amongst the multitude, there are a few useful remedies now laid aside and neglected.\n\nThe last writer of consequence who flourished at Rome was Galen, physician to the emperor Marcus Aurelius. His works are for the most part purely medical; although he wrote also on surgery, and made Commentaries on the Surgery of Hippocrates. He opened the jugular veins and performed arteriotomy at the temples; directed leeches, scarification, and cupping-glasses, to draw blood. He also described with accuracy the different species of hernia or ruptures.\n\nIn the year 500 flourished Aëtius, in whose works we meet with many observations omitted by Celsus and Galen, particularly on the surgical operations, the diseases of women, the causes of difficult labours, and modes of delivery. He also takes notice of the dracunculus, or Guinea worm. Aëtius, however, is greatly excelled by Paulus Aegineta, who flourished in 640; whose treatise on surgery is superior to that of all the other ancients. He directs how to extract darts; to perform the operation sometimes required in dangerous cases of rupture or hernia. He treats also of aneurism. Galen, Paulus, and all the ancients, speak only of one species of aneurism, and define it to be \"a tumor arising from arterial blood extravasated from a ruptured artery.\" The aneurism from a dilatation of the artery is a discovery of the moderns. In violent inflammations of the throat, where immediate danger of suffocation was threatened, Paulus performed the operation of bronchotomy. In obstinate defluxions upon the eyes, he opened the jugular veins. He describes the manner of opening the arteries behind the ears in chronic pains of the head. He wrote also upon midwifery. Fabricius ab Aquapendente, a celebrated surgeon of the 16th century, has followed Celsus and Paulus as text books.\n\nFrom the time of Paulus Aegineta to the year 900, no writer of any consequence, either on medicine or surgery, appeared. At this time the Arabian physicians Rhazes and Avicenna revived in the east the medical art, which, as well as others, was almost entirely extinguished in the west. Avicenna's Canon Medicinae, or General System of Medicine and Surgery, was for many ages celebrated through all the schools of physic. It was principally compiled from the writings of Galen and Rhazes. The latter had correctly described the spina ventosa, accompanied with an enlargement of the bone, caries, and acute pain. In difficult labours, he recommends the fillet to assist in the extraction of the fetus; and for the same purpose, Avicenna recommends the forceps. He describes the composition of several cosmetics to polish the skin, and make the hair grow, or fall off.\n\nNotwithstanding this, however, it was not till the time of Albucasis that surgery came into repute among the Arabs. Rhazes complains of their gross ignorance, and that the manual operations were performed by the physicians servants. Albucasis enumerates a tremendous list of operations, sufficient to fill us with horror. The hot iron and cauteries were favourite remedies of the Arabs; and, in inveterate pains, they repented, like the Egyptians and eastern Asiatics, great confidence in burning the part. He describes accurately the manner of tapping in abscesses; mentions several kinds of instruments for drawing blood; and has left a more ample and correct delineation of surgical instruments.\nments than any of the ancients. He gives various obstetrical directions for extracting the fetus in cases of difficult labour. He mentions the bronchocele, or prominent tumor on the neck, which, he tells us, was most frequent among the female sex. We are also informed by this writer, that the delicacy of the Arabian women did not permit male surgeons to perform lithotomy on females; but when necessary, it was executed by one of their own sex.\n\nFrom the 11th century to the middle of the 14th, the history of surgery affords nothing remarkable except the importation of that nauseous disease leprosy into Europe. Towards the end of the 15th century the venereal disease is said to have been imported from America by the first discoverers of that continent.\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, surgery was held in contempt in this island, and was practised indiscriminately by barbers, farriers, and sow-gelders. Barbers and surgeons continued, for 200 years after, to be incorporated in one company both in London and Paris. In Holland and some parts of Germany, even at this day, barbers exercise the razor and lancet alternately.\n\nIt is within the last three centuries that we have any considerable improvement in surgery; nor do we know of any eminent British surgical writers until within the last 150 years. \"In Germany (says Heister) all the different surgical operations, at the beginning even of the 18th century, were left to empirics; while regular practitioners were contented to cure a wound, open a vein or an abscess, return a fractured or luxated bone; but they seldom or never ventured to perform any of the difficult operations.\" He also speaks of their gross ignorance of the Latin language.\n\nThe first surgical work of the 16th century worthy of notice is that of J. Carpus. F. ab Aquapendente, an Italian, published a System of Surgery, containing a description of the various diseases, accidents, and operations. Boerhaave pays this author the following compliment: \"Ille superavit omnes, et nemo illi hanc disputat gloriam; omnibus potius quam hocce carere peffimus.\"\n\nAbout the same period, A. Parey, a Frenchman, made several important additions to surgery, particularly in his collection of cases of wounds, fractures, and other accidents which occur during war. The ancients, who were ignorant of powder and fire-arms, are defective in this part of military surgery. Parey pretends to have first invented the method of tying with a needle and strong silk-thread waxed the extremities of large arteries, after the amputation of a member. The ligation of the blood-vessels is, however, merely a revival of the ancient practice, which had fallen into disuse: Throughout the dark ages, the hot iron, cauteries, and strong astringents, were substituted in its place. B. Muggius and L. Botellus wrote on the cure of gunshot wounds. J. A. Cruce wrote a system of surgery.\n\nIn the 17th century, surgery was enriched with several systems, and with detached or miscellaneous observations. The principal authors are, M. A. Severinus, V. Vidius, R. Wifeman, Le Clere, J. Sculletus, J. Mangetus, C. Magnus, Spigellius, F. Hildanus, T. Bartholin, P. de Marchett.\n\nDuring the last century, surgery, like all the other sciences, made more rapid progress toward perfection, than during all the preceding periods. This partly arose from the assistance of governments in the different countries. They being convinced that anatomy is one of the most necessary sciences, and the groundwork of the whole healing art, but particularly of surgery, in many great cities academies were instituted for the cultivation of practical anatomy; and schools were also established for the instruction of the theoretical and practical parts of surgery.\n\nThese improvements in surgery have been chiefly made in England, France, and Germany; and in all these countries a number of very eminent men have appeared.\n\nThe English surgeons, besides possessing an accurate knowledge of anatomy, and great abilities in the operative part of their profession, were the first who endeavoured to bring the art to its present simplicity. They directed also their attention, in a particular manner, to the diet of patients; the neglect of which had caused the unfortunate issue of many operations which had been dexterously performed.\n\nAmong the surgeons of later times, we may first mention the name of Sharp. He was a scholar of Chefielden, and one of the best surgeons of his day. He wrote a Compendium of Surgical Operations, 1746; and also a Critical Inquiry into the State of Surgery; both of which works are still in high estimation.\n\nIn the year 1719, Dr Monro, after visiting the schools of London, Paris, and Leyden, where he was a pupil of the great Boerhaave, came to Edinburgh; and this may be considered as the date of the foundation of the Edinburgh medical school. He began by giving lectures on anatomy and surgery, the first which were delivered in Edinburgh; and in the year 1721 he was appointed professor of anatomy and surgery to the university. This eminent anatomist and surgeon, besides filling his chair with the greatest reputation, contributed to the advancement of our knowledge in many important parts of anatomy and surgery. His works, published by his son, besides his Treatise on Osteology, which is certainly the best description of the bones that has ever been given, will be found to contain many interesting and valuable observations on various surgical diseases.\n\nJoseph Warner, surgeon of Guy's Hospital, in London, published his Cases and Remarks in Surgery, in the year 1754, a work which contains many very important practical remarks. He afterwards published a very good work, containing a description of the human eye and its adjacent parts, in which he particularly rejects the faltering of the eye during the operation of cataract. He also published An Account of the Telescopes, their Common Coverings and Coats, &c.\n\nPercival Pott, surgeon of St Bartholomew's Hospital, may be justly considered as one of the principal English surgeons of his time. He was not only a successful practitioner, but an industrious and excellent writer. The merits of Pott are indeed considerable. He threw much light on the doctrine of wounds of the head, by his accurate arrangement of the different kinds of injuries to which the head is subject. He also gives a good account of hydrocele and the other diseases of the testicle. For the operation of the fistula in ano, he made material improvements. He has given many useful hints on fractures and dislocations; and he was a great champion in favour of the operation for cataract by coining. He was the first person who described the chimney-sweeps\nHistory sweeps cancer; and on hernia, polypus, and curvatures of the spine, he has made many judicious pathological and practical observations.\n\nCharles White, surgeon in Manchester, published an excellent practical work in the year 1770, in which he recommends amputation of the foot, a little above the ankle joint, instead of under the knee, as had usually been practised. He also shows the effect of sawing off the ends of bones; and discusses several other interesting points in surgery. In the same year, Mr Elle of St Thomas's Hospital, published his treatise on the hydrocele, in which he recommends the use of cautery in the cure of that disease.\n\nIn the year 1770, Mr Deane, of Dublin, wrote an excellent treatise on the wounds of the head. Mr Bromfield, of St George's Hospital, and Mr Hill, surgeon at Dumfries, also distinguished themselves; Mr Bromfield for his Chirurgical Observations, and Mr Hill for his Observations on Cancers.\n\nIn the year 1778, Mr Benjamin Bell published the first volume of his System of Surgery. The reputation of this work was soon such, that it was translated into the French and German languages; and it has since gone through several editions in these, and many in English.\n\nThis work presented the most complete system of surgery which had ever appeared; and in every part of it there is displayed a talent for practical observation and clearness of thought which must render it even a useful and valuable present to surgery. Like all such extensive works, it is not without faults, and the language in which it is written is in some places prolix and diffuse; but notwithstanding its errors, it certainly must be considered as the most useful body of surgery that has ever yet appeared in this country.\n\nBesides these, mention must be made of two other eminent surgeons, William and John Hunter; the former rendered immortal by his splendid work on the gravid uterus, and the latter by his treatise on the venereal disease, and his treatise on the blood, inflammation, and gun-shot wounds.\n\nMany very eminent men arose, both in France and Germany, during the last century. The transactions of their academies leave a lasting monument of their zeal and industry.\n\nIn France we have the names of Petit, Arnaud, Garangeot, Morand, Le Dran, Le Cat, Louis, David Levret, Le Blanc, Da la Faye, David Chopart, Deflault, Janin, Jourdain, Pouteau, André Lombard Wenfel.\n\nIn Germany, surgery has been enriched by the works of Vogel, Platner, Albert Haller, Bilguer, Weitz, Seibold, Brambilla, Theden, Smucker, Stork, Pleun, Hennflam, Rougemont, Conradi, and many others.\n\nMost authors who have written systems of surgery have described diseases according to the parts of the body where they were situated; beginning with the head, and describing the parts in succession, according to their situation.\n\nBesides this mode of arrangement being unphilosophical, it has many serious disadvantages. Diseases which have no analogy to each other, are treated of in the same place; and similar diseases are treated of separately, instead of being classified together, and considered in one general point of view. A repetition of what may be considered as the specific characters of the disease, therefore, is constantly occurring. The utility of nosological systems in practical medicine and in pathology, has been very generally acknowledged. Diseases which have common characters are thus brought together and are arranged under classes, orders, genera, and species. It is to be considered, therefore, as an important step in order to facilitate the knowledge of the diseases of the human body, and to give clear and distinct ideas of them; for it is equally important, to be able to distinguish diseases, as to point out how they should be treated.\n\nAll nosological writers have not, however, constructed their systems on similar principles; and their efforts have been often frustrated by the false theories and hypotheses with which they have let out.\n\nThe world is indebted to the ingenious and celebrated Bichat, for the first truly philosophical view of the structure of the human body. The simple division of it into its component parts, which that great anatomist and philosopher pointed out, must be considered as the groundwork of all future anatomical and pathological inquiries.\n\nBichat demonstrated, that most of the organs of our body are made up of a variety of elementary parts or textures; each of which, in whatever part of the body it is found, uniformly has the same physical properties, and present the same morbid phenomena. These he considers as the elementary parts; which, by the diversity of their combinations, produce all the modifications of structure and functions exhibited in the different organs of animals. This method of considering organized bodies, accords with every phenomenon with which we are acquainted, and seems to arise from the essential nature of their constitution. We may trace this view of the structure of the body in the observations of many of the older anatomists; and particularly it may be considered as the basis of some of the most ingenious philosophical theories of the late ingenious Mr John Hunter.\n\nIn order to fix the characters of the elementary textures, Bichat employed various modes of inquiry. He performed numerous experiments on living animals; persevered in tedious and minute dissections; employed chemical reagents to supply the place of the knife; and examined with minuteness all the varieties of morbid structure. Having by these means accomplished his object in tracing the character of each separate texture, he proceeded next to investigate their combinations as they are found in the different organs.\n\nThe effects of this mode of investigating the structure of the human body when diseased, must be at once obvious. We learn from it, that diseases at their commencement are generally confined to one texture of an organ; the other textures of which the organ is composed remaining sound.\n\nThere is no organ of the body from which this important truth may not be deduced. It may be readily illustrated from considering the diseases of the mucous, ferosus, and muscular textures, which compose the stomach and alimentary canal; of the cellular texture of the lungs; of the mucous membrane of the bronchi, the ferosus one of the pleura, and many others.\n\nBut diseases are not only confined to one individual texture of any organ, as in the cases just mentioned; the symptoms and morbid changes are likewise uniformly the same in textures of a similar structure, in whatever parts,\nThus the feros membranes which invest the lungs, the brain, the heart, the abdominal viscera, have one common character when affected with any specific disease: so also have the mucous membranes, whether we trace them in the mouth, the nose, the vagina, the urethra, or covering the eye-ball; and the same may be observed of every individual texture which enters into the composition of our bodies.\n\nBesides the symptoms and morbid changes which are common to all textures whose structure is similar in the natural state, there are others which are determined from the particular functions of the organ in which the diseased texture exists. For example, when any of the feros membranes are inflamed, the nature of the pain, the degree of fever, and the duration of the symptoms, are the same, in whichever one it may have taken place. But to these symptoms are added, cough, difficulty of breathing, &c., when it happens to be connected with the organs of respiration, as in the case of pleuritis; colicines, strangury, delirium, loss of vision, when the intestines, the bladder, the brain, or the eye, are involved in the disease.\n\nThis view of the subject naturally suggests a correspondent division of the symptoms. The first class are general, and characterize a whole genus of textures; the second are in a manner accessory, and depend upon the relative situation or the particular functions of the organ into the composition of which the affected texture enters.\n\nBut here we must set bounds to this theory;—the history and progress of diseases shew, that we ought not to confine our observations within such narrow limits. The principles which have been stated, indeed, account admirably well for the propagation of some affections; and for some of the sympathies which subsist between different parts of the body; but there are other disorders which advance in a very different manner. In some diseases which are termed chronic, for example, the whole structure of an organ becomes gradually altered, although the primary affection was confined to one of its component textures. This is often to be observed in cancer, scrofula, lues venerea, &c. When cancer attacks the mamma, it is at its commencement generally confined to a small portion of that gland; but if allowed to proceed, it ultimately involves the whole gland, and the adjacent cellular and cutaneous textures, in one mass of disease.\n\nThese general observations will be sufficient to give an outline of the principles of a pathological system, founded on the basis of anatomical knowledge; and in giving an account of these diseases which more properly belong to a system of surgery, we have ventured to apply these principles. We shall, in the first place, therefore, consider the diseases of the cellular membrane; the diseases of the skin; of the mucous, feros, and fibrous membranes; of bone and cartilage; of the vascular and nervous systems; and of the glands. In the second place, we shall treat of diseases which occur only in particular organs, whether from the peculiarity of their structure or functions: such are the diseases of the eyes, ears, nose, teeth, mouth, and fauces, and the organs of urine and generation. In the third place, we shall take notice of malformations, distortions, and protrusions; and in the last place, of wounds, fractures, dislocations, and such operations as are occasionally necessary to be performed on different parts of the body, as amputation, sutures, &c.\n\nCHAP. I.\nOf the Diseases of the Cellular Membrane.\n\nSect. I. General Remarks on the Pathology of the Cellular Membrane.\n\nThe cellular membrane is distinguished from other organs, by the power which it has of throwing out granulations, by its being capable of elongation, of reproduction, and of growth when it has been divided or cut by any means.*\n\nSuppuration also takes place in the cellular membrane, with a rapidity of which we have few examples in other textures. The fluid which is the result of this suppuration, is well known. Its colour, its consistence, and all its external qualities, have become the criterion by which we form our ideas of pus; in consequence of which, all discharges which do not resemble it, have been commonly considered as pus of a bad kind, or as fancies. This opinion, however, is false; and has been formed in consequence of a too superficial view of the different circumstances attending different kinds of discharged fluids. Certainly the pus which is discharged from a bone, from a muscle, from the skin in erysipelas, from the mucous membranes in catarrh, is of a good kind whenever the inflammation runs through regularly its different periods, and notwithstanding it is quite different in all these cases from the pus produced by suppuration of the cellular membrane. As the latter is most frequently observed, from it we have formed an idea of laudable pus, and of fancies. The cutaneous pus, the mucous pus, the offensive pus, &c. have all their proper fancies; which differ from one another as much as the natural structure and functions of the organs from which they are produced.\n\nThere are few parts of the body which have a greater number of exhalents than the cellular membrane; and this exposes it to a number of alterations of structure, such as being preternaturally distended by the different substances which it exhales; these presenting a solid appearance, and sometimes producing a lardy substance, sometimes a gelatinous matter, and sometimes a much firmer and harder mass. The numerous absorbent vessels which are also distributed on the cellular membrane, is another cause of various diseases; every small cell being a reservoir common to the exhalents which terminate in it, and to the absorbents which arise from it.\n\nThere are some diseases, too, which produce a change in the elasticity and powers of diffusion, which the cellular membrane naturally possesses. In health it has enormous powers of diffusion, as may be observed in emphysema and in anaerobiosis; and whenever these causes are removed, it regains its natural bulk and form. In inflammations, this property is in part destroyed, and it happens also in many of the different indurations to which it is liable. Its elasticity is also less remarkable in people advanced in life, than in children. When an old man becomes rapidly thin, the skin becomes flacid, and formed...\nThe cellular membrane, when diseased, becomes sometimes extremely sensitive, and the seat of acute pain, though it seems to possess no sensibility in its natural state. When either blood, milk, or lymph, are effused in it, its sensibility is not altered, and these fluids are absorbed. On the contrary, the sensibility is so much altered by the contact of urine, of bile, of saliva, and of the other fluids destined to be thrown out of the body, that often the inflammation which succeeds the effusion prevents their absorption.\n\nAs the cellular membrane enters into the composition of every organ, it is often difficult to distinguish in different cases what belongs to it from what is the attribute of the parts with which it is found. These connections, however, become manifest under several circumstances; in acute and chronic diseases it is very susceptible of being influenced by the disease of the organs. We do not speak here of the alterations produced from juxtaposition and continuity, but of those which arise in parts of the cellular membrane which have no known connection with the affected organ.\n\nIn acute diseases which affect a particular organ, as the lungs, stomach, intestines, &c., often the cellular membrane becomes sympathetically affected and the seat of inflammation and abscesses, &c. The greater number of critical abscesses arise from this connection which exists between the organ affected and the cellular membrane. In acute diseases too it is commonly the function of exhalation or absorption of the cellular membrane that is affected, and hence the sudden edema which often accompanies them. In chronic diseases their influence is no less remarkable. It is well known, that in chronic diseases of the heart, of the lungs, of the liver, of the stomach, kidneys, uterus, &c., they have for their symptom during their last stages an anaemia, more or less general, which arises from a debility produced in the cellular system.\n\nWe observe, that in all acute diseases, the skin receives with great facility the sympathetic influence of the diseased organ, and that it is alternately moist and dry frequently during the same day. It is by no means improbable that the cellular membrane undergoes alterations analogous to those of the skin; and if we could observe what passes in it, we would discover the cells more or less moist, more or less dry, according as it happened to be influenced; it is also to this that we ought to attribute the different state of the cellular membrane, in patients who have died of acute diseases, the presenting numberless varieties in the ferosus effusions.\n\nThe cellular system is not only influenced by its sympathy with other organs; but it also exercises a sympathy over them. In a phlegmon or inflammation of the cellular membrane, if the tumour is considerable, often various alterations take place in the functions of the brain, of the heart, of the liver, or of the stomach. The sympathetic vomiting, &c., are those phenomena in great phlegmons which are often manifested without being considered as belonging to the disease.\n\nArt avails itself of the influence of the cellular system being affected by other organs, in the use of fetons. Often in the diseases of the eye and of joints a feton produces an effect which cannot be obtained by a blister; and this probably arises from the connection which exists between the cellular membrane and the eye, being more active than that which exists between that organ and the skin.\n\nIt ought also to be remarked, in considering the pathology of the cellular system, that there is a manifest difference in the properties of the cellular texture, which is composed of layers and filaments; and in that found exterior to the different mucous surfaces, to the blood-vessels and excretories, which consists of filaments alone. From this difference results the rare occurrence of inflammations and of different kinds of tumors in the latter. It often forms a barrier where the morbid affection of the former stops, and thus protects the organ which it envelopes.\n\nThe infrequency of hemorrhage when extensive suppurations have laid bare large arteries is a proof of what has been said. We have seen cases where the cellular membrane contiguous to the brachial and femoral arteries has been completely ulcerated, whilst the coats of the arteries remained sound. We have observed the same phenomenon in the urethra and in the intestine. In cases of suppuration of the prostrate gland and cavernous bodies of the urethra, the canal has remained untouched; and in a case of femoral hernia, where the hernial sac, and the cellular membrane covering it, all mortified, the protruded gut remained quite sound.\n\nThe cellular membrane has also a powerful influence in the production of a variety of tumors and excrescences, forming as it were their base or parenchyma of nutrition. Encysted tumors are met with alone in the cellular texture of different parts of the body, and various kinds of solid tumors and excrescences are formed by the growth of that texture on the part where the tumor is to be developed; afterwards different substances are deposited amongst it, the difference in the nature of which constitutes the difference in the tumors.\n\nThese remarks will be sufficient to give a general view of the pathology of the cellular membrane, and will enable us to form a more comprehensive and connected view of those diseases, which may be more properly considered as coming within the province of surgery.\n\nThe diseases of the cellular membrane which we shall treat of in this chapter are, 1. Inflammation of the cellular membrane, or phlegmon. 2. Panaris or whitlow. 3. Sinuses. 4. Carbuncle. 5. Encysted tumors. 6. Steatom. 7. Sarcoma. 8. Edema. And, 9. Emphysema.\n\nSect. II. Of Phlegmon.\n\nIn most accounts which surgical authors have given of inflammation, they have taken the description of its general phenomena from inflammation of the cellular membrane.\n\nInflammation of the cellular membrane, or phlegmon, is characterized by a tumor more or less elevated and circumscribed, visible or not visible, according to the part where it is situated. It is always accompanied with an increased sensibility of the part, and with a lancinating or beating pain, a degree of heat, greater than natural, a bright redness, which becomes more livid as the disease advances, an elevated point; and it gradually\nly turns softer from the center to one part of the circumference.\n\nThese are the symptoms which are generally to be observed more or less remarkable in every species of phlegmon. When they are slight, and when the affected part is not extensive, or very important from the nature of its functions, it generally has not much influence on the general system. But when they are more considerable, and the inflammation extends far, the pulse becomes commonly full, frequent, and hard; at the same time, the patient complains of universal heat, thirst, and other febrile symptoms.\n\nWhen by the efforts of nature, or by the application of proper remedies, the pain, the heat, and the tension go away, the other symptoms, which depend in a great degree or altogether on the first which have been mentioned, disappear also, and the patient quickly recovers his health. This termination, which is commonly the most desirable, is called resolution.\n\nBut if, notwithstanding the remedies used, the different symptoms augment instead of diminishing, the tumor gradually increases in size and turns soft. A small eminence is observed towards the centre of the tumor or at some particular point, and its surface becomes polished. Soon afterwards the pain diminishes, and the febrile symptoms abate; and on compressing the tumor, the fluctuation of a fluid can be perceived in it, and this constitutes the second termination of a phlegmon, or abscess.\n\nOf the treatment of Phlegmon.—The principal object which is to be generally kept in view in the treatment of inflammatory tumors, is to obtain their resolution; this being the most prompt and most certain mode of cure. There are, however, some cases which are an exception to this general rule; such as some inflammatory tumors which precede fevers, and other internal diseases: for it is commonly supposed that in these cases, suppuration is a mode by which nature throws off certain fluids or humours, which are pernicious to remain in the system. There are other tumors which seem to arise from internal causes, where it is perhaps better rather to attempt to accelerate their suppuration nor resolution, but to trust them entirely to nature. Such are inflammatory tumors which occur in scrofulous subjects. There are few cases of this kind where suppuration ought to be promoted, for their treatment is always embarrassing whether they are opened naturally or by art. It is well known too, that such tumors often remain a long time without any danger; from whence we may conclude, that it is most prudent not to touch them.\n\nIn the venereal disease, we have a specific for its cure; and when buboes are opened, or other inflammatory venereal swellings, they generally become very difficult and embarrassing to treat. It is therefore always most prudent to attempt their resolution.\n\nThe principal means to be employed, in order to procure the resolution of an inflammatory tumor, are local and general blood-letting, the application of heat and moisture, &c. Leeches is perhaps the best mode of bleeding the inflamed part; but should the inflammation take place in any of the extremities, or contiguous to any of the large veins, one or other of these may be opened. There is no application which tends so much to remove the tension and pain of an inflamed part as the use of poultices or warm fomentations. Applications of a sedative nature are recommended by many, such as the different preparations of lead, the sulphate of zinc, vinegar, &c.; but as far as we have been able to observe, the use of this class of medicines has by no means such powerful effects as emollients, though it has been generally supposed that emollients hasten suppuration. In applying poultices, they should generally be removed three or four times in twenty-four hours, and the part bathed with warm water each time the poultice is changed. When fomentations are to be used, many employ warm water alone, whilst others prefer a decoction of chamomile flowers, or of poppy heads. A piece of flannel of considerable size, wet with either of these in nearly the boiling heat, is to be forcibly wrung out, and applied as warm as the patient can suffer it, to the inflamed part. A second piece of flannel is to be prepared in the same manner, and whenever that which is first applied begins to cool, the second piece is to be employed; and this practice is to be continued for ten or fifteen minutes, and repeated as often as it is found to relieve the patient. The best mode of applying the sedative remedies in external inflammation, is in the form of watery solution. Half an ounce of the acetate of lead dissolved in four ounces of vinegar, with the addition of two pounds of distilled water, is a convenient form. In making use of this solution, it is of consequence to have the parts affected kept constantly moist, and cataplasm prepared with it generally answer that intention exceedingly well. But when the inflamed part is so tender and painful, as not easily to bear the weight of a poultice, pieces of soft linen, moistened with the solution should be employed. Both should be applied cold, or at least with no greater warmth than is merely necessary for preventing pain or uneasiness to the patient. They should be kept constantly at the part, and always renewed before turning dry and stiff.\n\nWhen the part affected with inflammation is not very tender, or lies deep, applications of vinegar are often had recourse to with considerable advantage; and the most effectual form in using it, is in that of cataplasm, made with the strongest vinegar and crumb of bread. In such cases, the alternate use of this remedy, with the saturine solution, has produced more beneficial effects than are commonly observed from a continued course of any one of them.\n\nIn all cases of inflammation, the whole body, but more especially the diseased part, should be preserved as free as possible from every kind of motion, and the patient should be confined to a low cooling diet, and also a total abstinence from spirituous and fermented liquors.\n\nIn slight cases of inflammation, a due perseverance in the mode of treatment which has been mentioned, will be in general sufficient to accomplish the intended purposes; but when there is likewise a full, hard, and quick pulse, with other symptoms of fever, general blood-letting becomes necessary; and the quantity of blood taken away is always to be determined by the extent and violence of the disease, and by the age and strength of the patient. Evacuations, however, should never be carried to a greater height than what is merely necessary for moderating the febrile symptoms; for should suppuration take place after the system is too much reduced, its progress becomes more slow and uncertain;\nnor is the patient able to support the discharge that ensues. The use of gentle laxatives, with a cooling diet, is also attended with very good effects.\n\nBesides these different evacuations, it is of great consequence to procure ease and quietness to the patient. The most effectual remedy for this purpose is opium, and, when the pain and irritation are considerable, as in extensive inflammations very frequently happens, it should never be omitted. In all such cases, the opium should be given in full doses, otherwise, instead of proving serviceable, it seems rather to have the contrary effect, a circumstance which is perhaps the chief reason for opiates having been by some very unjustly condemned in every case of inflammation.\n\nBy a proper attention to these different circumstances, a resolution of the tumor will generally begin to take place in the course of three or four days, and sometimes in a shorter time; at least before the end of that period, it may be for the most part known how the disorder is to terminate. If the heat, pain, and redness, and other attendant circumstances abate, and especially if the tumor begins to decrease, it is probable that, by a continuance of the same plan, a total resolution will be finally effected.\n\nBut, on the contrary, if all the different symptoms rather increase, and especially if the tumor turns larger, and somewhat softer, with an increase of throbbing pain, we may with tolerable certainty conclude that suppuration will take place; and we should therefore immediately desist from such applications as were judged proper while a cure was thought practicable by resolution, and endeavour to assist nature as much as possible in the formation of pus, or what is called the maturation of the tumor. To effect this, nothing is more useful than warm fomentations and cataplasms; and should these not have been employed during the former stage, the cold fomentine applications should be given up, and recourse had to the emollient remedies.\n\nDry cupping, as it is termed, viz. using the cupping glasses without the scarificator, applied as near as possible to the part affected, is frequently had recourse to in promoting the suppuration of tumors. It is only, however, in those in which there seems to be a deficiency of inflammation, that it can ever be either necessary or useful; but in all tumors of an indolent nature, and where there is still some probability of a suppuration, no remedy is more effectual. By these different applications, continued for a longer or shorter time, according to the size of the tumor, its situation and other circumstances, a complete suppuration may generally be at last expected.\n\nWhilst an abscess is forming, it extends according as the quantity of purulent matter is augmented in the cavity in which it is contained; and this extension takes place towards that side where there is least resistance. It is on this account that where an abscess is deep, or covered by an aponeurosis, it extends in the interstices of the neighbouring parts, and affects, as it were, the tendons, the muscles, and the bones, whilst in common cases it makes its way towards the skin. When matter is collected very near to the surface of the body, and is only covered by the common integuments, it speedily makes its way externally; but when it is deep, and surrounded by parts which make great resistance, purulent matter infuses itself until it arrives at some place where there is nothing to oppose its exit; and it is observed making its escape after having made, in some cases, a very great circuit. It is generally towards the inferior parts of the body that purulent matter, in consequence of its weight, makes its route. On this account we see large abscesses open themselves most frequently at their inferior part, and from thence the advantage which is found by waiting till they open of themselves, or that they indicate the place most convenient for the opening to be made. Thus, we see abscesses formed under the temporal muscles open themselves in the mouth, and those of the loins making their appearance near the ring, or upon the anterior part of the thigh. Deep abscesses, in certain parts of the body, proceed rather towards the interior than towards the surface, because the purulent matter finds less obstruction in its passage. Those, for example, which form on the surface of the lungs, find great resistance from the ribs and other parts forming the thorax, whilst they easily make their way through the spongy substance of the lungs, and open in the ramifications of the bronchiae. For the same reason, abscesses formed in the cavity of the abdomen sometimes discharge themselves into the stomach or intestines; but as the parietes of the belly yield more easily than those of the chest, we also see abscesses of the different organs contained in the belly, discharge their contents through its parietes.\n\nWhen matter is fully formed in a tumor, a remission of all the symptoms takes place. The throbbing pain, which before was frequent, now goes off, and the patient complains of a more dull, heavy, and constant pain. The tumor points at some particular part, generally near to its middle, where, if the matter be not deep seated, a whitish yellow appearance is observed, instead of the deep red that formerly took place; and a fluctuation of the fluid underneath is, upon pressure, very evidently perceived. Sometimes, indeed, when the abscess is thick, and covered with muscle and other parts, though from concurring circumstances there can be little doubt of there being a very considerable collection of matter, yet the fluctuation cannot be readily distinguished. It does not, however, often happen that matter is so very deeply lodged as not to be discovered on proper examination.\n\nThis, however, is a circumstance of the greatest consequence in practice, and deserves more attention than is commonly paid to it. In no part of the surgeon's employment is experience in similar cases of greater use to him than in the present; and however simple it may appear, yet nothing more readily distinguishes a man of extensive observation than his being able easily to detect deep-seated collections of matter; whilst nothing, on the contrary, so materially affects the character of the surgeon as his having, in such cases, given an inaccurate or unjust prognosis.\n\nIn addition to the several local symptoms of the presence of pus already enumerated, may be mentioned the frequent shiverings to which patients are liable on its first formation. These, however, seldom occur so as to be easily distinguished, unless the collection is considerable; but it is a symptom constantly observed in all large abscesses; and when it takes place, along with other symptoms of suppuration, it always contributes to point out the true nature of the disease.\n\nOf the opening of Abscesses.—When abscesses come to complete\ncomplete maturity, the integuments gradually become thinner over the more prominent part of the tumor; and they become ulcerated in one or more points through which the pus is evacuated. In many cases it is advisable to wait for the spontaneous rupture; but, on the other hand, it is often more prudent, and is indeed absolutely necessary, to give vent to the matter by an artificial opening. It is a general rule not to have recourse to such means before suppuration is completely formed; for if an abscess be opened before this period, and a considerable hardness remain around, the treatment afterwards becomes very embarrassing and difficult. It is, however, necessary in some cases to depart from this general rule, and to open an abscess much sooner. Above all, those which are critical, and those which are the consequence of lingering fevers.\n\nIn many cases there is neither safety nor convenience to be expected from the spontaneous opening of the integuments. In abscesses situated in any of the joints, or upon either of the cavities of the breast or abdomen, and more especially when they seem to run deep, they should always be opened as soon as the least fluctuation of matter can be discovered; for when the resistance is on either side equal, it just as readily points inwardly towards the cavity, as outwardly towards the skin; and the consequence of a large abscess bursting into either of the large cavities, most frequently proves fatal.\n\nAbscesses are sometimes formed about the face, which point externally, and these should be opened in the inside of the mouth, in order to prevent any deformity. Whenever the fluctuation is sensible, this should be immediately done. They cicatrize very rapidly, and require no dressings.\n\nAbscesses confined under an aponeurosis, and in general under those parts which are not capable of being extended without much difficulty, ought to be opened early. Such are abscesses which are formed under the temporal muscles or fascia lata of the thigh, or those which frequently happen in the extremity of the fingers, under the arch of the palate, round the maxillary bones, behind the ear, above the mastoid processes, &c. All these ought to be opened very speedily, and in particular those last mentioned, on account of the danger of a cavity of the bone in which they lie being produced.\n\nIt is also particularly necessary to open without delay abscesses in the neighbourhood of the anus, or near the urethra. This ought also to be done in large abscesses of the extremities, and in particular those which are the consequence of violent inflammation, occupying the whole member, as the thigh, the arm, &c. If in such cases the matter be allowed to remain too long, the greater part of the cellular membrane is detached from the subjacent aponeurosis, and there often follow large gangrenous ulcers, which in separating themselves lay open extensive surfaces, and often form large bags of pus, which become as many separate abscesses; and often the disorder is such that the whole of the integuments of the member sphericate and fall off. It is also necessary not to delay the opening of abscesses formed among the large muscles, the interstices of which are filled up with cellular texture; such are those of the thigh, the back leg, and under the arm-pit. In these situations the matter is very apt to spread, and to form ramifications of the abscess in various directions, which, if not treated with much care, are very tedious to heal.\n\nWith the exception of those cases which have been mentioned, it ought to be observed as a general rule not to open an abscess until suppuration has completely formed; for if it be true, as it is said, that pus is always sufficiently prepared to be evacuated, it is also the case, that the more we favour its formation before giving it vent, the more we are sure of diminishing and of reducing the hardness which exist in the neighbourhood, and facilitating the cicatization of the ulcer.\n\nOf the different Methods of opening Abscesses.\n\nThere are three different modes of opening abscesses; viz. by cautery, incision, or seton.\n\n1. By Cautery.—The use of cautery is recommended in cases where suppuration has been slow, and has not occupied the whole tumor; in those where the integuments have suffered much, and where it was necessary to wait long before opening it, on account of some affection of the bottom of the abscess; and in general in all cases of the suppuration of glands.\n\nBut though there are circumstances which may render it necessary to employ the cautery rather than the incision, yet the latter generally deserves the preference. The pain which it occasions lasts only a moment, whilst that of cautery lasts many hours; and when the inflamed part has acquired a morbid degree of sensibility, the pain is very violent. The surgeon also can never limit precisely the extent of the action of the cautery; and whatever attention be paid to it, it often extends too far, and penetrates too deep.\n\nTo open an abscess with cautery, an adhesive plaster spread on leather is to be applied over the tumor, with a slit in it of a size somewhat less than what is intended to be made in the skin by the cautery. The slit is to be filled with the cautery reduced into powder, mixed with a small quantity of soap, and wetted, so as to make it operate more quickly. Another adhesive plaster is then to be laid over it, and the whole secured with a firm compress and bandage. The time necessary to allow the cautery to make a sufficient opening will depend on the thickness of the skin and strength of the cautery, but generally it requires two, three, or more hours.\n\nIf the effusion is made, and the matter has not escaped, we ought to assist its exit with the end of a probe, or the point of a bistoury; and the separation of the effusion is to be promoted by emollient applications.\n\n2. By the Incision.—The tumors which are not very extensive, may generally be opened by making a longitudinal incision with the lancet, see Plate DXIII, fig. 1. For this purpose, when the situation of the abscess permits it, the surgeon is to apply one hand on the base of the tumor, and press the pus towards the skin, by doing which there is no risk of wounding any artery, or important part at the bottom of the tumor, and the lancet penetrates into the cavity of the abscess with more certainty and ease, and with less pain. With the other hand an incision of the integuments is to be made in such a direction, that it terminate at the most depending part of the tumor; and should be made of such length as may appear necessary, in order that the matter may be allowed freely to escape. It is in general supposed sufficient, in cases of small abscesses, that the incision extend two thirds of the length of the tumor. Some authors have advised, that when the integuments are much distended, an incision should be made through the whole length of the tumor, even where\nwhere it is of a large size; but this practice ought to be rarely adopted. The irritation and consequent inflammation, produced from such an operation, must always be very considerable; and as it scarcely ever happens that the integuments are ever so much extended as entirely to lose their contractile power, there is always reason to hope that they will recover their natural dimensions. In all very large abscesses, it is the safest practice to make at first a small incision sufficient to allow the contents to be discharged; for whenever this is done, the extent of the cavity rather diminishes; and should it be found afterwards necessary to make a more extensive opening, this can now be done with much advantage. When an abscess has been opened by either of these methods, it is reduced to the state of a simple wound or ulcer, and ought to be treated accordingly.\n\nThe mode by incision ought to be preferred to that of cautery, when the matter is collected deep; when it is in the neighbourhood of important nerves or blood-vessels; when it is necessary to make the opening large; when the skin which is to be opened has a natural appearance; and, above all, when the ulcer is wished for to be healed rapidly up, and leave little deformity.\n\nAlthough surgeons generally agree in preferring the incision to the cautery, it has nevertheless its inconveniences. Whenever the incision is made, the matter contained in the tumor is suddenly evacuated; from whence it happens, when the collection is considerable, that the patient faints, or has some other disagreeable symptoms; but the principal disadvantage of this method is, that it gives free access to the air over a large extent of the ulcerated surface; a circumstance which is followed by very pernicious effects, particularly in large abscesses. A total change takes place in the nature of the matter; a laudable pus is transformed into an ichorous indigested fluid; the pulse becomes quick; colliquative sweats and other symptoms of fever come on, and commonly the patient dies in a short time. Surgeons have too often occasion to observe the dangerous effects which probably are altogether produced by the admission of the air; for we see a great number of patients have for a long time after a termination of inflammatory diseases considerable abscesses, where the pus is perfectly formed, without shewing at the same time any symptom of hectic fever. But when these abscesses exceed a certain size, and if a large incision be made into them, there always follow symptoms of fever, generally in forty-eight hours from the time that the abscess had been opened. These accidents, which we have frequently observed in private practice, are still more frequent in great hospitals, where the air is impregnated with putrid exhalations.\n\n3. By the Feton.—From the observations which have been already made, it appears necessary that as much precaution as possible should be taken to prevent the contact of the air with the internal surface of the abscess. The fenton, therefore, has the advantage, not only of being attended with little pain, and emptying the abscess in a gradual manner, but it completely prevents the access of the air. When patients are otherwise in good health, there is another advantage in employing the fenton; for frequently a cure is obtained at a period much shorter than that which is usually necessary when the incision has been adopted. On the other hand, if we have reason to wish to keep up for a long time a certain degree of irritation and suppuration in the affected part, the fenton ought to be preferred to every other means. There have been various instruments contrived for introducing the fenton, and it may easily be done by a lancet and common probe, or by the instruments represented in Plate DXIII. fig. 15. One of these being threaded with glovers' silk or with cotton, should be introduced into the upper part of the tumor; but if the blunt one be employed, it will be necessary to have the assistance of the lancet. The instrument is then to be brought out at the under part of the tumor, and the matter allowed to run gradually along the threads. The fenton should be changed forty-eight hours after it has been introduced, and as much of it should be pulled out at the under part as is sufficient to allow the removal of that which was shut up in the abscess. The abscess is to be dressed in this manner every day as long as circumstances seem to require.\n\nBy means of the fenton, we obtain a regular and slow discharge of the matter contained in the abscess; the sides of the abscess are allowed to contract in a gradual manner; the presence and friction of the fenton on the surfaces, excites a slight inflammation which contributes to unite them, and to complete an adhesion, much more readily than by any other method. In proportion as the discharge diminishes, the thickness of the fenton ought to be lessened; and this is easily done by taking out some of the threads of the cotton every two or three days. It ought to be entirely taken out when no more matter is discharged than what would be produced by the irritation of the fenton alone; and by compressing gently the parts for some days after it has been withdrawn, with a compress and bandage, we can in general depend upon a complete cure.\n\nWhen speaking of the mode of introducing the fenton, we recommended that this should be done from above downwards, because, if the first opening be made at the base of the tumor, a great quantity of matter immediately escapes. Thus the boundaries of the abscess at the upper part become effaced, and the passage of the director along the abscess is much more difficult than when the abscess is opened according to the manner we have pointed out. In that way the under part of the tumor is left completely defended till the last moments, and only a very small quantity of matter escapes by the superior orifice. Another advantage is, that the part of the fenton left for the future dressings, is easily kept clean and dry.\n\nThe method of opening abscesses by the fenton has been found particularly useful in suppurations of the joints, and in all those glandular parts where the admission of the air is followed by very pernicious effects. Thus, when it is thought necessary to open a scrofulous tumor, we may generally be able to obtain a more prompt and easy cure from the use of the fenton, than by making a larger incision. Venereal buboes, too, when come to maturity, have been said to get well much sooner by this than by any other method, when the integuments have not become too thin by great distention long continued. On the other hand, this mode is not without its inconveniences, for in adopting it we cannot be well assured of the state of the bottom of the abscess, which it is often important to know.\n\nWhatever advantages these different methods of opening abscesses may possess over one another, yet there is not one of them which deserves the preference in all cases, although the cautery, as already mentioned, be the means\nto which we ought most rarely to have recourse. However troublesome it may be, the action of the air on the interior surface of the abscess is not always equally pernicious; and when by properly applied dressings, care is taken not to allow purulent matter to form in any particular cavity, and to prevent the access of cold air on the surface of the wound, and above all when the surrounding air, as that in hospitals, is contaminated with putrid exhalations, daily experience shows, that the method by incision is accompanied with most success.\n\nOn the other hand, we have seen the seton extremely useful in gradually discharging, and without exciting much inflammation, large abscesses.\n\nThese are the general principles we have to observe in the treatment of abscesses, in whatever part of the body they are found. There are, however, some modifications, some particular details of practice, which ought to be kept in view, when the disease is seated in particular organs, as the eyes, the mammae, the cavity of the chest, the groin, the scrotum, &c. Mention will be made of these in giving an account of the diseases of the particular organs.\n\nSect. III. Of Sinuses (Fistulae).\n\nWhen an abscess, instead of healing continues to discharge purulent matter, and when this takes place through a small orifice, it obtains the name of a fistula. The orifice has smooth and callous edges, and the fistula commonly communicates with one or more cavities of different dimensions, situated in the cellular membrane, between the common integuments and the muscles, or between the interstices of the muscles themselves.\n\nThese different cavities, which are generally known by the name of sinuses, serve as reservoirs, both for the matter which is formed in the body of the ulcer, and for that furnished by their own sides. It is thus that when by compression, the matter contained in the sinuses is pressed out through the ulcers, these discharge a much greater quantity than what might have been expected, by considering the extent of their surface alone.\n\nThis description of a fistulous ulcer indicates the most simple form of the disease; but when it has lasted for a long time, the whole internal surface frequently becomes hard and callous, acquiring the properties and structure of a mucous surface.\n\nThe most frequent cause of the formation of sinuses is, when an abscess bursts, that the purulent matter, instead of being all discharged, remains shut up in some part of the cavity. Remaining there, it naturally falls to the lower part, and gradually infiltrates itself among the layers of the cellular membrane, which, from its softness, gives little resistance; it advances by degrees among the interstices of the more solid organs, which are connected by that substance alone; and at last it makes its appearance on the surface of the body, or penetrates into one of the cavities. Both recent and old fistulous ulcers are generally curable, provided that the ulcer be situated in such a manner, that the necessary remedies can be applied to it, and that the constitution be otherwise free from disorder. But when the disease has been of very long duration, and, above all, when the sinuses open into any articulating cavity, or are placed in such a manner, that one cannot practise any operation, the treatment then becomes extremely difficult, and the event very doubtful. There is no disease which resists more frequently all the efforts of art than certain species of fistula, and particularly some of those about the anus and perineum.\n\nOf the treatment of Fistulae.—There are several different modes which have been proposed for the treatment of this disease, all of which may be useful in particular cases.\n\nInjections, supposed to have a cicatrizing quality, have been propounded by some; and these are no doubt useful in particular cases, in diminishing the quantity of the discharge, and in preventing the extent of the sinus from increasing. When the disease is far advanced, and the edges become perfectly callous, injections of an echinocytic quality have been employed; but these remedies have seldom, if ever, produced any good effects; and their too frequent use has even rendered sinuses hard and callous, which were of a more benign nature.\n\nIn some cases, particularly when the disease is recent, great advantage may be derived from the proper application of a compress and bandage. In applying these, the compress should be placed in such a manner, and made of such a form, as to make a firm pressure from the bottom of the sinus towards its orifice; and care should be taken that no pressure be made towards the orifice itself, in order that any matter which is formed may not be allowed to collect, but be discharged from it. Indeed in whatever mode we treat sinuses, the object to be held in view, is to allow any matter which is formed to be immediately discharged.\n\nSome have advised, that, in all fistulae of long standing, their cavities should be laid open from one end to the other, and all the parts should be dissected out which have become hard, and thus to convert the whole into an ulcer, and treat it in the ordinary manner. There is no doubt, but that by such an operation, it will often be possible to obtain a cure; but independent of the great pain, and of the large and disagreeable cicatrix which must always follow, the practice is not without danger. It cannot answer, for instance, in those fistulas which extend far up the rectum. No practitioner surely would advise the adoption of such a method in the case of fistulas which penetrate very deep, and extend, as often happens, underneath the blood-vessels, the tendons, and the nerves; and even although this practice was without danger, it ought to be adopted in no case, as we are enabled, by an operation more simple, and much less painful, always to obtain a cure with as much certainty, as by a total destruction of the parts.\n\nIn the treatment of fistulas, it is necessary to procure by incision an agglutination of the edges of the sinuses, so as to obliterate the cavity. The means most efficacious to fulfil this indication are, to make first an opening, so as to allow the exit of the matter; and to excite a certain degree of inflammation on the internal surface of the cavity, so as to produce an adhesion between its sides.\n\nBoth of these indications may, in some cases, be fulfilled in the most convenient manner, by introducing into the orifice of the ulcer a seton which will follow the whole course of the sinus as far as its opposite extremity. The seton should be of a size proportioned to that of the sinus; and it may be diminished by degrees as the cure advances, by taking away some of the threads day after day. At last, when the cavity of the sinus is nearly\nOf Sinuses, nearly filled up, and consequently the discharge much moderated, the feton ought to be withdrawn. Afterwards a bandage is to be firmly applied over the part, which should be allowed to continue a convenient time, in order to obtain a complete cure. In all cases, therefore, we ought to discover the direction of the sinus, which can commonly be done by introducing a probe, or by observing the place in which the matter collects, when it has been allowed time to accumulate, and by marking the place from whence it comes, the pressure is to be made on the affected part. A feton ought then to be introduced into each sinus.\n\nAnother means of procuring the obliteration of sinuses is, by a longitudinal incision along the whole cavity. In cases where the fistula extends to parts which it is not dangerous to cut, and where the feton has inconveniences which render it inadmissible, we should not hesitate to have recourse to this means. Indeed, the longitudinal incision of the sinus is to be considered in all cases, as the only means which can be adopted with certainty in the cure of the disease; and though in many cases it may be proper to attempt the cure by the milder means which have been mentioned, yet they often fail, and the mode by incision ought always to be held in view.\n\nWe may observe here, that this part of surgery owes much to the celebrated Mr Pott, he having rendered much more simple and successful the treatment of fistulas, particularly those situated in the perineum and anus. When a fistula is to be laid open, the first thing to be done, is to determine the extent of the incision. The exact extent of the sinus should be accurately ascertained with a probe, and it is necessary to lay it open to the extreme point, in order completely to secure the filling up of the cavity. The operation may be performed by introducing a director (fig. 9, and 12.), along the whole course of the sinus, and cutting on it with a common scalpel (fig. 17); or the sharp-pointed bistoury (fig. 4) may be introduced along the groove of the director, the point of the instrument pushed through at the bottom of the sinus, and then, by withdrawing the director, the incision may be speedily completed with the bistoury.\n\nA still better method is one we have often adopted in cases of sinus with the greatest advantage. It consists simply in putting a small bit of wax, about the size of a pin head, upon the end of a sharp-pointed bistoury, introducing the point of the instrument thus defended along the sinus; and when it arrives at the bottom of it, the point may be pushed through the skin, and displace the wax with very little pressure. When the point has been brought through the skin, the incision may afterwards be completed with one quick motion of the knife. In laying open fistulas in this manner, it is particularly necessary to form an exact idea of the direction of the sinus, and of the extent of the incision to be made, before attempting to introduce the bistoury. For as a very slight degree of pressure is sufficient to displace the wax on its point, any untoward motion upon the side of the abscess would thus expose the point of the instrument, and render the operation more tedious and difficult, and always more painful.\n\nThe principal advantages of this mode of laying open sinuses are, that the operation can be much more speedily performed, and that it costs much less pain to the patient. The introduction of the director through a small fistulous opening, and the tedious process of cutting through the integuments with a scalpel, cannot fail of creating much distress, whereas a thin bistoury can be introduced without giving almost any uneasiness; and after the operator has conducted its point to the bottom of the sinus, it may be pushed through the integuments, and the sinus cut open with a coup de main.\n\nAll sinuses should be laid open in this manner, which can be detected by a careful examination with the probe; and if the edges of the fistulous sore are found to have acquired a great degree of callousness, it is sometimes advisable to cut them entirely away.\n\nThe fistulas are now to be dried by placing between the edges portions of caddis dipped in oil, or simple ointment; and great care should be taken that no portion of newly divided parts be allowed to come into contact, as there will be great risk of an adhesion taking place between them, thus frustrating the very objects of the operation. After the pledgets have been introduced between the edges of the wound, it is commonly directed that the whole wound be covered up with a piece of linen spread with ointment. In place of the ointment, we have generally found a poultice answer better. The poultice, by its moisture prevents any agglutination of the lips of the wound; and it has the power of diminishing the inflammation more than any other application. The wound is afterwards to be treated on the principle of the common ulcer.*\n\nSect. IV. Of the Whitloe (Paronichia).\n\nThe whitloe is a painful inflammatory swelling, occupying the extremities of the fingers, most frequently at the root of the nails. Several varieties of the disease have been described by authors; but these differences only consist in the depth the disease supposed to have been seated. From what we have been able to observe, it appears to be situated chiefly in the cellular membrane immediately underneath the skin, and in the structure connected with the nails; though at the same time the pathology of this disease is not yet well understood.\n\nThe first symptom of the whitloe is an uneasy burning sensation over the point of the finger, or root of the nail. The part becomes tender and painful to the touch; and a slight degree of swelling takes place, resembling oedema, attended by little discolouration. A transparent effusion takes place below the epidermis, and forms a vesication round the root of the nail. A purulent discharge takes place round the edge of the nail, and the nail always separates. The peculiarity in this disease is, that it generally affects several fingers, one after the other, and sometimes all the fingers of both hands.\n\nIn the more severe forms of the disease, the inflammation extends to the cellular membrane underneath the skin, and even to the tendinous aponeurosis and periosteum of the fingers, producing caries. In such cases the whole hand generally swells, and the swelling even extends up the arm and affects the axillary glands.\n\nWhitloes sometimes succeed a blow or injury of the finger; but they most usually make their appearance without any known cause.\n\nTreatment.—In the treatment of whitloe, two sets of remedies\nremedies have been employed. Some use fomentations, poultices, and leeches; whilst others apply ardent spirits, vinegar, cold water, and astringents.\n\nLocal bleeding and emollients do not seem to give the same relief in this as in other species of inflammation. When, however, the inflammatory symptoms and pain are violent, it is always necessary to take away some blood; and this may be best done at the bend of the arm. The affected part should be afterwards immersed in strong brandy, spirit of wine, or alcohol or strong vinegar. We have also seen the inflammation much abated by immersing the hand, on its first commencement, in a very large vessel of cold water.\n\nIt is only, however, in the first stages of this affection that remedies of this kind can prove useful: for, when effusion has actually taken place, and suppuration begun, that state of the disease is produced which these remedies were intended to prevent. Emollient remedies should now be employed; and whenever the presence of a fluid can be ascertained, it should be discharged with a lancet.\n\nThe wound is afterwards to be treated as a common abscess; but we may remark, that here, more than in any other part of the body, it is of the greatest importance to lay open freely every sinus, which a patient use of the proper can detect. Sinuses, situated here, never heal; and, when allowed to spread, are always attended with mischief. They destroy ligaments and tendons, or at least produce a thickening of the parts around the joints, so as afterwards to interrupt their free motion.\n\nSect. V. Of the Carbuncle.\n\nThe carbuncle (anthrax) may be considered as a species of phlegmon, attended with a remarkable degree of malignity, and is one of the symptoms of the plague, where that disease rages, or of typhus fever in this country. It consists in a deep-seated very hard swelling, attended with an intensely painful sense of burning in the part, and considerable discolouration of the skin.\n\nThe carbuncle is often sudden in its appearance. It is of a dusky red colour at its centre, but much paler and variegated at its circumference. Vesications appear on its surface, and when these are ruptured they discharge a dark-coloured exudate. The disease sometimes commences with symptoms of general inflammation; but most commonly it is attended with rigors, sickness, great restlessness and depression of strength, fainting, delirium, &c. A miliary eruption, or even petechiae, are also sometimes found dispersed in different parts of the body.\n\nWhen suppuration takes place, several openings generally form in the skin, a thin ichorous fluid is discharged, and a dark yellow slough is observed at the bottom of the sore.\n\nThe carbuncle most frequently takes place about the back, neck, and shoulders, and is generally solitary. They are usually two or three inches in diameter, though sometimes they acquire an enormous size.\n\nThe cellular membrane and skin seem to be the principal textures affected in this disease; a great part of the former is always destroyed by the formation and separation of very large sloughs, and that of the latter by the extensive ulceration.\n\nIn the treatment of this disease great attention is necessary, not only to the local applications, but also to the general remedies.\n\nEmollient poultices, and warm anodyne fomentations, ought to be employed during the first stages of the disease; and when ulceration of the skin has taken place, the application of an ointment, composed of a considerable quantity of the powder of opium, we have found to relieve very much the pain which the ulcerative processes generally creates. The use of rags, wet with diluted nitrous acid, or a solution of lunar caustic, has been found of great use in promoting the separation of the slough, and the granulation of the cavities which remain.\n\nWhen the constitutional symptoms are inflammatory in their commencement, it may be necessary to employ general blood-letting; but the fever being commonly of a typhoid form, wine, bark, and opium, ought to be freely administered. It will be also proper to prescribe a generous diet, and to pay great attention to keep the bowels regular.\n\nSect. VI. Of Encysted Tumors.\n\nThe word tumor has been the origin of much confusion in the arrangements of diseases adopted by the most celebrated nosologists; they have employed it as a term to characterize a class, and also as expressing merely a symptom of diseases. A vast variety of diseases have been thus included under the class of tumors, diseases which are totally dissimilar, and have no analogy whatever. Anaeroma, bubo, encysted tumors, scrofulous and febrile tumors, warts, &c., have all been included under this class, these being as different from one another as any disease with which we are acquainted, having only one common symptom, which is that of swelling.\n\nMr Abernethy has lately made a very laudable attempt to arrange tumors from their anatomical structure; but, like those who preceded him, he has clasped diseases together, among which no analogy can be discovered. He divides tumors into sarcomatous, encysted, and osseous. Under the sarcoma he includes the fibroma (adipose sarcoma), medullary sarcoma, and others, all of which have no resemblance to each other in their history or symptoms.\n\nThe word tumor ought therefore to be expunged from nosology, and be no longer employed to characterize a class of diseases. Its use should be synonymous with that of swelling, and be confined to express merely an enlargement of any organ of the body, or a new growth; whilst all those diseases, which have been formerly clasped among tumors, should be arranged either according to their specific nature, or to the texture of the body in which they arise. Thus tumors, connected with lues venerea or scrofula, should be included under these general names. The fibroma, being a growth of fat, and being always formed in the cellular membrane, ought to be treated among the diseases of that texture. Encysted tumors, being also formed in the cellular membrane, ought to be arranged among its classes; and warts, corns, and other tumors being classes of the skin, will be with propriety clasped among them; and the name may be paid of all other diseases which have usually received the general appellation of tumor.\nChap. I.\n\nSURGERY.\n\nOf Encysted tumor. We shall, therefore, in this section, treat of Tumors, those tumors only which are formed in the cellular membrane.\n\nUnder the class of encysted tumors (tumours enkystées, loups cyphides), are comprehended all those tumors of preternatural formation, the contents of which are surrounded by a bag or cyst.\n\nEncysted tumors are generally formed in the cellular membrane, immediately underneath the common integuments; they are moveable, circumcised, commonly indolent, without heat or any change of colour in the skin; and they are very slow in their formation and progress. They contain a matter more or less thick in consistence; and, according to the nature and consistence of this matter, they are distinguished by different names. They have been denominated atheroma, from the contents being of a soft cheesy consistence; melicoris, when they contain a matter of the consistence of honey; and fleatum, when formed of fat. The fleatum, however, ought not to be included among the encysted tumors, as the thin cellular covering in which it is contained has no analogy in its structure to the cysts of the other tumors.\n\nIt ought to be observed, that the consistence of the matter contained within the cyst varies in every species of encysted tumor. In the atheroma and melicoris they have sometimes the consistence and firmness of new cheese, and at other times they are softer than the most liquid honey. These varieties depend on the length of time which the fluids have remained in the cysts, and in the proportion of coagulable lymph and serum, which have been separated and absorbed, and also from their having been inflamed or not, and on the extent to which this inflammation may have proceeded. Sometimes an encysted tumor is composed of different cysts, each of which contains a substance of a different nature. These different circumstances render in general the diagnosis in the varieties of encysted tumors very difficult; and happily this distinction is not necessary in practice, and perhaps ought also to be omitted in our nosological arrangements. The sac of an encysted tumor is generally pretty firm, and composed of concentric lamellae. We have observed some of the cysts which were nearly as firm as cartilage, having small chalky concretions formed in many parts between each layer. When the contents of the tumor are washed out, the internal surface of the sac generally appears smooth and polished; but, in others, some of the matter adheres firmly to the surface of the sac. In some cases the tumor very much resembles the hydatids found in the liver and other organs; for, besides the firm sac, there is sometimes formed within it, and apparently having no adhesion with it, a thin and very easily torn whitish bag, which contains the fluid.\n\nEncysted tumors are very small at their commencement, and grow by almost insensible degrees. They vary a good deal in their form and size. Those which are formed in the hip, are generally round and smooth; commonly of the size of a nut, and acquire rarely the bulk of a large egg. Those which are seated in other parts of the body are more irregularly formed, and sometimes become of a prodigious size, some having been found which weighed 10, 15, and even 20 lbs. They are never painful, at least at their commencement, and the skin preserves, for a long time, its natural colour; but when they become very large, the veins of the skin are large, and become varicose; and the skin on their upper part becomes polished, and acquires a reddish colour, similar to that of a part inflamed. They seldom give pain or uneasiness, except when they receive a blow. Inflammation and pain then easily come on, and the cyst becomes ruptured, if it is not previously opened by an instrument.\n\nSuch is the usual progress of encysted tumors; and although they do not come to a rapid termination, yet this sometimes happens more readily under certain circumstances, and even before they have acquired a large size. In the hip, for example, we perceive the integuments become tender and very thin, and open before the tumor has acquired any considerable size. But on other parts of the body, and particularly the back, shoulders, and thighs, the integuments preserve their natural appearance, even when the tumor has acquired a large bulk. This appears to arise from the skin being more loose in these parts.\n\nThe situation of encysted tumors also contributes much to determine the degree of adhesion which they have contracted with the neighbouring parts. In some situations they are so detached, especially while they continue small, that they readily alter their situation by very slight degrees of pressure; but in others, particularly when covered by any muscular fibre, they are more firmly fixed from their commencement. The attachment of encysted tumors is also influenced by their remaining more or less free from inflammation; for they never become inflamed, even in the slightest manner, without some degree of adhesion being produced between the cysts and contiguous parts.\n\nIt has been generally supposed that the membrane Mode of which forms the cyst of this species of tumor is not a their formation in this part, but that it is formed by a collection of fluid in one of the cells of the cellular membrane, which by its increase dilates the cell, and brings it into close contact with the adjacent cells so as finally to obliterate them, and increase the thickness of its own coats.\n\nThe ingenious Bichat * has shown that this opinion generally adopted is without foundation, and that the formation of encysted tumors more probably depends on laws, analogous to those which regulate the growth of the different parts of our bodies. He has also shown that there is a great analogy between these cysts and the serous membranes.\n\nThe cysts, like serous membranes, form a species of sac without an opening; they contain the fluid which they exhale, and they have a smooth and polished surface contiguous to the fluid, whilst the other surface is unequal, and connected with the adjacent cellular membrane.\n\nThe cysts have a similar structure to serous membranes; maceration, &c., proving them both to be composed of a cellular texture. In the natural state neither of them have any sensibility, but when inflamed they both become extremely sensible. The cysts also are evidently secretory organs, exhaling the fluid with which they are filled, and their power of absorption is also very manifest from the spontaneous cures of some encysted dropsies.\n\nThese considerations led Bichat to conclude that there exists a perfect resemblance between the cysts of the\nOf Encysted Tumors and the Ferous Membranes.\n\nAn important question here presents itself; to know how these cysts are formed, how a membrane which did not exist in the natural state can be produced, can grow, and even acquire a considerable development under certain circumstances? The mechanical explanation of these phenomena which has been already mentioned, though it at first sight may appear simple and satisfactory, yet it is by no means conformable to the usual proceedings of nature. How does it happen that as the cysts and ferous membranes are analogous, that these membranes are formed in a different manner, the ferous membranes being never formed from a compulsion of the cellular membrane? How is it, if the cells are applied and compacted with one another so as to form a sac, that the neighbouring cellular membrane does not disappear, or even diminish, whilst the sac acquires a large bulk? These reflections would lead us to believe with Bichat, that the common manner of explaining the formation of cysts is essentially different from the manner in which nature generally follows in all her operations.\n\nBichat ingeniously remarks that all tumors which vegetate externally, or appear internally, are formed and grow in the same manner as the cysts, there being no difference between these two morbid productions but in the form in which each of them appears. Most tumors throw out upon their external surface the fluid which they separate. The cyst, on the contrary, exhales that fluid from its internal surface, and preserves it in its cavity. \"Suppose a fungous tumor in suppuration (says Bichat), transformed in a moment into a cavity, and the suppuration to be transported from the external surface to the sides of the cavity, that cavity will then become a cyst.\" Reciprocally, suppose a superficial cyst, the cavity of which is obliterated, and of which the fluid is exhaled from its external surface, you will then have a tumor in suppuration.\n\n\"If therefore the form alone establishes the difference between tumors and cysts, how does it happen that the formation of the latter is not analogous to that of the first? or has ever any one attempted to attribute the formation of external or internal tumors to compression? We ought therefore to conceive the production of cysts in the following manner: they begin to be formed in the cellular membrane by laws analogous to those which regulate the general growth of our bodies, and which appear to be deviations of these fundamental laws of which we are ignorant. When the cyst is once formed, exhalation begins to take place, and though at first in a small degree, it at last augments in proportion to its progress. The increase of the exhalent organ then always precedes the accumulation of the exhaled fluid, in such a manner that the quantity of the suppuration of a tumor is always directly in proportion to its bulk.\"\n\nThis mode of explaining the formation of cysts appears much more conformable to the laws of nature than that which has been formerly mentioned and generally received. But it still remains to determine the precise mechanism of the origin and growth of cysts, and consequently of all other tumors. We ought to stop where the first causes commence; and as we do not know the mechanism of the natural growth of our organs, how ought we to guess at that of morbid productions which depend upon the same laws. It is a great deal in the economy of our organs to point out analogies, and to show the uniformity of a phenomenon not understood with one in regard to which all the world agree. Much would be done for the benefit of science, if in all its branches we could demonstrate that principle on which depends such a great number of effects, that nature, avaricious in her means, is prodigal in her results; that a few causes preside over a multitude of effects, and that the greater number of those regarding which we are uncertain, depend on the same principles as many others which appear to us evident.\n\nOf the treatment of Encysted Tumors.—Encysted tumors, though not dangerous, are often inconvenient from their size, situation, and from the deformity which they produce, so that whenever their removal becomes necessary, this can be done alone by a surgical operation.\n\nIf the tumor be of the thin or melicis kind, which for the most part will be the case when a distinct fluctuation is perceived in it, ought to be treated as a common abscess. If the tumor be small, the matter may be discharged by laying open the most dependent part of it with a common lancet, and treating it in the ordinary way till the sides of the cavity come in contact by adhesion, or by the process of granulation. But when the tumor is more considerable, the free admittance of air into the interior of its cavity is always dangerous; and we ought to be attentive to prevent its effects by making the opening in such a manner, that the wound be exposed as little as possible. When treating of abscesses, we have recommended the passing of a tenon or cord through them, as the best method of opening them when they are of a large size. This method is also very convenient in the case of encysted tumors, which contain a matter of a liquid consistence. It will only be necessary here to observe, that the tenon should traverse the whole tumor, from the superior part of it to the most depending point, and that the inferior opening should be sufficiently large for allowing the matter to be freely discharged. This method often answers extremely well; and cures have been performed by it which could not have been obtained in so short a time in following the ordinary method of treatment by incision. But this method cannot be employed, except in those cases in which the contents of the tumor are so liquid as to be easily discharged by a small opening. When it is too firm a confluence to admit of the tenon, the contents must be emptied, either by making an extensive opening into the cyst, or the cyst and its contents may be dissected out.\n\nWhen an encysted tumor adheres so firmly to the contiguous parts, as to render its removal tedious and difficult, it is often better not to undertake the operation. In such a case it will be sufficient to lay open the tumor its whole length, and to cut away any portions of the cyst which can be easily detached. The contents of the tumor will in this manner be completely removed, and the cure will be effected, either by keeping the wound open till the cavity of the cyst is filled with granulations; or it may be attempted by drawing the divided edges of the skin together, and applying moderate pressure, so as to produce adhesion within the sides of the cavity. It sometimes happens, however, that from the adhesion being complete, the remaining portion\nThe edges of the wound are to be placed accurately together, and kept in contact with adhesive plaster, a compress and proper bandage being applied over it. The wound is to be treated in the usual manner, removing the dressings whenever they become foiled, and the application of the adhesive plaster continued till a complete cicatrization has taken place.\n\n**Sect. VII. Of the Steatoma or Fatty Tumor (B).**\n\nThis species of tumor consists of a mere accumulation of cellular membrane and fat in a particular part of the body. They occur frequently, and are formed most commonly on the front or back part of the trunk of the body, and sometimes in the extremities. They generally grow in a slow and progressive manner, and the blood-vessels are neither large nor numerous. They have always a thin capsule of common cellular substance; and this capsule seems merely to be the effect of that condensation of the surrounding cellular substance which the pressure of the tumor occasions. \"As the growth of adipose tumors is regularly and slowly progressive, and as nothing like inflammation in general accompanies their increase, their capsules afford a striking instance of an investment acquired, simply by a slight condensation of the surrounding cellular structure, unaffected by inflammation.\" When the Aber-capsule, which is extremely thin, and which adheres but netheby's slightly to the tumor, is removed, the tumor within confines of a mere piece of fat, more or less compacted according to its situation in the body, and the length of time which it has remained.\n\n**Of the treatment of the Steatoma.—**When a steatoma is small, when it causes little deformity, and when it does not seem to injure the functions of any organ, it is most prudent to allow it to remain. They sometimes, however, acquire a very large bulk, and from their situation are extremely inconvenient and unsightly, and they then become an object of medical treatment. No external application was ever known to be useful in discharging tumors of this kind; and the only means to be employed for removing them is by an operation. There is indeed no species of tumors that can be dissected out with so much celerity, or with such apparent dexterity. In some cases, however, if inflammation has been induced, the capsules even of these tumors are thickened, and adhere so as not to be separated without difficulty from their surface.\n\nIn dissecting out a tumor of this kind, the same general rules may be followed as we mentioned when treating of encysted tumors. The external incision should be made very free, and it is also of great importance to cut completely down to the capsule of the tumor, before attempting to dissect it out.\n\n**Sect. VIII. Of the Sarcoma or Fleshly Tumor.**\n\nOur knowledge of the pathology of tumors of the cellular membrane is yet too limited to be able to arrange them in any systematic form; and it would be foreign to our purpose to attempt in this place the investigation.\n\n(b) Steatoma, adipose sarcoma of Mr Abernethy.\nSurgery\n\nInvestigation of the subject. We have adopted the term sarcoma as very general; and include under it all those swellings or wens of a fleshy feel, which occur in the cellular membrane throughout the body.\n\nThe basis of these tumors, as we before mentioned, is the cellular membrane; and the difference in the qualities of the substances deposited in the cells gives the peculiar appearance to the tumor.\n\nThe vessels which pervade them are either larger or smaller, and more or less numerous. They are also distributed in their usual arborescent manner, without any describeable peculiarity of arrangement.\n\nWhen tumors of this kind have attained a considerable size, the superficial veins appear remarkably large. They have little sensibility, enduring a rough examination.\n\nThis kind of tumor generally grows till the skin is so distended that it ulcerates, and exposes the new formed substance, which floughs away. In this manner does the disease occasionally terminate; but such is the constitutional irritation attending this process, and the disturbing factor and frightful appearance of the part, that the surgeon generally recommends its removal. In some instances sarcomatous tumors are composed of a number of irregular-shaped masses, which from their resemblance to the pancreas have been called by Mr Abernethy the pancreatic sarcoma, and considered as a distinct species. \"This new-formed substance is made up of irregularly-shaped masses, which in colour, texture, and size, resemble the larger masses composing the pancreas. They appear also to be connected to each other like the portion of that gland, by a fibrous substance of a looser texture.\" Other sarcomatous tumors are composed of a number of cysts, containing sometimes a transparent and sometimes a dark fluid; and have been called by Mr Abernethy, the cystic sarcomas.\n\nThe Mammary and Tuberculated Sarcomas are also other two species enumerated by Mr Abernethy. In the first the structure of the tumor has been supposed to resemble the natural structure of the mamma, and in the second the tumor \"consists of an aggregation of small, firm, roundish tumors of different sizes and colours, connected together by a kind of cellular texture. The size of the tubercle is from that of a pea to that of a horse-bean, or sometimes larger; the colour of a brownish red, and some are of a yellow tint (c).\"\n\nThese different terms employed to characterize the various kinds of swellings which form in the cellular membrane, are by no means adequate; and tumors will be daily met with which it is impossible to assign to one or other of these species. This subject therefore still remains open for the investigation of future inquiry.\n\nAnd it is probable, that when the subject is better understood, the surgeon will not on all occasions be obliged to have recourse to the knife; and that he will be able to distinguish those which may be allowed to remain, or as harmless treated by external applications, from those whose nature is more malignant, and require an early extirpation.\n\nTreatment.—When sarcomatous tumors are painful and tender to the touch, advantage may be had by local blood-letting, either by leeches or cupping. Fomenting the parts with a decoction of chamomile flowers or poppy heads, and applying a solution of muriate of ammonia or of vinegar, and acetate of lead, are also useful in diminishing their bulk. Frictions with unctuous substances, as mercurial ointment and camphor; camphorated spirits, aqua ammonia and oil; tincture of cantharides—have been used for the diffusion of indolent swellings: Soap and mercurial plasters have been also much commended by some; but of all these remedies perhaps there is none more useless than friction with the dry hand. The mode by which this practice is to be conducted is particularly mentioned under Swellings of the Joint. While we employ these applications to the tumor, we ought also to prescribe purgative medicines every second or third day, enjoin an abstemious diet and rest. An alternative course of medicine is also supposed to be useful. Small doses of calomel or corrosive sublimate are given for this purpose. The extract of hyoscyamus and calomel, or calomel and the extract of cicuta, has been much extolled by some.\n\nBy cautery.—Some surgeons (and it is a favourite practice with all itinerants) have attempted to remove tumors with cautery; and though this mode is much more painful and more clumsy than the knife, yet there are some cases, where, either from the tumor being situated, or from the patient being timorous, this practice may be resorted to.\n\nWhere a tumor is to be removed by cautery, the common caustic potash will answer the purpose extremely well. This is to be placed over a sufficient bulk of the skin, and allowed to remain longer or shorter according to the depth of the tumor, and the portion of it intended to be removed. After the dead portion has separated by the assistance of poultices, &c., the caustic may be again renewed until the whole mass is destroyed. Equal parts of red precipitate and burnt alum forms a very active caustic, and is used by some; but it creates great pain. By mixing opium with the caustics, the pain has been alleviated.\n\nBy incision.—When a sarcomatous tumor is to be removed by incision, the surgeon should always keep in remembrance, that whilst the tumor is growing, the contiguous cellular membrane is generally condensed, and is formed into a kind of capsule. A knowledge of this not only renders the extirpation of the tumor much easier, but tumors may be cut out from a depth, and from connexions, apparently dangerous. The integuments are to be freely divided, and the incision carried down to the capsule of the tumor, before we attempt to dissect it from the contiguous parts; if this be not done, the dissection becomes more tedious and difficult, and more blood is lost than what was necessary, from vessels being divided which might have been saved; and if the tumor happen to be deeply seated, its extirpation even becomes impracticable. The general directions given for the extirpation and after treatment of encysted tumors may also be applied to the sarcomatous tumors.\n\n(c) Another species of sarcoma has been termed the osteo sarcoma, from bony matter being formed in the tumor.\nSect. IX. Of Oedema.\n\nOedema consists in the effusion of a watery fluid in the cellular membrane of any part of the body.\n\nThe swelling in oedema is not circumcised. The skin of the swollen part retains its natural colour, and sometimes becomes paler than natural, having a glossy hue. The part has a cold feeling; and pressure made by the point of the finger forms an impression or dimple, which remains for some time after the finger is removed, and disappears slowly. There is no acute pain, but there is an uneasiness or sense of weight and tightness in the part. If a limb is oedematous, the magnitude of the swelling is always increased or diminished, according as it is placed in a depending or horizontal posture. Oedema always arises from the want of proper balance in the functions of the exhalent and absorbent systems, and it appears both in a constitutional and local form. Contusions, sprains, the long use of relaxing poultices and washes, are often local causes of oedema. More or less oedema is conjoined with erysipelas inflammation, and this sometimes terminates in gangrene. A part which has been acutely inflamed often remains oedematous for some time afterwards. It is also often owing to some impediment which prevents the return of the blood to the heart. Pressure of the gravid uterus on the iliac veins often renders the lower extremities oedematous. Aneurisms and other tumors, by compressing the veins of the extremity, often produce this affection. It also accompanies affections, hydrothorax, &c., &c.\n\nTreatment.—As an oedematous swelling is generally the effect of some other disease, the cure must depend upon the original disease being removed.\n\nIf the limb be the part affected, it should be kept in a horizontal position. Frictions made on the part with flannel, and a moderately tight roller, applied from the toes upwards, have a powerful effect in diminishing the swelling. The operation of these means is to be assisted by giving purgatives and diaphoretics. See Medicine.\n\nIf the tumor become so tenacious as to create much pain and inflammation of the skin, there are better modes of treatment than to allow the integuments to burst. A puncture is, however, not void of danger, for wounds in dropsical constitutions generally excite a great degree of inflammation, and are apt to become gangrenous. The puncture should be made upon the most prominent parts of the swelling with the point of a lancet; and as the fluid which oozes out is apt to create great irritation of the tender skin over which it flows, it is a proper and very useful precaution to keep the skin always covered with some unctuous adhesive substance. For this purpose the unguentum resinosum is very well calculated.\n\nSect. X. Of Emphysema.\n\nEmphysema consists in an effusion of air into the cellular membrane of any part of the body.\n\nThe swelling is without pain, and colourless; and it is easily distinguished from oedema, by the noise and particular feeling it has when pressed upon. It then makes a crackling noise, and resembles the feeling created by pressing a dry thin bladder half filled with air. The swelling is not heavy. At its commencement, it only affects one part; but it soon spreads over the body, and distends the whole skin.\n\nEmphysema generally arises from a wound of the lungs; often from a spicula of a broken rib*. It has also been known to arise from an ulceration in the Wounds of the Thorax, but this seldom happens, as the inflammation attending the formation of the matter condenses the contiguous vesicles, and produces adhesions between the lungs and cavity of the thorax.\n\nEmphysema has also been sometimes observed in some putrid diseases. Dr Huxham has recorded a case of this kind in a sailor who was attacked with putrid fever and sore throat†.\n\nA partial emphysema has also been observed in cases of gangrene. Dr William Hunter has mentioned a case of that kind.\n\nThe treatment of emphysema must always depend on the nature of the original disease. It may be here, however, remarked, that the effused air is readily absorbed, and creates no inflammation or any change in the cellular structure where it had been effused.\n\nChap. II.\n\nOf the Diseases of the Skin.\n\nSect. I. General Remarks on the Pathology of the Skin.\n\nThere are a considerable number of diseases which arise in the different parts which compose the skin; and there are others which seem to be the effect of that sympathy which the skin has with most organs of the body.\n\nOf the diseases which attack the skin, there are five classes. In the first, the papillae are affected; in the second, the cellular membrane contained in the areola of the skin; in the third, the rete mucosum or capillary net-work, from which the exhalants arise; in the fourth, the cutis vera or chorion; and in the fifth, the epidermis or scarf skin.\n\n1. Under the diseases of the first class, or those of the papillae, may be considered all those in which an alteration in the sensibility of the skin takes place. Whenever inflammation affects the skin, this alteration of sensibility is perceptible; and in some of the nervous diseases of women it is very remarkable; for on touching the skin a little roughly, convulsions are produced. It is also well known the effect of titillation on the skin; and perhaps an application of this knowledge might be extremely useful in the treatment of some diseases.\n\n2. We have examples of the second class of diseases of the skin, where the areolas of the cellular membrane of the cutis vera becomes inflamed, in boils and perhaps also in smallpox, and in some of those tumors commonly called pimples of the skin.\n\n3. The rete mucosum, from its vascularity, is probably the seat of eruptions, measles, scarlatina, and that multiplicity of eruptions to which the skin is subject.\n\n4. In elephantiasis, cancer, &c., and in general in all chronic cutaneous diseases, the cutis vera is affected; it appears, however, to be seldom primarily affected in acute diseases.\n\n5. The epidermis is passive in all the diseases of the skin, and is only affected by its continuity. Its sensibility...\nDiseases of the skin is never increased, nor is it susceptible of being inflamed, and consequently it never forms adhesions. Its internal surface, too, raised by a blister or any other means, and applied to the parts below, never reunites. The excrescences which form on it, such as corns, &c., are dry and inert, and without circulation; if they are painful, it arises alone from their pressure on the nerves of the subjacent parts.\n\nFrom all these different affections of the skin, a number of sympathetic affections arise which it is worth while here to remark, though only a few of the diseases of this organ come properly within the limits of a system of surgery.\n\n1. Every time that the papillae are much excited in irritable people, as in titillation, various organs are sympathetically affected by it. Sometimes it is the heart; hence follows fainting. Sometimes the stomach, and in two cases mentioned by Bichat, the persons vomited. Sometimes it is the brain, as is observed in people, where tickling brings on laughter, and even violent convulsions.\n\n\"Medical men,\" says Bichat*, \"are often astonished at the extraordinary effects which quacks produce on the body from the knowledge they have acquired of the sympathies of the skin produced by titillation. But how should we be more astonished at this, than by vomiting produced by diseases of the womb, than by diseases of the liver being brought on from a injury of the brain, or by headaches arising from a disordered state of the gastric viscera?\" The influence of titillation of the skin may be of much use in the treatment of some diseases. In hemiplegia, &c., would not the excitement of the foles of the feet, which have so much sensibility, as every one knows, not answer much better repeated ten or twelve times a day, than the application of a blister, the irritation of which continues only during a short time.\n\nFrom this sympathy which the skin has with the distant organs, we may be perhaps able to explain satisfactorily the influence which friction has been lately found to have in some diseases. Mr. , an ingenious surgeon at Oxford, has employed this remedy to a very great extent in diseases of the joints; and he has experienced from it the best effects†.\n\n2. Whenever the exhalents of the skin, or the exterior capillary system from whence they arise, are affected in any manner, a number of other parts participate, and thence arises a second order of sympathies of the skin.\n\nThere are few organs which have more sympathy with the skin than the stomach. The bath, which acts upon the skin, during digestion affects sympathetically the stomach, and disturbs its functions. When that organ is spasmodically affected, it often is referred to a state of health, by the influence it receives from the bath. Bichat mentions a case of a woman who was troubled with constant vomiting, in consequence of suppressed menses; and who was immediately relieved by the warm bath after other remedies had failed.\n\nThe action of cold on the skin produces a variety of sympathetic effects; above all when that action takes place during perspiration. It is also well known what a number of phenomena result from a sudden disappearance of many eruptions of the skin.\n\n3. When the cellular membrane contained in the areola of the skin, becomes inflamed, as in boils, pustules, &c., a number of sympathies ensue, which may be referred to the cellular system in general*.\n\n4. The diseases of the cutis vera and epidermis being all of a chronic nature, their sympathetic affections have the same character, little more being known of them.\n\nWe have also mentioned, that besides diseases of the skin, arising from a change of structure in that organ, there were also others which arose from the sympathy it has with other organs. Whenever a cold body enters the stomach whilst there is a perspiration on the skin, the perspiration instantly stops. The entry of warm drinks into the stomach, and an augmentation of the cutaneous exhalation, are two phenomena which coincide at the same moment, in such a manner, that one cannot attribute the second to the absorption of the drink, to its passage to the venous blood through the lungs, and then to the arteries. The production of perspiration is, therefore, analogous to the suppression of it in the former instance. Hence will be found a great variety of phenomena in different diseases, arising from the sympathy existing between the skin and the other organs, various degrees of dryness, of moisture, and of perspiration. Sometimes these phenomena are chronic. In many organic diseases, different kinds of tumors are formed on the skin, in the same manner as we observe petechiae, miliary eruptions, &c., &c., produced in acute fevers; the difference being merely in the duration of the periods of the sympathetic affections.\n\nThe diseases of the skin form a very important class in a system of nology. There are, however, only a few which ought properly to be considered in a system of surgery.\n\nIt is the seat of all eruptions, as smallpox, measles, and a vast number of other diseases. It is liable to inflammation, suppuration, and gangrene. It is also subject to diseases and injuries from its exposure to the action of external bodies, and from serving as a defense to the internal parts. It is also subject to cancer, warts, and other excrescences, the treatment of which more properly belong to the surgeon.\n\nSect. II. Of the Erysipelas, or the Rose.\n\nThe rose is sometimes a local disease; at other times it is merely a symptom of some other affection. It differs from all other inflammations in the peculiar shade of red colour, and it is also remarkable for the disorder which it generally creates throughout the whole system. The part of the skin which is affected becomes of a bright scarlet colour, with a tinge of yellow; and towards the termination of the complaint, the yellow becomes more discernible. Besides the difference in the shade of red, the swelling is neither so hard, so elevated, nor so circumcincted as that of phlegmon. The skin has a glossy smooth appearance, a burning heat, and on its being touched with the finger, the scarlet colour disappears where the pressure is made, leaving a white spot, which, however, is almost immediately replaced when the finger is removed. The pain attending the disease is sometimes very great; there is also always more or less swelling of the parts affected and those in the immediate vicinity; and this seems chiefly to arise from a watery effusion in the cellular membrane.\n\nThe rose is very apt to spread rapidly to a great extent;\nErysipelas tent; and it frequently changes its situation, growing gradually well in one side, and extending itself on the other. Sometimes it disappears entirely at one place, and attacks some other. As the disease gets well, the cuticle peels off from the affected part.\n\nErysipelas may be combined with phlegmon (erysipelas phlegmonoides), in which case the inflammation is of a deeper red colour; the swelling is also greater and deeper, and the pain is more acute. There is also a throbbing in the part, and the pulse is full and hard.\n\nThere is also a particular species of erysipelas called St Anthony's fire, in which small vesicles are formed on different parts of the skin. These burst, and discharge a thin fluid which forms a scab, and beneath the scab suppuration sometimes takes place.\n\nThe true erysipelas inflammation seldom suppurates, but generally terminates by resolution; very violent cases sometimes cause gangrene.\n\nWhen erysipelas is accompanied with inflammation of the cellular membrane, as there are no distinct limits of the disease, the matter which is formed in those cases which advance to suppuration, often extends very far in every direction, and sometimes produces very considerable floughing, not only of the cellular substance, but of the fascia and tendons beneath the skin. Erysipelas is generally accompanied with all the symptoms of general fever, and these occur in a very considerable degree, even where the external inflammation is extremely slight. Languor, languor, weakness in the limbs, headache, loss of appetite, oppression about the stomach, precede the appearance of the local complaint. The most violent form of erysipelas is most frequently seen attacking the face, producing a great deal of general fever, often accompanied with delirium; and in a few cases we have known it to proceed so far as to inflame and suppurate the membranes of the brain. Erysipelas seems to be intimately connected with the state of the general constitution. Persons in the habit of drunkardness and other species of intemperance, and who, when in a state of intoxication meet with local injuries, often have erysipelatous inflammation in consequence of these. In general, erysipelas has its principal source in a disordered state of the chylopoetic vasa, and the wrong state of the bilious secretion. It seems also to be often connected with a suppression of perspiration, for it never recedes until that symptom is relieved.\n\nOf the treatment of Erysipelas.—The mild erysipelas is to be relieved by the exhibition of gentle diaphoretics. A few doses of nitre, in order to promote the ordinary evacuations, and the general attention to the antiphlogistic regimen.\n\nIt is also of great importance to attend to the state of the bowels, and to give purgative medicines, both with a view of removing any feculent matter contained in them, and as a general evacuant.\n\nWhen the case is conjoined with phlegmon, and when there are strong symptoms of inflammatory fever, venesection becomes necessary; and this is particularly the case when the face is the seat of the disease. Copious bleeding, however, is generally hurtful, and no blood ought ever to be taken away when the functions of the abdominal viscera are much disordered.\n\nWhen the patient has a very foul tongue, a bitter taste in his mouth, and a propensity to vomit; if these symptoms cannot be removed, purgatives and emetics become necessary. Indeed, in almost all severe cases, erysipelas an emetic is indicated, and ought even to be repeated, should the symptoms remain severe.\n\nThere has been a great variety of opinions with regard to the external treatment of erysipelas; some recommending the part to be kept dry, of moderate warmth, and excluded from the air; others have used warm or cold moist applications. The practice of Default is perhaps the most judicious. In those cases of erysipelas which were produced from an internal cause, no topical application is to be employed, except, perhaps, dusting the part with flour; but when any species of erysipelas succeeds a contusion, a wound or an ulcer, the regimen and internal medicines are insufficient, if proper topical remedies are not at the same time employed to alleviate the local irritation. In this point of view Default employed poultices, the good effects of which in these sort of cases were confirmed by numerous observations. He considered it, however, as an essential precaution not to extend this topical application further than the bruised part, or the edge of the wound or ulcer. If any application is made to the erysipelasous surface, it ought to consist merely of a weak astringent solution; that which was always employed at the Hotel Dieu, consisted of a scruple of the extract of lead in a pint of water.\n\nSect. III. Of the Farunculus or Boil.\n\nThe farunculus appears to be an inflammation of the cellular membrane of the areola of the chorion; the other inflammations of the skin and cutaneous eruptions being seated on the corpus reticulare. The farunculus is a circumscribed, very prominent, and hard tumor, of a deep red colour; and they vary, from the size of a pea to that of a pigeon's egg. They are extremely painful, and are seldom attended with fever. They are also most frequent in young people. Boils generally pass into a more or less perfect kind of suppuration; a small white spot is formed on the apex of the tumor, which, when it has reached the skin, discharges but a small quantity of pus in proportion to the bulk of the swelling. Before the tumor begins to subside, a yellow flough, formed by a portion of dead cellular membrane, comes out.\n\nAs swellings of this kind almost always suppurate, and as induration constantly remains after an incomplete resolution of them, we ought to promote suppuration by using emollient applications. Emollient poultices are best for this purpose. When a quantity of matter is collected, it is sometimes advantageous to open the boil with the point of a lancet, then to allow it to remain until the skin ulcerates. Gentle aperients and antiphlogistic regimen ought not to be omitted.\n\nSect. IV. Of the Chilblain.\n\nThe chilblain is a painful, and very often an extremely itchy floughing of the skin of an extreme part of the body, in consequence of exposure to extreme cold, or sudden change from a very cold to a warmer atmosphere.\n\nChilblains are most frequent in young people of sanguineous constitutions, and in this country the disease is most prevalent during the winter months. It appears\nmost commonly on the toes and heels, and sometimes also on the fingers, and parts where the circulation is most languid.\n\nThe first symptoms of the disease are a paleness of the part, which is quickly succeeded by more or less redness, a very troublesome itching, and sometimes pain. The skin gradually acquires a purple hue; the part swells, and the cuticle separates from a serous effusion which takes place below it. Beneath the cuticle an ulcer appears of a very irritable appearance, and accompanied with great pain. This ulcer spreads rapidly, has very acute edges, and its surface is of a dark or rather dirty yellow colour. Sometimes the ulceration penetrates as low as the tendons, or even exposes the surface of the bones, producing a sphacelation of an extremity.\n\nIn the treatment of chilblains, before the skin has ulcerated, the principal attention ought to be paid in keeping the affected part of an equal temperature, and to rub it over with stimulating applications. Camphorated spirit, spirit of turpentine, &c., have been generally recommended for this purpose; but we have found the tincture of catharides, properly diluted, to be much more efficacious. A drachm of this tincture to an ounce of the tincture of soap, will be generally found to answer extremely well; and this is to be rubbed on the part once or twice a day.\n\nWhen vesications begin to appear, and ulceration has taken place, emollient poultices should be employed; but after this process has gone on a certain time, and the pain and irritation abated, much benefit will be experienced by the application of the red precipitate ointment to the ulcers. Under this treatment we have repeatedly observed large ulcers of this kind heal with unusual rapidity.\n\nRest and a plain nourishing diet will be commonly best suited to people with chilblains; and should symptoms of debility and a floughing of the sore ensue, it may be even necessary to give freely wine and bark.\n\n**Sect. V. Of Cancer of the Skin.**\n\nThe skin is frequently attacked with cancer. That of the face is more particularly exposed to it; and this no doubt arises from its delicacy, from the great number of vessels which penetrate it, and perhaps also from its more frequent exposure than any other part of the body to external irritations. Cancer, however, is not confined to the skin of the face; it frequently appears on the back of the hands, and on the feet. Wifeman has seen it on the cranium, Gooch on the inside of the thigh, Richter at the umbilicus; and we have seen an example of it in the skin above the pubes.\n\nWhen cancer affects the skin, it begins in the form of a small, hard, and dark-coloured wart, which increases very slowly in size; the contiguous skin becomes hardened, forming a stool or button around the wart. The progress of the disease in the skin has been always observed to be more slow than cancer in any other part; so that it often remains in the form of a black scab for many years. The scab at last separates, and then an ulcer of the skin is exposed, having all the characters of the true cancerous sore. It has a pale colour, ragged hard edges, and unequal surface; and it gradually extends in an irregular manner along the skin; the hard tumor which forms its basis, at the same time increasing in size. Instead of pus, the ulcer discharges a thin ichor, which reddens and excoriates the adjacent skin. The disease which, when in the form of a scab gave little uneasiness, now becomes painful; and the patient feels more or less frequently sharp lancinating pains darting through the tumor, and extending from it to the adjacent soft parts.\n\nWhen a cancerous affection of the skin is examined after it is removed from the body, it has all the leading characters we have described in our general observations on cancer*. The great degree of hardness of the morbid mass, is produced from the formation of the hard fibrous-looking matter observed in all schirrous tumors; and the direction of its fibres will be generally found extending from the base of the tumor to the surface of the skin.\n\nCancer of the skin follows the same progress as cancerous affections of other textures; the contiguous glands become enlarged and ulcerate; and both the ulcers which these form, and the primary one, spread over whatever parts they meet, till they destroy the patient.\n\n**Treatment.**—The success which has been attributed to various medicines, particularly to arsenic and strong corrosive applications, in the cure of cancer, has been chiefly from the use of these medicines in cancerous affections of the skin. From the disease being observed in the skin before it has far advanced, from its slow progress in that part, and the ready application of remedies, it affords better opportunities of experiment than other parts of the body when affected with that disease. Past experience, however, leaves us but little room to hope for a cure of cancer in the skin by any external application with which we are as yet acquainted; and we know of no remedy to be trusted to but the complete excision of the diseased parts.\n\nThe more early the diseased skin is removed, the greater is the chance of a permanent cure of the disease. And in whatever part of the body the skin is affected, it is of the utmost importance to remove every part where there is the least suspicion of contamination. In the face, we have often observed the surgeon too anxious to save skin, with a view of lessening the blemish of an extensive scar; but in a disease so deplorable as cancer, no object of this kind can in any degree compensate for being exposed to the smallest risk of its return; the more so, especially as we have often remarked that a second operation is seldom if ever attended with permanent advantage. The surgeon, therefore, ought to lay it down as a general rule, to include in his incision a considerable portion of the sound skin surrounding the diseased parts.\n\nThe particular cases wherein an operation is advisable, must be left entirely to the judgement of the surgeon. The operation may be performed in all cases where the diseased parts appear to be within the reach of the knife; or if there are any glands affected, if these can be safely removed, it may be even under these circumstances undertaken, though no doubt the chance of a return of the disease in such cases is greater.\n\nWhenever the periosteum and parts surrounding any of the bones is affected, there is little chance from any assistance of art, except when the disease occurs in the extremities of the body, as in the hands or feet; for in such cases, amputation of the whole member may be performed.\nWhen cancerous fores appear about the eyelids, and spread along the conjunctiva, covering the eyeball, it is the only safe practice to remove the whole contents of the orbit. The different parts which compose the eyeball and its appendages, seem to have such a close connection with one another, that it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to mark the boundaries of the diseased action which is going on; and as the loss of any part of the organ prevents the others from performing their functions, it becomes no material object to save any particular part.\n\nIt is generally remarked, that the lips are particularly subject to cancer, at least in men; and that the under lip is more so than the upper one. The diseased part may be removed in this part of the body with great neatness upon the general principles of the operation of harelip. This can only be done when the diseased portion is small, and may be included by two incisions forming an angle, inclining towards the chin. See HARELIP. When, however, the disease has spread over a considerable portion of the lip, so as to prevent the sound parts from being united; after the diseased parts have been removed, all that can be done is to remove the parts affected, secure the bleeding vessels, and dress the sore like any other recent wound.\n\nBy a little ingenuity and contrivance, much may be sometimes done in making the incision in such a manner as to allow the sound parts to be afterwards brought together and united; so that in all cases of extensive disease, the surgeon should consider of all the different modes by which the diseased parts may be removed with most advantage.\n\nThe operation is performed by some with a common scalpel, by others with scissors. When the scalpel is used, the lip is to be held firmly with forceps by an assistant, and the second incision made along their edge; but when the disease extends beyond the adhesion of the lip to the jaw, no forceps are necessary.\n\nThe scissors are, however, the preferable instrument; they divide the lip with much less pain, and with a mathematical precision. When they are used for this purpose, it is necessary they be made thick and strong; and as in some people the lip is extremely thick, and apt to slip through the blades, instead of being divided. Giving the cutting edge of the blades a circular form will be found to be an improvement on the common straight edge. It is evident, however, that the scissors can only be employed in those cases where the forceps could be used to aid the knife. All wounds of the lip heal best and most accurately with the twisted sutures; so that the edges should be brought together in the same manner as has been recommended in the case of harelip, and the same mode of after-treatment is also to be pursued.\n\n**Sect. VI. Of Warts.**\n\nThere are two kinds of warts which grow upon the surface of the body; the one species is connected with the skin by a broad base; is of a hard, firm texture, unequal in the surface, and free from pain. Warts of this description are frequent in young people, and are generally found on the hands.\n\nThe other species of wart is attached to the skin by a slender pedicle; they have a very unequal surface, appearing as if composed of an aggregate of small tumors. Warts of this kind seldom attain any very considerable size, the largest scarcely exceeding that of a pea. They are seldom troublesome; but in some situations they become extremely irritable, and produce, especially when injured, very disagreeable sensations.\n\nThis species of wart is most frequently met with on the prepuce and glans of the penis; on the labiae; around the anus, and also frequently upon the hairy scalp. In these situations they sometimes acquire a very large size, numerous warts arising over the whole surface, and forming a mass of a cauliflower appearance. They are most frequent in people advanced in life, and are often connected with the venereal disease.\n\nBesides these, there are varieties of small warts which occur in different parts of the body, which have not been accurately described by authors. There is one variety where a number of small, whitish tumors appear in some parts of the face of children; these contain an opaque white fluid, which when discharged, and allowed to remain upon the contiguous skin, contaminates it, and produces warts of the same description.\n\n**Of the treatment of Warts.**—A variety of local remedies have been applied, both by medical men and the vulgar, for the curing of warts; and these generally possess a corrosive quality.\n\nLunar caustic is one of those which generally answers best, and is most easily managed for destroying the first species of warts which we have described. A saturine solution applied to the warts three or four times a day, or aqua ammoniae, and tincture of cantharides, have also been found beneficial in promoting their absorption.\n\nIn the second species, when the excrescences are very large, they should always be removed along with a portion of the adjacent skin, by the knife. In those cases where the warts are very numerous, and where, from their situation, it becomes impossible to remove them with the knife, equal portions of serugo eris and fayne powder, or fayne powder alone, will be found sometimes to succeed in removing them. In some cases, particularly where the warts are situated about the glans of the penis, we have found a saturated solution of the muriate of mercury in spirit of wine, completely answer the purpose. In those cases connected with syphilis, besides local applications, it is necessary to use mercury. Sometimes, indeed, the warts drop off whenever the mercury begins to affect the constitution.\n\n**Sect. VII. Of Corns.**\n\nA corn is a peculiar hardness of the epidermis, which sometimes extends to the subjacent skin. In the first case, the diseased part is removable; in the second case it is more fixed. It frequently elevates itself above the skin, and is unlike one species of wart. It is hard, dry, and inflexible, except when pressed upon the contiguous parts; and it resembles in colour and appearance the thickened cuticle on the hands of workmen. Corns commonly are formed on the toes and sides of the feet, and they are generally owing to the wearing of tight shoes. Sometimes corns do not occasion the least inconvenience; but in other instances they occasion so much\nmuch pain, that the patient can walk with difficulty. Corns are generally more painful in warm than in cold weather. The pain seems to arise from an inflamed state of the parts in the circumference of the corn, which state is excited and kept up by the pressure of the induration, and not from any sensibility in the corn itself. They are more painful in dry than in moist weather, because they become much more hard and dry.\n\nTreatment of Corns.—The pain and difficulty of walking produced by corns, may be alleviated by immersing them in warm water, and with a sharp instrument cutting off their external layers; much relief will also be found by covering the part with a piece of adhesive plaster, and by being careful not to wear shoes which are too tight. But what we have found a most complete cure for corns, is the application of one or other of those corrosive substances which were mentioned for the treatment of warts. The lunar caustic, or the saturated solution of muriate of mercury in spirit of wine, ought to be preferred. They may be applied once every second or third day, until the absorption of the corn be completed; and before using them, it will be found proper to pare off some of the external hard layers of the corn.\n\nSome corn-operators extirpate the corn by a sharp instrument; but this only proves a palliative treatment, for sooner or later a hard substance is again deposited.\n\nSect. VIII. Of Naevi Materni.\n\nNaevi materni are those marks which frequently appear upon the bodies of children at birth, and which are supposed to originate from impressions made on the mind of the mother during pregnancy. They are of various forms; their colour is likewise various, though most frequently resembling that of claret or port-wine. Many of these marks are perfectly flat, and never rise above the level of the skin; these do not require the assistance of surgery; but in some cases they appear in the form of small protuberances, which frequently increase to a great size in the course of a few months. They appear to be soft and fleshy; of a cellular texture, the cells containing liquid blood. They may be removed with little danger when not involving any important organ. They are supplied indeed more plentifully with blood than most other tumors are; and even sometimes they appear to be entirely formed of a congeries of small blood-vessels; but the arteries which supply them may be, for the most part, easily secured by ligature. An operation should never be long delayed; for as the size of the vessels corresponds with that of the tumor, they sometimes are so large as to throw out a good deal of blood before they can be secured. In performing it, the tumor is to be cut out, the arteries taken up, and the remaining skin brought as well together as the nature of the part will allow, and kept so by adhesive plaster or future.\n\nIf the whole tumor be removed, little hemorrhage generally follows; but if the smallest portion of the diseased vessels remain, not only a troublesome bleeding follows, but the tumor is quickly reproduced by an increased exuberance. Tumors of this kind have been also removed by ulceration excited by the application of corrosive substances; and a knowledge of this circumstance might be in some cases of practical application.\n\n---\n\nChap. III.\n\nOn the Diseases of Mucous Membranes.\n\nSect. I. General Remarks on the Pathology of the Mucous Membranes.\n\nThough at first sight it may appear that the mucous membranes are very considerable in number, yet when they are viewed more generally, they appear much more limited; and we will find that in whatever part of the body they be found, they are subject to the same morbid alterations of structure.\n\nThe ingenious Bichat has shown that there are two general mucous surfaces, of which the others are all portions. The one penetrates into the interior of the mouth, the nose, and the anterior surface of the eye. After lining these two first cavities, it is prolonged into the excretory ducts of the parotids, and submaxillary glands. It passes into all the sinuses, forms the conjunctiva, enters the lacrimal points, the nasal canal, the lacrimal sac, and is continued into the nose. It lines the pharynx and eustachian tube, the trachea and bronchiæ. It goes down the oesophagus into the stomach, and passes along the whole intestinal canal till it joins with the skin at the extremity of the rectum. This he calls the gastro-pulmonary mucous surface.\n\nThe other general mucous surface, the genito-urinary, begins in the male at the urethra; passes along that canal into the bladder, lines the bladder, vesiculae seminales, and vasa deferentia, along with their numerous branches. It also extends into the excretories of the prostatic gland, the ureters, and the pelvis of the kidneys.\n\nIn the female it begins at the vulva, penetrates the ureter, and passes as in the male over the urinary organs. It also enters the vagina, lines the womb and fallopian tubes, and is then continued with the peritoneum. This is the only example of a communication established between the mucous and serous surfaces.\n\nThis view of the extension of the mucous membranes is strongly exemplified by an examination of their diseases; for it will appear that there is not only an analogy between the different portions of the first, by an affection of the whole parts over which it extends, but there is also a line of demarcation between the two, from the one remaining found whilst the other is affected throughout. This last circumstance is confirmed in the history of many epidemic catarrhs; one of these membranes having been observed affected throughout, whilst the other remained unchanged. The epidemic observed at Paris in the year 1780 had this character. \"This epidemic (says Pinel *) which was very general in Paris, * Nofogra and with which I myself attacked, was remarkable, * philo- for it affected almost the whole mucous membranes, * sophique, that of the trachea and bronchiæ, the conjunctiva, the tom. ii. pituitary membrane, the palate, the pharynx, and the alimentary canal.\" The epidemic catarrh of 1752, described in the Memoirs of the Medical Society of Edinburgh, is an example of the same kind; for in all these, the mucous membrane lining the urinary and genital organs remained unaffected.\n\nWe also observe that an irritation of any part of a mucous membrane frequently creates a pain on a part of the membrane which was not irritated. Thus a calculus\nChap. III.\n\nSURGERY.\n\nInflammation of Mucous Membranes.\n\nThe coccus in the urinary bladder produces the chief pain at the point of the penis, and the pressure of worms in the intestines produces an itching at the nose.\n\nAmong these phenomena, which are purely sympathetic, it is seldom that a partial irritation of one of the mucous surfaces produces pain in any part of the other. The singular connection which subsists between the membranes of the uterus and bronchial mucous hemorrhages, however, is an example of this kind. If the blood accidentally cease to flow from the one during menstruation, the other frequently supplies the functions of the first, and exhales it. In cases of fracture, or thickening and disorganization of the mucous membranes of the urethra, the stomach is sometimes affected; this may also arise from the sympathy of the two mucous membranes.\n\nMucous membranes, from being constantly exposed to the action of the external air, or to the contact of extraneous substances, do not suffer, when displaced, like other parts of the animal economy. In a prolapse of the uterus or rectum, their mucous surfaces serve all the purposes of skin; and surrounding bodies do not produce more pain on them than on common skin. This is very different from the effects produced on opening a serous cavity or a capsule of any joint. The cellular, muscular, nervous, glandular, and other systems, when laid open, present also very different phenomena.\n\nThe mucous membrane, like the skin, is organized in such a manner as to endure with impunity the contact of external bodies; these merely producing an increased secretion of thin mucus. A sound introduced and retained in the bladder produces no alteration in the structure of the mucous membrane of the urethra; and for the same reason, a style or tube can be kept in the lacrymal duct without causing any irritation.\n\nMost of the diseases of mucous membranes come within the province of the surgeon; the others have been already treated of under the article MEDICINE.\n\nSect. II. Inflammation of Mucous Membranes.\n\nThe contact of extraneous and irritating substances, acid vapors, or the sudden exposure to cold air of any mucous surface, is often followed by some degree of inflammation.\n\nA preternatural degree of redness is a constant symptom of inflammation in most parts of the body; but the most remarkable character of inflammation in mucous membranes, and that which distinguishes it from all others, is the secretion of a puriform fluid. The mucus, which in the natural state is nearly transparent, and merely moistens the surface, becomes of a yellow color, and the quantity is so abundant as to form a purulent discharge. It is from the susceptibility of the mucous glands to be acted upon by any irritation which is applied to the extremities of their ducts, that the stone or any tumor in the bladder, polypi of the nose or vagina, are always accompanied by a profuse discharge.\n\nThe inflammation is accompanied with a more or less degree of thickening of the membrane; and sometimes this remains after all the inflammatory symptoms cease. The abatement of the inflammation is marked by an increase in the thickness of the discharge and a diminution in its quantity.\n\nWe have an example of inflammation affecting the mucous membrane of the nose in coryza, the ear in otitis, the urethra and vagina in gonorrhea, the bladder in catarrhus vesicæ, and the eye in the puriform ophthalmia, the lacrymal sac or duct in fistula lacrymalis. In all these diseases the symptoms have a striking analogy, and are varied only from the difference in the functions of the particular organ, the mucous covering of which has been affected.\n\nDuring life, mucous membranes become gangrenous much more seldom than the skin. This is proved from the consequences of catarrh, compared with those of erysipelas. There are, however, cases where this texture dies, whilst those adjacent continue to live; as in malignant angina.\n\nSect. III. Of the Inflammation of the Mucous Membrane of the Urethra.\n\nThe term gonorrhea is employed to signify a discharge of puriform matter from the orifice of the urethra or prepuce in men, and from the vagina in women (leucos). Whether it proceed from a syphilitic or any other irritating cause.\n\nThe gonorrhea may be defined a discharge of a contagious, puriform fluid, which comes from the mucous glands of the urethra, and membrane which lines that canal; or from the glans in men, and the interior of the genital organs in women. The disease seems to be produced by a virus sui generis.\n\nThis disease generally makes its appearance in three or four days, sometimes in six, but rarely later, after impure coition, with the following symptoms. The patient finds a particular itching and disagreeable sensation at the point of the yard, and a sort of flight itching also at the part of the urethra placed immediately under the frenum. This lasts one or two days, and on the following days the orifice of the urethra becomes fleshy and red; it also swells, and a limpid matter of a clear yellow color flows from it, which tinges the linen. Whilst the flow of this matter continues, the titillation becomes stronger and more painful, particularly in making water; for this leaves a burning impression and sharp pain in the affected part. In some individuals the first symptom presenting itself is the discharge of a thick mucus. In these cases the patient feels from the commencement a burning and painful sensation in making water. These symptoms generally increase in three or four days. Sometimes, however, that does not sensibly happen till after eight or twelve days. The glans acquires a deep red livid color; the discharge through it increases, and the matter becomes of a yellow, or greenish yellow color, resembling pus diluted. The swelling of the glans, and also of the whole penis, becomes considerable; the patient has frequently a desire to make water, and he finds, particularly when he has remained for some time in bed lying on his back, frequent and involuntary erections, and so painful that they disturb his sleep, and oblige him to rise out of bed.\n\nSuch is usually the progress of the disease when the inflammation is simple, slight, and superficial; but in many cases the inflammation extends farther and penetrates more deeply, affecting the reticular substances of the cavernous...\nGonorrhoea cavernous bodies of the urethra. Then the pain becomes excessive during erections, and the frenum of the glans is drawn downwards as by a cord, in such a manner that the body of the penis is forced upwards by the violence of the erection. It is this which is called cordic. It sometimes happens, that in this state the vessels of the urethra are torn, and thus occasion considerable haemorrhagy. At other times, the discharged matter is mixed with streaks of blood; the prepuce is also so much inflamed and swelled that it cannot be pulled back over the glans, or if it has been pulled back, it cannot be again brought forward. In some cases the strangulation which accompanies this last accident, produces a mortification of the glans, and even occasions the death of the patient; this, however, seldom happens.\n\nIn some persons one or more of the inguinal glands swell, become painful, and are attended with symptomatic fever. Often the glands of the penis swell also, a cord or knots can be felt on the back of the penis, and the skin is also swollen and painful. Besides these symptoms, the patient often feels, either from his own fault, or on account of bad treatment, a particular uneasy aching sensation, with tension and swelling of the spermatic cord and testicles, accompanied with a diminution, or even a complete suppression of the discharge by the urethra. In other cases the disease makes greater progress; the irritation and inflammation stretching along the canal of the urethra. All the symptoms then become more violent, the pain which is felt in the perineum or behind it, in making water, is so violent, that the patient is afraid to make the attempt, at the same time that he is frequently solicited by the fatiguing distillation at the neck of the bladder and anus. There is a perpetual desire to let off the water, whilst he can make no more than a few drops at a time with a burning pain. The whole canal of the urethra is swelled, and in a state of tension; the patient has frequent erections, and lancinating pains along the whole length of the canal, through the perineum and anus. He cannot lie down for a long time, nor can he rest seated. In this state the swelling of the glands of the urethra, and the spasmodic contraction of its internal membrane, obstruct the free passage of the urine, and allow it to flow in a very thin bifurcated stream, or drop by drop; and if at the same time the discharge diminishes considerably, or totally stops, a complete suppression of urine sometimes succeeds, occasioned by the inflammation and stricture of the neck of the bladder, or by the inflammation and swelling of the prostate gland and adjacent parts.\n\nIt sometimes happens that the inflammation of the urethra becomes so violent, that its internal surface, and the orifices of the glands which line it, secrete nothing; the same as we observe sometimes happens in inflammation of the mucous membrane of the nose and of the lungs. It is this state of the disease which some authors have described under the name of gonorrhoea sicca.\n\nAfter these symptoms have continued with more or less violence, or when they have increased during one, two, or three weeks, or even during six or seven, according to the treatment employed, they begin gradually to diminish. The difficulty and the frequent desire to make water cease; the erections are no longer painful; the matter acquires more consistence, and forms into threads between the fingers, and at last the discharge entirely disappears. In other cases, and these the most frequent, the inflammatory symptoms disappear by degrees; but the discharge remains during weeks, months, or even years. It is this form of the disease which is called gleet, or simply blennorrhea.\n\nSometimes the inflammatory symptoms disappear by degrees, and leave behind them in the urethra an ulcer, from which there is a malignant and purulent discharge, and which occasions an affection of the system. This is what has been called gonorrhoea complicata or ulcerosa; but it occurs rarely.\n\nIn other cases a contraction remains in the urethra; sometimes a paraphymosis continues, and sometimes there is a tumor of the testicles, a hardening of these parts or of some of the glands of the urethra, an inflammation of the prostate gland, with a more or less complete suppression of urine; at other times, though very rarely, the discharge, when suppressed, produces suddenly a perfect deafness, or most violent ophthalmia.\n\nThe exciting cause of syphilitic gonorrhoea is always the application of the specific virus to some part of the venereal mucous membrane lining the urethra. The contagious fluid, applied to any part of the body of a sound person, acts with more or less difficulty, according to the difference in the structure, the greater or less debility of the part, and also according to the particular constitution of the individual; for we see people who are exposed to every danger of infection, without ever having the disease even during their whole life. Perhaps also the more or less violence of the action of the virus depends sometimes on the greater or less degree of acrimony of the virus itself.\n\nThe seat of gonorrhoea, when it immediately proceeds from impure coition, is always at a small distance from the orifice of the urethra, under the frenum, at that part of the canal where we observe a dilatation, called fossa navicularis. All gonorrhoeas which are situated more anteriorly on the curvature of the penis, in the verum montanum, the neck of the bladder, or in the bladder itself, arise from bad treatment, or from some cause which has stopped or suppressed the primary discharge.\n\nSometimes by the natural progress of the disease, and more frequently from faults committed by the patient, or by the effects of improper remedies, the inflammation and irritation are apt to change their place. They often occupy the orifice of a mucous gland which opens at the first turn of the penis. At other times they affect the two glands of Cowper. Sometimes they occupy the protuberances which cover the orifices of the seminal vesicles; and they also sometimes take place in the prostate gland, or in the neck of the bladder.\n\nIn some rare cases the contagious virus does not penetrate during the inflammation into the urethra, but applied to the extremity of the penis, it fixes itself upon the corona of the glans, and irritating the excretory ducts of the sebaceous glands there, produces a discharge which has been called the gonorrhoea of the glans.\n\nWhen the urethra of a person who has laboured under gonorrhoea is laid open, no ulcer is almost ever found upon the surface of the internal membrane; and in those who have suffered much in consequence of the disease, there is merely a thickening and contraction of one or more parts.\nChap. III.\n\nSURGERY.\n\nGonorrhoea parts of the urethra. Sometimes, though very rarely, excrescences are formed within it. The ducts of the mucous glands are obliterated, and the prostatic gland and bladder changed in their structure.\n\nIt has been a matter of great dispute among those who have written on the venereal disease, whether the gonorrheal and venereal virus are the same. In this controversy a number of very futile arguments have been brought forward. It is a striking fact, however, which the practical man must have always in view, that the venereal disease is never cured without mercury; whilst a gonorrhoea, however virulent, never requires that remedy. This difference in the treatment of the diseases some authors have attempted to explain, from the difference in the structure of the parts affected. It is remarkable, however, that the matter from the gonorrhoea never affects the skin, producing chancre; but that when its virus is applied to the vagina, or to the urethra of another person, gonorrhoea is the consequence. When it affects the prepuce too, it produces, in place of chancre, a morbid discharge from the sebaceous glands of that organ. It is also a striking fact, in the history of gonorrhoea, that however long it may remain, it never produces any constitutional affection. All these circumstances in the history of the disease, in its progress and symptoms, and in its cure, being so dissimilar to those of the venereal disease, are surely sufficient grounds to consider gonorrhoea and syphilis as two distinct morbid affections, and different from one another as much as any two diseases of the animal economy.\n\nTreatment.—All the forms of the venereal disease, when they are left to themselves, undermine and destroy the constitution; but gonorrhoea ceases without the resources of art, particularly if during its course the patient live a sober and regular life. The irritability of the urethra, the constitution of the patient, the faults in his diet, and his exercise and choice of remedies, and perhaps also the nature of the virus itself, which is more or less acrid, and of which the action will be more or less violent, often renders gonorrhoea a very severe disease. Experience confirms, that the sooner proper remedies are applied, and the sooner the patient is cured, the less he suffers; and the more certainly he avoids the disagreeable accidents which are to often the consequence of that disease. From this consideration, it is evidently of importance, either to prevent the disease entirely, or destroy it in its beginning. Two means have been proposed to accomplish these ends; one is, to remove the virus before it can act on the parts exposed to it; the other destroys and alters its nature, and prevents these effects from the moment that it gives the first signs of its action.\n\nDifferent practitioners have tried and recommended various prophylactic remedies. Some have applied mercurial ointment upon the surface of the glans and prepuce, immediately after coition, and others different kinds of lotions and injections, as caustic alkali, lime water, alcohol diluted with water; these preparations being injected seven or eight times a-day, for several days after the commencement of the discharge.\n\nBy the use of injections the irritation is diminished, and the progress of the inflammation stopped; and when the discharge becomes thicker during their use, they ought to be continued eight or ten days after it has disappeared; for if we were to give up too soon the use of Gonorrhoea, these injections, the inflammation and discharge would increase. In this case it is necessary to make the injection stronger, and to use it more frequently. The advantages to be derived from this practice do not seem, however, to be altogether confirmed; and it is to be wished, that enlightened and prudent practitioners would make some decisive experiments to determine whether injections are useful or hurtful in the commencement of gonorrhoea.\n\nWhen inflammation has taken place, and when the discharge and other symptoms of gonorrhoea are completely formed, a different mode of treatment ought to be pursued. Repose, abstinence from all kinds of irritating food, spices, wine, &c., will contribute much to allay the irritation.\n\nIn order to defend the irritable parts against the acrid matter, and to moderate the symptoms of inflammation, authors have recommended the use of mucilaginous, oily, and sedative applications. That which renders the urethra in man so violently affected by gonorrhoea, and so different from catarrh, is not from the difference of structure in the organ, which has been supposed to be more irritable than the mucous membrane of the nose and other parts of the body. It is the faults of the urine passing along the urethra, which keeps up the irritation produced by the virus. It has been proposed, in order to remedy this source of irritation, to give gum arabic or the infusion of linseed internally; but these, when taken in the necessary quantities, generally injure the stomach. An infusion of hemp has been found by Swedius to answer all the purposes, and not to be subject to the inconveniences of the others. This remedy may be rendered more agreeable to take, by adding a little sugar to it; and in some cases a weak decoction of farfara pilula may be advantageously added. All these drinks should be taken cold, or at least nearly milk-warm, and in small doses frequently repeated.\n\nThe antiphlogistic regimen must also be pursued in the treatment of gonorrhoea. The patient ought to avoid all exercise, or high-seasoned food. Lint, wet with a saturating solution, should be kept constantly applied to the penis; and the patient should keep his bowels open with saline purgatives. When the symptoms of inflammation are considerable, and the pulse hard and frequent, bleeding becomes necessary, either general or topical; the constant application of fomentations and emollient poultices is also useful. Swedius has advised, that camphor and the nitrate of potash should be given internally, and this should be continued according to its effects. Camphor alone, taken in the form of emulsion with sugar or fresh egg, is an efficacious remedy in allaying the pain and ardor urine. The use of camphor has also been recommended externally, with a view to allay the cordee.\n\nThese remedies ought to be continued as long as the pain and symptoms of inflammation in the urethra continue. After they are abated, the patient may be allowed a better diet, in order to prevent the urethra from being affected with a chronic gonorrhoea or gleet. Injections made of the extract of opium with acetate of lead, applied frequently from the commencement of the disease, contribute much to shorten it, and allay the accompanying pain. Sometimes, however, even the most mild injections do harm, from a particular irritable state of the urethra.\nSURGERY.\n\nGonorrhoea urethra. Great advantage has also been obtained by some, in very aggravated cases of the disease, by frictions of mercurial ointment on the perineum, and along the course of the urethra, or by mercurial fumigations applied to the genital organs, and even by the injection of mercurial ointment into the urethra.\n\nOn the other hand, when the symptoms of erysipelasous inflammation prevail; when the patient is feeble, and of an irritable temperament; when he feels better after dinner; when the discharge is clear and profuse, accompanied with sharp pain, often lancinating throughout the whole urethra; and if the pulse is feeble and frequent, it is more advisable to give him a less rigid diet; to allow him the moderate use of wine, and in some cases to give him opium and bark internally. We are sometimes surprised at the sudden changes which these remedies in such cases produce. The use of opium also contributes much to prevent cordic; and in all cases this ought to be avoided as much as possible, by fixing the penis downwards, and in making the patient lie on his side upon a mattress, which answers better than lying upon the back, and in a feather bed.\n\nIf in consequence of the violence of the inflammation the discharge stops, and the posterior parts of the urethra begin to be affected, we should have recourse to the warm bath, or apply vapours to the part, by placing the patient upon a vessel containing boiling water, and this should be repeated three or four times a-day; the patient should keep his bed, and an emollient cataplasm applied upon the penis, which should be renewed every hour. All kinds of injections in such cases are hurtful. The same treatment is also applicable when the discharge is stopped by the use of acrid and astringent injections, or by injections improperly used, or by the improper use of turpentine and balsams.\n\nWhen the prostrate glands and the neck of the bladder are affected, and the patient of a plethoric habit, it becomes necessary to bleed profusely, either at the arm, or by applying a number of leeches to the perineum. In all these cases, a sedative clyster repeated every seven or eight hours, and a general or local warm bath used twice a-day, are the best remedies which can be used. Sometimes a blister applied to the perineum is also useful.\n\nThe swelling of the lymphatic glands of the groin which sometimes takes place, is purely symptomatic, and disappears along with the inflammatory symptoms of the urethra.\n\nIn all cases of gonorrhoea the patient should wear a suspensory bandage whilst the disease continues*. It is also useful to persons who are obliged to take exercise, to wear a convenient bandage round the penis, which may be united to the suspensory in such a manner, that the penis may be enclosed in a kind of case, and thus defended from external injuries, from cold, and from friction; this bandage being kept constantly clean, by often changing the caddis, which is placed in its cavity. For this purpose, a hole should be left in the bag, covered by the caddis, which the patient can take away each time he makes water. Another general precaution which it is useful to make, is never to keep the penis bound up high, but to keep it low, in order that the matter may flow out freely, and may not pass backwards along the urethra.\n\nThe gonorrhoea which takes place in the glans and prepuce is generally easily cured, by injecting frequently warm milk between the glans and prepuce, and by keeping the penis in an emollient poultice. In those cases where the prepuce is so swollen that it cannot be pulled back, we ought to have recourse to sedative injections.\n\nIt is a useful general rule, which ought to be observed in all cases of gonorrhoea, to touch the parts affected as little and as seldom as possible; and every time that it is touched, to wash the hands immediately afterwards, and with the greatest care, fearing that, by carrying them unintentionally upon the eyes, nose, &c., these organs might be inoculated with the disease.\n\nGonorrhoea in women is seldom followed by violent symptoms, or by so severe and dangerous consequences as in men. In some cases the symptoms are so slight, that they conceive the discharge, particularly at its commencement, to be nothing but the whites, to which disease a great many are subject, especially in the large towns of Europe.\n\nThe gonorrhoea in women has been supposed by many authors to have its seat in the cavities of the urethra. This, however, will not be found to be the case. The disease is seated, either upon the clitoris, or on the orifice of the urethra; upon the nymphæ, or in the cavity of the vagina; or even upon the inferior commissure.\n\nWith regard to the treatment, we have the same indications to fulfil in gonorrhoea in women as in men, with this difference, that one can see the change of structure in these parts, and thus, from the seat of the disease, employ proper injections and lotions from the beginning.\n\nPrecautions in using Injections.—The syringe used in men for this purpose ought to have a short point of a conical form and of a thickness proportioned, that at more than its extremity may pass into the orifice of the urethra*. The body of the syringe should be perfectly cylindrical, and the piston ought to play very accurately; for if the piston does not fit the body of the syringe, the injection, instead of passing into the urethra, regurgitates between the piston and the syringe. From the unsteadiness of the motion of the piston, the point of the syringe is apt to move suddenly on the urethra, and injure its thin and delicate membrane. To prevent any injury of this kind, we have employed with great advantage, particularly if the mouth of the syringe is made of metal, a small strip of caddis wrapped in a spiral manner round the mouth of the syringe, so as nearly to expose its point. If the disease is seated near the point of the urethra, the patient should be attentive to compress with one hand the urethra above the arch of the pubis, where the scrotum commences, whilst with the other hand he holds and guides the syringe. The liquid should be thrown in gently, and so slightly to distend the urethra; the liquid is to be kept for a minute or two, and the same operation repeated two or three times in succession.\n\nThe liquid employed should always be used warm, which may be easily done by filling a cup with the necessary quantity, and placing the cup in a basin of boiling water.\n\nIt often happens, particularly in young people, that\nafter having used injections some time with advantage, they become less attentive in using them, and neglect them even for a day. This omission is always followed with bad consequences, the discharge returning with double force; and the patient is obliged to continue the injections during some weeks more than would have been necessary, if the use of the remedy had not been interrupted.\n\nIn order, therefore, to prevent the danger of a relapse, it is always prudent to advise patients to inject three, four, or even six times a day, if the circumstances demand it, and to continue the same two or three times a day regularly for at least ten or fifteen days after the discharge has entirely ceased.\n\nFor women the canula ought to be larger and longer. A canula of ivory, an inch in diameter, and two or three inches in length, fixed to a bottle of elastic gum, is the most convenient form of a syringe.\n\nOf Gleet.\n\nIt very often happens, that after the specific inflammation of the urethra is removed, from which gonorrhea is supposed to originate, a discharge still continues. This discharge is not attended with pain, nor can it be communicated from one person to another. The matter which escapes is generally of a tenacious consistence, and of a yellow colour, appearing to be composed of globules, mixed with a mucous fluid. When a cure cannot be performed, either by the use of injections, or by bougies, it has sometimes been proposed to inject liquids capable of exciting irritation and inflammation in the affected part of the urethra. It is probably from this principle that some gleets have been cured by violent exercise on horseback, or a long journey. There have also been examples of similar cases cured by coition; but this is a cure not to be recommended, as there always may be a risk of communicating the disease to the women. A blister, applied externally to the part affected, or to the perineum, has also been found useful. The cold bath has often been recommended in obstinate gleets, from which good effects often result; but there are other cases in which it seems to increase the discharge.\n\nIt is also proper to change the injection; for it is observed that an injection less strong sometimes produces a good effect, after a stronger one has been employed without success, and vice versa. In many cases it is useful to combine the use of internal medicines with external means. The chief of these are mercurial preparations, balsamic and resinous substances, and tonics. Swediaur has used, with much success, in gleets, pills made of turpentine and oxide of mercury. Among the resinous substances which are employed, the most common is the balsam of copaiba. The best way of taking this remedy is to give the patient thirty or forty drops in a small glass of cold water morning and evening, or from fifty to eighty drops for one dose in the middle of the day, and afterwards to take, in a small glass of water, twenty drops of the elixir of vitriol, which renders the balsam less disagreeable to the stomach. Half a dram of turpentine, of the balsam of Tolu, or of the balsam of Canada, answers the same end. Swediaur mentions the case of a young man, who, having been for a long time distressed with a very obstinate gleet, swallowed at once between two and three ounces of the balsam of copaiba, and was cured.\n\nSometimes the balsams, combined with tincture of guaiac, or with kino, produce a defecatory effect.\n\nAmong the corroborant or tonic remedies, the kino, which we have already mentioned, is one of the most useful; the cinchona also in powder or infusion in red wine, or, which is still better, in lime water; tormentilla in powder, or in extract, in the form of pills, joined, according to circumstances, with preparations of iron, Glauber's salts, are useful and efficacious remedies. The tincture of cantharides, given in a dose from twenty to thirty drops, has often been found a most useful remedy. It is one, however, which ought to be given with precaution, as it might do much harm to people of a delicate and irritable temperament.\n\nThere are, however, cases, where all our efforts to cure a gleet are fruitless; and we sometimes see, that nature alone can in time succeed, after we have uselesslessly tried all the resources of art.\n\nThere sometimes remains a species of cordece or curvature of the penis after all the symptoms of gonorrhoea have disappeared. Frictions, with mercurial ointment, with camphorated oil, spirituous lotions, or electricity applied to the part, are most appropriate remedies in such cases.\n\nIn all cases of obstinate gleet, which are situated far back in the canal of the urethra, the state of the prostate gland should be carefully examined; for they often arise from a disease in that part. When the prostatitis is found swollen and hard, Swediaur has seen instances where, after a mercurial treatment, the repeated application of cupping-glasses to the perineum, and the use of large doses of the conium maculatum, has succeeded, other remedies having failed.\n\nThe gonorrhoea of the prostate is a morbid discharge of mucus from that gland, mixed sometimes with the liquor of the seminal vesicles; and it takes place principally through the day, without any venereal defect. This disease is soon followed by feebleness and general debility, with emaciation of the whole body, and even death; particularly if the patient has not employed proper remedies.\n\nThe remedies most efficacious are the cold bath, injections of metallic salts, fomentations of hemlock, blisters to the perineum, and internally tonic medicines, with a well-regulated diet.\n\nSect. II. Of Inflammation of the Mucous Membrane of the Nose.\n\nInflammation of the mucous membrane of the nose is generally preceded by dryness in the nostrils, with an itching feeling, and with a weight over the forehead. It is also accompanied with sneezing and an increased flow of tears. The secretion of mucus from the nose is at first diminished, and afterwards becomes very abundant. At first it is limpid and irritates the found skin of the upper lip, over which it passes, and becomes afterwards opaque, of a yellowish white colour, and a disagreeable odour. This state is sometimes accompanied by fever, and it continues for a longer or shorter period. Most commonly it ceases at the end of a few days. It sometimes, however, becomes chronic and indetermined, in which case it is often intermittent, and reappears at regular intervals.\nCoryza, like all other inflammations of the mucous membranes, terminates by resolution. It sometimes passes into the state of chronic catarrh, and it also occasions an ulceration of the mucous membrane of the nose; but this is extremely rare.\n\nCoryza is frequently accompanied with inflammation of the mucous membrane of the eye, it also spreads in many instances along the eustachian tube, producing deafness, and it is very apt also to pass down the trachea and affect the lungs.\n\nThe nose is sometimes affected with a discharge of thick viscid mucus, when there is very little apparent redness or pain. Such instances are often connected with the formation of polypi; but we have observed several cases, where no other symptom than the mucous discharge appeared, and where the disease had very much the general character of some discharges from the urethra.\n\nTreatment.—Coryza is commonly an affection so slight, and of such short duration, that it is seldom necessary to employ any means to produce an abatement of its symptoms. Sometimes, however, the symptoms go to a very high degree, and it is then that emollient vapours directed into the nasal cavities are particularly indicated. If much symptomatic fever accompanies the disease, it may be advisable to draw some blood from the arm, and in all cases a brisk purgative will be found to relieve the fullness and uneasiness in the head. When the inflammation spreads along the mucous membrane of the trachea, it becomes the more necessary to use every means to alleviate the inflammatory symptoms, and to prevent the inflammation affecting the mucous membrane of the bronchi.\n\nPatients labouring under this disease, feel remarkable relief from living in a warm atmosphere; and the symptoms of inflammation of the nose and trachea will be much alleviated by the internal exhibition of opium.\n\nWhen the inflammation and the discharge are of a chronic nature, astringent injections, or a douché kept in similar solutions, kept in the nose during the night, are in such cases the most useful applications. They gradually diminish the quantity of the discharge, and render it more thick and tenacious; and the sense of smelling, which is commonly destroyed, is gradually restored.\n\nIf the discharge be fetid, and occasionally mixed with blood, in all probability it originates from the formation of an abscess or ulcer, connected with a carious bone.\n\nSect. III. Of the Inflammation of the Mucous Membrane of the Ear (Otitis).\n\nIn inflammation of the ear, there is the same characters deduced from analogy of structure, as in other mucous membranes. The principal causes of this disease are sudden changes in the atmosphere; above all, the change from heat to cold, or from dryness to moisture; coldness of the nights, north winds, suppression of any regular discharge, the crises of acute diseases, metatarsis, the presence of an irritating body in the ear, or the imprudent application of oily or spirituous substances.\n\nThe inflammation sometimes takes place in the meatus auditorius; and in other cases it is confined to the cavity of the tympanum and eustachian tube. In the first case, there is more or less pain, and buzzing in the ears, and afterwards a discharge of thin reddish yellow matter. This matter gradually becomes white and opaque, and increases in consistence till the termination of the disease; when it differs in nothing from the wax of the ear, but in its white colour. This affection generally lasts twelve or fifteen days. It sometimes spreads to the external parts of the ear, and often passes into a chronic state.\n\nWhen the inflammation is confined to the cavity of the tympanum, it produces an obscure tingling sensation, and a feeling of tension, which the patient supports without much inconvenience; but most frequently the inflammation is propagated from the cavity of the tympanum along the eustachian tube. In this case, the pains become more violent and extend along the contiguous mucous surfaces; they pass from the interior of the ear into the throat; there is great difficulty in swallowing, and the food, when passing through the pharynx, gives a sensation as if the skin had been eroded. The motions of the neck also become uneasy, and the smallest attempt to cough, to sneeze, or blow the nose, produces a painful sensation in the ear. The patient also complains of a floppage in the nose, of a frequent dry cough, and of pain in the head, and more or less fever in the evening. The ear also feels hard and distended, and there is generally deafness, particularly towards the end of the disease. Soon all these symptoms diminish except the hardness in the ear, which augments continually till the fifteenth or twentieth day.\n\nMost commonly after this period, a quantity of fecal matter is suddenly discharged into the external ear, or into the throat, and then all the symptoms disappear. This discharge generally diminishes daily, and in a short time ceases altogether. At other times, particularly in young people, it continues, and becomes chronic.\n\nTreatment.—When the inflammation is confined to the external meatus, the disease is generally so slight that it may be allowed to run though its common periods, and it is merely necessary to keep the patient warm. When the inflammation is very considerable, the mildest injections give pain, and in place of moderating the symptoms, they increase the irritation. We ought therefore to do nothing, except, perhaps, to allow some warm vapour to pass into the ear, and to pursue the antiphlogistic regimen. About the twelfth or fifteenth day, it may be useful to apply tonic medicines, such as aromatic alcohol dipped in a piece of cotton. When the inflammation is in the tympanum, or the eustachian tube, besides emollients, it will be also necessary to give some brisk purgative, or to employ local or general blood-letting. If the membrane of the drum is much distended, and accompanied with violent pains, it has been even proposed to make an opening through the tympanum*. When the matter has been discharged from the tympanum either spontaneously or artificially, little more is required to be done, unless the disease assumes a chronic form. This is more frequent in children. We often see the purulent discharge continue in them for many months, and some of the small bones of the ear become carious, and are discharged along with the matter. In such cases small doses of calomel, for some time repeated, blisters applied behind the ear, and injections of lime water...\nwater combined with muriate of mercury, acetate of lead and the like, should be employed.\n\n**Sect. IV. Of Angina.**\n\nThe parietes of the mouth, trachea, and larynx, are often inflamed in catarrhal affections, and present symptoms which vary according to the intensity of the disease, and particular seat of the affected membrane.\n\nAngina has therefore been distinguished according to its seat in the tonsils, the trachea, the pharynx, and larynx.\n\nWhen the patient has great difficulty in swallowing his food, and when the pain stretches in chewing, to the ear along the eustachian tube, by a sort of crepitation, and if, on inspection of the throat, the amygdalae and edge of the palate appear much inflamed, along with an abundant excretion of mucus, the angina has its seat principally in the amygdalae.\n\nAngina affects the pharynx when deglutition is difficult or impossible, and the food is returned by the nose, respiration at the same time not being impeded. This inflammation is also visible by examining the bottom of the mouth.\n\nBut if the deglutition is difficult; if no redness is perceived at the bottom of the throat, and if the patient has great difficulty in respiring, a sharp pain in the motions of the larynx, the voice acute but weak, and the speech short, we may then conclude that the inflammation has attacked the larynx, or upper part of the wind-pipe. An affection of this kind, though a few cases have been known to take place in adults, generally attacks children under twelve years of age. It is known by the name of croup.\n\nWhen the inflammation affects the amygdalae, inhaling steams of warm water and vinegar will often be found to give great relief. A poultice, too, applied to the outside of the throat, assists in lessening the tension of the inflamed parts. Though in many cases the inflammation seems to be confined to the mucous covering of the glands, yet in others it spreads into the glandular substance, where it generally advances to suppuration and abscesses. In such cases, the early discharge of the matter gives great and immediate relief; and though no matter has been formed, puncturing the inflamed part with a sharp instrument often produces an alleviation of all the symptoms. The instrument delineated in Plate DXIV, fig. 14, is well calculated for these purposes. By altering the position of the screw in the handle, the depth of the cutting part of the instrument may be regulated. When it is to be used, the fore finger of the left hand is to be introduced down the mouth, and the perforator concealed in the canula introduced as a director. When the extremity of the canula reaches the inflamed part, the perforator may be then safely pushed into it, of a sufficient depth, which had been previously regulated.\n\nWhen the inflammation affects the pharynx, relief will also be obtained by inhaling the steam of warm water, and by employing antiphlogistic remedies. In croup, calomel has been found to have a specific effect; and it is astonishing the quantity that has been given to infants for the cure of that disease. See Medicine.\n\nWhen the effusion which takes place in croup, is chiefly confined to the upper part of the larynx, and produces symptoms of suffocation, it has been proposed of the catarrh of the bladder, to make an artificial opening into the trachea below, where the matter is effused, in order to save the life of the patient. See Bronchotomy.\n\n**Sect. V. Of the Catarrh of the Bladder.**\n\nThe ureters, the bladder, and the urethra, are all liable to be affected with catarrhal affections from general causes, the same as those affections of the mucous membranes which have been already mentioned; and besides, the surfaces of the mucous membranes of these parts are exposed to the action of particular causes, namely, the ureters and the bladder to calculi, and the urethra to the venereal virus.\n\nThe catarrh of the bladder is more frequent among men than among women; and old people are more subject to it, than those at any other period of life. It is often produced by the internal use of cantharides, by acid diuretics, and by the progres of hemorrhage from the urethra. The sudden exposure to cold, suppressed perspiration, the disappearance of different diseases of the skin, of rheumatism, and of gout, are followed almost suddenly by this catarrh. Other circumstances may also give rise to the chronic catarrh of the bladder. The presence of a calculus or any foreign body, the continual application of bougies, a swelling of the prostate gland; and above all, strictures of the urethra.\n\nThis disease is marked by pains of the bladder, and at the point of the urethra, both before, and whilst making water. The injection of the urethra is more or less difficult, according to the action of the bladder, and of the freedom of the passage of the urethra. The hypogastric region is tense, and the urine presents variety of colours; it is sometimes whitish, or reddish, or of a deep yellow colour; it is muddy, and it exhales an odour of ammonia, which becomes more sensible a short time after it has cooled. It also forms, in most common cases, a mucus, which mixes and comes away with the urine in the form of glairy filaments, and which is afterwards deposited at the bottom of the vessel, in the form of the tenacious glairy substance, resembling somewhat the white of egg.\n\nThe chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of the bladder, may be accompanied with an ulceration of the kidneys or bladder; the mucus discharged then becomes of a greenish yellow colour, sometimes mixed with streaks of blood. It is deposited slowly, is mixed easily among the urine, and in water; it has little viscosity, or fetor, and does not coagulate by ebullition. The other symptoms which accompany this excretion, as fever, pain, wasting of the flesh, sufficiently distinguish this double affection of the bladder. The chronic catarrh is subject to return with intolerant pain in the region of the pubis and perineum, accompanied with restlessness and anxiety. These intermissions are irregular, and may remain some weeks.\n\nTreatment.—The matter which exists in the mucous membrane of the bladder, and that of other membranes of the same name, is sufficient to point out the means which are to be employed in its treatment. The warm bath, and mucilaginous drinks, are particularly indicated at the beginning of the acute catarrh; but the tendency which it has to become chronic, ought to make us cautious\nStrictures.\n\nious in not prosecuting debilitating remedies too far. Opium should be employed with great prudence, notwithstanding the intensity of the pain; and as this is often the result of the distention of the bladder, from the accumulation of urine, it is sometimes necessary to have recourse to the introduction of the catheter.\n\nThe chronic catarrh of the bladder is generally difficult to cure, and the more so, if it occur in old age: if it arises from the pressure of a stone in the bladder, there is no cure but the operation of lithotomy; if it arises from metaltasias, rheumatism, or any other disease, we ought to employ remedies to the skin and intestinal canal, and pour tonic injections into the bladder. The uva ursi has also been found a useful remedy. Exercise, dwelling in dry and elevated places, the use of woollen clothes next the skin, contribute often more to the cure of this disease, than the use of medicines, and they ought always to be combined.\n\nThe conjunctiva covering the eye-ball, eye-lids, and lacrymal passages, are also subject to inflammation; but these will be treated of among the diseases of the eye and its appendages.\n\nSect. V. General Remarks on Strictures.\n\nThe term stricture has been usually applied to a contraction of the urethra; generally arising from a thickening of the mucous membrane lining that canal. This change of structure is not, however, confined to the mucous membrane which lines the urethra; the same morbid alteration takes place in the oesophagus, in the eustachian tube and meatus externus, in the maxillary sinus, in the bladder, in the lacrymal passages, and in all canals lined by mucous membranes. Strictures, however, occur much more frequently in the urethra, and are there more pernicious than in any other part. They appear also sometimes in the upper part of the oesophagus. A similar change has been observed in the internal part of the bladder. Bichat found the membrane lining the maxillary sinus several lines in thickness, and the canals of the tympanum much thickened*; and reasoning from analogy, and from what we may observe by an attentive examination of the symptoms of many cases, of what is usually called fistula lacrymalis, there is little doubt but a contraction and thickening often take place of the mucous membrane lining the lacrymal sac and duct, and produce that disease.\n\nThis change in the structure of mucous membranes is always the consequence of inflammation; and when the membrane is thus altered, the discharge, instead of being healthy mucus, is generally a puriform fluid, apparently a mixture of pure mucus and globules of pus.\n\nSect. VI. Of Strictures in the Urethra.\n\nThe treatment of the diseases of the bladder and urethra has always been considered a difficult branch of surgery, as their true nature is often obscure, and as it is by no means easy to direct the proper means of relief.\n\nOf the great variety of causes which disturb the functions of these organs, strictures in the urethra are perhaps the most frequent, and most serious. They prevent the free evacuation of the bladder; greatly disturb, if not entirely destroy the function of generation; and often give origin to constitutional symptoms which sometimes increase to an alarming degree, and even prove fatal.\n\nThat the urethra should be subject to many morbid changes, we may infer, not only from our knowledge of the functions it performs, but also from its delicate and no less complicated structure.\n\nOne part of this structure is intended for the evacuation of the urinary bladder, the other for the transmission of the seminal fluid; and as in the exercise of this last function, the urethra sympathizes, in a greater or lesser degree, with the whole system, and also with the mind itself, it must have a connection with many of the other organs of the body.\n\nAccordingly, we find that patients who have obstructions in the urinary canal, have at the same time other complaints, which get well when the obstruction is removed. And, on the other hand, diseases of other parts bring on morbid affections of the urethra, which are cured along with the original complaint.\n\nThe whole extent of the urinary canal is lined by a delicate membrane, which is constantly covered with a viscid fluid, secreted by numerous glands, whose ducts open on its internal surface by orifices which are called lacunae.\n\nIt is highly vascular, and is endowed with so much nervous sensibility, that irritating bodies applied to it often affect, or even derange the whole system.\n\nIt has a considerable degree of contractility, is evidently elastic, and perhaps may possess a muscular power, although no muscular coat has yet been demonstrated; but to whatever cause this contractility be owing, it is well known it does not contract upon irritation.\n\nAs a proof of this contractile power, a remarkable case is mentioned by Mr Cline in his lectures, where a stone was lying in the membranous part of the urethra one evening, which during sleep had been expelled and was found among the bed clothes the following morning.\n\nThe contraction which forms a stricture in the urethra may take place round the whole circumference of the canal; it may arise chiefly at a particular point of the circumference; or, it may extend along a considerable extent of its surface, and thus produce obstructions of different forms.\n\nThe stricture once begun, continues no longer than the cause which first produced it continues to operate. But if the parts are kept long in this state of contraction they generally are attended with a degree of inflammation; the membrane of the urethra acquires a morbid degree of thickness; the surrounding parts are altered in structure; and this change of form and appearance remains after the cause which originally produced them has ceased to operate.\n\nThat spasmodic strictures do exist appears from the impressions made on bougies which have been passed through them, and from the examination of the parts after death; for although complete obstructions to the bougie were found when alive, yet not the smallest remains can be observed on dissection. This contraction is peculiarly violent, and from what we have seen more frequent, at the fossa navicularis than at any other part of the canal.\n\nA gentleman, after many attempts to make water during the night, was not able to pass a drop, and he applied for relief in the morning. A bougie was introduced, and met with a complete obstruction at the glans, which\nStrictures, which yielded in a few seconds after the bougie was in close contact with it; on being withdrawn the urine flowed freely, and the complaint has never since returned.\n\nContractions at this place are sometimes so violent as for a long time to interrupt the entrance of the bougie; and in one case it was so strong as nearly to cut the instrument through, after it was introduced. What is remarkable, this happened repeatedly with the same patient.\n\nWhen there has been a permanent stricture, the natural structure of the urethra is changed, and the morbid alterations it has undergone may be seen on dissection. There is commonly a contraction at one particular part of the canal; and the appearance of it has been compared to that which would have been given had a pack-thread been tied round it, or in slight cases it is a mere narrowing.\n\nWhen a ridge is formed projecting into the cavity of the canal, it is found to be a doubling of the inner membrane, with the cellular substance lying between the fold. The internal membrane itself is diseased; it assumes a whitish colour; becomes much harder, sometimes as hard as cartilage; and in some cases this change is confined to the doubling of the stricture itself, whilst in others it extends into the cavernous bodies. These ridges or folds often form over one another, so that the intermediate portion of urethra becomes preternaturally contracted also; but it never becomes so narrow as at those parts where the original strictures were formed. Instead of a distinct curtain or fold, it happens also in some cases that the urethra has the appearance of a cone gradually converging before the stricture, and diverging in the same manner behind it.\n\nThe contraction is generally round the whole of the circumference of the urethra; but it sometimes happens that it is only at one side, and in such cases the urethra does not form a uniform tube, but it becomes serpentine and contorted in various directions.\n\nWhen one stricture is formed, that portion of the urethra anterior to it is liable to suffer some changes, and these probably arise from its not meeting with the ordinary diffusion, the stream of urine being diminished. It is by no means uncommon, therefore, to find in those cases where the original stricture has been formed near the bladder, another stricture anterior to it, so that when an obstruction is found at the glans or four inches and a half from it, another is generally met with at seven inches, or at the bulb.\n\nFrom the peculiarity in the form of the urethra, some parts are subject to strictures much more frequently than others.\n\nIn the adult, and in the relaxed state, the urinary canal is about nine inches long, and nearly of the same diameter as a common quill; but its size varies at three different points, and there strictures most frequently arise. These contractions are at the glans, the bulb, and the prostatic gland (see fig. 5, Plate DXIV.) The narrowest part is just below the bulb, and here strictures most frequently occur.\n\nThe natural contraction renders it, in almost every case of stricture, the seat of the disease. This part of the canal seems also to possess an uncommon degree of irritability, as it is here that the contraction takes place in cases of strangury. When strictures continue long, and the violence of the symptoms increase, diseases arise strictures in other parts.\n\nThe urethra between the stricture and bladder, from the obstruction the urine has to overcome, enlarges, and is sometimes attacked by inflammation.\n\nAs in most cases the stricture is attended with a gleet, the glands situated about the neck of the bladder become diseased. The bladder becomes extremely thickened, and its capacity diminished. From the strong exertions it is necessary to make in order to overcome the obstruction, and as it cannot contain much urine, the ureters also become dilated.\n\nWhen the disease advances still farther, so that it is impossible to evacuate the bladder, the obstruction being complete, the urine escapes by some new channel; for as in such cases the parts between the bladder and obstruction make less resistance than its coats, both on account of their natural structure, and as these parts are generally inflamed or ulcerated, they give way, and the urine takes a new course. When this change has once taken place, so that no urine passes through the meatus urinarius, the other symptoms will differ according as the aperture has been formed by ulceration of the inner membrane of the urethra, or by a sudden rupture. For when the membranous part of the urethra has been eroded, a suppurating cavity must have formed in the contiguous cellular substance, and as the urine cannot so easily be diffused in the surrounding parts, it makes its way without difficulty through the integuments.\n\nBut when a sudden rupture or ulceration of the inner membrane of the urethra takes place, as the urine meets with no obstruction in infusing itself into the cellular membrane, it effuses itself in a short time over the perineum, scrotum, and adjacent parts; extensive abscesses are formed where the urine was diffused; and as these burst in numerous places, fistulous openings are formed, which have either a direct or indirect communication with the bladder, and through which the urine continues to pass till the original obstruction is removed.\n\nSymptoms.—Often this complaint does not become of such importance as to give alarm to the patient till many months, or even years, after the original cause has been forgot. At other times, a few months after a gonorrhoea has been cured, the urine, instead of coming away with the accustomed ease, begins to be passed with some difficulty. The stream, in place of being full and even, diminishes and becomes unequal; sometimes it comes in drops after much straining and exertion, has a forked appearance, or scatters in all directions. From the irritable state of the parts, the smallest quantity collected in the bladder, brings on a desire to make water, and a continual uneasiness all along the course of the canal, about the perineum, anus, and lower part of the abdomen. In most cases there is a discharge of matter from the urethra. The gleet is always more severe after any debauch or venereal act. It comes on immediately after such excess, and gradually diminishes or disappears. It is also not unfrequent to find strictures accompanied with that profuse discharge of mucus from the bladder called catarrhus vesicae. The irritation communicated to the bladder in consequence of the disease of the urethra, brings on inflammation, which is followed by a profuse discharge of mucus from the whole of its internal surface, and this mucus comes away with the urine, and\nSurgery.\n\nEnlargements of the prostate gland are by far the strictures most apt to mislead our judgment. Scrophulous and schirrous enlargements of that organ were at one time supposed to be very frequent causes of retention; it is now generally believed that they occur seldom, and are chiefly confined to people advanced in life.\n\nIt will be afterwards mentioned how swellings of the valvular processes of the prostate are apt to be mistaken for stricture when a bougie or catheter is introduced. The obstruction in such a case is always at a distance, as the canal has increased in length from the enlargement of the parts.\n\nIf attention be paid to this remark, and if the gland be at the same time examined from the rectum, little doubt will remain of the nature of the disease.\n\nIt is often difficult to draw off the water when the prolate gland has become thus diseased: to do this, much benefit will be found in using a catheter longer than ordinary, as the common curve cannot reach the extremity of the urethra from the increased length of that canal. Pouches or irregularities are also apt to form from the unequal growth of the gland; and as the ducts of the seminal vesicles and mucous glands become enlarged, the instrument ought to be of a large diameter to avoid being entangled by them.\n\nFrom the idea we have of the manner in which causes of strictures are formed, we infer that many substances of an irritating nature, whether applied immediately to the parts themselves, or to those connected with them, may, under particular circumstances, produce this disease. The stone irritating the bladder, numerous ulcers of that organ and prolate gland, irritations in consequence of gonorrhoea, long and repeated erections or other stimulants, and the natural disposition which the urethra has to contract in some constitutions, are the common causes of stricture. In whatever manner this irritation is produced, the symptoms and changes observed in the structure of the urethra, make it probable that there is always a certain degree of inflammation subsequent to or accompanying it. Obstructions in the urethra were supposed by Daran, and others about his time, to originate from causes very different from those now-mentioned. They conceived that the discharge from gonorrhoea proceeded from internal ulcers, and that the cicatrices and indurations they left behind were the most common causes of stricture. But since the nature of the discharge from gonorrhoea is found very rarely, if ever, to be purulent, and as ulcers occur very seldom, they cannot be considered as a common cause of the disease in question.\n\nCaruncles were also supposed to be frequent causes of obstruction in the urethra; but these are rarely met with. One preparation of such a case may be seen in the museum of St Thomas's Hospital. Drs Hunter and Baillie have seldom met with them. Indeed, since the internal membrane of the urethra so much resembles that which lines the cavities of the nose, mouth, and oesophagus, and as ulcers in these parts are more disposed to form skin and heal, than to produce fungi, few cases of obstruction can be ascribed to such tumors.\n\nThe other causes which prevent the free discharge of the urine, are those which are attended with no morbid change in the structure of the urethra itself.\n\nSuch are tumors or indurations of the prolate gland, of the vesiculae seminales, or parts composing the body.\nStrictures of the penis, or of the mucous glands along the course of the canal.\n\nBy far the most common of these, is an obstruction into the entrance of the bladder, from a diseased prostate gland.\n\nThis proceeds from a new form which the canal has assumed in consequence of an enlargement of its parts.\n\nIts cavity becomes deeper from the growth of its sides, and the posterior extremity or valvular process forms a projecting tumour into the cavity of the bladder, which interrupts the passage of the urine, or the entrance of a catheter.\n\nFrom the frequency of this appearance in diseased prostate glands, it is probable that it is the cause of diseases of that organ being often mistaken and treated as strictures of the urethra, and has in numerous instances not only prevented the introduction of a bougie into the bladder, but has been the cause of the formation of artificial passages through the substance of the gland.\n\nTreatment of Stricture.—From the erroneous ideas that the older surgeons formed of the nature of strictures, it was not to be expected that the means of cure they employed were either founded on just principles, or attended with much success.\n\nThey made use of various external and internal remedies; they prescribed long and tedious courses of mercury, and gave many medicines which were supposed to have peculiar virtues in curing diseases of these organs.\n\nThey sometimes introduced into the canal mechanical instruments in order to dilate it; and when that was impracticable, a new passage was made by force, or the diseased parts were dissected away, and a new canal formed in the sound parts.\n\nWifeman, so far back as the beginning of the last century, employed many of these rude and dangerous practices, and introduced into use the waxed candle or bougie, by means of which he said he \"crushed the carbuncle to pieces.\" He met with cases, however, where this could not be done; that is to say, cases where it was impracticable to pass small bougies into the bladder; and this led him to adopt another mode of treatment. He confirmed them by stimulating applications in the following manner. The wax at one end of the candle was scraped away, and the wick dipped in plasters composed of alum, red precipitate, calcined vitriol, argigo, and other such substances, and then it was applied to the carbuncle.\n\n\"But (says he), if after doing this you cannot pass the carbuncle, you may well conclude it callous; in which case you may pass a canula into the urethra to that carbuncle, and whilst you hold that there steady, you may convey a grain of caustic into the canula, and press the caustic to it; and whilst you hold it there, you will perceive its operation by the pressing forward of the caustic. The carbuncle thus confirmed, cast in a lenient injection daily; and if you take notice of his urine, you may see the separation of the sloughs as rags in it. After which you may with the common medicated candles wear away the remainder, and with the injections cicatrize it.\"\n\nAfter Wifeman, Daran introduced into use a kind of bougies, the particular composition of which was kept secret. They were supposed to possess very great medical virtues; and it was from these qualities that their superior efficacy was supposed to proceed. Other surgeons shortly began to imitate them, and they found that those they made had the same qualities as those of the original inventor. This led them soon after this to alter their opinion of their mode of action; and, instead of supposing that all the beneficial effects proceeded from the medicines in their composition promoting suppuration, cicatrization, &c., they explained their action on the principle of a simple wedge.\n\nBut however successful their practice might have been in alleviating, if not in curing strictures, yet many cases occurred where the obstruction was so complete as altogether to prevent the bougie being introduced. They were therefore obliged to continue forcing past the obstruction, till the mode of treatment described by Wifeman was renewed, and held out as an original invention. The practice, indeed, generally followed by modern surgeons is founded entirely on what Wifeman has written; but since these have been better understood, from the progress of pathological investigation, it has been considerably modified and improved.\n\nWhen we consider the effects of these modes of practice, and try to reconcile them with the ideas we have formed of the causes producing the stricture, it would appear that those very means employed for their removal belong to the same class of bodies as those originally producing the complaint.\n\nAs this cannot be denied, yet it will appear neither surprising nor improbable, when we reason from analogy, and observe the effect of similar applications to other diseased parts, and similar phenomena in other organs. It may be here observed, that the action of any part depends not only on the kind of the stimulus applied, but also on its degree of violence. We know that a slight pressure on the skin produces uneasiness or tickling, whilst a stronger degree it passes unnoticed. A certain degree of light produces distinct vision, but a more intense one destroys it. The upper part of the throat is thrown into violent action by a slight irritation, but a more powerful one has no effect. Similar phenomena take place in disease; or slight irritations sometimes occasion violent morbid action, whilst those that are more powerful not only produce a lesser degree of disease, but are even employed to remove such as are brought on from a lighter cause. We see this opinion strongly confirmed in ulcers, attended with much local or constitutional irritation. The mild emollient applications in such cases, if they do not increase the sufferings of the patient, bring no relief; whilst strong stimulating ones, such as a solution of lunar caustic, or diluted nitrous acid, seldom fail to diminish the pain and promote the cure of the disease.*\n\nIn toothache, the irritation produced by the external air on the exposed nervous surface excites much pain and even symptomatic fever; but the application of caustic acid destroys these sensations.\n\nThe same we will find to take place when we consider the nature and the mode of treating strictures of the urethra; and if we can prove that strictures have all that variety of character which an ulcer or many other diseases have, we will be better able to judge of the comparative merit of the different modes of treatment, and be able in some degree to account for their mode of action.\n\n* See Home's Observations on Strictures.\nOf the Bougie.\n\nWhen surgeons attributed all the beneficial effects of bougies to their mechanical qualities, the principal deliberation was to have them sufficiently pliable to take the curvature of the urethra, firm and elastic to make resistance, and mild so as to produce no irritation. But however simple such instruments might be in their composition, yet it will appear probable that their ultimate effect is not the same as that which a wedge produces on inanimate matter. That bougies cannot act by their mechanical powers in removing spasmodic stricture, appears from those cases where the mere introduction of the instrument into the urethra, and its contact with the obstruction, removes at once all spasm.\n\nThe same thing is observed in those cases of permanent stricture which are attended with occasional spasms. In such cases it frequently happens that a bougie finds a complete obstruction on its first introduction, but after being allowed to remain for some time in the canal it passes readily without force. A remarkable case of this kind happened, where there was not only a stricture in the urethra, but fistulous openings in the perineum and scrotum, through which most of the urine was discharged. After much trouble, a very small-sized elastic catheter was passed into the bladder, and as it gave no pain it was allowed constantly to remain. For the first five days the urine flowed through the instrument, but afterwards it began to pass along its sides; and gradually as the urethra dilated, larger instruments were introduced with similar good effect.\n\nThe silver files used by Mr Ware seem to act, in removing obstructions of the lacrymal passages in fistula lacrymalis, on the same principle as the catheter appears to have done in the above example. The file when first introduced, fills up completely the lacrymal duct; but in a short time the tears begin to flow along the sides, and pass into the cavity of the nose. In these examples it is difficult to explain the action of bougies on mere mechanical principles; it seems much more probable that they produce their good effects, either by a change of action of the living body, or by some alteration in the structure of the diseased parts. Says Hunter, \"Pressure produces action of the animal powers, either to adapt the parts to their new position or to recede by ulceration.\"\n\nMode of introducing the bougie.\n\nWhen speaking of the symptoms of stricture, it was observed, that in order to determine with certainty their presence, it was necessary to introduce a bougie. To do this, either with a view of ascertaining the state of the urethra, or in order to remove a stricture, a good deal of caution and nicety is required; for as the urethra is generally tender, painful, and easily thrown into spasmodic action, any awkwardness might entirely prevent the possibility of ascertaining the nature of the complaint, or of affording the means of relief.\n\nWhen, therefore, the operation is to be performed, in order to discover the kind of obstruction, bougies ought to be provided of different sizes, of a soft consistence, common goose quill, or even larger, generally passes easily, and is less apt to meet with obstructions before it comes to the stricture, than one of less diameter. Being of a soft consistence, it readily takes an impression of the stricture, and its blunt point prevents its being entangled by any accidental irregularity.\n\nAs it ought always to be rubbed over with oil before being used, it generally passes with little more force than its own weight, till it comes to the contracted part, where it flops. After changing with much caution the direction of the point, by elevating or depressing the other extremity of the bougie, and perhaps bringing it a little backwards and forwards, so as to be satisfied of the situation of the stricture, the instrument may be allowed to remain in close contact with it for a few seconds and receive its impression, so that when it is withdrawn, a precise knowledge is obtained of its situation and form.\n\nSome patients are often so irritable, that any foreign body touching the urethra excites much irritation and pain. In such cases it is the more necessary not to employ the smallest force, and to use an application of opium, or such medicine, to the perineum, to prevent these inconveniences as far as possible.\n\nWhen the stricture lies near the extremity of the urethra next the bladder, the point of the bougie ought always to be considerably bent previous to its introduction, so that it may readily accommodate itself to the curve of the urethra; for as a large instrument does not bend easily, it is apt to press on one of the side of the canal, and give rise to the suspicion of a stricture.\n\nIt is also of considerable importance that the point of the instrument be not conical. When once we are well acquainted with the state of the parts, such formed in fig. 2, instruments may be used with much advantage, as the small point enters the stricture, and by pushing the bougie forward it is dilated by the base of the cone.\n\nIt may be also here remarked, that in some instances a catheter can be easily introduced when no bougie can be made to pass; we ought therefore to make use of that instrument before finally deciding on the nature of the obstruction (d).\n\nWhen a stricture is discovered, and when bougies are to be used with a view of curing it, the first thing we are to attempt is to pass one through it. As the bougie we employ is most frequently of a very small size, we must attend particularly to the irregularities in the canal which may entangle the point of such a small instrument and the occasional bendings it may make, while it is supposed it is passing forwards towards the bladder. As the mouth of the lacune are chiefly situated on the superior part of the canal, the point of the bougie ought to glide along its inferior surface to avoid them.\n\nThe bending of the bougie is only to be prevented by a forbearance in using force, and in directing properly the point; but as the common bougies are apt to do this, it is often extremely useful to have catgut ones for this purpose; and it is necessary to have them very small.\n\nIn order to overcome the obstruction when the bougie reaches it, the situation of the point ought to be changed by shifting it backwards and forwards, and from\n\n(d) The silver balls represented in Plate DXIV. fig. 4, have also been found useful in ascertaining the nature of strictures by Mr Charles Bell.\nStrictures from side to side, and even employing a little pressure, till it passes forwards, provided the surgeon has a clear and distinct idea of the direction of the urethra.\n\nAs the introduction of the bougie almost always brings on spasms to a greater or less degree on the first attempt, it is often necessary to persevere some time before it can be made to pass the stricture; and we must continue in our endeavours a long time before we declare it impracticable.\n\nBlistering on the perineum or loins, fomentations of warm water and spirits, turpentine glysters, dipping the feet or glans in cold water, anodyne applications, and the internal use of camphor, opium, or tincture of iron, all assist in alleviating the spasmodic symptoms when they occur, and may be selected for use according to the judgement of the surgeon.\n\nAttention ought to be paid to the composition of the bougie; for those made of elastic metal, catgut, or elastic gum, often give pain, while those made of soft plaster are mild and harmless.\n\nThe time which a bougie ought to remain in the urethra, must depend greatly on the peculiarities of the case, for there are no diseases which appear under more various forms than stricture. In most cases bougies can be introduced with little pain, and can remain for some minutes without inconvenience; but there are others where the introduction not only produces general irritation, but the pain is so violent, as hardly to allow them to enter the canal, and sometimes they give rise to constitutional symptoms. In the first case, from the little pain the patient suffers, their use has been abused, and they have been allowed to remain not only when asleep, but they have been worn during the patient's daily employments.\n\nIt is found, however, that bougies have a more powerful effect when retained for a short time, and often repeated, than when they are longer continued, but seldom used; so that in no case, however little pain they may produce, ought they to be allowed to remain for a long time. Many indeed think that all their good effects are obtained after they have remained twenty or fifteen minutes, while others allow them to remain for one or more hours.\n\nIn cases of stricture accompanied with much irritation, whatever pain the bougie may bring on, it ought not to be thrown aside, but it should be introduced repeatedly whenever there is the least abatement of the symptoms. This practice should be continued for weeks before we despair of success, as afterwards the pain, from daily habit, will be diminished, and the patient will be gradually more and more able to bear it. Whilst we continue the use of the bougie, it ought gradually to be increased in size as the stricture gives way, and be introduced once or perhaps twice a day till the obstruction is no longer felt, till the urine flows in a full, even, and natural stream.\n\nWhen this happens we are not to consider the cure as altogether complete; for it is very generally found, that if the use of the bougie is at this time given up, the parts soon begin to contract again, as they have still a disposition to return to their former situation, and the disease in a short time is completely renewed. It will therefore be proper to continue using them at distant intervals, some time after the cure appears complete, and give them up in a very slow and gradual manner.\n\nIt may be here mentioned, that it is not necessary to retain the point of the bougie in the cavity of the bladder, but merely to allow it to pass the stricture.\n\nOf the Caustic.\n\nIn speaking of the use of bougies, we have supposed that it has been practicable to pass one through the stricture; but it is well known, that cases do often occur, where, from the tortuous form the canal has assumed, the smallest bougie is prevented from entering the bladder.\n\nIn such cases, pressure was employed on the diseased parts, in order to produce ulceration to destroy the obstruction; but as this mode was found in many cases to be followed with violent inflammation, and attended with great pain, it was not often performed.\n\nLaying open the sinuses, and dissecting out the diseased parts, was also a painful and no less difficult operation, so that no easy mode was ever adopted till Wifeman employed lunar caustic.\n\nFrom the delicate structure of the urinary canal, it was not without much caution, and in very urgent cases, that this remedy was first employed; but since its action was found not to be so violent, it has been freely used by many surgeons, and its application not confined to the more advanced stages of the complaint.\n\nFrom the time of Wifeman to that of Mr J. Hunter, we find little worthy of remark in surgical writers regarding the use of caustic. The latter of these authors, however, again introduced it into practice, and applied it to all those cases where he could either do no good with bougies, or when he could not pass them through the stricture. In his first trials he met with success; and as he soon improved the mode of its application, he was able to employ it with considerable advantage.\n\nMr Hunter's mode of applying caustic was first adopted by Wifeman; but as the silver canula which he employed, not only gave much pain, but could not be introduced as far down the urethra as a common bougie in many instances, and as the caustic could not be applied directly to the centre of the obstruction, a new mode was invented. A piece of caustic was fixed in the extremity of a common bougie, and covered with the plaster except at the extremity, where a part was exposed, but so small as merely to form the apex of the conical point of the bougie. In this manner it is found possible to apply it to almost all cases, and when in dexterous hands, may be used with considerable safety. When it is to be applied to a stricture, it is necessary that some previous knowledge of the case has been obtained from the introduction of a soft bougie. When this has been done, the armed bougie must be introduced rather quickly, but steadily, till it meets the stricture, which we know both from the feel, and from the situation previously determined. When brought into contact with the stricture, it is perhaps better merely to touch it with the caustic the two or three first applications, and afterwards it may be retained longer. When the bougie is to be withdrawn, it ought to be done cautiously; for as it has become soft, and the caustic not so firmly fixed in it, it may fall out, and be left behind in the urethra. Although this...\nStrictures, this mode has advantages over the silver canula formerly employed, yet there is a way which we think may be attended with considerable superiority, as it not only requires less dexterity on the part of the surgeon, but is less apt to do mischief.\n\nIt is evident, that when the armed bougie is passed to a stricture, it will unavoidably touch several parts of the side of the canal in its passage; and as often its introduction brings on a spasm, which lasts some seconds, or even minutes, a considerable portion of caustic may be dissolved on the found membrane.\n\nThe frequency of the application of the caustic must be determined by the particular circumstances of the case. It should never be repeated till after the effects of the first application have ceased; in general, every second day will be found to be enough, but in some instances it may be applied daily.\n\nAfter the use of the caustic, the patient ought to be kept quiet; he should not make any exertions to empty the bladder, nor take any violent exercise. In general the pain from the caustic lasts but a few minutes; and the day following, when the dough separates, a rawness is felt on making water.\n\nThe application of caustic to the urethra is, however, often followed by a train of very alarming symptoms; instead of a mere burning heat in the parts, the patient is seized with violent pain, followed by retention of urine, swelling of the testicles and perineum, hemorrhage, and sometimes, a complete febrile paroxysm.\n\nFrom the sympathy that exists between the urethra and testicles, it is not unfrequent to find diseases of the former produce morbid affections of the latter.\n\nStone of the bladder and the use of common bougies often bring on swelling on one or both of the testicles; and in one case the irritation of a bougie brought on an inflammation, which terminated in a hydrocele of the vaginal coat. It is a frequent effect of caustic, but soon disappears when its use is given up.\n\nStrangury has often followed the application of caustic after any imprudence on the part of the patient; and it generally happens in those cases where it has been applied near the bladder. This may happen not only from the great susceptibility this part of the canal has to contract; but it may arise from the bougie passing a part of the urethra where caustic had been formerly applied, and which remained still tender. This retention of urine in general does not continue long, and in most cases it is relieved by the introduction of a bougie, or the application of a blister.\n\nWhen caustic has not only destroyed the stricture, but its action extended to the found parts, blood is often poured out into the canal, or is effused into the cellular texture of the penis. The hemorrhage is sometimes very profuse, and seems to proceed from an erosion of the spongy bodies; but as it has, in every case hitherto published, ceased of itself, no particular means have been found necessary to stop it. Keeping the parts cool, and giving cold acid drinks, quietness, and caution against all causes of irritation, should be attended to. The tumor composed of effused blood generally gives little inconvenience, and like an ecchymosis on any other part, it may be removed by the topical application of stimulants.\n\nBy far the most serious and most alarming symptom which arises from the use of caustic is an ague or febrile fit. It begins with a severe cold fit, which continues from fifteen minutes to an hour. This is followed by another fit, which lasts sometimes several hours, and is succeeded by a very profuse perspiration, which is much greater than what happens in common ague. These paroxysms do not return at the same periods, and seldom occur more than two or three times. When repeated, they become more and more severe, and every future application of the caustic brings on one fix or twelve minutes after. Patients attacked in this manner become extremely debilitated; and three instances have come under our immediate knowledge where it proved fatal. When such a symptom occurs, the caustic ought to be immediately laid aside, emollients applied to the urethra, and the patient supported by cordials.\n\nThe caustic too has been sometimes known to fall out falling out of the bougie, and dissolve in the urethra. When such of the caustic an accident happens, if it be not immediately removed, etc., it may produce a slough of almost the whole extent of the canal, and bring on very alarming symptoms.\n\nIn place, therefore, of fixing a large piece of caustic in the bougie, take such a quantity as is intended to be applied; dissolve it into a fine powder, caustic, and stick it on the point of the bougie, by pressing them on one another. When this is done, it may be dipped in warm wax, and receive a thin covering of it.\n\nA bougie prepared in this manner may be introduced down to the stricture without any risk of injuring the found membrane; for as the thin layer of wax which covers the caustic prevents it being immediately dissolved, it is not till it has been kept some time in contact with the stricture that it begins to act. By following this plan we not only avoid injuring the internal membrane, but we dissolve no more of the caustic on the diseased parts than what is wished for, and there is no risk from a portion of caustic being left behind.\n\nThere are, however, cases where a soft bougie cannot be so easily introduced as a metallic instrument; in them, a silver catheter, or one made of Smith's elastic metal, may be used with much advantage.\n\nInstead of the holes being made at the sides of the instrument, it ought to be perforated at the extremity, and this hole filled with caustic, and fixed in that situation with adhesive plaster. Or, what answers equally well, the catheter may be introduced down to the obstruction, and an armed bougie passed through it.\n\nComparative advantages of the Bougie and Caustic.\n\nThus far we have mentioned the manner in which the bougie or caustic are to be employed; we now come to consider the peculiar merits of those two modes of practice, and to point out those cases where the one is to be employed in preference to the other.\n\nNotwithstanding the zealous advocates which have lately introduced caustic as a general remedy for strictures, we have no hesitation in declaring it as our opinion, that the simple bougie is the instrument to be preferred in the generality of cases of this disease, and that in all cases where the cure can be accomplished by its means, it should be adopted. Caustic, however, is a remedy by no means less beneficial, though its use ought to be much more circumscribed; for we certainly believe that\nStrictures, that by its proper application many of the worst cases of stricture, cases indeed which are quite incurable by the bougie, may be benefited by its application.\n\nIn those cases of spasmodic stricture where the common bougie either cannot pass the strictured part, or where it has no effect in relieving the symptoms, caustic may be used with advantage.\n\nIt may be also employed whenever the stricture is attended with much pain and irritation or constitutional symptoms; and in cases where the contraction of the urethra is such, as entirely to close up the canal, and the urine to come through fistulous openings in the scrotum and perineum, the use of caustic is attended with the best effects. We have met with cases, where during a succession of years, urine has drilled through fistulous openings in the scrotum, in which six, eight, or ten applications of the caustic bougie have opened a free passage into the bladder, and allowed all the fistulas to heal up.\n\nFrom the rapidity of the cures performed by caustic in comparison to those of the bougie, the former a few years ago came into very general use, and was tried by different surgeons all over this island in every possible variety of the disease. In this extensive field of experiment the merits of caustic have been fairly balanced, and its exaggerated good effects have fallen into disrepute, whilst the calumnious reports of its fatal and dreadful consequences in the hands of experienced men, have been shown to be without foundation. Thus in the midst of medical rancour and dispute, cautious and intelligent men have become acquainted with the good qualities of a most active application; and an unprejudiced mind has laid open before it a vast field of observation on a disease which deeply interests a considerable number of men.\n\nSect. II. Of Strictures in the Oesophagus.\n\nThe mucous membrane lining the oesophagus, like that of the urethra, is liable to become contracted, forming a stricture. These contractions may be formed at any part of the canal; but it is observed that there is one spot more liable than any other to become affected with it. The part alluded to is immediately behind the cricoid cartilages of the larynx, where the fauces may be said to terminate, and the oesophagus begin. The disease appears, on dissection, to consist of a transverse fold of the internal membrane of the oesophagus, filling up in different degrees the aperture of the canal.\n\nThis part of the oesophagus is also liable to two other diseases, whose symptoms are nearly alike, and therefore may be mistaken for stricture. One of these is a thickening of the coats of the oesophagus, which extends to the surrounding parts, and in the end most commonly degenerates into cancer. The other is an ulcer of the lining of the oesophagus, which is commonly situated a little below the ordinary place of stricture, and upon the posterior or vertebral portion of the canal. Both of these complaints produce a difficulty in deglutition, and in their early stages are only to be distinguished from stricture, by an examination with a bougie. Stricture appears to be a disease more frequent in the early periods of life; while the two other diseases are more commonly met with at an advanced age.\n\nWith a view to ascertain the true nature of the disease, it is always necessary to introduce a bougie. The best mode of doing this, is that recommended by Mr Everard Home. The patient is desired to push the tongue as far as possible out of the mouth, thus bringing the orifice of the stricture as nearly as possible in a line with the middle of the pharynx. The bougie being oiled or covered with mucilage, is then to be thrust down into the oesophagus. When the bougie passes down to the distance of eight inches, measuring from the cutting edge of the front teeth in the upper jaw, the surgeon may be satisfied that it has gone beyond the usual seat of stricture; and if it is brought back without any resistance, he may conclude that the aperture of the oesophagus considerably exceeds the size of the bougie which has been used. But if the bougie stops at five inches or even lower, he is to retain it there with a uniform steady pressure for half a minute, so as to receive on its point an impression on the surface to which it was opposed. If the end of the bougie retains its natural form, or nearly so, and there is an indentation like the mark of a cord on its side, whether all round or only partially, he may decide that the disease is a stricture. But if, on the other hand, the bougie passes without any difficulty to the distance of seven inches and a half, and when brought back the point has an irregular jagged surface, it is equally clear that the disease is an ulcer on the posterior surface of the oesophagus.\n\nWhen strictures of the oesophagus have been of long continuance, ulceration takes place on the side of the stricture next the stomach. When such ulceration takes place, the character of the original disease is lost; and when the ulceration extends upwards, the stricture itself is destroyed. A bougie passed under such circumstances, will, in general, have its point entangled in the ulcer; and when so skilfully directed as to go down into the oesophagus, it will meet with a difficulty while it is passing from the sound oesophagus to the ulcer, and again when it leaves the ulcer and re-enters the sound canal below; and in its return there will also be two parts at which a resistance is felt. This may mislead the most accurate observer, and create a belief that there are two strictures, whereas in fact there is none but an ulcer of some extent, and a power of contraction in the upper and lower extremities of the oesophagus where they terminate in the ulcer.\n\nTreatment.—The treatment of stricture in the oesophagus is to be conducted on the same general principles as stricture in the urethra.\n\nBougies which are made much longer and of larger dimensions than those for the urethra, may be used with the greatest safety. At first, indeed, they sometimes create a good deal of irritation and a febrile attack; and in such cases they must be employed with the greatest caution. Once in twenty-four or forty-eight hours, according to the nature of the case, will be sufficiently often to introduce them; and they may be discontinued in proportion to the alleviation of the symptoms. The use of caustic in this species of stricture has also been not only proposed, but adopted; a practice which is more a proof of the boldness of its inventor than of his prudence. It is not to be denied, that some remedy proves useless, and that in these, the caustic bougie,\nStrictures, bougie, introduced and applied to the stricture with much dexterity, may be beneficial. But these cases are so rare, and there are so few able to use this active remedy properly, that we cannot help thinking it can never be very generally introduced into practice.\n\nSect. III. Stricture of the Rectum.\n\nAs far as we know, there is no author who has given any accurate account of the various morbid appearances of the extremity of the rectum. Under the general name of hemorrhoids, a variety of tumors very different from one another have been clasped; whilst under the name of schirrus, have been considered all cases where the diameter of the lower part of the intestinal canal has been diminished. In a practical point of view, these observations are of the greatest importance, as they lead the surgeon to discriminate between those cases which are likely to be aided by the use of medicines, and those which are beyond the reach of art, or which the same mode of treatment might tend more to aggravate than to alleviate.\n\nIn many cases of the true schirrus, or cancerous affection of the intestine, the disease first appears by the formation of one or more gritty tumors on the internal surface of the canal; and these by increasing in number and in size, and by involving the adjacent parts, contract the canal, and at last ulcerate, forming true cancerous fores. But there is another class of cases, in which the diameter of the intestines becomes narrowed by a thickening of its coats, and which, were we to reason from analogy, might be compared to that thickening which forms stricture in the other mucous surfaces, as in the oesophagus and urethra. It is the same cases that we suspect Desfauit treated with so much success by the use of bougies*; and from the good effects of this mode of treatment in cases of stricture in other parts of the body, it is reasonable to expect benefit from their use in strictures of the rectum. Desfauit, however, wishes it to be understood that the practice is to be employed in the true schirrus; but the two cases which are given in detail by Bichat in his edition of Desfauit's works, in illustration of the practice in schirrus, are by no means conclusive. The first is a case of tumors of the internal membrane, which were much alleviated by the compression of a bougie; whilst the second was a case which shows the relief to be obtained by the use of bougies in cases of schirrous contraction in the discharge of the faeces, but by no means in the cure of the disease.\n\nIn cases, therefore, of contraction of the rectum which are not of a febrile nature, besides the strict attention to keep the bowels regular, and render the faeces as liquid as possible by the use of laxatives and emollient injections, bougies made of a proper size may be used with relief; and, as we have mentioned in another place, the practice is also highly serviceable in some cases of tumors which grow from this part of the intestine.\n\nSect. IV. Of Polypi.\n\nWhen the mucous membrane of any part of the body becomes elevated above its natural level, so as to form a circumscribed swelling, the disease is called a polypus.\n\nPolypi have been found on all the different mucous surfaces; in the nose, frontal and maxillary sinuses, pharynx, gullet, mouth and gums, meatus externus, conjunctiva, stomach, intestines, rectum, uterus, vagina, bladder, and urethra.\n\nThere are four different kinds of polypi, varying from each other in their structure. 1st, The mucous; 2d, the flethy, 3d, the carcinomatous; and 4th, the encysted polypi.\n\nThe mucous polypi have a slippery surface, and are constantly covered with a quantity of mucus. They are of a greyish or dull white colour, and have a semi-transparent appearance, resembling, particularly at their extremities, a piece of softened glue. They are easily torn and bleed freely; they are neither painful nor sensible to the touch; they suffer remarkable alterations from changes in the state of the atmosphere, extending prodigiously in cold and moist, and contracting in a dry and warm air. They are of an irregular and angular shape, and often seem to take the particular form of the cavity in which they grow. They are commonly attached by a narrow neck, and are quite moveable.\n\nThe flethy or carcinomatous polypi are of a bright red colour, their surface is smooth and regular. They are of a rounded form, and are attached by a narrow neck. They are firmer and are not so easily torn, nor do they bleed so readily as those of the mucous kind.\n\nThe carcinomatous polypi are of a darker red or more purple colour than those of the flethy kind, and sometimes they are of a livid hue. They are supplied by a great number of blood-vessels, which makes them bleed profusely even when slightly injured, or gives them a disposition to bleed of themselves. They are of a very hard firm structure; some of them are as hard as cartilage. They are more or less painful, and are very sensible to the touch. Sometimes the pain is of that stinging lancinating kind which carcinomatous tumors have in other parts of the body. Their surface sometimes ulcerates, and the ulcer affumes all the characters of a cancerous sore. They are commonly attached by a firm broad basis.\n\nThe encysted polypi occur least frequently. Richter says that they resemble a reticular sac, which contains fluid sometimes resembling mucus; at other times it is of a thick consistence. In one case we found the mucous membrane covering the superior spongy bones extended, but not much thickened; and between its folds there were several round semitransparent vesicles, containing a thick glairy fluid.\n\nSect. V. Of Polypi of the Nose.\n\nAll the four different kinds of polypi have been found growing from the mucous membrane lining the cavity of the nose; we have also seen the superior spongy bone so increased in bulk, as to form a tumor resembling the flethy polypus.\n\nThe first symptom of a polypus in the nose is a preternatural degree of redness of its mucous surface. It becomes spongy and callous, and there is an increased secretion of mucus. The patient has some interruption in breathing, and the voice is rendered more or less indistinct; he feels as if stifled, and he tries to get quit\nChap. III.\n\nSURGERY.\n\nOf Polypi; of something which incommodes him by blowing his nose, for the same reason as a person does who labours under a common catarrh; the sense of smell becomes impaired, and all these symptoms are more troublesome in wet than in dry weather.\n\nThe symptoms increase till the extension of the mucous membrane increases to such a degree, as to form a distinct circumscribed tumor; and the progress of the complaint is generally so slow, that its nature is frequently not suspected till it gets this length.\n\nBy degrees the breathing through the nose and the sense of smell are entirely destroyed from the mechanical obstruction of the tumor; and the patient himself finds, that by a violent expiration or inspiration, the tumor can be pushed forward or backward in the nose.\n\nThe pressure which a polypus sometimes makes on the nasal duct prevents the tears from flowing freely into the nose, and is the cause of a watery eye.\n\nWhen the tumor is large, the septum of the nose is frequently pressed on, and pushed to the opposite side, and then the respiration is oppressed in both nostrils. Sometimes the tumor descends, and part of it projects through the nostril; when this takes place, the surface of the part exposed to the air becomes like common skin. This indeed happens when any mucous surface is exposed. We have observed it in the vagina when it was inverted, and in the eyelid when the palpebral membrane was turned outwards, from a tumor, or any other cause.\n\nMorgagni takes particular notice that the natural position of the septum is apt to be mistaken for disease, as it very frequently divides the nasal cavity into two unequal portions.\n\nMore frequently polypi extend backward into the pharynx, and can be felt by introducing the finger behind the velum pendulum palati. In one rare instance, we have known a polypus to large, as to descend along the esophagus into the stomach, and in another to fill up the whole cavity of the mouth, and produce suffocation.\n\nIt happens also that polypi growing from an extensive base, separate, displace, and produce an abscession of the bones which surround them. The bones of the nose are pushed upward; the maxillary bones and the palate bones are disjointed, and carried outward; the arch of the palate depressed; the inferior margins of the orbits are pressed upward, and push the eyes out of their orbits.\n\nPolypi are found to arise from every part of the nasal cavity; but most frequently from the inferior spongy bones. Many surgeons have conceived that polypi arose from general diseases of the constitution, as scrofula, syphilis, &c.; but it will in general be found to be a mere local disease, and probably to arise from whatever tends to produce a continued or repeated attack of inflammation in the part.\n\nTreatment.—If polypi are attached to the upper spongy bones, their removal will be more dangerous, as the inflammation excited by an operation will be readily conveyed to the brain. When they are attached to the inferior spongy bones, they can be removed with perfect safety.\n\nThe most celebrated surgeons have never advised any operation when the tumor is small and gives no distress; but whenever it becomes of such a size as to fill up the cavity of the nostril, disturb respiration, and assume a malignant aspect, it ought to be removed.\n\nAs long as polypi continue small, or when the mucous membrane acquires that appearance which indicates the commencement of the disease, tonic and astringent remedies are generally recommended, as decoction of oak bark, with alum; strong solutions of white vitriol, saccharum saturni, or muriate of mercury, ardent spirits, and vinegar. Either of these solutions, which may be selected, ought to be thrown up a little warm into the nasal cavity with a syringe, retained there half a minute or more, and repeated four or five times daily; or a piece of charred wet with them may be put into the nose with a probe, and applied to the diseased surface. Kino, galls, white vitriol, &c. saline in the form of powder, inhaled up into the nose, as strong as the patient can suffer it, are also useful in stopping the progress of the disease. Mercury has been found rather to make them worse; caustic and other corroding applications have been of use in the softer kind, though they have never produced a cure. Bougies have been recommended by Mr. B. Bell, and are said to have been useful; and when the polypus is small, they may act on the same principle as bougies do on tumors of the rectum, a practice so successful in the hands of Default.\n\nPolypi may be removed either by tying a ligature round their neck, by tearing or twisting them, or by cutting them out with a knife or scissors.\n\nOperation.—Professor Richter of Gottingen, and several eminent practitioners of this country, use, in general, the forceps; and in those cases where the polypus is attached to the inferior spongy bones, or to any of the inferior part of the nasal cavity, this mode of operation is much more easily performed, and has the best chance of success.\n\nFrom the soft spongy texture of the superior spongy bones, and ethmoid bone, with which they are connected, there is a considerable risk of tearing and injuring more parts than is necessary for the removal of the polypus; and, as any inflammation excited on these may spread to the membranes of the brain, it is more advisable to remove polypi attached to these parts by the ligature.\n\nWhen polypi are completely within the reach of the knife, adhering towards the external opening of the nostrils, they may be easily cut away.\n\nIn performing any operation, or even making an examination of the state of the nose, it is of considerable importance to attend to the position of the forehead, and to employ a proper light.\n\nThe head should be bent backwards; and in order to enlarge the external nostril, an assistant, on whose breast the head of the patient rests, ought, with the forefinger of his right hand, to press upward the point of the nose; whilst, with a probe in his left, he spreads out the alae.\n\nOf removing Polypi with the Forceps.—Forceps for this purpose ought to be six inches or six inches and a half long, and the axis at two-thirds of their length distant from the extremity of the handle; so that the operator may have the advantage of a long lever. See Fig. 1, Plate DXV.\n\nThe points of them ought to be blunt, rounded on the outside, perforated, and a concavity, made rough, extending...\nOf Polypi extending to near the axis. The two blades ought to be separated at their union, when closed, and not to become parallel till they are opened to a considerable distance, in order that the polypus may be held very firmly. The blades should be strong, and pretty broad.\n\nEven this form of forceps is not always sufficient; and it is useful to have a pair of such as has been recom-\n\n* See Plate mended by Richter *. They are intended to be employed in those cases, where the polypus is so large as completely to fill the nostril, and so hard, that the upper part of the blades of the common forceps cannot sufficiently dilate to allow their extremity to pass down the nostril, and reach the bottom or neck of the tumor.\n\nIt is of great importance to fix the forceps as near the root of the polypus as possible; for, when that is accomplished, the whole mass may be at once removed; and the hemorrhage is never so great as if the polypus was torn through the middle.\n\nOften, however, it happens, that the polypus is so large as to distend the nostrils in such a manner, that it is impossible to discover the root till the extremity is removed. We must, in such a case, remove as much as we are able, and even although the bleeding is profuse, persevere in the operation as long as we can pull any away with safety.\n\nWhen the operation is to be performed, the patient ought, by his own efforts, to push the body as far forwards as possible; then the surgeon, with a pair of small forceps in his left hand, seizes the point of the polypus, and having kept fast hold of it, he cautiously introduces the polypus forceps on the outside of the others. The more time that is bestowed on this step of the operation, the more the polypus becomes elongated and thinner, the more room is given for the forceps, and therefore the higher up can the polypus be grasped. After it is completely secured between the blades of the forceps, it is to be twisted slowly round, and at the same time pulled outwards. If only a portion of the polypus is removed, what remains is to be extracted in the same manner. The hemorrhage is generally profuse, but seldom requires the assistance of art to stop it.\n\nOf Removing Polypi by the Ligature.—The ligatures consist of wire, catgut, silk or cord; and different methods have been employed for passing them round the root of the polypus. In order to remove a polypus, the anterior part of which is situated in one of the nostrils, a ligature (a) is to be introduced through a double canula (b), and one end fixed round the ring (c); whilst the other end (d) being loose, allows the noose at a, to be increased or diminished, according to the size of the polypus. The polypus is to be grasped by a pair of forceps put through the noose, and drawn forwards. The ligature is then to be carried to the root of the polypus, either by means of the forked probe (fig. 4.), or by one of the porte-neuds (fig. 5.), taking care to tighten the wire gradually, the further the instrument is introduced. When the noose reaches the root of the polypus, the ligature is to be firmly drawn, and secured by being twisted round the ring of the canula. If the polypus hangs down behind the velum pendulum palati, the doubled wire is to be slowly introduced through the nostril into the throat. The finger of the surgeon is to be introduced into the mouth, and by opening its doubling the noose passed over the extremity of the polypus, and conducted to its root, by gradually tightening the ligature, and then it is to be firmly fixed. The ligature should be tightened once or twice a day, until the tumor entirely separates. As there is generally a considerable degree of swelling and inflammation of the tumor before this takes place, if it be so situated as to disturb respiration, it may even be necessary to perform bronchotomy as a preliminary step. Should any part of the polypus remain, it may be destroyed by caustic, or the actual cautery, if practicable.\n\nBesides this, which is the common and most simple mode of applying the ligatures, there are others which are well adapted for particular cases. The apparatus employed by Deffault is extremely ingenious and well-suited for its purpose, but is more particularly useful in polypi of the vagina and uterus.\n\nWhen this apparatus is to be used, two porte-neuds Deffault's (a a) ought to be procured, and having pushed the apparatus cylinder over the branches of the stalk, so as to shut the rings (d) completely, a ligature of waxed thread, catgut, or silver wire, is to be passed through them (e), and the extremities may be either held along with the canula or secured at e *.\n\nThe two canulas, thus armed, are introduced parallel to one another between the tumor and parietes of the cavity in which it lies; and when they reach its base, one is held firm, and the other carried round the base, crossed over the other, forming a noose round it.\n\nThe ligature being pulled tight by an assistant, the two ends are to be put through the hole (g) of the other canula, and fixed to the axis at h.\n\nThe extremity (g) is then to be slit along the ligature close to the polypus; and the ligature being firmly fixed to the other extremity, the two porte-neuds may be at once removed, by allowing the ring to divide, and the ligature to escape.\n\nThis being done, nothing remains to complete the operation. The ligature is kept round the polypus till it drops off, and as the parts begin to give way, it ought to be retained always perfectly tight; and this may be easily accomplished by turning the screw at h.\n\nThe apparatus, too, (fig. 6. Plate DXV.) may also sometimes be useful, from the flexibility of the canula, which conveys and directs the ligature.\n\n2. Of the Polypus of the Rectum.\n\nPolypi of the rectum differ considerably from the common hemorrhoidal tumor, in their symptoms and appearances. They resemble the fleshy polypi in other parts of the body, in their colour and external form, and they are also sometimes ulcerated on the surface. On cutting through a large tumor of this kind, we found it composed of a vast number of cells, some of them very large, and all of them filled with blood. Their progress is slow, and we have seen them grow as big as a large walnut. They do not alter their size at different times, as is observed in the hemorrhoidal tumor, except that they are apt to swell, when allowed to remain long external to the anus. They are most commonly situated in the rectum, close to the anus; so that when the patient goes to stool they are pushed downwards,\nChap. III.\n\nSURGERY.\n\nOf Polypi downwards, and appear externally. When very large, they are also apt to come through the anus by the least exertion in walking. They are generally attended with more or less pain or uneasiness on going to stool; and when they become too large as to come through the anus in walking, the disease becomes very distressing. They are often accompanied with a discharge of mucus. Sometimes, too, hemorrhoidal tumors are formed contiguous to the polypus; but the latter is generally pointed out by the patient as the original swelling, and that which gives most pain. These tumors may also be readily distinguished from one another by their difference in colour and general form.\n\nTreatment.—Astringents, with opium, and bougies, may alleviate the symptoms; but as they seldom give permanent relief, the most complete and safest mode of cure is removing them with the knife, if they can be readily reached; if not, the ligature is preferable, although it gives much more pain; for it sometimes happens, that a very profuse bleeding follows after they have been cut away. The hemorrhoidal tumors which accompany the polypus disappear after its removal.\n\nWhen they are tied with a ligature, this can be done in most cases by simply tying a strong silk thread firmly round the base of the tumor. Often the base is larger than the apex, and then it is necessary to pass through the middle of the tumor a curved needle with two ligatures, one to tie each half of it. To prevent any mistake, and accelerate the operation, surgeons make one of the ligatures of black, and the other of white thread. Whilst the mortified part is separating, great attention is necessary to keep the surrounding parts from excoriating; and this is to be done by frequently washing with warm water, or a tartarine solution, and anointing them with tartaric ointments, or the unguentum retinum. Fig. 7. Plate DXV. gives an outline of tumors of this kind.\n\n3. Polypi of the Gums\n\nMost frequently are connected with a carious tooth, or of the alveolar processes of the jaw bone; sometimes, however, not. They are generally of a firm fleshy texture, rounded form, polished surface, and are very apt to bleed; and they sometimes grow to a very large size, and become malignant. They are best removed by the knife; and, as they bleed profusely, it is often necessary to use the actual cautery to restrain it. If the bone is found carious, the diseased part should, if possible, be removed, or means used to assist and promote its exfoliation; and when this has taken place the polypus often disappears without any operation.\n\n4. Polypus of the Frontal Sinus.\n\nThis is a very rare disease, and it produces the same dreadful consequences as that of the antrum. Art can perhaps venture to do little, as the close connection to the brain would render any attempt to remove it dangerous.\n\n5. Polypus of the Antrum Maxillare.\n\nThe surgeon is seldom aware of the presence of this disease until it is far advanced, and has begun to distend the bony cavity in which it is formed. It sometimes acquires a prodigious bulk, separating and rendering various the bones of the face, pushing the eyeball out of the orbit, and filling up the cavity of the mouth. If the nature of the complaint is early suspected, by removing a portion of the external parietes of the antrum with a trephine, the polypus may perhaps be removed from its attachments; but if that is impracticable, strong astringent applications, caustic or the actual cautery, or removing portions by the knife, may arrest the progress of the disease.\n\n6. Polypi of the Urethra.\n\nThese are what have been called caruncles, and were supposed to be the most common cause of stricture. It is now, however, well known that they occur seldom. If their growth is not checked by the use of a bougie, and if they are not near the meatus urinaris, it may be necessary in some cases to cut into upon the urethra, in order to get them extirpated; but that must happen rarely.\n\n7. Polypi of the Bladder\n\nAre beyond the reach of the surgeon, but they occur very rarely; and the distressing symptoms which attend this disease, can only be alleviated by those internal medicines which dilute the urine and allay the irritability of the bladder.\n\n8. Polypi of the Ear.\n\nThey sometimes grow from the membrana tympani, but they generally arise from the cavity of the tympanum, after the membrana tympani has been destroyed by ulceration. They resemble the common mucous polypi in structure; and they are most frequently accompanied by a discharge of puriform matter and a total loss of hearing. They may be removed with a ligature in most cases very easily; or they may be torn out with forceps; and it is always necessary to touch the part to which they adhered repeatedly with caustic, and to use strong astringent washes, in order to prevent their future growth.\n\n9. Polypus of the Conjunctiva.\n\nWe have never observed them on the conjunctiva covering the eyeball; but they are formed on the inner membrane of the eyelids, and most frequently on the upper one. They are soft pendulous masses, which, being loose, float between the eyelid and ball, and sometimes even pass beyond the edge of the lids. They are of the red colour of the inflamed mucous membrane; but those portions which are exposed to the external atmosphere become dry, and often drop off. They are often formed in consequence of the membrane being inflamed by the abscess bursting internally. They are easily removed by the knife; and they are prevented from being regenerated, by slight scarifications or the application of lunar caustic to the base.\n\n10. Of the Polypus of the Uterus.\n\nThese polypi are found to grow either from the fundus, the lower edge of the os uteri, or from the inside of the cervix. The first is the most, and the second the least frequent. The shape of the uterine polypus is generally pyriform, having a very narrow neck. They are commonly of the sarcomatous kind; though it often happens that polypi are formed in uteri affected with cancer.\ncancer. Polypi protruding into the vagina are apt to be mistaken for prolapsed uteri; and this mistake is more likely to take place in some cases where the polypus acquires a large bulk in the uterus, and is suddenly protruded into the vagina, and strangulated by the os tinci. Cases, too, of prolapsed uteri have been mistaken for, and treated as polypi.\n\nThe safest mode of removing uterine polypi is with the ligature. When it is situated in the uterus, this operation is impracticable; but when it descends into the vagina, it may be very readily done by the apparatus of Default (Plate DXV. fig. 5.).\n\nSect. VI. Of Aphthae.\n\nThe formation of aphthae, when they are examined with care in their different degrees, may probably extend our views of the intimate structure of the mucous membranes. Boerhaave considered them as small superficial ulcerations, and Stahl regarded them as tubercles or pustules. From the present state of our knowledge it is difficult to determine whether aphthae arise from the chorion of the mucous membrane, in its papillae, or in its mucous follicles.\n\nAphthae are formed on the lips, the gums, the interior of the mouth, the tongue, the palate, the amygdalae, the oesophagus, and also in the stomach and intestines. They are most frequent in children and old people, and they have been observed in people who inhabit places where the air is tainted, and who live on unwholesome food.\n\nThe aphthae of the adult may be considered as a collection, more or less agglomerated or inflamed, of white superficial rounded tubercles, each about the size of a millet seed. These tubercles discharge a serous humour; the pellicle which covers the mucous membrane is detached, and is progressively formed in the different parts of the mouth, and even in the rest of the alimentary canal. They are sometimes disseminated in solitary pustules over the tongue, the angles of the lips, or the back part of the mouth, with a benign character. At other times they are formed and seemingly propagated from the interior of the oesophagus; pass the back part of the mouth, forming a white, thick, and strongly adhering crust; and these are often dangerous from a complication of typhus fever.\n\nThe aphthous tubercles vary in colour. Sometimes they are transparent; at other times they are white, with a certain degree of thickness; they are also sometimes of a deep yellow colour, and sometimes they are livid or blackish, a symptom which always indicates a greater degree of danger.\n\nAphthae may also be frequently observed in people who have taken many courses of mercury. In these cases, the repeated action of the mercury on the mouth appears to leave on that organ a degree of sensibility or weakness which disposes it to the disease. It happens not unfrequently that these aphthae are considered as venereal sores, in consequence of the venereal disease not having been properly cured; on this supposition a new mercurial course is employed, which only augments the disposition to aphthae, and makes the sores spread more rapidly.\n\nThe aphthae of children are preceded by a profound sleep, by agitation of the muscles of the face and lips, difficulty of respiration, prostration of strength, feebleness of the pulse, and vomiting. In the mild form of the disease, white superficial spots appear in different parts of the mouth, which are separated from one another, and the surfaces are neither red nor inflamed. The bottom of the mouth has often been discoloured, and the heat immoderate; there is no difficulty in swallowing, and the child can readily suckle; the sleep is natural, and there is a slight diarrhoea. The spots during the first days preserve their whiteness and transparency; they afterwards become a little yellow, exfoliate in flakes, and go away entirely about the ninth or tenth day, particularly when the child has a nurse.\n\nThe confluent or gangrenous aphthae have other characters. The small pustules are contiguous to one another, and spread not only over the lips, the gums, the tongue, and the interior of the cheek; but we also see them at the bottom of the throat. The mouth of the child is burning; the lips are with difficulty applied to the nipple, and sometimes it is excoriated by their contact. Deglutition is very difficult, and the most simple drinks given in small quantities, and with precaution, do not enter into the stomach but with pain. There is a constant purging of greenish matter, which inflames and excoriates the skin round the anus; the child is very feeble and heavy, and the eyes are sunk and shut, and the child screams. The whole interior of the mouth from the lips to the throat becomes at last lined with a white thick crust, resembling coagulated milk. This crust becomes yellow, and forms a flough, which, after it falls off, exposes gangrenous ulcers of a dark brownish yellow colour.\n\nTreatment.—In the benign form of the disease in children, it is of great consequence to get the child a good nurse; and the affected parts may be washed over five or six times a-day with a piece of caddis dipped in a little water gruel, to which has been added a few drops of sulphuric acid. Borax, either in powder or solution, has also been considered by some as a useful application. When the crust has separated, if the remaining ulcer be painful and irritable, its surface may be rubbed over with nitrate of silver, or any other caustic application. Sometimes very malignant looking ulcers remain in the adult, after the separation of the crust. In these cases, cautery may be employed; and we have often seen them heal rapidly by touching their surfaces once a-day with a weak solution of corrosive sublimate or muriatic acid. For the treatment of the confluent aphthae, see Medicine.\n\nSect. VII. General Remarks on the Hemorrhage from Mucous Membranes.\n\nAll the mucous surfaces are particularly subject to hemorrhage; and this may arise either from a rupture of the vessels, or the blood may be poured out by the exhalents.\n\nThe superficial position of the vessels, and consequently their want of firmness and support, exposes them much to rupture by very slight concussions. We have examples of this in the bronchiae, brought on by coughing; in the nose, by slight blows on the head, or by violent sneezing; and in the rectum, by straining on going to stool. The effects of stones or gravel on the mucous membrane lining the urinary organs are the same; and even\neven the most cautious introduction of a found or bougie into the urethra, often causes bleeding; or the slightest friction of polypi of the nose and gums, or the introduction of a probe into the lachrymal passages. When considering the diseases of the skin, we mentioned, that in some diseases, particularly some phlebotomy fevers, the exhalents of the skin poured out red blood. The same thing happens among the mucous membranes. We often see blood come from the nose, from the bronchiae, stomach, and intestines, urinary bladder and kidneys, where there has been no reason to suppose ulceration previously to have taken place, or any thing to cause a rupture of any of the vessels.\n\n1. Hemorrhage from the Nose.\n\nHemorrhage from the nose arises from a variety of causes. We often observe it after fevers, and then it has been considered as critical. In young people it occurs very frequently, and from very slight causes; and it has been sometimes known to take place at the menstrual period.\n\nHemorrhage from the nose is generally preceded by symptoms of an increased quantity of blood to the head, pulsating motion of the temporal arteries, feeling of weight about the head, symptoms which are preceded or accompanied by other changes in more distant parts; such as spontaneous laffitude, pains about the belly.\n\nWhen the means mentioned for this complaint in the article Medicine have failed, recourse must be had to compulsion. Doffs of lint introduced into the nostrils are sometimes effectual; or the gut of some small animal, tied at one end, then introduced by a probe into the nose as far as the pharynx, and filled with cold water, or water and vinegar, and secured by a ligature, by adapting itself to all the parts, and prefilling equally on them, has been attended with advantage. When these remedies likewise fail in their effect, a piece of catgut or wire may be introduced through the nose into the throat, and brought out at the mouth; a piece of sponge, or a bolster of lint of a size sufficient to fill the back part of the nostril, is then to be fixed to it; the sponge is next to be drawn back and properly applied. Another is to be applied to the anterior part of the nostril and secured. The same may be done to the other nostril, if it be necessary; or the sponge may be of such a size as to fill the ends of both nostrils at the same time. By this contrivance the blood not finding an outlet, will soon coagulate, and prevent any farther evacuation.\n\n2. Hemorrhage from the Rectum, or Fluxus Hemorrhoidalis.\n\nThe discharge of blood from the rectum is a disease chiefly confined to those advanced in life. It is often occasioned by full living, change from an active to a very sedentary life, the abuse of purgatives, particularly aloes; violent passions, or habitual melancholy. The symptoms which precede and accompany this disease, are bearing down pains, and a sensation of weight in the back and loins, sometimes a numbness in the limbs, and a contracted pulse, thirst, diminution of urine, flatus, and sometimes a discharge by stool of a white mucus. The discharge returns commonly in a periodical manner once a month, and thus becomes necessary for the preservation of health; for if it be suppressed, or if it stops spontaneously, it occasions a variety of nervous affections, such as spasmodic tightenings about the chest, colic and vertigo.\n\nTreatment.—When the hemorrhoidal discharge has become habitual like the menstrual discharge, we not only ought not to attempt curing it, but if it be from any cause suppressed, it ought to be restored. If it be the effect of general plethora, it is to be removed by a vegetable diet and moderate exercise. In order to moderate the discharge, the patient ought to lie in the horizontal posture on a hard bed, avoid all exercise, keep the belly open by cooling laxatives, or even to take acids if the bleeding is excessive, and apply cold to the loins and perineum. As a sudden suppression of the hemorrhoidal discharge is the cause of many diseases, it is of much importance to reproduce it. To effect this, leeches applied to the anus, and warm fomentations, are the most efficacious remedies.\n\n3. Hemorrhage from the Bladder (Hematuria).\n\nHemorrhage from the bladder is a disease most frequent in old people; it is often occasioned by a suppression of the hemorrhoidal discharge, or any other accumulated discharge of blood. It is sometimes the consequence of excess in living and drinking, and of a sedentary life followed by great exercise. It also arises from a plethoric state of the system, violent exercise on horseback, the internal use of cantharides, a contusion in the region of the kidneys, or from stone in the bladder.\n\nTreatment.—The treatment to be employed is the same as in hemorrhage in general. Everything ought to be avoided which might tend to irritate the kidneys or the urinary bladder. Laxatives, acid drinks, the application of ice to the lumbar region, hypogaltrium, and perineum, or to the inside of the thighs, is of great importance. Under the articles Medicine and Midwifery, we have considered the hemorrhages from the lungs and uterus. We may here remark the connection and strong sympathy which subsists between these organs, and also between them and the other organs of the body; for a minute acquaintance with these may often lead to a successful mode of treating their diseases. When the menes are suppressed, there is often a hemorrhage from the mucous membrane of the lungs; and there are also many cases of obstruction in the bowels which bring on hemorrhage both from the lungs and uterus; a hemorrhage which never ceases until the primary affection be removed.\n\nSect. VIII. General Remarks on the Ulceration of Mucous Membranes.\n\nSimple inflammation of a mucous surface seldom, if ever, terminates in ulceration, most ulcers of these parts having a specific character. The venereal inflammation rapidly terminates in ulceration; and aphthae have the same tendency, forming often what are called phagedenic sores.\n\nThe mucous membrane of the nose is peculiarly subject to ulceration; ulcers also occur in the different parts of the mouth and gums, in the intestinal canal, and also, though very seldom, in the urethra. It is\nOf Ulcers of the Nose, or Ozana.\n\nThis species of ulcer sometimes appears in the nostrils, and sometimes in the frontal or maxillary sinus. It generally succeeds a violent coryza. It also sometimes arises from blows on the nose, or from the application of very acrid substances. Ozana is often accompanied with inflammation, hemorrhage, pains, caries of the bones which sometimes destroys the palate bones, cartilages of the nostrils; and by hindering more or less the free passage of the air, it alters the tone of the voice.\n\nTreatment.—In the simple ozana, much benefit generally arises from the use of astringent washes, such as a decoction of oak-bark and alum, solutions of sulphate or acetate of zinc, or the acetate of lead. The best mode of using these is to inject them a little warmed, with a common syringe, into the affected nostril, three or four times a day; and when the quantity of discharge diminishes and becomes of a better quality, an ointment composed of the flowers of zinc or the like, spread on a piece of lint, should be introduced once or twice a day into the nostril.\n\nWhen the ozana is of a more virulent nature, and the bones affected with caries, there is generally great reason to suspect a venereal taint. This can only be determined by the history of the complaint and the constitutional symptoms of the venereal disease being present. In such cases mercury is the only remedy, and along with its internal use the injection of mercurial lotions, and the use of fumigations, will be serviceable. In such ulcers as are obstinate, and which do not partake of any venereal taint, a liniment, with an eighth part of the red precipitate of mercury, or a smaller proportion of the acetate of copper, has been recommended by Mr Bell as a useful application. In some cases, too, where, after the venereal taint is destroyed by a proper mercurial course, there remains an obstinate sore, the above liniment may be useful, and it has also been found in such cases of much advantage, a course of sarsaparilla or cinchona.\n\nChap. IV.\n\nOf the Diseases of Serous Membranes.\n\nGeneral Remarks on the Pathology of Serous Membranes.\n\nThe phenomena of the diseases of serous membranes are very different from any of those of the other textures which have been mentioned. When they are attacked with inflammation, the serous surfaces often adhere together, or if suppuration takes place, it is never accompanied with ulceration or erosion of their substance. However abundant these purulent collections may be, the membranes always remain sound, with only a little additional thickness; the purulent fluid rejected from them, being like the natural fluid formed by exhalation.\n\nThe serous cavities are also subject to hemorrhage, and to premature collections of the exhaled fluid.\n\nUnder the article Medicine we have treated of inflammation of the pleura, membranes of the brain and peritoneum, and also of hemorrhage from these organs. Of Ascites.\n\nIn this place we shall consider dropsy and hemorrhage from the vaginal coat of the testes, as the only diseases belonging to surgery.\n\nSect. I. Dropsy of the Peritoneum, or Ascites.\n\nWhen water collects in a considerable quantity within the cavity of the peritoneum, the skin becomes dry and scurfy, and the superficial veins varicose. In one case they appeared like large tubes half filled with blood, the anterior part of the canal thin and dry, and the posterior portion hard and unyielding. The skin at the umbilicus is sometimes much distended, and the water seen shining through it as in a common blister. The water varies much in its appearance; most frequently it is yellow or brownish. We have seen it as thick and dark coloured as coffee grounds. In one case it was viscid and tenacious, resembling the white of an egg; and in other instances it resembled milk and water, with the milk partly curdled. Ascites is generally accompanied with a disease of some of the abdominal viscera, and most frequently the liver.\n\nIt is not confined to any particular period of life, but has been observed more frequently in men than in women.\n\nThe symptoms of ascites are, 1. The swelling and sense of tightness over the belly. 2. Laborious and difficult breathing, especially in the horizontal posture. 3. The distinct feeling of fluctuation, upon applying one hand to one side of the belly, and striking it with the other hand on the opposite side. 4. The urine is in small quantity, and of a dark red colour. There is also thirst, a dry skin, often a feeling of heat, and very frequently oedema of the inferior extremities.\n\nParacentesis.—When the swelling becomes large, and Operation internal medicines have no effect in diminishing it, it is advisable to discharge the water by an artificial opening, an operation which seldom cures the disease, but is always attended with temporary relief, and may be repeated as often as the water is found to collect. Smucker has performed it seventy times, and protracted the patient's life for many years. The operation is to be performed by introducing a trocar* at the linea alba, as in a hydrocele, about two or three inches below the umbilicus. Many surgeons now prefer this place, as it prevents all risk of wounding the epigastric artery, or any other important part. It was formerly the common practice to introduce the instrument on the left side of the abdomen, half way between the umbilicus and anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, in order to avoid the liver and epigastric artery. But those who laid down this rule were not aware of the change in the relative situation of parts when diseased; and it has several times happened to Mr Cline and other eminent surgeons, in performing the operation at this place, that they have wounded the epigastric artery, and the patient has died of hemorrhage. The direction of the abdominal muscles in patients who have died of dropsy, shows how much the recti are extended in breadth, and the situation of the epigastric artery changed.\n\nThe place for entering the trocar being determined, and marked with ink, the patient should be placed in the horizontal posture, and in such a situation that the\nwater can be run off readily into a vessel proper to receive it. But as patients are very apt to faint if the water is suddenly removed, and no pressure applied to support the belly as it is emptied, it is necessary to make an equal pressure during, and after the operation. From neglecting this in some cases, dangerous symptoms have arisen, and in one instance the patient died three days after the operation from this cause.\n\nA piece of flannel as broad as the belly, and divided into several pieces at each end, and these drawn across each other by assistants, or the bandage *, answers for this purpose. By either of these modes the belly may be gradually compressed as the water is let out, and the compression continued for several days after the operation. Sometimes the water does not come out readily, by a portion of omentum or intestine coming in contact with the end of the canal; but the discharge may be assisted by introducing within the canal a blunt probe, or a less canal within the first, having small perforations at the extremity and edges. After all the water is discharged, a piece of plaster should be applied to the wound, and every caution taken to exclude the admixture of the external air. The bandage should also be kept applied, and it may be worn for some time.\n\n**Sect. II. Water collected in the Cavity of the Vaginal Coat, or Hydrocele.**\n\nThe effusion of water in the tunica vaginalis frequently accompanies hernia, the scrophulous schirrus, venereal and other enlargements of the testicle; but in such cases, it is merely to be considered as a symptom accompanying these disorders. Mr Home mentions cases where it was a symptom of stricture. It occurs also during the abatement of inflammation of the testicle; and sometimes more or less of the water remains after the inflammatory symptoms have disappeared. In cases of this kind the tunica vaginalis is generally found thickened, and there is an effusion of lymph over its surface and over the surface of the albuginea. In many cases, the water is collected where there is no apparent alteration in the structure of the parts. The disease in such cases most probably arises either from a diminished absorption or from an increased exhalation. If the disease has been of long duration, the tunica vaginalis is generally thickened, to a great degree sometimes; and particularly in old people it becomes hard or cartilaginous. We have seen several preparations where it was converted into a shell of bone. We have met with two cases where a round substance resembling cartilage was found floating loose in the water of a hydrocele. It is not uncommon to find the vessels also of the spermatic veins become more or less varicose. Collections of water of a very considerable size form sometimes after birth (wind rupture); but in old people they are most frequent. The water is usually collected only in one cavity; but it sometimes happens, that in consequence of adhesions between the tunica vaginalis and testicle, several irregular shaped bags are formed in which it is contained. The water usually collects in one side of the scrotum, sometimes also in both. The water is generally clear and straw-coloured, sometimes it is coloured with blood, sometimes yellow or brown, and sometimes thick, and like coffee grounds. See Morgagni, Ep. xxxviii.\n\nThe quantity of water varies. In the Acta Erud. Lipsiensis 1725, p. 492, there is mention made of a case which contained forty pounds of fluid. Doight saw one which contained four pounds. There are sometimes also hydatids found along with the water. Richter has met with four cases of this kind.\n\n**Symptoms.—1.** The scrotum is commonly of a pyramidal form, and the corrugations of the external skin are destroyed in proportion to the bulk of the swelling. The shape of the tumor, however varies; in some cases, it is very globular, and in others it appears like two swellings joined. It is even altered from the manner in which it is suspended; if a bag trus has been worn it is usually oblong. 2. The swelling generally begins at the lower part of the scrotum, and as its bulk increases, it gradually ascends towards the abdominal ring. 3. It appears pellucid when held between the eye and a candle; but this is not a certain prognostic, as the transparency is destroyed when the tunica vaginalis is thick and hard, or when the water is turbid and dark. 4. It gives the distinct sensation of fluctuation. In some cases, however, the degree of thickening of the tunica vaginalis renders the fluctuation obscure or imperceptible, and also destroys its transparency. 5. The tumor cannot be made to recede or change its situation from pressure or change of posture of the body. 6. The testicle is involved in the swelling, and can be distinguished like a firm unyielding mass at the posterior part of it. In cases where adhesions have been formed, the position varies; but the patient generally knows where it lies, and pressure applied to the part of the swelling where it is situated gives pain. Sometimes the testicle is placed at the under part of the swelling, sometimes in the middle. Mr Bell felt it twice forwards. Sometimes along with the water there are hydatids floating in the cavity of the vaginal coat. Sommering says, that he has often observed this appearance. 7. The spermatic cord can be readily distinguished unaltered. 8. The tumor gives little or no pain, and the patient suffers merely from its bulk. 9. The growth of the swelling is generally very slow, and sometimes years elapse before it becomes a great inconvenience; sometimes, however, it forms rapidly. When it grows very large, the integuments become thick, and the veins varicose; if the swelling extends up to the inguinal ring, the cord cannot be felt, and the penis is sometimes so much involved in the tumor, that it appears like an umbilicus or piece of corrugated skin.\n\n**Treatment.**—In children, the water generally disappears in a short time, by the application of strong astringent or diuretic applications. In some cases, the disease advances so slowly, that it is sufficient to wear a suspensory bandage. Richter mentions a case where it was twenty years old before it was necessary to remove the water. When the swelling becomes so large as to render it necessary to discharge the water, the operation may be either palliative or radical. The object of the first is merely to remove the water, after which the disease commonly returns; and by the second, an adhesion is intended to be produced between the surface of the vaginal coat and albuginea, and consequently the cavity in which the water was collected entirely obliterated. In making choice of these modes of treatment,\nit is necessary to attend to the following rules. 1. When the hydrocele is large, it is safer to perform the palliative operation; and afterwards when it has again collected in less bulk, the radical one may be employed. 2. When the state of the testicle is not accurately ascertained, it is better first merely to discharge the water, which allows it to be completely examined. 3. The palliative operation should be employed in all cases where the disease is connected with a morbid state of any contiguous organ. 4. In all other cases, the radical operation is preferable.\n\nPalliative Operation.—The matter may be discharged either by a puncture made with a lancet or by a small trocar.\n\nWhen the trocar * is to be introduced, the posterior part of the tumor should be firmly grasped in the left hand, so that the fluid is pushed to the anterior and inferior part of it. A puncture is to be made, with a lancet, through the integuments at the most prominent part of the swelling, large enough to admit readily the trocar, taking care to avoid any large superficial vein. The trocar is then to be pushed through the coats of the tumor perpendicularly; but when it has entered the cavity, which is known by the feeling of a sudden want of resistance, the point should be directed upward, and carried forward a sufficient way; so that the surgeon is assured of its being within the cavity so far that there is no risk of its falling out.\n\nAfter all the matter has been allowed to flow out, and the canula withdrawn, the wound should be covered with a piece of sticking plaster, and the scrotum supported by a suspensory bandage. If the operation is to be done with a lancet, an incision should be first made through the skin, rather larger than what is necessary into the cavity. Then a puncture is to be made through the tunica vaginalis, which will allow the water to flow out; and the discharge may be assisted by the introduction of a probe, director, or hollow tube, into the opening. The trocar should always be employed for this operation, except when the hydrocele is so small that the testicle would be in danger of being wounded by it, or when there is any enlargement of the testicle accompanying the hydrocele, which is not well underfilled, or if the tunica vaginalis is extremely thick and the fluctuation not distinct.\n\nRadical Operation.—An obliteration of the tunica vaginalis may be produced either by an effusion of lymph on the surfaces of the tunica vaginalis and albuginea, or by the process of granulation. The first is effected by injecting into the cavity a stimulating fluid to produce inflammation and adhesion; the second is by laying open the cavity to produce inflammation and suppuration, and to allow it to fill by granulation.\n\nBy Injection.—Dr. Monro primus first proposed and adopted this ingenious, yet simple mode of cure; and it is now that which is most generally practised in all cases not attended with any peculiarity or puzzling symptom. The fluid contained in the tunica vaginalis, is to be discharged by a trocar, in the manner recommended in the palliative treatment. The trocar for this purpose should be of a rounded form, which is either altogether cylindrical, or only a small slit at its extremity; for that of André, which is flat and slit up at both sides, is apt to allow the fluid to be effused into the cellular membrane of the scrotum; an accident which we have seen repeatedly happen, and always frustrates the object of the operation.\n\nThe fluid is then to be injected through the canula either by a syringe (Plate DXIV.), which has a moveable stop-cock, that it may be filled as frequently as is necessary, or by an elastic bottle, which has a valve in its pipe, so as to allow the fluid to pass forward, but to prevent its exit. It is not necessary to inject as much fluid, as there was water in the hydrocele; it answers well to fill the cavity moderately and by gentle strokes on the scrotum agitate it over the whole surface. The fluid most commonly employed is port wine. Some recommend it to be diluted, but it is better to use it pure, and allow it to remain a longer or shorter time according to the degree of pain it excites, and the general irritability of the patient. In hospitals, other fluids are used, as being less expensive. Mr Cline of St Thomas's hospital employs a solution of the sulphate of zinc 5i. ad lbi. From five minutes to a quarter of an hour is in most cases a sufficient length of time to allow the wine to remain. If it excite severe pain in the testicle or cord, it may be detained more or less time. A considerable degree of uneasiness is always to be wished for in order to secure success in the operation. After the wine is withdrawn, the wound should be covered with a piece of sticking plaster or caddis; the scrotum well supported with either pillows or a truss, and the patient put to bed. The operation excites more or less swelling in a longer or shorter period. The medium effect on the testicle is to cause it to swell about the bulk of a turkey's egg in four or five days; and the surgeon should, by pursuing the antiphlogistic regimen, moderate as far as in his power the inflammatory symptoms to that pitch, and by an opposite treatment bring them up to that degree should they be too mild. Low diet, local or even general blood-letting, purging, the horizontal posture and fomentations, are the most powerful means to arrest inflammation; but if the patient has little pain, he should live on a nourishing diet, and some local stimulant may be applied over the scrotum until a sufficient degree of inflammation comes on. If the inflammatory symptoms abate, the swelling disappears; and it is advisable to wear always afterwards a bag truss to support the whole scrotum. In some cases the water again collects, and then the operation should be repeated; but it requires caution, as the relative situation of parts is sometimes altered from some partial adhesions having formed between the tunics.\n\nWe have seen frequently cases where it was thought that the water had been regenerated a few days after the operation, which swelling afterwards disappeared. This probably arises from an effusion in the cellular membrane, but it requires no particular treatment.\n\nBy Incision.—After grasping the tumor firmly, an incision is to be made through the skin with a scalpel, from its superior to its inferior part. A puncture is to be made towards the upper part, with a lancet, large enough to admit the point of the fore finger; the fluid is allowed gradually to escape through the opening; and the tunica vaginalis is to be laid open its whole extent with a probe-pointed bistoury in the same direction as the incision through the integuments. Pledgets of lint dipped in oil,\noil, or covered with simple ointment, are to be put between the lips of the wound, down to the bottom of the cavity, one on each side of the testicle; and the edges of the scrotum are to be brought together either by strips or future. A single ligature put through the integuments opposite the testicle, answers best, and prevents the testicle from being pulled without the edges of the wound in consequence of the degree of swelling the operation occasions. The whole should be covered with a pledget of ointment, and suspended in a tight bandage.\n\nIn three or four days after the operation, the external dressings should be removed; and in one or two days more, the pledgets interposed between the tunica vaginalis and testicle may be taken away and renewed. The ligature should be cut out whenever the swelling of the parts begins to abate, or at any time when it appears to create irritation. During the cure, great care should be taken, first, by the introduction of slips of plaster, to prevent the union but from the bottom; secondly, to guard against the collection of matter in any cavity; thirdly, to prevent the lips of the wound separating far, thus exposing the testicle and protracting the cure; and fourthly, to lay open freely any sinuses which may form. The cure goes on much more rapidly by persevering in the horizontal posture, and keeping the scrotum well supported. The bowels should be always kept open and regular, and when suppuration has begun, the patient's strength should be supported by a nourishing diet and bark or port wine, if necessary. The cure takes from three to eight weeks in most cases.\n\nThis mode of operating, is the most eligible when there is any ambiguity in the case, as it allows the testicles to be accurately examined, and castration performed if necessary. It ought also to be performed when the tunica vaginalis is much thickened and hardened, and it is sometimes necessary, even to cut away some of the hardest portions. The mode of curing hydrocele by a felon, cautery, &c., are now generally given up.\n\nSect. III. Dropsy of the Thorax, or Hydrothorax.\n\nThe fluid is sometimes confined to one, and sometimes affects both sides of the chest. It is commonly of a brown or yellow colour; sometimes it is reddish from a mixture of blood. Its chemical qualities are those of serum. When it is accumulated in a large quantity, the lungs are more or less comprimised. Dr Baillie has seen a lung not larger than the closed fist. It is also in some instances accompanied with adhesions between the surface of the lungs and pleura.\n\nThe existence of water is known by the following symptoms. Respiration is short and difficult; and the patient cannot rest in bed, except the head and trunk be elevated from the horizontal posture. The sleep is often interrupted by alarms and disagreeable dreams, and the patient suddenly starts from it with a sense of suffocation: he is unable to stoop much forward, or raise anything from the ground. There is sometimes a tearing cough, with little expectoration. During the progress of the disease, the pulse is very variable; but it is generally irregular. The countenance is pale, and the lips and cheeks of a purple hue. The urine is diminished in quantity, and of a high colour. The bowels are generally constipated. The feet and legs are commonly anaerous. The undulation of a fluid may be heard by the patient himself, and moving the body by sudden jerks will sometimes assist in discovering the dropsy. The affected side has in some cases been observed to be enlarged.\n\nThis disease is treated by the exhibition of internal medicines, where the quantity of water is small; but when it collects in such a quantity as to threaten suffocation, it ought to be discharged by an opening made into the cavity of the thorax. The incision ought to be made between the fifth and sixth ribs, half way between the sternum and spine; two inches in length through the skin. The subjacent parts ought to be cautiously divided; and the incision should be directed rather towards the upper part of the fifth rib, to avoid wounding the intercostal artery and nerve, which creep along the inferior edge of the fifth rib. The pleura, which is distinguished by its bluish colour, should be carefully cut with the point of the knife; so that, in case of adhesion, the lung is not wounded: and if the water flows out, a canula should be introduced into the opening. If it does not, in consequence of adhesion, another incision must be made. Great care should be taken to prevent the admission of air, and for that purpose, the opening should be made valvular, by pulling up the skin which is to be cut through. If the quantity is very great, it may be drawn off at two different intervals; or if it is collected in both cavities of the thorax.\n\nSect. IV. Dropsy of the Pericardium.\n\nWater is sometimes found in the pericardium when there is none in any other cavity of the thorax, but it is generally accompanied with a collection of water in some of them. The symptoms of this disease are nearly similar to those of hydrothorax; and we find that Deffault and other very eminent surgeons have not been able to distinguish them. Dr Baillie says, \"that the feeling of oppression is more accurately confined to the situation of the heart; and the heart is more disturbed in its functions in dropsy of the pericardium than in hydrothorax.\" It is also said, that a firm undulatory motion can be felt at every stroke of the heart.\n\nIf the existence of this complaint is ascertained, and if the quantity of water is suspected to be great, it may be perhaps advisable to discharge it, as practised in one case by Deffault, by making an opening between the fifth and seventh ribs of the left side, opposite to the apex of the heart.\n\nSect. V. Blood effused in the Tunica Vaginalis. (Hæmatocèle).\n\nThe effusion of blood within the cavity of the vaginal coat is characterized by the sudden appearance of the tumor, by its wanting the transparency of a hydrocele, by its greater weight, and by its being most commonly occasioned by some accident. It is usually produced by the trocar used in performing the palliative operation wounding a vessel which pours its blood into the vaginal cavity; it is still more apt to happen when a lancet is used and a varicose vessel punctured. It also takes place from the rupture of a varicose vessel by the sudden depletion of a large hydrocele.\n\nIf the swelling is small, it may disappear by the local\nule of difcutents and stimulants, such as solutions of saccharum saturni, or that of alum, vinegar, &c. If it does not yield to these, and if it has acquired a considerable bulk, the blood should be discharged by an incision; and any bleeding vessel either secured by a ligature, or by strong stimulants, and the wound afterwards treated as in common hydrocele.\n\nChap. V.\n\nDiseases of the Sinovial Membranes.\n\nSect. I. General Observations on the Pathology of Sinovial Membranes.\n\nThe diseases of the sinovial membranes are much more limited and less understood than those of the textures which we have examined. They do not appear to be sympathetically affected in the diseases of other parts. In the acute diseases of the important viscera, the skin, the mucous surfaces, the cellular membrane, the nerves, &c., are more or less sympathetically affected, whilst all the sinovial membranes remain undisturbed. In this respect they resemble the bones, cartilages, and fibrous membranes. Neither is the sinovial fluid subject to the different alterations, which we observe of the serous fluid. We never find any preternatural membranes formed on the articulating surfaces; and the preternatural collections of sinovia never contain any of the white flocculent matter so frequent in serous collections.\n\nThe sinovial membranes are subject to inflammation, and are probably the seat of many of those pains about the joints which are so frequent. Their fluids are also sometimes increased to a preternatural quantity, and chalky or earthy depositions are also occasionally found in them.\n\nSect. II. Of Ganglions.\n\nAn increase of the sinovial fluid in the bursae, or tendinous sheaths, forms a species of dropy called a ganglion. It is not, however, probable that these tumors are always formed in a natural sinovial capsule; most commonly they are accidental, and are formed in the cellular membrane; for they are frequently found in parts where no natural capsule exists. They are most frequently met with over the tendons upon the back of the wrist, and often likewise about those of the ankle and other parts of the extremities. When pressed, they are found to possess a considerable degree of elasticity, from which, and from their situation, they may generally be distinguished from other encysted tumors. They seldom arrive at any great bulk, are not often attended with pain, and commonly the skin retains its natural appearance. On being laid open, they are found to contain a tough, viscid, transparent fluid, resembling the glair of egg, which is also sometimes of a reddish colour.\n\nThey are generally produced by sprains or contusions of the joints, or by rheumatism. In many instances, they go off infensibly, without any affluence from art; but as this is often not the case, means ought to be used for removing them. For this purpose, friction frequently repeated, or gentle compression applied to them by means of thin plates of lead and bandages, sometimes remove them. In some instances they have been removed by the application of blisters; but the most certain method is, to make a small puncture into the sac, or to draw a cord through it; or, after the puncture is made, to press out the contents, and then inject some gently stimulating fluid, as port wine and water heated blood-warm.\n\nSect. III. Of Collections within the Capsular Ligaments of the Joints.\n\nCollections here may consist of serum, blood, or pus and synovia combined. They are most frequently met with in the joint of the knee, and may be produced either by internal or external causes. These kinds of collections may in general be distinguished from each other.\n\nWatery effusions, commonly called dropsical swellings of the joints, arise chiefly in consequence of severe rheumatic complaints; and when the tumor is not very large, the fluctuation of the fluid may be felt by pressure. When a large effusion appears immediately after a violent bruise, it is probable that it consists chiefly of blood; but when it succeeds a violent sprain, attended with great pain, inflammation, and swelling, terminating in an effusion, there is every reason to think that the contained fluid consists of pus mixed with synovia.\n\nSwellings of the joints are most apt to be confounded with collections in the bursa mucosa, or with matter effused in the adjacent cellular substance. From the first of these they are generally distinguished by the contained fluid passing readily from one side of the joint to the other, and from its being diffused over the whole of it; whereas, when it is contained in the bursa, the tumor is confined to a particular part, and is seldom attended with much pain.\n\nWhen such collections can safely be allowed to remain, the capsular ligament ought never to be opened, as they can often be removed by difcutents. Even considerable collections arising from rheumatism may commonly be dissipated by friction, fomenting the parts with warm vapour, keeping them constantly moist with farinaceous solutions, covering them properly with flannel, and applying blisters. When these fail, supporting the part with a laced flocking, or with a roller, has frequently been of service. But whether a rheumatic tumor can be dissipated or not, it ought not to be opened; for the inconvenience attending it is more tolerable than the pain and inflammation which may ensue. But when the matter would do mischief by lodging, it should be discharged. Effused blood and matter which succeed high degrees of inflammation are of this kind. Blood is frequently extravasated among soft parts without much detriment; but when in contact with cartilage or bone, it soon injures them. The matter ought to be discharged so as most effectually to prevent the admission of air into the cavity of the joint. For this purpose the opening should be made with a trocar; and the skin, previously drawn tight to the upper part of the tumor, should be pulled down immediately on withdrawing the canula. A piece of adhesive plaster should be immediately laid over the opening, and the whole joint should be firmly supported by a flannel roller carefully applied. If the patient be plethoric, he should be bled to such an extent as his strength will bear; he should\nChap. VI.\n\nSURGERY.\n\nOf the Diseases which are found within the Sinovial Capsules.\n\nMoveable bodies have been found in many of the sinovial capsules of the human body. But they are most frequent in the knee joint; and it is there only where they require surgical affluence. These bodies are generally composed of cartilage in the form of lamellae, and there is often an osseous concretion in their centre. The cause of their formation is not known; but it is probable that they are formed by a gradual deposition of the cartilaginous matter on the articulating surface. They have been often met with, attached by narrow necks to the sinovial cavity; so that when this attachment is destroyed, they float loose in the cavity, and undergo perhaps but little future change.\n\nWhen they occur in the knee joint, and acquire such a bulk as to obstruct or derange the motions of the joint, it then becomes necessary to remove them. This ought to be done by bringing the moveable body to the outer part of the joint, and making a valvular incision of such a size as admits of its extraction. Sometimes much inflammation succeeds this operation, which ought to make us careful in choosing a proper time for performing it, and in using every endeavour to prevent any inflammatory symptoms afterwards.\n\nSect. V. Of the Spina Bifida.\n\nSpina bifida is a tumor which sometimes appears upon the lower part of the spine in new-born children. A fluctuation is distinctly perceived in it, and the fluid it contains can in some measure be pressed in at an opening between the vertebrae. In some cases this opening is owing to a natural deficiency of bone; in others, to the separation of the spinous processes of the vertebrae.\n\nThe disease proceeds from a serous looking fluid collected within the coverings of the spinal marrow. It is always fatal. Children labouring under it have been known to live for two or three years; but, in general, they linger and die in a few weeks. All that art has been able to do is to support the tumor by gentle pressure with a proper bandage. When a tumor of this kind is laid open or burled, the child generally dies in a few hours. A tumor nearly of the same nature with this is sometimes met with upon different parts of the head in new-born children: it is formed by a fluid lodged beneath the membranes of the brain, which have been forced out at some unoffended part of the skull. What we have said with respect to the former is exactly applicable to this disease.\n\nChap. VI.\n\nOf the Diseases of the Bones.\n\nSect. I. General Remarks on the Pathology of the Bones.\n\nThe diseases of bones are remarkable for their slow progress, in comparison with what is observed in the other organs. Inflammation proceeds extremely slowly, and callus is remarkable when compared with the cicatrization of other parts, for the length of time necessary for its formation; the origin and progress too of an ex-crust of the osseous is very different from a tumor of the soft parts, as we observe in phlegmon. Suppuration too, which requires only a few days in other organs, takes months before the same process is completed in bones. There is also a striking difference between a gangrene of the soft parts and a caries or necrosis of the bones. In the natural state the bones have no sensibility, but when diseased, they are often the seat of acute pain; we observe this in the spina ventosa, in caries, necrosis, &c. Besides the changes to which the bones are subject from inflammation and various accidents, they also suffer alterations in their hardness and softness. Premature growths also form upon them; and they are liable to absorption.\n\nSect. II. Of Particular Diseases of the Bones.\n\nThe bones, as well as the softer parts, are liable to be inflamed, either throughout their whole length, or to have tumors formed on particular parts of them.\n\nExostosis is one species of tumor of the bone. According to Mr. Bromfield, no swelling should be called so, but an excrescence continued from a bone, like a branch from the trunk of a tree. Under this head therefore is ranked the benign node, which may be produced by external injury, such as contusions and fractures: it can hardly be called a disease, as pain seldom succeeds, but rather a deformity.\n\nThere are rings or tumors observable on the bones which are often the consequences of venereal virus, and are termed tophi gummi, or nodus.—Tophus is a soft tumor in the bone; and seems to be formed of a chalky substance, that is intermediate between the osseous fibres. These cretaceous extravasations are sometimes found on the ligaments and tendons, as well as on the bone; and may sometimes be taken out by the knife. We have many instances where chalk stones in gouty people make their way out through the skin of the fingers and toes.\n\nGummi is a soft tumor on the surface of the bone, between it and the periosteum; and its contents resemble gum softened, from whence it has taken its name.\n\nThe confirmed venereal node has the appearance of a venereal divarication of the osseous fibres. When the periosteum node is thickened, but the bone not affected, a course of mercury will often produce a perfect cure: but when the bone itself is diseased, this method will often fail. But here the division of the extended periosteum has been known to give perfect ease.\n\nThe usual method, formerly, was to apply a caustic equal to the extent of the node, which being laid bare, required exfoliation before it could be cicatrizated. If the incision is made early, that is, before matter be formed under the investing membrane, it seldom requires exfoliation; and, as we often find that the bone itself is not affected, but only the periosteum thickened, we may be deceived even after a careful examination: it is therefore proper that the patient should be pretty far advanced in a course of mercurial unction before even the incision is made; for, should the tumor decrease, and the pain abate during the course, surgical assistance, with the knife, most likely may become unnecessary.\nA bone may become carious first in its internal parts; and that from external injury, as well as from a vitiated state of the animal-fluids. Authors seem not to agree as to the technical term for this kind of disease of the bones; some calling it cancer or gangrena effis; others, spina ventosa, from the pointed exuberances usually attendant on this disorder of the bone; and some again, teredo, from the appearance of the carious bone, like wood that is worm-eaten.\n\nIt is universally allowed, that this disease takes its rise from matter being formed either in the diploe, or in the marrow: whenever obstruction is begun in the vessels expanded on, or terminating in, the medullary cavity, the consequence will be inflammation, and, if not early removed, matter will form; for this reason this case may be called abfectus in medulla. Whenever, then, a patient complains of dull heavy pain, deeply situated in the bone, consequent to a violent blow received on the part some time before, though the integuments appear perfectly sound, and the bone itself not in the least injured, we have great reason to suspect an abscess in the medulla. Children of a bad habit of body, though they have not suffered any external injury, will often become lame, and complain of the limb being remarkably heavy; and though not attended with acute pain, yet the dull throbbing uneasiness is constant. If rigors happen during the time the patient labours under this indisposition, it generally implies that matter will be formed within the substance of the bone. If the extremities of the diseased bone swell, or if it becomes enlarged throughout its whole extent, it may be known to be an abscess in the medulla, or the true spina ventosa, as it is called: if neither of these symptoms take place, the great infirmity of the bone in some subjects will prevent that acuteness of pain usual in other parts where matter is formed, though the acid matter is eroding the bone during the whole time it is contained within it.\n\nThis matter at length having made its way through, arrives at the periosteum, where it creates most violent pain. The integuments then become swollen and inflamed, and have a sort of emphysematous feel. On being examined by pressure, the tumor will sometimes be softened, from part of the matter retiring into the bone: from this appearance to the touch, most likely the name of ventosa was added to the term spina.\n\nWhen we are assured of matter being under the periosteum, we cannot be too early in letting it out, as it will save a considerable deal of pain to the patient, though probably it may not be of any considerable advantage in respect to the carious bone; for, where the fluids in general are vitiated, no chance of cure can be expected from topical remedies; but where the constitution is mended, nature will sometimes afford us in her part, as the carious bone will be thrown off from the epiphyses, or the teredines will be filled up by the offensive matter that flows from the parts of the bone where some of the spine have come away.\n\nIf proper medicines are given, the children well supported, and the parts kept clean and dry, patience and perseverance will frequently give great credit to the surgeon. In case it should have been thought advisable to apply a trephine, to give free discharge to the matter, the wailing it away, as well as the small crumbling of the carious bone, by means of detergent and drying injections, has been known to contribute greatly to the curing this kind of caries, after the habit of body in general had been mended.\n\nBesides those above-mentioned, the bones are liable to two opposite diseases; the one termed friability, the other mollification; the former peculiar to adults, the latter more frequent in infants, though sometimes seen in adults, from a vitiated state of their juices.\n\nFrom repeated falvations, the bones in old people Rickets have been rendered extremely brittle; insomuch that in many subjects they have been fractured merely from their weight and the action of the muscles: but in such cases, this is not owing to the friability of the bones, but to the loss of substance, from the erosion of the bone by an acrimonious humour thrown on it: to which cause perhaps may be attributed the disease called rickets in children. The effects of scurbutic humour in rendering the bones soft in many instances, have often been remarked.\n\nBy proper diet, gentle friction, exercise, and cold bathing, rickety children will frequently get their constitution so much changed, as that, by the time they arrive at the age of 20 years, there shall not remain the least vestige of their former disease. The epiphyses are generally most affected in this species of the disorder. For want of early attention to invalids of this sort, we find that their bones not only become soft, and yield to the powers of the muscles, but remain distorted during the rest of life, though they have acquired a perfect degree of solidity. In such cases, therefore, the affluence of a skilful mechanic is necessary both to support the parts improperly acted on, and to alter the line of direction of the distorted osseous fibres.\n\nThough the curvature of the extremities, or thicknesses of the ends of the bones near their articulations, may give the first alarm to those who are constantly with children, yet there are other symptoms that give earlier notice; which if they had been timely discovered, it is highly probable that the curvature of the limbs in many children might not have happened. The belly generally becomes larger in this disease, from the increased size of the contained bowels; the head then becomes enlarged; then a difficulty of breathing succeeds, which is generally supposed to be the effects of taking cold. The sternum is elevated and sharp, and the thorax becomes contracted; the spine is protruded in several parts; the pelvis altered, according to the pressure of the parts within, and habitual inclination of the patient to obtain that line of direction in which the perpendicular from the centre of gravity may fall within the common base of the body, the extremities of the cylindrical bones, and the ends of the ribs next the sternum, become enlarged; soon after this the bones in general become soft and flexible, yielding in such directions as the strongest muscles determine.\n\nWhere the affection of the mesenteric glands is evident, Mr Bromefield affirms, that after a dose or two of the pulvis basilicus to empty the intestines thoroughly, the purified crude quicksilver is by much the most efficacious medicine to remove obstructions in those glands. When the belly begins to soften and subside, the chyle passes without interruption, and the child begins to get flesh; then the cold bath becomes truly serviceable, and the decoction or cold infusion of the Peruvian bark is a proper\nOf the Diseases of the Arterial System.\n\nSect. I. General Remarks on the Diseases of the Arterial System.\n\nThe diseases of the vascular system form an important class in systems of Nofology. In the diseases of every organ, the action of the arteries and veins is more or less influenced, though the changes of structure to which these vessels are subject are very limited. The only\ndiseases to be considered in a system of surgery, are aneurism and varix.\n\nSect. II. Of Aneurisms.\n\nThe term Aneurism was originally meant to signify a tumor formed by the dilatation of the coats of an artery; but by modern practitioners it applies not only to tumors of this kind, but to such as are formed by blood effused from arteries into the contiguous parts. There are three species generally enumerated; the true or encysted, the false or diffused, and the varicose aneurism.\n\nThe true or encysted aneurism, when situated near the surface of the body, produces a tumor at first small and circumfunded; the skin retains its natural appearance; when pressed by the fingers, a pulsation is evidently distinguished; and with very little force the contents of the swelling may be made to disappear; but they immediately return upon removing the pressure. By degrees the swelling increases, and becomes more prominent; the skin turns paler than usual, and in more advanced stages is edematous: the pulsation still continues; but parts of the tumor become firm from the coagulation of the contained blood, and yield little to pressure; at last the swelling increases in a gradual manner, and is attended with a great degree of pain. The skin turns livid, and has a gangrenous appearance. There is an oozing of bloody serum from the integuments; and, if mortification do not take place, the skin cracks in different parts; and the artery being now deprived of the usual resistance, the blood bursts out with such force as to occasion the almost immediate death of the patient.\n\nWhen affections of this kind happen in the larger arteries, the soft parts not only yield to a great extent, but even the bones frequently undergo a great degree of disarrangement.\n\nThe false or diffused aneurism consists in a wound or rupture in an artery, producing, by the blood thrown out of it, a swelling in the contiguous parts. It most frequently produced by a wound made directly into the artery. A tumor, about the size of a horse bean, generally rises at the orifice in the artery soon after the discharge of the blood has been stopped by compression. At first it is soft, has a strong pulsation, and yields a little to pressure, but cannot be made entirely to disappear; for the blood forming the tumor being at rest, begins to coagulate. If not improperly treated by much pressure, it generally remains nearly of the same size for several weeks. The enlargement however proceeds more rapidly in some cases than in others. Instances have occurred of the blood being diffused over the whole arm in the space of a few hours; while, on the contrary, swellings of this kind have been many months, nay even years, in arriving at any considerable size.\n\nAs the tumor becomes larger, it does not, like the true aneurism, grow much more prominent, but rather spreads and diffuses itself into the surrounding parts. By degrees it acquires a firm consistence; and the pulsation, which was at first considerable, gradually diminishes, till it is sometimes scarcely perceptible. If the blood at first thrown out proceed from an artery deeply seated, the skin preserves its natural appearance till the disorder is far advanced; but when the blood gets at first into contact with the skin, the parts become instantly livid, indicating the approach of mortification; and a real sphacelus has sometimes been induced. The tumor at first produces little uneasiness; but as it increases in size, the patient complains of severe pain, stiffness, numbness, and immobility of the whole joint; and these symptoms continuing to augment, if the artery be large, and assistance not given, the teguments at last burst, and death ensues.\n\nWhen an artery is punctured through a vein, as in blood-letting at the arm, the blood generally rushes into the yielding cellular substance, and there spreads so as nevirism, to shut the sides of the vein together. But in some instances where the artery happens to be in contact with the vein, the communication opened has been preserved; and the vein not being sufficiently strong for resisting the impulse of the artery, must consequently be dilated. This is a varicose aneurism. Soon after the injury the vein immediately communicating with the artery begins to swell, and enlarge gradually. If there be any considerable communications in the neighbourhood, the veins which form them are also enlarged. The tumor disappears upon pressure, the blood contained in it being chiefly pushed forwards in its course towards the heart; and when the tumor is large, there is a singular tremulous motion, attended with a perpetual hissing noise, as if air was passing into it through a small aperture.\n\nIf a ligature be applied upon the limb immediately below the swelling, tight enough to stop the pulse in the under part of the member, the swelling disappears by pressure, but returns immediately upon the pressure being removed. If, after the swelling is removed by pressure, the finger be placed upon the orifice in the artery, the veins remain perfectly flaccid till the pressure is taken off. If the trunk of the artery be compressed above the orifice, so as effectually to stop the circulation, the tremulous motion and hissing noise immediately cease; and if the veins be now emptied by pressure, they remain so till the compression upon the artery be removed. If the vein be compressed a little above, as well as below the tumor, all the blood may generally, though not always, be pushed through the orifice into the artery; from whence it immediately returns on the pressure being discontinued.\n\nWhen the disease has continued long, and the dilatation of the veins has become considerable, the trunk of the artery above the orifice generally becomes greatly enlarged, while that below becomes proportionably small; of consequence the pulse in the under part of the member is always more feeble than in the sound limb of the opposite side.\n\nAneurisms have frequently been mistaken for abscesses and other collections of matter, and have been laid open by incision; on which account great attention is sometimes required to make the proper distinction. In the commencement of the disease the pulsation in the tumor is commonly too strong, and other concomitant circumstances to evidently point out the nature of the disorder, that little or no doubt respecting it can ever take place; but in the more advanced stages of the disease, when the swelling has become large and has lost its pulsation, nothing but a minute attention to the previous history of the case can enable the practitioner to form a judgment of its nature.\n\nAneurisms may be confounded with soft encysted tumors,\nmors, scrophulous swellings, and abscesses situated so near to an artery as to be affected by its pulsation. But one symptom, when connected with strong pulsation, may always lead to a certain determination that the swelling is of the aneurismal kind, viz., the contents of the tumor being made easily to disappear upon pressure, and their returning on the compression being removed. The want of this circumstance, however, ought not to convince us that it is not of that nature; for it frequently happens, especially in the advanced stages of aneurisms, that their contents become so firm that no effect is produced upon them by pressure. Hence the propriety, in doubtful cases, of proceeding as if the disease was clearly of the aneurismal kind.\n\nIn the prognosis, three circumstances are chiefly to be attended to; the manner in which the disease appears to have been produced, the part of the body in which the swelling is situated, and the age and habit of body of the patient.\n\nIf an aneurism has come forward in a gradual manner, without any apparent injury done to the part, and not succeeding any violent bodily exertion, there will be reason to suppose that the disease depends upon a general affection either of the trunk in which it occurs, or of the whole arterial system. In such cases art can give little assistance; whereas if the tumor has succeeded an external accident, an operation may be attended with success.\n\nIn the varicose aneurism a more favourable prognosis may generally be given than in either of the other two species. It does not proceed so rapidly; when it has arrived at a certain length, it does not afterwards acquire much additional size; and it may be sustained without much inconvenience for a great number of years. As long as there is reason to expect this, the hazard which almost always attends the operation ought to be avoided.\n\nTreatment.—In every case of aneurism, the use of pressure has been indiscriminately recommended, not only in the incipient period of the disease, but even in its more advanced stages. In the dilated or false aneurism, as pressure cannot be applied to the artery alone, without at the same time affecting the reflex veins; and as this, by producing an increased resistance to the arterial pulsations, must force an additional quantity of blood to the orifice in the artery—no advantage is to be expected from it, though it may be productive of mischief.\n\nIn the early stages of encysted aneurism, while the blood can be yet pressed entirely out of the sac into the artery, it often happens, by the use of a bandage of soft and somewhat elastic materials, properly fitted to the part, that much may be done in preventing the swelling from receiving any degree of increase; and on some occasions, by the continued support thus given to the weakened artery, complete cures have been at last obtained. In all such cases, therefore, particularly in every instance of the varicose aneurism, much advantage may be expected from moderate pressure.\n\nBut pressure, even in encysted aneurism, ought never to be carried to any great length; for tight bandages, by producing an immoderate degree of reaction in the containing parts to which they are applied, instead of answering the purpose for which they were intended, have evidently the contrary effect. Indeed the greatest length to which pressure in such cases ought to go, should be to serve as an easy support to the parts affected.\n\nOf late years the subject of aneurism has attracted the notice of several eminent surgeons of this country; and arterial trunks have been successfully tied, which had been often proposed, but never executed. Mr John Bell several years ago, tied the trunk of the gluteal artery. Mr Abernethy of St. Bartholomew's hospital, tied the common femoral. Mr Astley Cooper of Guys, tied the common carotid; and Mr Ramsden of St. Bartholomew's hospital, has lately tied the subclavian artery.\n\nSect. III. Of the Popliteal Aneurism.\n\nWe are indebted to Mr John Hunter for the ingenious operation for popliteal aneurism. The operation consists in exposing the femoral artery about the middle of the thigh, and putting a ligature round the vessel. An incision is to be made through the integuments, two inches and a half in length on the inner edge of the sartorius muscle (see Plate DXV. fig. 1.). An incision is to be made through the sheath containing the artery with its accompanying vein and nerve, and a double ligature is to be introduced underneath it, by means of a blunt needle; care being taken not to include either the femoral vein, or crural nerve. One ligature is to be tied as high up, and the other as low as the artery is separated from the contiguous parts; the distance between the two being rather more than half an inch. The artery should then be divided by a probe-pointed bistoury, (Plate DXIII.) in the interspace between the two ligatures, but nearer to the lower ligature than to the upper one. The ligature should be moderately thick, in order that the noose may be drawn as tightly as possible, without risk of tearing or cutting the coats of the vessel. The limb may be kept warm after the operation, by artificial heat if necessary; and the wound treated in the usual manner.\n\nSect. IV. Of the Femoral Aneurism.\n\nThe external iliac artery was first tied by Mr Abernethy*; and there are now eight cases on record where the practice has been followed, six of which were successful. Abernethy's operation consists in making an incision through the integuments of the abdomen, about three inches in length in the direction of the artery, beginning just above Poupart's ligament, (see Plate DXV. fig. 1.) and half an inch on the outside of the abdominal ring, in order to avoid the epigastric artery. The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle is then to be divided in the direction of the wound. The lower margin of the internal oblique and transverse muscles is to be cut with a crooked bistoury. The finger may then be passed between the peritoneum by the side of the psoas muscle, so as to touch the artery. A double ligature is to be put underneath the vessel, and tied as in the operation for popliteal aneurism.\n\nSect. V. Of the Carotid Aneurism.\n\nIt had been repeatedly proposed to tie the carotid artery; but the operation was first performed by Mr Astley.\nThere are three instances of this artery having been successfully tied, so that there is sufficient encouragement to adopt the practice in future cases, where there is room to tie the artery above the sternum. The operation is to be done by making an incision on the side of the artery next the trachea, laying bare the vessel, and carefully avoiding the par vagum and the recurrent branch in placing the ligature.\n\n**Sect. VI. Of the Axillary Aneurism.**\n\nMr Keate of St George’s Hospital, tied with success the axillary artery, where it passes over the first rib; and Mr Ramsden has lately tied the subclavian artery for an axillary aneurism. The patient however died. A similar operation was attempted by Mr Cooper, but he failed in tying the ligature round the artery, from the bulk of the tumor. The great difficulty felt in these operations was the passing of the ligature below the vessel on account of its depth. Some contrivance is therefore necessary in order to facilitate this part of the operation.\n\n**Chap. VIII.**\n\nOf the Diseases of the Venous System.\n\n**Sect. I. Of Varicose Veins.**\n\nWhen the veins of any organ become prematurely dilated, they are said to be varicose. This state of the veins is most usually met with in those which are superficial, and seems to arise either from some mechanical cause preventing the ready flow of blood through them, or from the veins themselves losing the necessary support of the skin and adjacent parts. The gravid uterus, by pressing on the iliac vessels, frequently renders the veins of the lower extremity varicose. Various tumors produce similar effects. We also see the veins of the integuments of old people become tortuous and swollen from no mechanical pressure.\n\nVaricose veins are a frequent attendant on ulcers of the leg, and it has been observed that the ulcer seldom or ever heals until the varix is cured.\n\nVaricose veins of the extremities may generally be much relieved by the application of a proper bandage from the toes upwards; and in cases where this does not give relief, the venous trunk should be tied with a ligature as directed in aneurism.\n\n**Sect. II. Varicose Spermatic Veins (Varicocele).**\n\nThe veins of the spermatic cord often remain varicose after inflammation of the testicle, and also in early life without any known cause. The disease is generally easily distinguished by the tortuous irregular swelling. It sometimes, however, acquires a large size; but even then its nature may be readily distinguished by placing the patient in a horizontal position, and applying pressure to the tumor. By this the swelling disappears, and if the upper part be grasped so as to allow nothing to pass out of the abdomen, the swelling will nevertheless be again formed.\n\nThe disease occurs most frequently in the left side, and this may arise from the vein in that side not terminating directly in the vena cava, but in the emunctary of the diseases of the testicle.\n\n**Treatment.**—The use of astringents, along with a proper suppuratory bandage, will generally afford relief. It has also been proposed to tie a ligature round one or more of the varicose vessels. In one case this was done with complete success.\n\n**Sect. III. Of Hemorrhoidal Tumors.**\n\nThe hemorrhoidal tumor consists in a dilatation of the veins about the anus and extremity of the rectum. They are round smooth tumors of a purple colour, and more or less painful. They vary in their size and number. Sometimes they are accompanied by a regular periodical discharge of blood, (bleeding piles) and in other cases no such discharge takes place, (blind piles) and then they are more subject to inflammatory attacks.\n\nHemorrhoids occur more frequently in women than in men, and they commonly arise from a long continued pressure on the rectum; as obstinate colicines, prolapsus, gestation, calculus or tumors about the bladder, uterus, or vagina.\n\n**Treatment.**—When they are inflamed, local bleeding, fomentations and poultices give much relief, care being taken at the same time to keep the tumors within the anus, and to keep the bowels very open by mild laxatives and clysters.\n\nIn some cases the piles acquire a very considerable bulk, and form a number of large and loose tumors round the anus, which prevent the free discharge of faeces. In such cases the tumors ought to be removed, and this may be best done with the knife; or, as sometimes happens, if they be so situated as to render this dangerous, they may be removed by a ligature.\n\n**Chap. IX.**\n\nOf the Diseases of the Glandular System.\n\n**Sect. I. General Remarks on the Pathology of the Glands.**\n\nWe observe a vast variety of diseases of the glandular system, and the greater number of these arise from a morbid state of their secretions. We see striking examples of an increased secretion in diabetes, in the mercurial salivation, and in many bilious disorders; on the other hand the natural secretion is diminished in suppression of urine, in dryness of the mouth, &c.\n\nAn alteration in the secretory function is not, however, the only disease of this system; there are a great number of organic alterations of structure with which they are affected, and a variety of tumors are also found to form in them. As, however, most of the principal glands of the body are situated within the larger cavities, few of their diseases come within the province of the surgeon.\n\n**Sect. I. Of the Diseases of the Testicle.**\n\n1. Of the Schirrus and Cancer of the Testicle, (Sarcocele).\n\nThis affection is liable to a considerable variety in its appearances; and as in the description of it which has been given by authors, they have included symptoms of diseases\nOf the Difficulties which are very different from the true chirurges of the Testicle.\n\nThe most remarkable symptom of schirrous testicle is a gradual enlargement and induration of the body of the gland or epididymis, advancing from one point, without marks of inflammation or pain. Along with its increase in bulk it acquires additional hardness, and its surface, from being smooth, turns by degrees unequal and knotty. The integuments become of a purplish red, at last ulcerate, discharge a fetid ichor, and a cancerous fungus grows from the wound. The spermatic chord also becomes enlarged, knotty, and hard, and the glands of the groin swell, the health of the patient becoming entirely destroyed, and at last carrying him off in the greatest misery.\n\nThe progress of this disease is in general slow, and is commonly attended with an aching sensation about the testicle, and severe pain darting from it to the loins, particularly when the testicle is not supported. The disease is most frequent in the advanced stages of life. It commonly arises from an unknown cause. It has at times been known to succeed a venereal affection, but this is by no means common, and it is sometimes preceded by a blow or some accident which excites inflammation.\n\nWhen the schirrous testicle is examined by dissection, Dr. Ballie observes that \"it is found to be changed into a hard mass of a brownish colour, which is generally more or less intersected by membrane. In this there is no vestige of the natural structure, but cells are frequently observable in it containing a fumous fluid, and sometimes there is a mixture of cartilage.\" Sometimes water is found collected in the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, but more frequently the tunics adhere to each other. When the spermatic cord is affected, that exhibits the same changes of structure as the testicle itself.\n\nTreatment.—When a testicle is known to be affected with the true schirrus, all prospect of a cure by the exhibition of internal or external remedies becomes hopeless, as there is no fact better known and more severely felt in the history of schirrus and cancer in every organ of the body, than its resisting all means of relief, but by the complete removal of the diseased part. In a few rare cases, by a moderate diet, keeping the bowels open, suspending the tumor, avoiding violent exercise, or anything which may prove a source of irritation, the disorder has been said to be not only prevented from increasing, but has in a gradual manner entirely disappeared; but we much suspect that these cases whose termination was so favourable, have not been of a schirrous nature. This is probable from what is known of the termination of schirrus in other organs of the body, and also from the difficulty we have in forming an accurate diagnosis in the diseases of the testicle. There are, we hesitate not to say, many testicles extirpated which might have been saved; for our imperfect knowledge of the various morbid changes of this organ, has made it too much an established practice to extirpate all testicles which are enlarged and hard, and which do not yield to mercury.\n\nWhen, however, by an attentive examination of the history and symptoms of the disease, no doubt is entertained of its schirrous or cancerous nature, the more speedily the tumor is removed, the better chance there is of a permanent cure. In performing the operation, care should be taken to remove completely every part of the Difficulties suspected to be diseased, and no part of the skin should be left with a view of covering the wound more completely which has the least discolouration or mark of disease.\n\nMode of extirpating the Testicle.\n\nThe parts being previously shaved, the patient is to be laid upon a firm table covered with a blanket or mattress. His legs should hang over the table, and be supported by afflatus. An incision is to be made through the integuments with a common scalpel, extending from a little above the external abdominal ring to the bottom of the scrotum. The cellular membrane around the spermatic chord is to be dissected back, and the chord laid fairly bare; and this part of the operation is much more easily accomplished when the incision through the skin is very free. A ligature of considerable thickness is to be put underneath the chord, and it may be introduced with a blunt pointed needle or instrument (fig. 17, Plate DXIII.). The extent of the disease in the chord should now be examined as accurately as possible, and the ligature should be tied firm with a running knot, as far above the diseased part as possible. If any hardness extends to the external abdominal ring, the chord may be even dissected up along the inguinal canal, and the ligature put on at that place. The chord may be divided one-fourth of an inch below where the ligature has been applied, and then the whole of the testicle and its vaginal coat may be readily dissected away, taking care not to cut into the vaginal cavity of the opposite side of the scrotum. After the testicle is removed, the ligature should be loosened, and the spermatic artery and veins included in separate ligatures. The ligature upon the spermatic chord is to be left loose, so as to act as a tourniquet if a hemorrhage should ensue. Much care should also be taken to secure any arteries of the integuments of the scrotum which are seen bleeding; as we once met with a very troublesome hemorrhage from one of these retracting among the loose cellular texture, and not being seen after the operation. It therefore will be a good general rule to tie these with ligatures immediately after they are divided.\n\nThe wound is to be dressed, so as to be healed if possible by adhesion; and this may generally be accomplished, except at the upper part where the ligatures come through. With this view the wound and scrotum are to be carefully washed, and two or three stitches, as may be thought most expedient, are to be put through the edges of the wound; for in a part like the scrotum, where the skin is loose and puckered, it is hardly possible to apply adhesive straps with sufficient accuracy, so as to serve the purpose. Small pieces of adhesive plaster, however, should be neatly placed between each of the stitches, along the whole extent of the wound, and a pledget of simple ointment and compress afterwards to be laid over it, the whole being secured with a T bandage.\n\nAfter the operation, the patient is to be put to bed, being directed to lie on his back with a pillow between the thighs, so as to support the scrotum.\n\nOpiates should be given to allay pain, and if any inflammatory symptoms supervene, bleeding at the arm should be had recourse to without the least hesitation;\nfor we have made a general remark, that after almost all surgical operations, there has scarcely ever an instance occurred where the patient died from loss of blood, and on the contrary, that almost all patients who have lost much blood, or who have been previously much emaciated, have recovered more quickly than those in full health. The antiphlogistic regimen in almost every case should be rigidly pursued, until at least all inflammatory appearances of the wound are gone, and a healthy suppuration commenced. About four, five, or six days, according to circumstances, the dressings should be removed, and if the wound has healed by adhesion, the stitches may be withdrawn, and the edges of the wound kept together by adhesive plasters. The ligature on the spermatic chord may now be safely taken away, and that round the spermatic artery and veins generally comes readily away before the tenth dressing. In this manner the wound should be dressed daily until it is cicatrized. When the wound, instead of healing by adhesion, suppurates, the stitches may be taken away as soon as it appears that the edges of the wound can be accurately kept together with the adhesive plasters; for if the stitches are allowed to remain long, they generally ulcerate the contiguous skin, and form sinuses, which continue to discharge matter after the rest of the wound has healed. The wound should be dressed once or even twice in twenty-four hours if the discharge be profuse, and care should be taken to wash away with a sponge any matter which may be deposited on the sound skin of the scrotum or groin. The edges of the wound should be brought accurately together at each dressing, any matter collected in different parts of it should be gently squeezed out, so as to prevent any lodgment from taking place. Should the patient become weak from the continuance of the discharge, he should be ordered a nourishing diet, with a proper proportion of wine; and if the discharge be at any time thin and very profuse, we have found much benefit in such a case from the internal use of bark (cinchona).\n\n2. Inflammation of the Testicle (Hernia humoralis).\n\nInflammation is one of the most frequent diseases of the testicle. Sometimes the inflammation is confined to the substance of the testicle, at other times it affects the epididymis, and in some cases it spreads to the albuginea and vasa deferentia. The surface of the inflamed testicle is uniform and smooth, more or less sensitive to the touch, equally firm and tense throughout when pressed upon, and the integuments are generally discoloured, having a blush of redness, and interposed with varicose veins. When examined by dissection, the testicle exhibits, according to Dr. Baillie, precisely the same appearances as the inflammation of the substance of other parts. The vasa deferentia sometimes partake of the inflammation, its coats becoming considerably thickened, and in other instances the veins of the spermatic chord become varicose. Inflammation of the testicle most frequently is preceded by gonorrhoea, but also occurs from a variety of causes. It occurs sometimes from exposure to cold, from violent exercise, and is often excited from blows, riding on horseback, &c.\n\nThe inflammation of the testicle concomitant of gonorrhoea generally begins by spreading along the vasa deferentia from the prostate gland through the inguinal canal till it comes to the testicle; it is in most cases attended with excruciating pain from the rapidity of its progress; and as it commonly comes on when the gonorrheal discharge diminishes or disappears, and subsides when the discharge returns, many authors have supposed that it was a true metafasis of the venereal matter.\n\nIf the disease be left to itself, the body of the testicle becomes more hard and painful, with all the symptoms of local inflammation, and the tumor sometimes acquires an enormous bulk. Sometimes the inflammation is accompanied with violent fever, with a pulse hard and strong in the plethoric, and feeble and rapid in constitutions which are delicate and irritable. The patient also often complains of pains in the loins, and has nausea and vomiting. In general the discharge from the urethra diminishes considerably, and often it ceases altogether before the testicle becomes affected; but sometimes that does not happen in any remarkable degree till one or two days after the swelling has begun to appear. It never happens that both testicles are affected at the same time, but when the swelling of one disappears, often the other one begins to be attacked.\n\nThe testicles sometimes fester and inflame from the absorption of the matter of a chancre, and as the progress of the swelling is in such cases slow, and generally more irregular, it has sometimes been mistaken for a chilblain testicle; but an investigation into the history of the case, and particular attention to the appearance of the skin of the scrotum, and any symptoms of the venereal disease in other parts of the body will generally lead to a knowledge of the true nature of the case. It sometimes happens that inflammation is chiefly confined to the spermatic chord, and in many cases it affects the epididymis alone. The extent of the disease is always easily ascertained by a careful examination of the parts. It seldom happens that both testicles are inflamed at once; we have, however, remarked this to take place. Inflammation such as has now been described, generally abates by the application of proper remedies; in some cases, however, an induration of the testicle remains. It terminates, though rarely, in suppuration.\n\nTreatment.—When an inflammation has arisen from a blow, from exposure to cold, or from any injury done to the testicle, it ought to be treated according to the general plan laid down of treating inflammation of other organs. Local bleeding by leeches is a most useful remedy, and ought to be the first thing employed, if there is the slightest pain, tenderness, or redness of the scrotum. Fomenting the scrotum with warm water, or a decoction of poppy heads, chamomile flowers, or tobacco leaves, often give much relief, and great attention should be paid in supporting the testicle with a silk net truss (Plate DXIV.). Some have also used with success the application of ice or snow to the part. If the symptoms and pain are very violent, bleeding at the arm may be necessary. The bowels should be kept open, and even purged; the patient should be confined to a low diet, and he should keep as much as possible to the horizontal posture, as this is found to be of the greatest importance in promoting the cure.\n\nWhen the inflammation arises from gonorrhoea, particular attention must be paid not only to the disease in the testicle, but to that of the urethra. Indeed it is of much importance in the treatment of gonorrhoea to use means...\nmeans to prevent the testicles from becoming inflamed; and as every thing which causes a suppression of the discharge tends to produce a swelling of the testicle, it is natural to suppose, that in order to prevent this troublesome disorder, every thing should be avoided capable of increasing the irritation and inflammation of the urethra, as exposure to cold, violent exercise, ill chosen injections, and balsamic medicines; but above all, the use of a suspensory is most efficacious, and Swediaur * recommends one to be worn in every case of gonorrhoea from the commencement of the disease, to prevent all risk of the testicles becoming inflamed. When the inflammatory symptoms are severe, the treatment should be adopted as we have recommended in common inflammation of the testicle. If the discharge from the urethra is kept, means should be used to redore it. Whenever the inflammatory fever is rendered more mild, Swediaur recommends, with this view, a dose of opium to be given, and according to circumstances, an injection composed of two or three ounces of oil of linseed and decoction of barley, along with fifty or sixty drops of the vinous tincture of opium. This may be repeated every ten or twelve hours, taking care always to have the bowels well opened before using it. Swediaur has found the extract of hyoscyamus in many cases answer better than opium. Fomentating the penis and adjacent parts with warm vinegar and water, injecting warm oil, and the use of bougies, may also be advantageous in promoting the discharge from the urethra.\n\n3. Induration of the Testicle.\n\nAfter the inflammatory symptoms have abated, it generally happens that a degree of swelling and hardness of the body of the testicle, but still more frequently of the spermatic cord or epididymis, remains, and in many cases continues for months, or even during life. This effect takes place from whatever cause the inflammation may have arisen. In many cases the testicle itself remains quite sound, and the epididymis is converted into a very hard unyielding mass, which feels as if it were injected with quicksilver. Sometimes the testicle, whilst it remains hard, diminishes in size, and becomes much smaller than natural. When the testicle is examined by dissection, it is found to have lost its natural structure, and is sometimes changed into a hard brown-coloured mass (Voigtel), interlaced more or less by membranous bands; sometimes parts having a cartilaginous quality appear it, and sometimes cells are formed which contain matter. The seminal vessels are so changed and hardened, that they cannot be distinguished from each other. In some cases the whole testicle has been found converted into a cartilaginous mass, and in a few instances some parts of it have been converted into bone.\n\nThe treatment usually recommended in cases of induration of the testicle preceded by inflammation, are strong stimulating and astringent applications; such as solutions of the muriate of ammonia, acetate of lead, sulphate of zinc, &c., either applied by moistening with them a piece of linen, which is to be kept constantly wet, or by using them in the form of a poultice. Frictions with mercurial ointment, either singly or combined with camphor, over the scrotum and perineum, sometimes produce a good effect; mercurial fumigations to the genital organs have also been recommended. In some cases the internal use of mercury has been found necessary. A mercurial plaster with camphor, or the common soap plaster, is also a good application, and is very useful in defending the testicle.\n\nThe internal and external use of the hemlock (conium maculatum) has been much recommended by Plenk. Electricity has also been successfully employed. The muriate of lime, and the muriate of barites, have been used by some authors. Swediaur says that he has known some affections of the testicle produced by gonorrhoea, and also some diseases of the eye from the same cause, cured by the patient getting a fresh infection. In a few cases of induration, and swelling of the testicles, we have employed blistering with good effects. The scrotum should be shaved before this is done; and it is often necessary to repeat the blister several times before the hardness or swelling begin to abate.\n\n4. Abscesses of the Testicle.\n\nIt sometimes, though rarely happens, that the testicle suppurates. The matter which is formed, is commonly a tough, thready, yellow-coloured substance, which adheres to the surface of the cavity in which it is contained. Sometimes there is only one abscess; in other cases the matter is contained in several small irregular shaped cavities. Sometimes the matter is formed in the very middle of the body of the testicle; in other cases we have observed small abscesses in different parts of the epididymis, the body of the testicle remaining quite sound. When an abscess is formed in the testicle, the structure of the gland becomes more or less changed; generally instead of being soft, and the tubes of which it is composed being easily separated, it degenerates into a hard firm mass.\n\nAbscesses of the testicle should be opened as soon as possible, in order to prevent the substance of the testicle from being destroyed. The presence of matter is learnt by a fluctuation which can be felt externally; but it is often extremely difficult to determine the true situation of the abscess, whether it is formed in the body of the testicle, in the epididymis, or between the albuginea and tunica vaginalis, or in the cellular membrane external to the tunica vaginalis; for when such a degree of inflammation has taken place as to terminate in the formation of an abscess, the accompanying swelling destroys the natural form of the parts, and involves the whole into a determined shapeless mass. Richter remarks, that there are sometimes soft spots in the testicle, in which it is believed there is a fluctuation. When such swellings are opened no matter is discharged, nothing but blood appears, and the inflammatory symptoms are afterwards increased. The more matter which is discharged from an abscess of the testicle, the smaller the testicle grows, as the matter is sometimes formed partly of the thready substance of the testicle. Cases have occurred where the whole testicle has been pulled away, the surgeon having mistaken the seminal tubes for flaps. Abscesses of the substance of the testicle seldom heal, and generally a fistulous opening remains, through which there is a constant oozing of the seminal fluid.\n\n5. Fistulous Sinus of the Testicle.\n\nAs far as we know no author has taken notice of this appearance. In one case we observed it very remarkable. The epididymis alone was swollen, and there was\nSurgery\n\n6. Scrofulous Testicle.\n\nWhen the testicle is affected with scrofula, it presents some of those general characters of scrofula in other glandular parts. Its tubular appearance is destroyed; it becomes enlarged; and when cut, it is found to be composed of a dull white substance, of the consistence of curd, which in some parts is mixed with a thin puriform fluid. The scrotum is in almost all cases involved in the disease; it becomes red and inflamed, and the vaginal coat adheres to the albuginea. Abscesses also form in various parts of the cellular membrane of the scrotum, which sometimes communicate with the body of the testicle. This disease generally occurs during the early periods of life, and most commonly only one testicle is affected with it. Sometimes, however, when one recovers, the same disease attacks the other.\n\nIn most cases of this kind surgical aid does not avail much, for the progress of the disease cannot be checked by any internal and external remedies. All that can be done is to relieve the inflammatory symptoms, to allay pain, and to prevent the formation of sinuses. With a view to alleviate the symptoms of inflammation, nothing is so beneficial as the application of leeches to the scrotum, and the use of fomentations and poulticing, or solutions of the acetate of lead. Opiates and laxatives may be also freely given, unless in cases where from experience they are known to disagree. When matter has once formed, the sooner it is discharged the better, and this should be done by a small incision. After one abscess has healed, others are very apt to form in succession; these should be treated in the same manner, and if at any period of the disease sinuses form, they should be at once laid completely open to the bottom; or if they are very deep and extensive, a feton may be introduced; if this, however, does not produce an adhesion of the cavity, they should be laid open with a bistoury in the manner directed when treating of sinuses.\n\n7. Testicle preternaturally small, and wanting.\n\nAfter violent attacks of inflammation, or in cases of abscesses, the testicle sometimes diminishes greatly in size, is almost entirely absorbed; and in a few instances people have been born with them much smaller than natural (Baillie). Sometimes a testicle has been known to waste away without any known cause, so as to disappear altogether. Sometimes one testicle, and sometimes both remain in the cavity of the abdomen through life; so that a person appears to have only one testicle or to be without them altogether. Mr Hunter supposes that in these cases they are not so perfect as when they descend into the scrotum; and if we were to reason from what is observed in other animals, in the horse particularly, where this by no means unfrequently takes place, it is highly probable that when the testicles do not descend into the scrotum, they are not capable of performing their functions.\n\nThese cases, though they cannot be relieved by medical aid, yet they are worthy of the notice of medical men.\n\n8. Fungus of the Testicle.\n\nThere sometimes arises from the testicle a species of fungous tumor, which was first accurately described by Mr Lawrence, demonstrator of anatomy at Bartholomew's hospital, in London.\n\nThe patient generally affirms the origin of the complaint to some injury. In some cases, it is the consequence of hernia humoralis, and in others it appears spontaneously. The scrotum, after a certain length of time inflames, and adheres to the testicle already swollen; at last the skin ulcerates, and the opening thus formed, instead of discharging matter, is filled up with a fungous tumor, which is of a firm texture, and generally insensible. Whilst the fungus is increasing, the inflammation of the scrotum diminishes; and if the fungus is at this time removed, a cicatrix is formed in the skin, which adheres to the testicle. There is sometimes a copious and very fetid discharge from the whole surface of the fungus. On dissection, the fungus is found to arise from the pulpy substance of the testicle, more or less of which remains according to the duration and extent of the disease.\n\nIt may be worth while to remark here, that we have met with one case, where, from an abscess and ulceration of the scrotum, the testicle itself flung out at the ulcerated orifice, and exhibited very much the appearance of the fungus above described.\n\nThis species of tumor may be safely removed by the knife, by ligature, or by elocutionary; the removal by the knife is perhaps the safest, and certainly the most expeditious method.\n\nFor an account of Fungus Hæmatodes in the testicle, we refer to Wardrop's Observations on Fungus Hæmatodes.\n\nSect. II. Of the Diseases of the Mamma.\n\nFrom the changes which take place in the female breast at the age of puberty, during the menstrual derivations, charge, and before and after the birth of the child, we ought to expect a considerable variety in the diseases of this organ; and, in considering these, we should always keep in view the powerful sympathy between that gland and the uterine system.\n\nThe gland of the mamma is subject to inflammation and abscesses. Scrofulous tumors also form in it; it is subject to a particular disease, called milk abscess, to leucorrhea, and to other species of indurations, the nature of which is not well ascertained.\n\nThe nipple and integuments around it are also subject to particular kinds of excoriations and ulcerations; the lymphatic glands which lie close to the mamma, are also frequently diseased, and the contiguous cellular membrane is subject to those diseases which are met with in the cellular membrane of other parts of the body.\n\nAt the age of puberty, when the uterine system becomes fully developed, the female breast swells, turns hard, and becomes tender, or even painful. A change also takes place during pregnancy; the breast enlarges, becomes very tender and painful, and a dark-colored zone is observed round the nipple. In women who are fluctuating about the ninth or tenth month after parturition, and sometimes sooner, the menses reappear; and\nChap. IX.\n\nSURGERY.\n\nOf the Dif- if the woman afterwards continues to suckle, at each monthly return a remarkable change takes place in the milk; it loses its sweetness, acquires a bitterish taste, becomes of a reddish colour, and excites a temporary derangement in the system of the child. Obstructions of the menes, their final cessation, and all the diseases of the womb, affect more or less the mamma; and it is at the age of puberty, at the time of menstruation, during pregnancy, in the early months of suckling, and at the time of the cessation of the menes, which are the peculiar periods when blows and other injuries are most apt to produce disease in the mamma.\n\nThis consent between the mamma and uterine system ought to be always kept in view when forming our opinion of any disease in these organs; and it is particularly worthy of the notice of surgeons when operations on that organ become necessary.\n\n1. Of Inflammation and Abscess of the Mamma.\n\nThis disorder occurs most frequently in nurses by the stoppage of the milk, which is always occasioned by sudden or imprudent exposure to cold.\n\nIn the early stages of the affection, resolution is to be attempted, unless the swelling appears to have an evident tendency towards suppuration. The remedies used in inflammation, in general, seem useful in every case of inflammation of the breasts. When the patient happens to be nursing, a sudden evacuation of blood is apt to diminish the quantity of milk: In such cases, therefore, blood is to be extracted in small quantities at a time. The application of cooling satyrine poultices is advisable. When suppuration is taking place, fomentations and poultices are to be used, and the matter is to be discharged by making an incision in the most depending part of the tumor.\n\n2. Of Scirrhus and Cancer of the Mamma.\n\nCancer has been met with in the female breast more frequently than in any other part of the body. We have also seen an example of it in that gland of the male; but such instances are extremely rare.\n\nThe commencement and progress of a scirrhus tumor in the female breast, is extremely various in different peoples; and has been often the cause of scirrhus tumors, and tumors of a more benign nature, being mistaken for one another.\n\nScirrhus tumors have generally made some progress before they are taken notice of. Sometimes they are first felt like a pea underneath the skin, and lying loose over the gland of the mamma; in other instances, a portion of the central part of the gland is found indurated. Of whatever bulk, and in whatever situation the swelling be discovered, it is remarkable for its unyielding and incompressible hardness, and its rugged unequal feel.\n\nWhen the tumor is small it seldom gives any pain, and the patient generally discovers its presence by accident. In some cases its existence is discovered by an acute pang darting through the breast leading to its examination; but in many cases it acquires the bulk of a large hazel nut or walnut, particularly when the patient is fat, before any circumstance leads to its discovery.\n\nAs the tumor increases in bulk, it advances towards the surface of the body and adheres to the skin. The skin then becomes thickened, inflamed, and ulcerated. If the tumor be situated near the nipple, the disease speedsily affects that part, sometimes enlarging and hardening it; and in other cases puckering it and drawing it inwards. When the nipple becomes involved in the disease, the fleshy fluid formed in the tumor often escapes before the skin ulcerates, by the lactiferous tubes.\n\nThe pain which accompanies the tumor in its more advanced form, is generally of a lancinating kind; but its frequency and degree is susceptible of great variety. Sometimes sharp stinging pains pass frequently from the tumor as a centre, and extend through the whole breast; in other cases there is more of a burning heat in the part.\n\nThe progress of the disease is generally very slow, and in many cases three, four, or more years elapse before it ulcerates. When ulceration has taken place, the appearance of the ulcer is similar to that we have described when treating of cancer of the skin*; and the progress of the ulceration is often so slow, as that many II. feet v. years elapse before the disease proves fatal.\n\nScirrhus tumors have been met with in the mamma, from the age of twenty or twenty-five, to a very advanced period of life; but they occur about that period, when the catamenia disappear, much more frequently than at any other.\n\nTreatment.—There is no part of practice about which less has been satisfactorily established, than the treatment of scirrhus in the mamma. The good effects of an early extirpation of cancer in the skin is very generally admitted; but the want of success in removing scirrhus mammae in the hands of many, has not only led some surgeons to desist performing an operation, except in very recent cases, but has even deterred others from attempting their removal in the first stages. There are no doubt many patients who submit to a painful operation from which no relief can be reasonably expected; on the contrary, the irritation and fever occasioned by it seem to hasten the progress of the disease. But there are others where this practice has had a happier effect, and where the patients have lived for many years without a return of the disease. Whenever, therefore, a scirrhus tumor appears in the mamma, which is moveable and distinctly circumscribed, past experience warrants us in removing it. On the other hand, when any of the absorbent glands have become enlarged and hardened, or when the skin has ulcerated, we believe the operation in all such cases should not be resorted to. Some solitary examples of the disease, afflicting this form, may have occurred to individuals, where an operation has arrested the progress of the disease; but these, opposed to the vast number of unsuccessful cases, are by no means sufficient to warrant us in proposing the operation.\n\nMethod of Extirpating the Mamma.—In extirpating the mamma, which we shall first suppose is to be done where the skin is found, and where the tumor has no uncommon adhesion to the pectoral muscle, the patient ought to be placed horizontally in a bed, or upon a table covered with a mattress. Two incisions are to be made with a common scalpel through the skin and cellular substance along the whole extent of the tumor, including a small portion of skin. When the longest diameter of the tumor is across the body, instead of a longitudinal incision, a transverse one is to be made. The integuments being dissected from the mamma on both sides of the incisions, the patient's arm is to be extended...\nOf the Diseases of the Breast.\n\nThe breast is more generally affected with sore nipples in sucking their first child than at any future period. This may, in some measure, be owing to the smallness of the nipples; but very often it arises from their being unaccustomed to the irritation of sucking. In some cases, the nipples are so flat, and so much sunk in the breast, as to render it difficult for the child to lay hold of them. Here assistance can sometimes be given, by the mother pressing back the prominent part of the breast, so as to make the nipple project between two of her fingers. Should this be insufficient, the nipple may be made to project by applying to it a stout child several months old; but when this cannot be done, breast-gloves may answer the same purpose. By applying these to the nipple, and sucking out the air, the child will commonly be enabled to lay hold of it.\n\nThe nipples at this time are liable to excoriations, cracks, or chops; which, though not attended with a formidable appearance, are frequently more distressing than large ulcers. Mild, astringent, and drying applications are most to be depended upon in such complaints; saturnine water, or lime-water, will answer; and either ought to be applied warm. After bathing the parts with any of these, the nipple should be covered with Goulard's cerate. Even a little soft pomatum frequently rubbed upon the part, and covered with a soft linen rag, is sometimes found to give considerable relief. But the nipple should be perfectly cleared of these applications before the child is laid to the breast; and this may be done with a little port wine, or equal parts of brandy and vinegar. If proper attention be paid to these remedies, they will commonly be found to have the desired effect; but if the contrary should happen, another remains to be mentioned, which, in different instances, has given great relief: it consists in the application of a thin skin to the nipple, as the neck and part of the body of a swine's bladder with an aperture in it; which, being properly moistened and fixed to the breast, will completely protect it in the time of sucking. As long as the nipples remain any way affected, small cups of glass or tin are useful for retaining the dressings, defending the nipples from the friction of the clothes, and receiving any milk which may fall from the breast.\n\nSwellings and hardnesses are found in the breast which are not of a scirrhouss nature. Scrofulous inductions are particularly frequent. They often become old and hard, and are then commonly considered as cases of the feirrhus. If the surgeon succeeds in discharging them by tonsils and means of any kind of remedy, he is apt to think that he has dischurged a scirrhus. These scrofulous swellings sometimes inflame, and the progress of the inflammation is very tedious. The breast is long painful before any softening or fluctuation can be perceived. The surgeon then perhaps considers it as an occult cancer, extirpates it, and thinks that he has successfully cured a cancerous affection. If the surgeon opens such a suppurating knot before all the hardness is dissolved by the suppuration, and if he makes a large opening, then commonly follows a very malignant ulcer, which may be also mistaken for a cancerous sore. Many cases, where ulcerated cancers have been supposed to have been extirpated with success, may have been of this kind.\n\nVenereal indurations are not unfrequent in the breast, and also cause similar mistakes in practice. Encysted tumors are also met with in the breast, and are most commonly of that kind called melicercis.\n\nIn the breast of young girls, ten or twelve years of age, hardnesses sometimes appear, which disappear as soon as menstruation takes place. Sometimes they do not go away until the first delivery. Sometimes the breast swells to an enormous size, and becomes indeed not hard, but throughout firm, like muscular flesh. In such a case the extirpation has been successfully performed.\n\nSometimes considerable and often quite hard swellings appear in the breasts, which proceed merely from blood. In such cases blood flows from the nipple at each menstrual period. When the menses disappear with years, the discharge of blood no longer appears from the breast; but then there is a hard not painful swelling arises, which often acquires a considerable size. If it is opened, coagulated and fluid blood is discharged, and a fistula follows, which discharges a purulent fluid, and sometimes pure blood, and often continues several years, without giving great uneasiness. The swelling, which was at first quite hard, sometimes becomes soft, and then the surgeon is commonly induced to open it. Sometimes such swellings are observed in women who have the menstrual discharge; and in such cases the swelling always becomes greater at each period. Sometimes hectic fever and death follow the opening of these tumors. (Monro). The mamma is also subject to fungus hematodes; for an account of which, we refer our readers to Wardrop's Observations on Fungus Hematodes.\n\nSect. III. Of the Diseases of the Tonsils and Uvula.\n\n1. Of the Enlargement of the Tonsils and Uvula.\n\nThe tonsils sometimes grow so large and hard as to become incurable, and even to threaten suffocation. The tumors have been commonly considered to be of a scirrhouss nature; but they are neither attended with shooting pain, nor are they apt to degenerate into cancer; neither do swellings return after the tonsils have been extirpated: hence they ought not to be removed till by their size they essentially impede deglutition or respiration; but whenever they do this, they may be removed with safety. The only proper method of removing them is by ligature, which is not only void of danger,\nChap. IX.\n\nSURGERY.\n\nOf the Diseases of the Tonils and Uvula.\n\nDanger, but seldom fails to perform a cure. If the base of the tonsil be smaller than the top, the ligature is to be used as for polypi in the throat; but however broad the base of it may be, much difficulty will seldom occur in fixing it, for the swelling is always very prominent. In diseases of this kind both tonsils are generally affected; but if the removal of one of them forms a sufficient passage for the food, the other may be allowed to remain. When, however, it is necessary to extirpate them both, the inflammatory symptoms produced by the extirpation of the first should be allowed to subside before any attempt be made to remove the other.\n\nWhen the form of the tonsils happens to be conical, so that the ligature would be apt to slip over their extremities, Mr. Chefelden has recommended a needle (Plate DXV.) with an eye near the point: a double ligature being put into the eye, the instrument is to be pushed through the centre of the base of the tumor, and the ligature being laid hold of by a hook and pulled forwards, the instrument is to be withdrawn; then the ligature is to be divided, and so tied that each part may surround one half of the tumor. This method, however, is scarcely ever found to be necessary.\n\nEnlargements of the uvula, from inflammation or from other causes, may generally be removed by the frequent use of astringent gargles, as of strong infusions of red rose-leaves or of Peruvian bark. But when these fail, and the enlargement is so considerable as to give great uneasiness by impeding deglutition, irritating the throat, and causing cough, retching, and vomiting, extirpation is the only thing upon which any dependence can be placed. Excision is the readiest method when the uvula is only elongated; but when the size is considerable, dangerous hemorrhages sometimes attend this method; on which account a ligature is preferable.\n\nTreatment. In performing the operation, the speculum oris (Plate DXV.) is necessary to keep the mouth sufficiently open, and the uvula should be laid hold of by a pair of forceps or a small hook, so as to keep it firm, and prevent it from falling into the throat. After the operation, if the bleeding be considerable, it may be checked by astringent gargles, or by touching the part with lunar caustic; but this will seldom be necessary.\n\nWhen a ligature is to be employed, it may be readily done according to the method recommended in the extirpation of polypi. A double canula with a ligature may be passed through the nose, or the ligature may be applied according to Chefelden's method in extirpation of the tonsils.\n\n2. Of Scarifying and Fomenting the Throat.\n\nIn inflammatory affections of the throat, the means commonly employed are gargles, fomentations, scarification, or topical bleeding. Gargles are useful for cleaning the fauces from mucus, or in cases of ulceration. In relaxation of the parts, they are employed with advantage when made of astringent materials. Fomentations may be of some use when externally applied; but the steam of water, &c., drawn into the throat, by means of Mudge's inhaler (Plate DXV.), is preferable. Sometimes it is necessary to draw blood from the part affected. Here recourse may be had to scarifying, which may be readily done by the scarificator (Plate DXIV., fig. 14.). After a sufficient number of punctures have been made, the flow of blood may be promoted by the patient's frequently applying warm water to the punctures. When an abscess forms, notwithstanding the use of these remedies, the matter may be discharged with the scarificator already mentioned.\n\nChap. X.\n\nOf the Diseases of the Eye and its Appendages.\n\nIn the account of the diseases of the eye, we shall follow the same principles of arrangement as we have already adopted, and treat of the diseases of each particular texture of which the eye is composed, in the order in which they appear most natural; as the diseases of the conjunctiva, cornea, iris, crystalline lens, &c.\n\nSect. I. Of Inflammation of the Conjunctiva.\n\nThe general phenomena of inflammation of the conjunctiva, are analogous to those which have been already enumerated, when treating of the inflammation of mucous membranes*. Along with the symptoms there enumerated, there are others which arise from the peculiar functions of the organ. The eye cannot endure the usual quantity of light, vision becomes obscured, and there is an increased secretion of tears. The inflammation is sometimes confined to the palpebras, sometimes to the conjunctiva covering the white of the eye, in some cases to that portion of it which forms the external layer of the cornea, and in others it spreads over the whole of these surfaces. These differences merely regard the extent of the inflammation; but there are others which arise from a difference in the specific nature of the disease, forming three distinct species; 1. The purulent ophthalmia; 2. The purulent eyes of new-born children; and, 3. The gonorrhoeal ophthalmia.\n\n1. Of the Purulent Ophthalmia.\n\nThe purulent ophthalmia appeared in this country as an epidemic after the return of our troops from Egypt in the year 1801. Since that period, it has spread with the greatest violence over most part of Britain. This disease generally begins with a peculiar purple-coloured redness over the whole eyeball and inner membrane of the eyelids. There is a sudden pain produced in the eye, as if sand or some foreign substance was lodged between it and the eyelid. As the redness increases, the conjunctiva becomes swollen, from the effusion of a transparent fluid in the loose cellular membranes, between it and the sclerotic coat. There is at first a profuse discharge of tears from the eye, and the eyelashes are glued together when the patient awakes. There is soon created intense pain in the ball of the eye, and a dull aching pain in the forehead. The cornea sometimes becomes opaque; and if the violence of the inflammation continues, it ulcerates and ruptures, allowing the aqueous humour to be discharged; after which, an abatement of the inflammatory symptoms generally takes place.\n\nBefore the disease advances thus far, the eyelids are generally considerably swollen; and, besides the flow of tears,\nOf the Difficulties, there is a profuse discharge of a puriform fluid.\n\nThe inflammation usually attacks both eyes, and it begins in one several days before the other.\n\nTreatment.—In slighter cases of the disease, fomenting the eye with a decoction of poppy heads, and a brisk purge, have been found sufficient to abate the inflammatory symptoms. In other cases, however, it has been necessary to draw blood to a very great extent. When the disease occurs in a strong plethoric person, recourse should be immediately had to the lancet, and the operation repeated on any recurrence of the symptoms. It has been the usual practice of Dr Veitch, and of those who have had extensive opportunities of treating this disease, to draw the blood from the arm. A smaller quantity, however, taken from the temporal artery or external jugular vein, would be found to have an equally good effect.\n\nWhen the purulent discharge becomes profuse, some have recommended the use of collyria, in the form of injections. The aqua camphorata is recommended by Mr Ware; and a weak solution of corrosive sublimate, with opium, has been found to have equally good effects. In those cases where there is much pain and tension in the eyeball and brow, along with a turbid state of the anterior chamber, and ulceration beginning in the cornea, the discharge of the aqueous humour has been attended with much success*. This operation may be easily, and at all times safely performed, by making a puncture with a common extracting knife, through the sound part of the cornea, near its junction with the sclerotic coat.\n\n2. Of the Purulent Ophthalmia in Children.\n\nThe symptoms of the purulent eyes of children are very similar to those which have been mentioned. The disease generally appears a few days after birth, by an increased redness of the palpebral membrane, more or less swelling, and a puriform discharge. Sometimes the membrane swells so much as to evert the eyelids, and render it impossible to examine the eye-ball. The cornea becomes obscure, ulcerates, and allows the aqueous humour to be discharged. The disease generally affects both eyes. From what we know of the origin of purulent ophthalmia, and from some ingenious observations of Mr Gibbon of Manchester,* it appears probable, that the origin of this disease is communicated by the lodgment of an acrimonious discharge upon the eyes of the child, from the vagina of the mother. In a great proportion of cases, Mr Gibbon found the mothers of those children, affected with purulent ophthalmia, had leucorrhoea; and it is probable, that this, as well as other scrofulous discharges, which we know to take place from the mucous membranes of these parts, produces the disease.\n\nTreatment.—Solutions of saccharum saturni and opium, injected between the eyelids, or the aqua camphorata of Bentos, ought to be employed in the first stage of the disease; and the eyelids ought to be likewise covered with some mild unctuous application. When ulceration has advanced so as to endanger a rupture of the cornea, that may be prevented by discharging the aqueous humour. In the second stage of the inflammation, scaring the eyelids, and applying the red precipitate ointment, will generally be found to be useful in allaying the inflammation and swelling of the eyelids, and in restoring the transparency of the cornea.\n\n3. Of the Gonorrheal Ophthalmia.\n\nThe gonorrheal ophthalmia occurs very rarely; and it has been known to arise from the suppression of a gonorrhoea, or from the accidental application of the gonorrhoeal matter to the eyes. In this respect, its origin is very similar to the common purulent or Egyptian ophthalmia, and to the purulent ophthalmia which occurs in children.\n\nThe symptoms and progress of the disease are also similar, only that its progress is much more violent, and it generally completely destroys the organ.\n\nTreatment.—When it is suspected that the disease has arisen from a suppressed gonorrhoea, such means ought to be employed as are most likely to restore the discharge from the urethra; such as the introduction of a bougie, the injection of warm oil, and the application of poultices and fomentations to the perineum. If the inflammatory symptoms run high, powerful evacuants should be employed. Besides purgatives, blood should be taken from the arm or temporal artery.\n\nThe local applications should consist of weak injections of corrosive sublimate and opium, or acetate of lead and opium; and the swelling and redness may be also relieved by the application of the red precipitate ointment, or the ointment of Janin.\n\nSect. II. Of the Pterigium.\n\nThe word pterigium denotes all those morbid changes in which that portion of the conjunctiva covering any part of the cornea or sclerotic coat becomes thickened, vacuolar, and opaque. If the disease be confined to a particular part of the conjunctiva, the disease is observed at its commencement like a small globule of fat, or condensed cellular substance, situated most frequently near the junction of the cornea and sclerotic coat; and this spot extending imperceptibly along the surface of the conjunctiva at length passes over the cornea, the conjunctiva on the adjoining part of the sclerotic coat becomes puckered, and as if it were forcibly drawn over the cornea. The portion of it which lies on the sclerotic coat is commonly loose, and can be easily elevated, but that which is on the cornea adheres more firmly. This species of pterigium has generally a triangular form; one of the angles of the triangle advancing towards the cornea, or covering a portion of it, and the base lying on the sclerotic coat. Sometimes the thickening of the conjunctiva is first perceived on the cornea. The conjunctiva covering the sclerotic coat remaining quite sound. A pterigium is always considerably elevated above the adjacent cornea; but the degree of its thickness varies from that of a thin membrane to that of a fleshy mass.\n\nPterigia arise most commonly at the nasal angle of the eyeball. They are formed, also, at the temporal angle; and they sometimes occur at both places in the same eye. In one case there were two pterigia in each eye. They are formed very rarely on the upper and under parts of the eyeball.\n\nTreatment.—The only mode of removing this disease is by excision. This may be done by elevating the diseased portion of the conjunctiva with a pair of forceps; and separating it at its base by cutting it through with a pair\nOf the Dif- pair of scissors; and then carefully diffusing it off to its apex. If any portion of it has been allowed to remain, or if the wound shows any tendency to form a fungus, lunar cautic ought to be applied to it, and the application repeated as often as may appear necessary. Any slight inflammation or weakness in the eye which may continue after the operation, may be speedily removed by the application of the vinous tincture of opium.\n\n**Sect. III. Of Pustules (Ophthalmia pustulosa).**\n\nPustules are small tumors which are formed both on the cornea and sclerotic coat, but they occur most frequently near the junction of these membranes. A pustule commonly first appears like a dusky yellow or reddish spot, a little elevated above the surface of the cornea or sclerotic coat; and in a short time it becomes a distinct conical tumor. The adjacent part of the cornea is always more or less dim; and a considerable degree of inflammation accompanies it, which is either confined to the white of the eye contiguous to the pustule, or is spread over the whole eyeball. Whilst the pustule is forming, the inflammation is generally confined to that part of the white of the eye which is in its immediate vicinity. The blood vessels are of a pale livid hue; they appear superficial, and can be readily elevated by a pointed instrument; each trunk can be distinguished, for they are never so numerous as to appear confused, or like one red mass. They sometimes run in various directions, anastomose freely with one another, forming net-works upon the white of the eye.\n\nIf the inflammation and pustule remain for some time, the pustule generally advances to suppuration. When suppuration takes place, the apex of the pustule ulcerates, and frequently a chalky white spot appears at the centre of the ulceration; and the opacity of the cornea at the same time daily increases around it. In other cases, the opaque matter separates, and leaves behind it a deep ulcerous excavation.\n\nSometimes the suppuration proceeds more like a common pimple or phlegmon of the skin; a small quantity of a thick matter collects within the pustule, and when it is discharged, a conical tumor remains, which has a depression at the apex. When the pustule contains a watery fluid, the fluid is most frequently absorbed in a gradual manner; but at other times the pustule breaks, and an ulcer is formed.\n\nIf, in either of these cases, the contents are artificially discharged, all the accompanying inflammatory symptoms are much increased.\n\nMost frequently there is only one pustule, and only one eye affected; but in some cases there are several both on the cornea and sclerotic coat of each eye.\n\nThe disease, at its commencement, is almost invariably accompanied with the sensation of a mote in the eye, and the whole conjunctiva covering the sclerotic coat has often a yellowish and shining glairy colour before the redness appears. There is often, also, a degree of redness and swelling, chiefly of the upper eyelid; and the tears are found adhering together in the morning, from the exudation of a yellow matter among the cilia. There is frequently an unusual dryness felt in the eye; but if it be exposed to a bright light, or if an attempt be made to use it, the secretion of tears is increased.\n\nThis species of inflammation is always accompanied with a much greater degree of general fever, in proportion to the severity of the local symptoms, than any other ophthalmia. The pain is rarely acute till the pustule ulcerates; but, if that takes place, it is commonly very severe.\n\nAn eye which has been once affected with pustule, is very subject to repeated attacks of the disease. Pustules of the cornea are met with in people of all ages; but they are more common in young people than in those advanced in life.\n\n**Treatment.**—Sudorific medicines, cooling diluent drinks, and purgatives, ought to be employed in the first stage of the disease; and given according to the violence of the constitutional symptoms. The eye, and parts around it, should be fomented three or four times a day, with a decoction of poppy heads; to which may be added a small quantity of spirits. When the symptomatic fever abates, and the redness assumes a more purple hue, the vinous tincture of opium may be applied to the eye once or twice a day; and this will be found equally useful whether the pustule is in a state of suppuration or not; and it ought to be continued as long as there are any remains of the disease.\n\n**Sect. IV. Of Matter collected between the Lamellae of the Cornea.**\n\nPurulent matter is sometimes collected between the lamellae of the cornea, when the disease is termed unguis or enix; or in the anterior chamber, when it is called hypopion.\n\nWhen the matter is collected between the lamellae of the cornea, it appears in the form of a yellow spot; and as the quantity increases, the spot becomes larger, but does not alter its situation from the position of the head.\n\nWhen the matter is collected in the anterior chamber, it generally appears like a small yellow globule between the iris and cornea, occupying the inferior part of the cavity. These abscesses are commonly the effect of violent ophthalmia, occasioned by a blow, or injuries of the eyeball; they are also formed, though rarely, without any accompanying inflammatory symptoms.\n\n**Treatment.**—Though the purulent matter may be more or less absorbed on the abatement of the accompanying inflammatory symptoms; yet it would be found a good general practice to evacuate the matter whenever it appears, by making an incision through the cornea. The discharge of the aqueous humor along with the matter, never fails to diminish the inflammation; and this perhaps may be the reason why the practice is so useful. Besides this, fomentations, brisk purges, and cupping at the temples, may be necessary if the inflammatory symptoms are severe.\n\n**Sect. V. Of Ulcers of the Cornea.**\n\nUlcers of the cornea have been divided by some authors into a number of species, from differences in their size, in their duration, in the degree of the severity of the accompanying symptoms, and from the various causes from which they have been supposed to originate.\n\nThe most frequent variety of ulcer, is that which remains after the cornea has suppurred and burst; either in consequence of a pustule or of an abscess.\n\nWhen a pustule suppurates, the central part of it generally\nOf the Dif-erally gives way; and as the difeafe continues, the ulceration extends in all directions from that point. Ulcers of this kind are generally circular, and the edges rounded and smooth; having sometimes the appearance of a small artificial dimple: in other instances they have an irregular shape, and their edges are jagged and acute. The size of ulcers is very various; in some cases they do not appear larger than a depression made by the point of a pin, whilst in others they cover a large surface. Most frequently the part of the cornea contiguous to the ulcer becomes more or less dim; and in some cases red vessels may also be traced in it.\n\nTreatment.—The acute pain which generally attends most ulcers, particularly those which are the consequence of pustules, will generally be much relieved by the application of the vinous tincture of opium, repeated two or three times a day. When this produces no good effect, and the ulcer spreads rapidly, attended with acute pain, much relief will be obtained by touching the surface of it with lunar caustic, or if there is a risk of the ulcer eroding the whole thickness of the cornea, and a prolapsus of the iris to take place, it may be advisable to prevent this by discharging the aqueous humor.\n\nSect. VI. Of Specks of the Cornea.\n\nThere are three forms of the corneal speck; the first and most simple variety, is when a particular part of the cornea loses its natural transparency, and appears clouded; objects being seen by the patient as if looked at through a mist or smoke. Some of these specks are undefined, others distinctly circumscribed, and they have each an equal degree of opacity throughout, or one part is more opaque than the rest. They are most commonly of a circular form; but in some cases their shape is very irregular. This size varies from the smallest spot, to such an extent as occupies the whole cornea.\n\nIn the second form of the corneal speck, the opacity is of a darker shade, giving the cornea a bluish, or in some parts a milky appearance. It is seldom equally opaque through its whole extent; being generally more so at the centre, and becoming gradually of a lighter shade towards the margin. In some instances the shade is very unequal in the different parts of the speck.\n\nIn the third form of the corneal speck, the cornea becomes of the opaque glinting white colour of common pearl, and the opacity generally extends through the whole of the lamellae of the cornea; so that if even several of those layers which are external be removed, the remaining ones completely interrupt vision. Specks of this description sometimes produce a slight thickening of the cornea, and are accompanied by adhesions between the cornea and iris. They are almost always distinctly circumscribed, though generally not so opaque at the edge. When they are of any considerable size, they are nourished by one or more red vessels.\n\nIn the first form of speck, the iris can be seen through the diseased portion of the cornea; but in the second and third form of the disease, the degree of opacity is such, that nothing can accurately be distinguished behind it. If there is an external inflammation accompanying the speck, the red vessels will be seen in a cluster on that part of the sclerotic part nearest to it; and some of the branches can often be traced passing over the edge of the cornea, and terminating in the substance of the speck. As the accompanying inflammation abates, the number of the red vessels on the cornea commonly diminishes; but sometimes one or more trunks remain, and are distributed on the speck. In some cases, there are large specks with numerous blood-vessels supplying them during the continuance of active inflammation; and although the opacity remains extensive after the inflammation abates, yet no red vessels continue to nourish it. The number of blood-vessels is in no case in proportion to the degree or extent of the opacity during any stage of the accompanying inflammation. For we frequently observe a net-work of blood-vessels on a cornea which has very little obscurity, and at other times there is a large opaque spot, with only one, or even without a single red vessel supplying it. Specks appear on every part of the cornea, but most frequently towards its centre.\n\nSpecks appear to be formed most frequently on the external lamella of the cornea; but it is difficult to determine accurately their situation. They vary in number. Commonly there is only one; but it frequently happens that there are two, three, or more distinct spots on one cornea, all of which differ in their size, shape, and degree of opacity.\n\nSpecks impede vision in proportion to the degree of their obscurity, and according to their situation. Even a speck of the slightest shade, which is hardly perceptible to a common observer, if it be placed directly opposite the pupil, materially injures the sight; whereas those of the opake kind, if placed beyond its circumference, diminish the sphere, but not the distinctness of vision. In those cases where the speck is of a moderate size, and placed towards the centre of the cornea, the patient feels better in a dull, than in a clear light. For in a clear light the pupil contracts so much, that it becomes covered by the speck, and the rays of light are prevented from entering; but in a dull light it becomes larger, so that the rays of light enter by its edge.\n\nSpecks, most commonly, are either preceded or accompanied by inflammation of the cornea. Likewise wounds, if they do not unite without suppuration, and ulcers of the cornea, are followed by a speck.\n\nSpecks are formed at every period of life; but they occur most frequently in young people; probably because in them the cornea is much softer, and more spongy; and also as they are more subject to inflammatory complaints of the eye than adults.\n\nTreatment.—Those specks which have been described under the first and second form of the disease, generally disappear either by the use of remedies, or in some cases after the inflammatory symptoms abate.\n\nWhen the eye is inflamed, and the eyelids turgid with blood, slightly scarifying the eyelids, and immediately after the bleeding ceases, applying a quantity of an ointment composed of the red oxide of mercury (ten grains to a dram of simple ointment), will be found a very active remedy. And the scarifications along with the ointment should be repeated every second or third day as long as any inflammation continues. When there is no inflammation accompanying the speck, the ointment may be applied alone. The aqua-vitrum citrinum, and various powders composed of the sulphate of alum, sulphate of zinc, sub-borate of soda, diluted with from a fourth to an eighth\nChap. X.\n\nSURGERY.\n\nOf the Dif-eighth part of sugar, may also be advantageously employed in the eye. In specks of long duration, it will be found useful to vary the application, and to employ two or three of the above medicines ten days or a fortnight alternately.\n\nThose specks of the third form, seldom become more transparent, even by the use of the most active remedies. In those cases where only a small central portion is of that description, the size of the speck may be diminished by the treatment already mentioned; and in some cases, much benefit has arisen from cutting away an external layer of the most opaque part; and afterwards using the above applications. It often happens, however, that if portions of a very old and opaque speck be cut away, the part is regenerated by an equally opaque matter.\n\nThe specks which are formed rapidly, are in general most speedily removed. They go away, too, much more quickly in children than in old people; and in them, also, a much greater degree of obscuration can be made entirely to disappear. When a part of the cornea has become opaque, the opacity begins to disappear at the circumference of the speck, or at that portion of it nearest to the circumference of the cornea. In some cases it may also be observed, that the external laminae of the cornea first regain their transparency.\n\nSect. VII. Of the Staphyloma.\n\nWhen the cornea, besides losing its transparency, swells to such a degree, that its internal surface comes in contact with, and adheres to the iris, and when it forms a prominent tumor externally, the disease has generally been called staphyloma. When the whole cornea is affected, it generally assumes a more or less conical form; loses entirely its natural transparency; and vision is completely destroyed. The opacity is generally most remarkable towards the apex of the tumor, and is generally of a pearl white colour diffused through the whole corneal substance. The internal surface of the cornea adheres to the iris, and the pupil is in most cases altogether obliterated.\n\nIn many cases the cornea does not project beyond the eyelids; but in others, particularly in children, a large tumor is formed, which projects beyond the eyelids, and is attended with pain and inflammation, which, in some instances, renders the other eye weak and irritable.\n\nTreatment.—When a part of the tumor gives way, and allows the contents of the tumor to be discharged, the patient always experiences a speedy relief, but the tumor is soon formed again; so that in order to prevent its growth, it is necessary not only to discharge its contents, but also to remove a portion of the diseased cornea of such a size as to prevent the humors from again collecting. A common extracting knife may be passed through the tumor, so as to divide a segment nearly equal to half the cornea, and the other half may be readily cut away with scissors. Inflammation and suppuration succeed; and the eyeball finally collapses if there be not a sufficient degree of inflammation excited. A pointed instrument may be introduced through the wound, so as to allow the crystalline lens, or any portion of the vitreous humour which may have remained, to be pressed out.\n\nSect. VIII. Of Inflammation of the Iris.\n\nInflammation seldom affects the iris alone, though in some cases it appears to be the principal diseased part of the organ. The disease is accompanied with intense pain on exposure to light; discoloration of the iris from the addition of red blood; dilatation of the pupil to contract; and lymph to be effused on the surface of the iris and pupil.\n\nTreatment.—Copious bleedings from the arm, or temporal artery, are generally necessary; and in order to prevent any permanent contraction of the pupil from taking place, much benefit will be derived from keeping it dilated by the action of an infusion of belladona.\n\nSect. IX. Of the Mode of making an Artificial Pupil.\n\nThe iris, whether from previous inflammation or other cause, has been often found with the pupil so much contracted, and adhesions formed between it and the capsule of the crystalline, to such a degree, as to prevent vision. The pupillary edge of the iris, too, sometimes adheres to the cornea, and is contracted; and sometimes a portion of cornea opposite to the pupil is a cause of blindness. In all such cases it has been repeatedly attempted to make an artificial pupil; but this operation has seldom been successful. Various modes have been proposed to perform it, but that recommended by Scarpa is entitled to most attention. This method consists in introducing a curved couching needle (Plate DXVII. fig. 20.), as in the operation of couching the cataract, passing its point through the iris at the place where it is intended the new opening should be made, and then forcibly tearing down a portion of iris from its connection with the ciliary ligament. After the operation it will be found useful to keep the iris for some time under the influence of belladona. We understand that Mr. Gibbon, an ingenious surgeon in Manchester, has operated with great success in a new manner. He makes the punctuation of the cornea at its transparent part with an extracting knife (Plate DXVII. fig. 1.), and presses the eyeball so as to squeeze the iris through the incision of the cornea; or if any adhesions render that impracticable, he drags it out with a hook (Plate DXVII. fig. 19.), and afterwards cuts away with a scissors the prolapsed portion. Then immediately the perforated iris falls back into its natural situation, leaving a proper opening.\n\nSect. X. Of the Cataract.\n\nThe most common disease of the lens is a loss of its natural transparency; and this arises either from a change in its structure, or from a deposition of new matter. The capsule of the lens is also subject to opacities. These diseases are known by the name of cataract.\n\nThere are four species of cataract generally enumerated. In the first, the crystalline lens itself becomes opake (cataracta crystallina). In the second, the capsule is changed in its structure (cataracta membranacea). In the third, the liquor Morgagni becomes opake (cataracta interstitialis); and when all these parts are affected at the same time, it has been denominated the mixed cataract, cataracta mixta.\nWhen the crystalline lens becomes opake, the opacity generally begins towards the central part of the lens, and extends towards its circumference; in other cases a general obscurity extends over the whole lens.\n\nThe consistence of the lens varies very much in the different kinds of cataract. Sometimes it is converted into an aqueous or milky fluid, or like thin jelly; at other times it becomes harder and firmer than natural; and in several cases it has been found converted into bone or into a chalky looking substance. It has been generally remarked, that the fluid or milky cataract is most frequent in children, but we have also met with it in those advanced in life. The solid or concrete cataract, on the other hand, has been generally found in adults. At the same time, we have observed the lens of young people converted into a hard and white substance resembling chalk.\n\nThe colour of different cataracts is very various; and they never appear of the same colour in the eye as when removed from it. The most usual colour of them in the eye is a bluish white or gray; sometimes clouded in different parts or striated, sometimes of a lead colour, sometimes greenish, and sometimes of a yellow or amber colour. When taken out of the body, those which appeared white or gray are generally dark yellow or amber; and those of a yellow tinge in the eye often appear white when extracted.\n\nThere is scarcely any diagnostic mark of a soft and hard cataract which can be altogether depended on. The colour proves nothing, those of a milky colour being often quite hard, and sometimes those of a pearl colour are quite soft. Neither is there anything to be learnt from the degree of the opacity; for it will be found that those who see no more than to be able to distinguish light from darkness have the lens quite soft, whilst those who can distinguish colours and large objects have the lens quite hard. Richter, however, has remarked two symptoms, which he says have seldom deceived him in ascertaining this point. The softer the lens is, the larger and thicker it is in general, and therefore approaches nearer to the plane of the iris or to the edge of the pupil. Hence he always concludes that the cataract is soft when it is near the pupil. In order, however, to judge of the space between the pupil and lens, the surgeon must look into the patient's eye from one side; and in general it requires much experience to judge of this with accuracy.\n\nWe are also able, in some cases, to discern points, streaks, or inequalities, in the shade of a cataract. If, after having observed the place, figure, and disposition of them, we find that in some days afterwards, or upon rubbing the eye pretty hard, they have undergone any change in their figure, situation, or shade of colour, we may then conclude with certainty that the cataract is soft; only we must be cautious not to draw an opposite conclusion, viz. that we are not to conceive the cataract to be hard if these changes should not be perceptible.\n\n\"A perfectly hard cataract,\" says Beer, \"shows itself very plainly before the operation; the pupil is equally opake in its whole circumference; there are not to be observed any points, streaks, or spots, of a clearer or darker colour; the lens is evidently separated from the iris, so that a sufficient number of rays of light can enter, and the patient is still capable of distinguishing some objects from the side of the eye; the motions of the pupil are extremely lively, and it never remains considerably enlarged. The opacity behind the pupil at the commencement of the cataract is first observed in the middle, and it then extends, but very slowly, towards the circumference. Such patients, if the middle part of the pupil is completely opake, can for the most part read writing by the assistance of a magnifying glass, and distinguish small objects. The colour of the hard cataract is gray, palling more or less to a greenish hue; and the smooth level of the lens may be very plainly remarked.\"\n\nIn most patients the cataract is to be considered as a local disease, though there are also many cases where an opacity of the lens comes on after or along with other diseases of the eye. It has been observed in gouty and rheumatic constitutions, and in such people there is reason to suspect that it is more or less connected with the general constitutional affection. This observation is of importance; for when an operation is performed in such cases, a total blindness is usually the consequence. Richter operated on a man who had been much troubled with gout, and his sight was restored. In seven months afterwards the pupil gradually contracted, at last closed, and a second blindness followed. In one case of a similar kind on which we operated, an attack of gout succeeded the operation, the eye suppurred, and the inflammation has never altogether disappeared, though two years have elapsed since the operation. Even in such cases the operation is not to be entirely forbidden: the success is less certain, and the patient will require a very careful preparation before it, and much attention after it.\n\nThere are some varieties of cataract which are considered to be hereditary. Richter extracted a cataract cataract from a man whose father and grandfather were both blind from that complaint. Maitre Jean and Janin have both met with similar cases. Richter also saw three children, born of the same parents, who had all cataracts at the age of three years. We have known several similar facts, and particularly one of twins, who both were affected with cataract when one year old.\n\nWhen the cataract is seated in the capsule above, it in general arises from a blow or wound with a pointed instrument. Sometimes the whole anterior portion is opake and very much thickened, whilst that which is posterior remains transparent; and in some cases the capsule has been extracted in the form of a bag, having become altogether opake, and containing within it the crystalline. Such cases have been called by Richter the cataracta cylica. He says he has only met with one case of that form of the disease; Beer, however, mentions many; and from meeting with them he has been led to propose the extraction of the capsule along with the crystalline in all cases of the disease.\n\nThe cataracta membranacea primitiva of Scarpa is also another form of the disease. In this variety the lens disappears, and leaves the capsule opake, or at most in its interior a speck not larger than a pin-head. This kind of cataract, Scarpa remarks, occurs most frequently in infants, or in people under twenty years of age. It may be distinguished by its resemblance to a very thin scale, or by a very white point, at the center or at the circumference of the crystalline.\n\nThe tremulous cataract (cataracte tremblante of the Trembling French), is another variety of the disease which deserves cataract to be noticed. It is generally of a very opake white colour,\nOf the Diff. colour, and seldom large. It moves about on every motion of the eye, and the whole iris trembles and fluctuates to and fro. Sometimes they altogether disappear, at times passing behind the iris, but they soon regain their situation. In one example of this disease we observed that the opake lens sometimes fell into the anterior chamber through the pupil. In this form of the disease it generally happens that the functions of the retina are impaired or lost; though this is not always the case.\n\nCataract is often accompanied with a complete amaurosis. In some cases of this kind there is a great dilatation, and immobility of the pupil, and the opake lens is observed of a very large size behind it. The patient can seldom distinguish right from darkness; and the want of sight generally precedes any obscenity of the lens. In some cases, where there is a combination of cataract and amaurosis, the pupil remains of its natural form, and alters according to the quantity of light. But, as in the former variety of the disease the opacity of the lens most commonly precedes the amaurosis, it generally too comes on suddenly, preceded by sparks of fire appearing before the eyes, or clouds flying before them, or headache, and pains about the brow or temples. We have seen an instance of a simple cataract in one eye, and in the other cataract and amaurosis combined.\n\nCommonly cataract affects both eyes simultaneously; but there are also many examples of the disease affecting only one eye. It also happens, that first one eye is affected, and many years afterwards the second. We have in general observed, that when the cataract takes place only in one eye in young people, or when it succeeds a blow, the other eye is seldom affected. But on this we should not trust much, for it is an undeniable fact, that a great sympathy exists between the two eyes; and that when one of them becomes diseased, the other is very apt to become similarly affected. We have seen a case where a staphyloma arose in one eye in consequence of a wound, and in a few years afterwards the other eye became staphylomatous. A man who received a blow on one eye, which produced amaurosis, had soon afterwards a cataract formed on the other. Richter mentions an analogous case. St Ives mentions a very remarkable case of a man who was wounded in the right eye with a small shot, and shortly after that eye was affected with a cataract. Some time afterwards the same disease took place in the left eye, but which gradually disappeared after the cataract had been extracted from the right eye. These observations on the connection between the two eyes, have led some surgeons to advise operating for cataract when only one eye is affected, in order to prevent the second eye from becoming diseased. There are a few cases where this practice has been successfully adopted, and there are others where it has failed. We know of one gentleman, now upwards of seventy years of age, who was couched for a cataract in one eye when twenty years old, and the disease has never attacked the other eye. Richter once performed the operation on a woman who had a complete pearl-coloured cataract in the left eye, and an incipient one in the right, which, before the operation took place, was beginning to advance rapidly. After operating on the left eye, the progress of the disease in the right seemed to be checked, and for years after the operation it had not made the smallest progress. On the other hand, we have operated in several cases where the disease was just commencing in one eye, and when the operation did not appear to arrest its progress in the second one. It is therefore a point not yet determined in what cases it would be advisable to operate when only one eye is affected; for in those where the progress of the disease in the second eye cannot be arrested by an operation on the first, no operation should be performed on either eye until vision is nearly altogether destroyed.\n\nThe progress of this disease is very various; sometimes it proceeds so slowly as not to destroy vision for the disease many years, at other times a complete obscenity of the lens has been known to take place almost instantaneously. Richter and Eschenbach both relate cases where people labouring under gout, which suddenly retarded, were entirely deprived of their sight in one night. We have observed analogous cases, though we could not determine the existence of any constitutional affection.\n\nFrom the found crystalline being chiefly composed of albumen and a small quantity of gelatine, whatever might produce a coagulation of these, would destroy the pellucidity of the lens. Whatever too would produce inflammation of the capsule of the lens might also render it obscure; for when any furred surface is inflamed, and that class belongs the capsule of the lens, its transparency is destroyed, and it becomes thickened from an effusion of albuminous matter on its surface. Cataracts arising from wounds are probably produced in this manner.\n\nIn old people there is often distinguishable a slight obscenity of the lens, and sometimes it even forms a complete cataract. In such cases the obscenity probably arises from a want of balance in the secreting and absorbent systems, or the necessary perfection of these functions to preserve the natural state of parts, which we observe to decay in many other organs, as well as the eye, in those far advanced in life.\n\nBesides the symptoms which are to be observed in an eye affected with cataract, there are others remarked by the patient. Objects appear to him as viewed through a mist or cloud; and as the opacity of the lens increases, the cloud appears greater until it finally prevents even the largest objects from being distinguishable.\n\nThe patient, at the commencement of the disease, can distinguish objects better in a moderate than in a bright light; and the same thing happens if the light be interrupted by the interposition of the hand or any other shade. The reason of this is obvious; because the pupil is more dilated in a moderate than in a bright light, and thus still admits a certain number of rays of light by means of the pellucid circle of the lens.\n\nWhen the exterior part of the lens is less obscured than the centre, the patient sees those objects much better which are placed by his side, than those which are opposite to him.\n\nIf the obscenity has not affected the middle of the lens, but some part of its edge, any circular body looked at by the patient, appears to have its edge imperfect. It has been also remarked that some patients see everything with perforations in them. The cataract is seldom accompanied with any pain. When it is brought on from internal causes, both eyes are generally affected.\nOf the Treatment of Cataract.\n\nIn the treatment of cataract, recourse has generally been had to a surgical operation. Some have pretended to cure cataract by internal medicines. Small doses of colomel, electricity, extractum hyoscyami, aqua laurocerasi, have been extolled; but their use is now very generally given up. In some cases of cataract which have arisen from an injury of the eye, Mr Ware has seen them disappear by an external application of ether, which promoted the absorption of the opaque body.*\n\nThere are two operations which have been proposed for the cure of the cataract; the one called extraction, and the other couching. In the first, an incision is made into the cornea, and the lens removed by pushing it through the pupil. In the second, the lens is taken out of its capsule, and lodged in some part of the vitreous humour, where it may be entirely out of the axis of the eye. Each of these methods has been much practised; and though a decided preference seems at present to be given by the most distinguished surgeons to the mode by extraction, yet there are also cases attended with peculiar circumstances, in which the operation of couching may be successfully employed. Both operations ought therefore to be well understood by every surgeon.\n\nIt was formerly the custom, before performing either of these operations, to confine the patient for several weeks, or even months, to a strict antiphlogistic regimen; but this precaution, except in very particular cases, may be generally dispensed with. People who have become blind, generally lead a quiet life, and are not exposed to any of those dissipation which are likely to affect the constitution. It will therefore generally be found sufficient precaution, before attempting an operation, to enjoin the patient to live moderately; to avoid spirituous liquors, and take a few doses of any of the common laxative medicines. If he be strong and plethoric, it will be necessary to pursue such a course a little further; to give doses of laxative medicines for a longer period, and even to bleed the patient in the arm. Many surgeons lay it down as a general rule, to take some blood on the morning of the day of the operation, either from the arm, from the temples, or from the neck by cupping; and either of these methods is to be preferred, according to the quantity of blood which is intended to be taken. In old people of a healthy constitution, we have often found it unnecessary to use any of these means, no inflammatory symptom having arisen during the progress of the cure. In many cases, instead of bleeding before the operation, we have preferred doing it after the operation was performed, when the patient was put quiet in bed. Blood taken at this period may be reasonably supposed to have a more powerful effect in giving check to any inflammatory attack which might be apt to succeed the operation, than if an equal quantity had been taken away before it. The bleeding too, immediately after the operation, we have often observed, renders the patient calm, and more disposed to rest, whereas at the same time any of those disagreeable symptoms are avoided during the operation, which are apt to remain for several hours after bleeding, when the patient is in the erect posture. It is also of importance before the operation is performed, the patient being so situated, that he can be easily put to bed. The operation should therefore be performed in the same chamber in which he is to remain, or in one immediately adjoining; and he should be clothed in a bed-gown, or some loose dress, so as to enable him to get into bed without much trouble. The bed should be placed in such a position in the room that the light does not fall directly on the patient's face, so that during the cure, all glaring lights may be easily avoided.\n\nOf the Extraction of the Cataract.\n\nIn this operation the object of the surgeon is to make a wound in the cornea, and to extract through it the opaque lens. In performing it there are four steps which require to be particularly considered. The first of them is the means to be employed for securing the eye during the operation. The second is the mode of making the incision through the cornea; the third, the mode of opening the capsule of the crystalline lens; and the fourth is the extraction of the lens. All these shall be considered separately.\n\nMode of securing the Eye and Eyelids.\n\nOne of the great improvements in modern surgery is the simplicity of the mechanical means employed in performing operations. A great variety of contrivances have been proposed, in order to secure the eyeball and eyelids during the extraction of the cataract. Experience, however, shows, that almost all these are completely useless, and most of them extremely hurtful. To dispense, therefore, with these instruments, and to be able to execute with the fingers alone those parts of the operation for which they were employed may be justly considered as a material improvement. The eyeball and eyelids may be completely secured in almost all cases, by the fingers of one hand of the operator, and those of an assistant. The assistant will generally find that, with the forefinger of one or both hands placed upon the tarbus, one upon the internal, and another towards the external angle of the eye, he will be easily able to raise the upper eyelid, so as to expose the cornea; and by the finger being placed towards the internal angle he will be also able to assist the operator in preventing the eyeball from being turned inwards, when the incision into the cornea is about to be made. The operator is to secure the under eyelid by the fore and middle fingers of his left hand. They are to be placed in such a manner over the edge of the tarbus, that they may come in contact with the eyeball; and the middle finger is to be pressed pretty firmly in the internal angle of the eye, between the eyeball and lachrymal caruncle, so as effectually to prevent the motion of the eye towards the nose. In this position of the fingers of the operator and assistant, those who are accustomed to perform operations on the eye, find that they are completely master of the motions of the eyeball; and by altering the positions of the points of the fingers, and applying more or less pressure, they are able to counteract any untoward motion of the organ. Before attempting to secure the eyeball, the operator should be prepared to advance in every step of the operation; for it will be generally found, that if an attempt has been made to open the eyelids forcibly, a certain degree of irritation and watering of the eye takes place; so that, when a second attempt is made,\nOf the Dil-with a view of proceeding to the other steps of the operation, more difficulty is met with in holding the eye than at first would have been the case. It is a good precaution, however, for the surgeon to take an opportunity, before the day of the operation, to try to fix the eye, and to explain to the patient this step of the operation; for it often happens, that patients flart, and make great resistance by squeezing the eyelids, when the operation comes to be performed; so that by habituating them to the mode of securing the eye, it is more easily accomplished. The first thing to be attended to, before attempting to fix the eye, is a proper light, the position of the patient's head, and the height of the chair in which he is to sit. The light of the room should come from one window, and the patient sit in such a manner that the light falls obliquely over his nose upon the eye to be operated on. If he be placed so that the rays of light from the window fall in the direct line of the eye, the surgeon will find that he is obliged, either to fit in his own light, or that the reflections upon the cornea tend to embarrass him. As soon as the other eye is covered, so as to prevent it from having any motion, and communicating that motion to the eye on which the operation is to be performed, the afflant is to be placed behind the patient, and the patient's head to be supported firmly on his breast. The height of the chair on which the patient is to be placed, will depend on the height of the patient, and always should be so low, that the afflant is able to look over the head, and completely command the motion of his own fingers. The operator and afflant should open both eyelids at the same time, which will more readily secure the eyeball in a proper position. The eyeball, however, is apt to be turned upwards, so that the cornea is thrown out of view. When this happens, the upper eyelid should be first raised, and the afflant should be always ready with the points of his fingers, to press in such directions, that when the eyeball at any moment places itself in a proper position, he may be ready to secure it. When, on the other hand, the eyeball is thrown downwards, the operator himself must place it in a proper position, and in this manner both the operator and afflant are to co-operate with each other, and the one or the other placing his fingers in such a manner as to counteract most effectually any awkward position of the eyeball. When the eyeball appears steady, the incision of the cornea ought to be immediately performed. But before entering the knife, it will be found a useful precaution to touch the cornea frequently with its back, and see if the patient starts, or if the eyeball remains quite steady. It will often happen, that whenever the point of the instrument touches the eyeball, it is suddenly thrown into motion; and was the incision of the cornea to have been begun at this moment, much difficulty would have arisen. If however, the eye be repeatedly touched with the knife, the starting motion will sooner or later cease, and then the incision of the cornea may be begun with every possible advantage. When the knife has passed through both sides of the cornea, there is no danger of any motion of the eyeball hindering the operation.\n\nIf sometimes happens that the eye is extremely small, and that it is sunk deep in the orbit. In such people the operation becomes much more difficult; and we have met with cases, where, from these circumstance it was almost impossible to secure the eyeball with the fingers; Of the Dil-room which the fingers necessarily take preventing the knife from being properly managed, and covering a portion of the cornea. In such cases, the speculum contrived by M. Peller will be found to be a useful instrument. See Plate DXVII. fig. 8. The speculum consists of a piece of silver wire, bent in the manner represented in the plate; and though in itself extremely simple, it requires a good deal of management and nicety in using it. The curved edge of the wire (a) is to be placed upon the inside of the cilia on the horizontal plate of the tarsus; the skin of the upper eyelid being previously stretched upwards. The afflant is then to move the speculum upwards, imitating, as it were, the natural motion of the eyelids; and, when the eyeball is sufficiently exposed, the speculum, with the handle (b) resting on the brow of the patient, is to be kept firm and steady in the same position. In using the speculum, it is necessary to make a considerable pressure on the eyeball, in order to prevent the eyelid from slipping from underneath the speculum. At the same time as little pressure should be employed, as will prevent this from taking place. Many surgeons, in using the speculum, place it behind the cilia; and whenever any watering of the eye takes place, from the irritation of the instrument, it is very apt to slip from the moisture of the skin. In order to prevent this, we have found very material benefit from firmly folding round the speculum a thin fold of crape, which, from its roughness, effectually prevents the risk of the speculum slipping. The operator is to manage the under eyelid in the same manner as if the upper eyelid was covered by the fingers of an afflant; and it more particularly rests with him to prevent the eyeball from rolling inwards, the speculum merely serving to support the upper eyelid.\n\nAfter the knife has penetrated both sides of the cornea, the afflant is to be aware that no pressure is to be made upon the eyeball. When, therefore, this step of the operation is completed, the afflant, if he be using the speculum, is to be particularly careful in taking off any pressure which it may make, and merely to support the eyelid.\n\nMode of making the Incision of the Cornea.\n\nThe great object to be kept in view in making an incision of the cornea is, that it be of sufficient size to allow the easy extraction of the crystalline lens, and that any cicatrix which may remain may not interrupt the entrance of the rays of light through the pupil. The mode which has been recommended to effect these purposes, is to make a semicircular incision, parallel to the circumference of the cornea, and about half a line distant from the junction of the cornea and sclerotic coat. One of the knives (Plate DXVII. fig. 1, 2, 3.) is to puncture the cornea half a line distant from its circumference, to be carried across the anterior chamber to the opposite side, and brought through the cornea at the same distance from the sclerotic coat to where it was entered; afterwards the incision is to be finished by pushing the knife forwards till the incision is completed.\n\nInstead of making the incision in this manner, Mr. James Wardrop has proposed another form of incision, circular and in order to remove several objections to which the other operation was liable*. The disadvantages which Mr. War-\n\n*See Etin-Chirurgical Journal, vol. iv. drop\nOf the Dif-drop supposes to arise from the usual mode recommended, ed are,\n\n1. The cornea being of very considerable thickness, a great part of the semicircular incision will be carried through between its laminae, and therefore the length of the incision of the internal lamina will be much less than that of the external one. This he explains by two plans, Plate DXVII, fig. 11, and 12, where besides the external form of the incision (aaa), there is drawn a second line (b), intended to represent the incision of the internal lamina. The dark space, therefore, included between these two lines (b and a) is intended to represent that portion of the incision which is made between the laminae.\n\n2. The external form deceives us in the extent of the internal incision, and much more difficulty is met with in bringing the lens through it, than from its apparent length could have been expected; for, as the line of the internal incision has a very slight curvature, the thickness and tension of the cornea allow the edges of the wound from being separated only a little way from one another.\n\n3. When the cornea is divided nearly at its union with the sclerotic coat, and when the aqueous humour and lens have escaped, the portion of the iris opposite to the centre, and most depending part of the wound, loses its natural support given to it by the cornea, and is pushed forward, so that it comes in contact with the cornea, and even infinates itself between the edges of the incision. The greater the opening is, the more danger there is of a prolapsus, both of the iris and vitreous humour; for it would seem as if these two parts of the eye were pushed forwards in consequence of the contraction of the coats of the eye, which takes place as soon as the incision is made; and if two thirds of the cornea be cut, there is certainly much less resistance than when the half only has been divided. Thus, the iris and cornea form permanent adhesions in consequence of the inflammation which always follows the operation. The pupil becomes an irregular form, is drawn from the centre of the eyeball; is sometimes very much contracted, and retains but a very limited sphere of contraction and dilatation.\n\n4. The contraction of the muscles of the globe of the eye pressing forward the contents of the posterior chamber, are very apt to push a portion of the vitreous humour through the pupil and wound of the cornea. When this happens, the pupil becomes irregular, and drawn down towards the incision, the form of the eyeball is somewhat altered, and the prolapsed vitreous humour inclosed in its capsule, appears externally in the form of a round transparent tumor.\n\n5. As the external edge of the semicircular flap of the cornea is very thin, and lies loose, the smallest movement of the eyelids, particularly of the upper one, is apt to catch and raise it out of its proper situation, and thus that speedy union is prevented which would take place if the two divided surfaces had been kept in accurate and constant contact.\n\n6. And lastly; As the internal edge of the incision is often unavoidably made, from the smallness of the anterior chamber, and the flatness of the cornea, nearly opposite to the inferior margin of the pupil; and as all the extent of the cut surface ab (Plate DXVII, fig. 12.), sometimes remains opaque after the wound is healed, the opacity of the cicatrix must diminish the sphere of vision.\n\nAll these disadvantages in the usual mode of making an incision of the cornea, appeared to Mr Wardrop to arise chiefly from the want of a sufficient portion of the cornea being left at the inferior part of the wound, to support the iris, and to prevent the pressure of the parts contained within the eyeball, and the occasional action of the muscles pushing forward the iris towards the wound of the cornea; he therefore conceived that if the incision could be made in such a manner that a larger portion of the cornea could be left at the inferior part of the wound, being at the same time made of such a form as to allow the easy extraction of the cataract, and the cicatrix not afterwards to interfere with vision, a considerable improvement would be made in the operation. With this view he made the incision in the following manner.\n\nThe best knife for the purpose is of the same size and shape with that delineated in Plate DXVII, fig. 1, a knife. The blade is of a simple triangular form, the back being one continued line with the handle, except merely the point. The point, though extremely sharp, should be made firm, and the blade should turn gradually thicker from the point towards the handle. The point of the knife must be sharp on both edges for at least the breadth of a line, in order that it may penetrate the cornea quickly and easily. The back of the knife should not be left angular, but the edges rounded off and made smooth, so that it be convex on both sides. Particular care ought to be taken that the point of the knife be well conditioned; and it is not only necessary that it be sharp, but that the metal of which it is made be neither too hard nor too soft. This may be easily ascertained by pressing the point upon the nail; for if it bend readily, not being so brittle as to break through, and sufficiently elastic to recover the straight line, we may be confident that it will answer the purpose. It is also a good precaution to have the knife sharpened the day before, or the morning of the operation; and in case of any accident happening to the point, the operator himself should carefully examine by trying how it penetrates a thin piece of leather, immediately before using it. From the point of the knife being too brittle, we have known a case where the point of it was broken off, when attempting to penetrate the inner part of the cornea; and from the point being too soft, we in one case, after puncturing the cornea, found it impossible to penetrate with the knife the opposite side, and this we found had arisen from the point of the knife bending round.\n\nHaving previously smeared the knife with oil, or smoothed the edge of it upon the palm of the hand, in order to make it cut more keenly, its point is to be thrust through the cornea at its transverse diameter, and at least half a line distant from the sclerotic coat, and in a direction as if it was to wound the iris, or nearly perpendicular to the spherical surface of the cornea (see Plate DXVII, fig. 13, and 15, a). When the point of the knife reaches the plane of the iris, it is to be turned towards the opposite side of the cornea, by moving the blade upon the incision already made, as a fulcrum. It is then to be carried forward, so that the cornea is again punctured at its transverse diameter b, at the same distance from the sclerotic coat at which it had been entered on the\nOf the Dif the opposite side (fig. 13). By these two incisions the blade of the knife has cut perpendicularly, or very nearly so, to the spherical surface of the cornea, and the gradual thickening of the knife, by filling up the wound as fast as it is made, prevents any of the aqueous humour from making its escape. The eye is now completely secured with the knife, and the assistant who has been supporting the upper eyelid, should receive a signal from the operator, to take away all prelude from the eyeball, and merely to support the eyelid sufficiently to allow the inferior half of the cornea to be seen. When the knife has been pushed forward a little way, as is represented in fig. 15, the incision is to be finished, by turning round the blade on its axis, and thus keeping the edge turned outwards, in such a manner, that the remaining part of the incision is made a straight line, and therefore nearly perpendicular to the lamellae of the cornea (fig. 15, e). Whenever the last step of the operation is begun, the aqueous humour begins to escape, which allows the knife to cut the cornea readily and in any direction.\n\nSupposing, therefore, that the cornea, instead of being spherical, were a plain surface, the incision now described would be represented by the lines a, b, and c, fig. 13; but as it is a segment of a sphere, the form will more resemble that represented in fig. 14; at least this is the form of the incision which the operator should have in view when performing the operation. By the inspection of these figures (13 and 14), it appears,\n\n1. That a large portion or ring of the cornea is left attached to the sclerotic coat, and must form, from its thickness, a complete support to the iris.\n\n2. That as the incision is made throughout nearly perpendicular to the lamellae of the cornea, the length of the incision of the internal lamella will be nearly equal to that of the external one, and will be greater than when it is made in the usual manner, by the femicular incision; and consequently the cataract will be more easily extracted through it.\n\n3. The upper edge of the internal incision is at a greater distance from, or further below the edge of the pupil.\n\n4. As the flap of the cornea is very small, the external edge thick, and not easily moveable, or apt to be caught by the motion of the eyelids, the edges of the incision are not liable to be displaced, and consequently the wound has a much better chance of uniting by adhesion.\n\nLastly, the cicatrix which remains is scarcely perceptible, and cannot even be distinguished when the cornea is looked upon in a direction perpendicular to its surface. The incision should be made so that the inferior edge of the wound (fig. 3, e) is half way between the circumference of the cornea and the edge of the pupil, supposing the pupil to be in a moderate state of dilatation. If it be made nearer to the sclerotic coat, then the advantages to be expected from this mode of operating will be lost; and on the other hand, if it be made at too great a distance from the sclerotic coat, and consequently too near the pupil, the edge of the pupil will be apt to pass through between the lips of the wound. In one case in which this accident happened, partly on account of the incision being at too great a distance from the sclerotic coat, and also from the knife having been entered too far above the transverse diameter of the cornea, the wound was long in uniting, and after it was healed, the pupil remained very irregular and contracted.\n\nIn making the incision of the cornea in the manner that has been directed, another circumstance also particularly deserves notice, which is, that after having punctured both sides of the cornea, in giving the knife the motion round its axis, some of the aqueous humour escapes, and there is a great risk of the iris turning over the cutting edge of the knife. An operator who meets with this for the first time, is apt to think an wound of the iris is inevitable; but if he cautiously stops the progress of the knife by gliding the point of the forefinger over the cornea, and prefling the iris from its edge, the incision will be completed with perfect safety.\n\nIt sometimes happens that after the knife has entered the cornea, the eyeball makes a sudden motion inwards, towards the nose, and a considerable part of the cornea is thus thrown out of view. This accident happens either from a fault in the operator or his assistant, and ought to be particularly guarded against; for when it has taken place, it is irremediable. The operator must not attempt to proceed any further, but immediately withdraw the knife, allow the wound of the cornea to heal, the aqueous humour to be regenerated, and after any slight inflammation which might succeed, has gone off, the operation may be a second time attempted without any additional risk.\n\nIt sometimes happens that, on puncturing the cornea on the nasal side, the point of the knife does not come through at the proper distance from the sclerotic coat. If it passes through too near the centre of the cornea, as is represented in Plate DXVII, fig. 17, considerable disadvantage arises; for besides the incision being too small, so that the lens is extracted with difficulty, the eye is apt to receive considerable injury, and the cicatrix afterwards to interfere with vision. When this accident happens, it will be the most prudent practice to proceed no further in the operation, but to allow the wound to heal by adhesion, so that a second operation might be afterwards attempted with all the advantages of the first. It is astonishing the rapidity with which a wound of the cornea made by a cutting instrument heals, and except it be very large, scarcely can the most acute eye detect any cicatrix. It is therefore much more prudent whenever any fault in the incision arises, that the wound be allowed to reunite, so that afterwards a second operation may be successfully performed, instead of attempting by scissors or other instruments to correct any bulging. If the knife passes through the cornea too close to the sclerotic coat, it is not attended with such bad effects as when it passes near to the pupil; and was it not for the danger in wounding the iris, it would be advisable in all cases to lay it down as a general rule to make the knife come out very close to the sclerotic coat.\n\nSee fig. 18.\n\nOf the Mode of opening the Capsule of the Lens.\n\nAfter the operator has completed the incision of the cornea, he should make a pause, and allow the patient to compose himself a little, in case of any involuntary motion of the eye-ball injuring any part of its structure. It sometimes happens, indeed, that the moment the incision of the cornea is finished, the lens suddenly follows the knife; but this is a circumstance never to be wished for, as the same cause which throws out the lens may also\nOf the Dit-also push after it some of the vitreous humour. When the incision of the cornea is finished, and nothing has escaped but the aqueous humour, the patient should be directed to turn his eye from the light, and to keep his eyelids shut, taking great care not to squeeze them, so that the pupil may be allowed to dilate. In most surgical operations, particularly those attended with much pain, it is of importance to finish them as quickly as possible. This, however, is not the case in the extraction of the cataract. It will be in general found that the severity of an injury done to any part of the body depends, not only on its extent, but on the sudden manner in which it is inflicted. Thus, a small drop of blood suddenly effused on the surface of the brain, often produces a series of much more distressing symptoms than a large collection of purulent matter in that organ. It is therefore reasonable to expect that if the different steps of the operation for the extraction of the cataract are gone through in a rapid manner, the eye will be much more injured than if the same operation be performed more slowly.\n\nThere is another advantage too, derived from performing the operation in a cautious manner; by holding the eye firmly for some time, the muscles become fatigued, and during the latter steps of the operation, when there is the greatest danger of injuring the organ, the power of resistance to the operator is much diminished.\n\nThe next step of the operation is to make a puncture in the capsule of the crystalline lens, so that the lens is allowed to pass through the pupil. On opening the eyelids, it will generally be found that the pupil has a very irregular appearance, which a beginner may often suppose to be in consequence of a wound of the iris, though no such accident has happened. Some surgeons employ an assistant to support the upper eyelid, whilst others take both eyelids completely under their own management; and when the operator finds that he can easily accomplish this last mode, he should always prefer doing so. When the eyelids are opened in such a manner as to expose the incision of the cornea and pupil, the point of the instrument called the curette*, is to be introduced through the wound of the cornea and pupil, to puncture the capsule of the lens. Richter advises that the capsule should be punctured several times with the point of this instrument, in order that a large opening may be made into it. When the lens is soft and milky, this may be necessary, but when it is of a firmer texture, if one puncture is made it sufficiently tears the capsule so as to allow itself to come away easily. Before introducing the curette, moderate pressure should be made on the eyeball, which has the effect not only of keeping the eye steady, but also of dilating the pupil. The convex part of the instrument (a) is then to be introduced through the wound of the cornea, and conducted to the central part of the pupil. When it reaches the pupil, from the curvature of the instrument, a very small turn of the handle will place the point upon the capsule of the crystalline lens, and by pushing the point inwards, the capsule will be readily punctured. It is not necessary that the point of this instrument be very thin; a rounded point will answer all the purposes of puncturing the capsule; whilst from this form there will be less danger of wounding the iris from any unexpected motion of the eyeball. Very little force is necessary to puncture the capsule, and when the point of the curette passes through it, it gives the sensation as if puncturing a piece of very fine paper with a pin.\n\nThis part of the operation we have often found to be one of the most difficult; for in many patients the eye becomes extremely unsteady, and whenever an attempt is made to hold it firm, or introduce the point of the curette, the eyeball is immediately rolled upwards under the roof of the orbit. The eyeball, too, is apt to make some untoward motion, after the point of the curette has been introduced into the anterior chamber; so that if the operator be not on his guard, the iris may be caught and torn by the point of the curette. In one case where, after the point of the curette was introduced through the pupil, the eye turned suddenly upwards, and the hooked part of the instrument catching the edge of the iris, pulled it a good way downwards, though fortunately it did not tear it.\n\nMode of Extracting the Lens.\n\nWhenever the capsule of the lens is punctured, the lens in many cases begins to move forward, and the pupil to dilate. The operator carefully watching this effect, should keep up an equal and moderate pressure upon the eyeball, which will assist the lens in getting through the pupil. Whilst the lens is making its escape, and appears to press very much on the inferior part of the pupil, the iris should be supported by the back of the spoon, (b Plate DXVII. fig. 19.) which is generally for convenience, fixed upon the opposite end of the handle of the curette. In applying the pressure on the eyeball, it is of great importance that it be kept up uniformly, and it should always be proportioned to the effects which it appears to produce on the dilatation of the pupil. In most cases a very moderate pressure will be found to answer the purpose. We have met with others, however, where it was necessary to compress the eye with a good deal of force, before it was possible to remove the lens.\n\nAny small portion of opaque lens which now remains in the capsule, or on its surface, must be extracted by means of a small scoop. When the fragment lies on the surface of the capsule, or in any part of the anterior chamber, it is in general easily removed; but when the opaque body remains within the capsule, it becomes necessary, that the scoop should enter the capsule through the opening which was made in it. When this opening is large and wide, the scoop will easily get in, and reach the opaque fragment; but on the contrary, when the opening is small, the scoop may be moved about in every direction, in hopes of laying hold of it, for the scoop is on the outside of the capsule, and cannot procure an entrance. It has happened accordingly, that every endeavour to extract the remaining fragment has been fruitless, and in such cases it was supposed by the operator to adhere to the capsule. It was more probable, however, that the capsule had not been sufficiently opened, and that the scoop could not reach the small fragments. In all cases, however, it is an object of importance, completely to remove the opaque body; for though any remaining portions be ultimately absorbed, yet in the mean time the operation is by no means so complete as it would have been, had nothing been allowed to remain. It has been advised by some, (and the practice has certainly been attended with\nOf the Extraction of the Capsule.\n\nWhen, after the crystalline lens is removed, the capsule is found to be opaque, it is absolutely necessary that it be at the same time taken away. Opacities of the capsule are generally situated in its anterior parts, which renders the removal of them much more practicable. The forceps for this purpose (Plate DXVII, fig. 9.) are to be cautiously introduced through the wound of the cornea and pupil, and any opaque portion laid hold of, and cautiously removed. It has been observed that though the capsule did not appear opaque during the operation, yet in consequence of inflammation, which occurs more or less afterwards, the capsule has become opaque. This circumstance has led to a proposal, that in all cases the capsule should be extracted along with the opaque lens. From the natural structure of the eye, and the strong adhesion which exists between the posterior part of the capsule of the lens and the anterior portion of the capsule of the vitreous humour, it would appear impracticable to separate them from each other, so as to extract the capsule entire. Many cases, however, are recorded by different authors, where, in performing the common operation, the lens inclosed in its capsule has made its escape. In these cases, however, it is probable, that the natural adhesion between the capsules of the two humours had been destroyed by some morbid alteration of structure. Such cases have probably been the cause of the proposal to extract in all cases the capsule of the lens. Mr Beer, a celebrated oculist in Vienna, has published a work*, in order to recommend and describe the mode in which such an operation should be performed. After some general observations on the bad consequences which arise from portions of the capsule remaining behind after the lens is removed, he describes his mode of operating in the following words.\n\n\"Immediately after dividing the cornea, I dilate the pupil as much as possible, by a gentle pressure on the eyeball with the finger. I then introduce the lancet (Plate DXVII, fig. 4.) through the wound of the cornea, and plunge it into the lens; one surface being turned upwards, and the other downwards, so that none of the lancet is visible. It is particularly to be recommended to the instrument-maker, that this lancet have a pretty thick body, by which means, the moment of introducing it, the lens will be somewhat pressed back, and its weak anterior adhesion will be separated. The lancet must now, when in the middle of the lens, be moved upwards and downwards, in order to divide its connections above and below. Lastly, the instrument must be turned suddenly on its axis, and moved to the inner angle of the eye, and then drawn out in a straight direction. The lens often follows with its capsule, immediately after the lancet is withdrawn, or at least it comes out quite easily, along with its capsules, on a continued pressure of the finger. There is not merely a slight hand, which must be carefully observed in the use of the lancet; experience has taught me many precautions which must not be neglected the moment that the lens comes out, otherwise the capsule may be very easily rubbed off from the lens, either in passing the pupil, or in the wound of the cornea.\n\n\"In order to avoid this, the opening of the cornea should be made as large as possible, and it is best to divide two-thirds of it; thereby the operator has the following advantages.\n\n\"1. The pupil dilates of itself after the division of the cornea by the pressing forward of the lens; and this dilatation may be easily increased by the slightest pressure.\n\n\"2. The more the pupil is dilated, the better the operator can observe the management of the lancet; he can move his instrument more freely in different directions in the lens, and consequently separate more quickly and more surely, the lens along with the capsule, from all its connections.\n\n\"3. The lens with its capsule passes more easily through the pupil, the wider the opening in the cornea, (which indeed requires in most cases much space), and the further and more easily the pupil dilates, the less danger there is of the capsule being separated on coming out. If the wound of the cornea is small, the capsule will be either separated from the lens in the pupil, or in the wound of the cornea, or passed back again either entirely, or at least partly, into the posterior chamber of the eye.\"\n\nTo those who are accustomed to perform operations on the eye, the method which we have detailed will at once appear to be difficult, extremely dangerous, and in many cases totally impracticable. The causes of failure in the operation for the cataract seldom arise from an opacity of the capsule of the lens, and when this does occur, it is always in consequence of a violent or long-continued inflammation of the eyeball. Whenever, therefore, the inflammation which takes place after the operation is checked by proper remedies, a cataract of the capsule will seldom be met with.\n\nOf the Treatment after the Operation.\n\nAfter the lens has been extracted, and the eyelids allowed to remain shut for a short time, the eye ought to be examined, in order to ascertain that the edges of the wound of the cornea are in their proper place; that no portion of the iris has passed through it, and the pupil is quite regular. When the incision of the cornea is made in the manner and size already described, the edges of the wound, from their firmness and thicknesses, accurately apply themselves to each other; and if the iris has sustained no injury, it will remain in its natural situation, and the pupil will become perfectly circular. When the pupil is not regular, it has been generally recommended to expose the eye to a bright light, in order to make it contract, and thus detach it from any part to which it might have adhered. When a portion of the iris protrudes through the wound, this generally arises, not from any injury of that part, but in consequence of the incision of the cornea having been made too large. If the incision be more than semicircular, (or two-thirds of the circumference of the cornea as directed by Mr Beer) this accident will almost constantly happen; and when it does take place, can never, as far as we know, be remedied. In such cases the operator should be careful not even to attempt with the spoon, or any such instrument, to replace the prolapsed iris; for it has always been\nOf the Dif- been observed, that attempts of this kind are fruitless, and never fail to increase the inflammation which succeeds the operation.\n\nIn applying the necessary compresses and bandages on the eye, the objects to be held in view are, to keep the eyelids in such a position, that they cannot disturb the wound of the cornea by their motion, and that the eye be not exposed to any light. The upper eyelid will be completely secured, by placing over it, and in the hollow of the orbit, a small stripe of wet caddis. The piece of caddis should not be so large as to press much upon the eye, and from its being wet, it will be readily kept in its situation. Above the caddis should be placed a piece of linen covered with simple jointment, large enough to cover both eyes; and this may be secured by one turn of a bandage round the head. In applying the bandage, care should be taken to place it so that the pins are put in at the forehead and temples. The convenience of this will be afterwards found, the bandage being easily removed without moving the patient's head from the pillow. The patient should now be put cautiously to bed, and his head kept extremely low. The room in which he sleeps should be made so dark, that no light may pass through the bandage to the eye. In an hour or half an hour after the operation, after the patient has become composed, he should be bled in the arm, if from the previous state of the patient's health that should be deemed a proper precaution. Rest, quietness, and abstinence, ought to be rigidly adhered to for the first day after the operation; the patient should be allowed no food except that which is liquid, in order that any motions of the jaw may be avoided, and the food should be given through a tea-pot, in order to prevent any motion of the head. Sixteen or twenty hours are sufficient to produce an adhesion of the cornea in favourable cases; and after this period, the compress of wet caddis placed upon the upper eyelid, becomes no longer necessary; for if it be allowed to remain any longer, it becomes hard and dry, and will be apt to irritate. The bandage and plaster ought therefore to be loosened, and the piece of caddis removed. The eyelids will now be found to adhere, and the patient will find much relief by cautiously wetting the cilia with cold water, in order to liberate the eyelids. From this period it is advisable to keep the eyelashes constantly greatly with any unctuous application.\n\nIn all cases, the symptoms which we are particularly to guard against after this operation, are those of inflammation; for when these arise, various effects may be produced which might frustrate all our endeavours to restore the patient's sight. If the wound in the cornea, instead of uniting by adhesion, goes through a tedious process of suppuration, the pupil becomes irregular and contracted; or if there is an effusion of lymph in the pupil, or if an opacity of the capsule takes place, these effects, all of which may arise in consequence of inflammation, might either greatly impair, or entirely destroy vision. The patient, therefore, ought to be carefully watched every six or eight hours for several days, and on the evening of the day of the operation, or at any future period, if symptoms arise which indicate the commencement of inflammation, he ought to be freely bled. The symptoms which are to guide us in adopting such means, are pain and uneasiness darting through the eye or head, and a frequent and full pulse.\n\nWe have often remarked, after this operation, that even in those cases where no bleeding is necessary, the pulse becomes unusually full. This symptom alone would not, therefore, be sufficient to warrant us in proceeding far in adopting such a practice. We have long believed, that the success of all surgical operations depends much on the adoption of the means to prevent any inflammatory action. It is well known the danger of amputation, and such operations in a vigorous and healthy constitution; it is equally well known the speedy recovery of patients from operations, who have been much debilitated from previous disease; and we have repeatedly remarked that patients who have lost much blood from some accident, after an operation, have recovered much more speedily than those to whom no such accident had happened. Aware of these circumstances, we have invariably adopted rigorously the depletive system after the operation for the cataract; and in many of those patients from whom a very considerable quantity of blood has at different periods been taken, we have observed that the success of the operation has been more speedy and more complete. The surgeon will sometimes find cases where, from the mildness of the symptoms, he is led to hesitate on the propriety of bleeding. In such a situation it is the safest plan to have recourse to it; for in general, wherever no symptoms have arisen which may indicate the impropriety of such a practice, if it be not useless, it is at least never followed by any bad consequences.\n\nVenefaction at the arm is the easiest and best mode of extracting the blood; but should any circumstances occur which render the operation at this place impracticable, or should it be thought necessary to take away the blood nearer to the inflamed organ, an opening may be made in the temporal artery. For the first two or three nights after the operation, the patient's arms should be watched, or secured in such a manner, that when he is asleep, he shall not be able to raise his hand towards his eye; for the most gentle stroke upon the eye, even several days after this operation, is attended with most excruciating pain, and is generally succeeded by violent inflammation. The patient should be enjoined to lie on his back, or on the sound side of the head; and after the first twelve hours he may be allowed to raise his head to the usual height. Most authors who have laid down rules to be followed after this operation, have directed that the eye should be kept shut up, and in total darkness for many days after the operation. We have, however, found an opposite practice attended with the most beneficial effects, and we have always considered it as a general principle to be followed, that the eye, from the very day after the operation, be gradually restored to its natural state, that the globe of the eye and eyelids be allowed to move, and that day after day the quantity of light to which it is exposed be gradually increased. In regulating the quantity of light, and the motion of the eye and eyelids, we should be entirely guided by the patient's feelings. Whatever be the quantity of light to which the eye is exposed, or its extent of motion, if it does not create uneasiness or pain, it will never be found to prove injurious; but on the contrary, if such a quantity of light be admitted as to create uneasiness, or if any motion of the eyes or eyelids gives pain, these circumstances will all tend to increase the inflammatory symptoms.\nIt has been already mentioned, that on the first day after the operation, the wet caddis should be removed, and the eyelids separated and covered with some unctuous substance, so that the patient may, from time to time, cautiously move the eyelids, provided it gives him no uneasiness. The pledget of ointment covering the eyes will prevent, during this day, any light from entering.\n\nOn the second day the pledget of ointment may be removed, and both eyes covered with two or three folds of old linen, the patient being directed to bathe his eye frequently with a little warm water, so as to remove any glutinous or concreted matter from the eyelids. He should also continue frequently to move the eyelids, and by opening them, to expose the eye to the small quantity of light which passes through the linen. On the following days, the light is to be admitted more and more freely into the room, and by degrees the patient will find that he is able to look down upon the bed clothes, or any large object, without uneasiness. People are often apt, from the joy which they feel in having their sight restored, to make too much use of the eye, and to render it weak and painful. Too much care, however, cannot be taken, to avoid any accident of this kind; and though the patient may feel his eye perfectly easy, and has no other complaint, yet it is always prudent to confine him to his bed for the first five or eight days. After the second or third day he may raise the head or body safely in bed; but we have repeatedly observed that when patients began to sit up early, and particularly when they approached too near a fire, they have been seized with a peculiar headache and inflammation of the eye, which were attended with much distress, and very difficult to remove. In ten or twelve days after the operation, the patient is commonly able to use the eye with considerable freedom, and to look even at minute objects without pain or uneasiness. It sometimes happens that after this period, a slight irritability of the eye remains, but this in general is speedily removed by the use of the vinous tincture of opium, or sometimes by the application of a weak ointment composed of the red oxide of mercury. The application of the vinous tincture of opium will be found peculiarly useful; and we have known many instances of patients who have undergone this operation, who were frequently, for a long time afterwards, attacked with slight pain or inflammation of the eye, which were always speedily and completely removed by the use of this medicine. It is scarcely necessary to observe that during the whole of the after treatment, the antiphlogistic regimen should be rigidly pursued, and that the patient should avoid every kind of food which from experience he knows to be apt to disagree with him; and that above all he should abstain from the use of wine and spirituous liquors of every description.\n\nOf Couching.\n\nBy this operation the lens is depressed from its natural situation behind the pupil, by introducing a needle into the posterior chamber.\n\nThe operation may be performed by introducing a needle (Plate DXVII. fig. 20.) through the sclerotic coat, about two lines distant from its junction with the cornea. The point of the needle is to be directed immediately over the opaque lens, and the lens to be depressed a little with the convex surface of the end of the needle. The point is to be pushed in a transverse case of the direction as far as the inner edge of the lens. Then the operator is to incline the handle of the instrument towards himself, by which means its point will be directed through the capsule into the substance of the opaque lens, and by inclining the needle downward and backward, the former will be lacerated and conveyed with the latter deeply into the vitreous humour. The treatment to be employed after couching is similar to that after extraction.\n\nSect XI. Of the Fistula Lacrymalis.\n\nWhen the lacrymal sac is distended with a puriform fluid, or when it has ulcerated, and the tears do not pass freely down the nasal duct, the disease is called fistula lacrymalis. In the first stage of the disease, a distinct tumor is formed in the situation of the sac, which, when compressed, a quantity of puriform fluid flows upon the eyeball through the puncture, or some of it passes through the nose. In the second stage of the disease, the integuments covering the sac ulcerate, and the puriform fluid and tears are constantly oozing through the fistulous opening. The eyelids are affected most commonly in the second stage of the disease, and sometimes also in the first, though not always. From the affection of the internal palpebral membrane, Scarpa has supposed that all the puriform fluid contained in the sac was secreted by it, but this does not always happen.\n\nTreatment.—When the disease has originated in the mucous membrane of the eyelids, applications to it alone will be sufficient to remove the accumulation in the sac. A collyrium of the muriate of mercury, and the daily application of the ointment of Janin, or of an ointment composed of the red oxide of mercury, are well suited for this purpose. When the sac has been the original seat of the disease, a solution of corrosive sublimate, acetate of zinc or of lead, will be useful, and these may be used by allowing them to be absorbed by the puncta into the sac, along with the tears, or by injecting them into the puncta by a proper syringe, (see Plate DXVII. fig. 23.)\n\nIf there be a complete obstruction in the nasal duct, these remedies generally fail, and it becomes necessary to open the sac, and remove the cause of obstruction in the duct. The sac may be readily opened by boldly plunging a common lancet into it while distended with matter. The sac should then be examined with a probe, and the probe passed down into the nose in the direction of the natural canal. A surgeon well acquainted with the situation and direction of the duct, can never fail in introducing the probe; for we never met with any case where the obstruction could not be overcome. A style, (Plate DXVII. fig. 24.) such as has been recommended by Mr Ware, is to be introduced in place of the probe, and allowed to remain until the canal is quite open. When the parts around the sac appear healthy, the style may be withdrawn, and the opening of the sac then heals. In many cases the disease returns, and in such, after the parts are a second time healthy, a tube (Plate DXVII. fig. 25.) may be introduced and allowed to remain during life. This operation requires that there be a free external opening, and that the head of the tube be pressed completely down.\nOf the Difc down below the edge of the skin. Generally the external opening heals in a few days. When the fac has ulcerated, there will generally be found some sinuses in the integuments covering the fac, all which should be freely laid open, and the style introduced as in the former case. After the skin and fac are apparently healthy, the tube may be introduced as in the former case. Besides the use of the style, it is also requisite to apply the eye-waters and ointments recommended in the first stages of the disease.\n\nSect. XII. Of the Porophthalmia.\n\nIn this disease there are numerous small brown coloured eminences formed at the roots of the ciliae of both eyelids, and generally both eyes are affected. The adjacent skin has a brownish red tinge, and becomes scurfy; the ciliae drop out, and the patient has a difficulty and uneasiness in opening the eyelids, particularly in candle light. The blood-veins of the internal palpebral membrane are also turgid, and prematurely numerous. This disease affects often many branches of the same family.\n\nTreatment.—The unguentum citrinum is a specific remedy in this disease. When there is much inflammation of the eyelids, they ought to be scarified, and the ointment applied immediately after. A collyrium composed of a weak solution of corrosive sublimate is also sometimes useful.\n\nOf the Ophthalmia Tarfi.\n\nIn many people who use their eyes much, particularly in candle light, and in those who live freely, the internal membrane of the eyelid often becomes gorged with blood; a thick puriform fluid glues the ciliae together in the morning, and the patient complains of an inability to move the eyelids, or to look at an object in a bright or dazzling light, without much uneasiness being excited. In other instances the eyelids become affected with serous inflammation, the glands of Meibomius swell and suppurate, the ciliae drop out, and the eyelids lose their natural form.\n\nTreatment.—Scarifying the inflamed vessels, and applying immediately afterwards a quantity of the red precipitate ointment, seldom fails in bringing relief, and in many instances alone the ointment will answer. In some cases the disease in the eyelid is much aggravated, and connected with affections of the stomach and bowels, and in such the greatest attention becomes requisite to keep the belly regular, and even to purge.\n\nOf the Entropion.\n\nWhen the eyelids are inverted, so that the tarbus with its cilia come in contact with the eyeball, the disease is called entropion. This disease, Mr Crampton has shown, arises in some cases from a thickened and diseased state of the internal palpebral membrane. In others the ciliae are turned in upon the eye from repeated and tedious inflammation altering the form of the tarbus, and in some old people where the integuments are very loose, the whole tarbus is inverted by the action of the orbiculari muscle.\n\nTreatment.—In the first case, Mr Crampton has ingeniously recommended that the tarbus be divided at their junction towards the external canthus, and that the eyelids thus liberated be kept in their proper situation by plasters, compresses, and when in the upper eyelid by fixing the speculum of Pellier, until such time as the wound has healed. In the second case little can be done but pulling out from their roots any of the ciliae which may have taken a wrong direction, and repeating the operation whenever they grow again. In the third case the disease may be cured by removing an oval portion of the skin the whole length, and close to the tarbus, and uniting the wound by one or two stitches and adhesive plasters. This operation may be also advisable along with that of Mr Crampton, when one is not sufficient to cure the complaint.\n\nChap. XI.\n\nOf the Diseases of the Ear.\n\nThe functions and structure of the internal membrane of the external meatus, and also of the eustachian tube and cavity of the tympanum, prove that it belongs to the mucous system, and that it is not a continuation of the periosteum as many anatomists have supposed. The analogy in the diseases of this organ prove the same. In catarrhal affections of the pituitary membrane of the pharynx, the ear is always more or less affected, and often the function of the organ is much impaired. Polypi also grow from the cavity and membrane of the tympanum of a similar structure to those found in other mucous surfaces. See Polypi. It is also subject to haemorrhages, and when it becomes inflamed, instead of suppuration taking place, there is a discharge of a puriform fluid from the surface, the same as what is observed in inflammation of the urethra, nose, &c.*\n\n* See Inflammations of the Mucous Membranes.\n\nThe internal membrane of the ear is also subject to the same kind of thickening and contraction of the canal, as what takes place in the urethra and lacrimal fac, &c., in consequence of long continued inflammation†. This we might conclude from analogy, but the fact has been proved in one instance. Bichat dissected the body of a person who had been exposed during his life to a puriform discharge from the ear, in which he found a very remarkable thickening of the membrane of the tympanum, but no mark of erosion could be detected.\n\nThe most common disease of the ear, and almost the only one which the surgeon can relieve, is a collection of wax in the meatus externus. Its presence can always be determined by the inspection of the ear; and it can be removed by directing the patient to drop some warm water into the ear for a few successive nights, and afterwards syringing out the softened wax, an operation which may be performed with a syringe, such as is represented in Plate DXVII.), having fitted for it a pipe of considerable length.\n\nChap. XII.\n\nOf the Diseases of the Nervous System.\n\nSect. I. General Remarks on the Pathology of the Nerves.\n\nA great number of diseases have been considered under the class of nervous; and much obscurity has been thrown on this department of medical science, from\nPathological investigations have been also unsuccessful; and in only a few cases has the knife of the most skilful anatomist been able to detect any morbid alteration of structure in nerves, which, during life, had been the seat of agonizing disease. In a few cases, where tumors have been found growing in their substance, it is not unlikely, that the cellular structure, connecting their fibrillae, has been the first part affected. Their arteries and veins are subject to the diseases of these systems in other organs; and we have seen an aneurismal tumor as big as a hazel nut formed in the nutrient artery of the popliteal nerve; and Bichat mentions having seen the veins of the tetic nerve varicose in a paralytic limb. Mr E. Home has described in the Philosophical Transactions a particular tumor of one of the axillary nerves, in which it is difficult to ascertain if the medullary portion be affected; and in the Encyclopedie Methodique there is a description of a case of a disease, resembling in some respects the case of Mr Home's. The disease was in the middle of the radial nerve; and as the hand had neither lost its sensibility nor the movement of any of the fingers, this circumstance led to the supposition, that the medullary portion of the nerve was not affected, but merely its neurilema.\n\nIn the fungus hermatoide, it is by no means improbable that there is a morbid alteration in the medullary matter of the nerves; though this fact can only be determined by an accurate examination of the disease in various organs.\n\nMost diseases belonging to this system have been fully treated of in the article MEDICINE. There is only one which becomes an object of surgical treatment.\n\n**Sect. II. Of the Tic Doleureux (Neuralgia).**\n\nAffections of this kind are distinguished by the nature of the pain, which is sharp, gnawing, and particularly at its commencement, accompanied with torpor, and sometimes with pulsations. It is attended with no heat or redness, or any tension or swelling of the part. It comes on in paroxysms, more or less long, and at different intervals. Sometimes the attack is periodical.\n\nThe pain is always fixed in the trunk or branch of a nerve; and, during the paroxysm, it darts from the part first affected through all the ramifications of the nerve.\n\nMany nerves of the body have been found affected with this disease. The first pair of the loins (neuralgie ilio-scrotale), the posterior crural (ilchias nervosa politica), the crural, but particularly the nerves of the face are subject to it. When the disease affects the face, it is generally situated either in the frontal nerve, in the infra-orbital nerve, or in the submental nerve. Sometimes the pain affects not only all the branches of these nerves, but it extends to their anastomosing branches, and spreads to one or more of the trunks.\n\nThis disease appears to be produced from a variety of causes, according to which its symptoms are varied. Sometimes it has been known to succeed a local irritation, such as an injury on the trunk of the nerve; and in other cases, the affection of the particular nerve is sympathethic of a disease in some distant organ.\n\nIn some instances we have observed this disease arise from an affection of the prime vice; so that in all cases it becomes the first object of the surgeon to trace the cause of the disease.\n\n**Treatment.**—When the stomach or intestinal canal are disordered, along with the particular affection of the nerve, the nervous affection will often cease when they are restored to their natural state. This is to be accomplished in most cases by emetics, and a course of laxative medicines, purged according to the qualities and quantity of the evacuated matter.\n\nIn some cases, particularly in the affection of the frontal nerve, we have found great relief from the repeated application of small blisters over the nervous trunk. In some instances, too, the patients have experienced great relief, and have even completely recovered, by a continued attention to a very spare vegetable diet, or to a milk diet. The celebrated Marmontel was a remarkable instance of this kind.\n\nThere are, however, cases where these means fail, and where the disease appears to depend on some fixed cause of irritation in the affected nervous trunk. In such cases, it is the usual practice to divide the trunk of the nerve. This operation generally gives instant relief; but its effects have, we believe, in most cases, been but of short duration. It is a fact completely established, that the ramifications of the nervous as well as of the vascular system, though divided, are gradually regenerated. The numerous anastomoses preserve the life of the part on which the divided trunk was distributed, and the divided edges of the trunk gradually coalesce; so that the nerve is again able to perform its natural functions. This reunion of the nerves does not take place so rapidly as we observe it in the arteries, in the skin, cellular membrane, or muscle; and months elapse before it is completed: but, from this reunion, it is probable, that the morbid action in tic doleureux, of the nature of which we are ignorant, the operation, in most cases at least, brings merely temporary relief.\n\nWhen the operation is to be performed, the necessary steps are extremely simple. Some have contented themselves with introducing a sharp-pointed bistoury through the integuments towards one side of the exit of the nerve, passing the point underneath it, and then dividing it; thus leaving only a small puncture of the skin.\n\nWhen, however, the operation is done in this manner, the divided extremities, from being separated only a little way, are apt immediately to reunite; a circumstance which should be prevented. We would therefore advise that a free incision be made immediately above the nerve; that the nerve be completely divided, and either a portion cut altogether away, or the divided extremities separated to a distance, and the wound allowed to heal by suppuration.\n\n**Chap. XIII.**\n\n**Of Herniae.**\n\nThe word hernia has been used to signify a protrusion of any viscus, from its proper cavity; but we shall only treat in this place of abdominal hernia. The viscera of this cavity are most frequently protruded at the inguinal and\nSURGERY.\n\nOf Herniae, and crural rings and the umbilicus. They, however, protrude also at the foramen ovale, at the perinaeum, through the iliacic notch, and diaphragm.\n\nThe names that have been given to different kinds of hernia, have been derived both from the contents of the hernia, and from its situation. If they contain omentum only, they are called omental hernia, or epiplocele; if only intestine, intestinal hernia; if both, omentum and intestine, enteropelvicole; if the stomach is contained in the tumor, gastropelvicole; if the liver, hepatocoele; if the bladder, cystocoele; if the uterus, hysterocele.\n\nThe peritoneum generally protrudes prior to any of the viscera, forming a bag called the hernial sac, in which the protruded viscera are afterwards contained. The protruded portion of peritoneum is not dragged from its natural situation, but becomes elongated by gradual diffusion; and it is usually not only lengthened, but more or less thickened.\n\nSect. I. Of the Inguinal Hernia.\n\nIn an inguinal hernia, the protruded viscus enters the abdominal ring, passes along the inguinal canal, and comes out either at the inguinal ring, and goes into the scrotum (scrotal hernia), or bursts through the tendon of the external oblique muscle (inguino-abdominal). Or, it passes through the tendon of the transversalis, and internal oblique, and appears at the inguinal ring (abdomino-inguinal).\n\nInguinal hernia is more frequent in men than women, the round ligament of the uterus being of a smaller size than the spermatic cord. It sometimes appears on both sides, but most frequently on the right side.\n\nWhen the skin of the scrotum of an inguinal hernia is removed by dissection, a fascia is found lying underneath it, which varies in thickness, according to the bulk and duration of the tumor. This fascia comes off from the tendon of the external oblique muscle above the abdominal ring. Below this fascia is the cremaster muscle, which is united both to the fascia and hernial sac, though easily separable from them by dissection. When the fascia and cremaster muscle are removed, the hernial sac is exposed. The epigastric artery is situated on the pubic side of the sac. The spermatic cord lies generally behind the sac; sometimes to one side, and sometimes on its anterior part. Often the vessels of the cord are split, the epididymis passing along one side of the sac, and the artery, veins, and absorbents, on the other. Sometimes there are more than one hernial sac on the same side. Mr Cooper found, in one case, two within the inguinal canal. This arises in some cases from wearing a truss.\n\nIn the inguino-abdominal hernia, the sac enters the abdominal ring; and, instead of being continued along the inguinal canal, it passes through the tendon of the external oblique muscle. The hernial sac, in this case, is composed of two distinct layers; the one internal and peritoneal, the other external, and produced by an elongation and gradual thickening of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle.\n\nIn the abdomino-inguinal hernia, the sac passes through the tendon of the transversalis or the tendons of both the transversalis and oblique muscle, enters the inguinal canal, appears at the inguinal ring, and then passes down into the scrotum. In this case, Mr Cooper observes, that the spermatic cord lies on the upper or outer part of the sac. The epigastric artery lies on the outside of the lac.\n\nThe inguinal hernia is generally pyriform, small towards the ring, and enlarging as it descends. It may be distinguished from other swellings of these parts, by the following symptoms: 1. When the patient is desired to cough, the tumor becomes immediately distended, owing to the pressure of the abdominal muscles forcing into the sac more of the viscera or of their contents. 2. When the patient can remember that the tumor used to disappear when in the horizontal position. 3. When the progress of the tumor has been from the groin to the scrotum. 4. When the tumor contains intestine, it is elastic and uniform; and, when pushed up into the abdomen, it returns with a gurgling noise. When omentum is contained, the tumor is less equal on its surface, receives an impression with the fingers, and does not return with a gurgling noise. Most commonly, however, both intestine and omentum are contained in the sac. 5. The functions of the viscera are sometimes interrupted, producing eructations, sickness, constipation, colicky pains, and diffusion of the abdomen.\n\nThe inguinal herniae ought to be carefully distinguished from hydrocele of the vaginal coat, from incysted hydrocele of the spermatic cord, from enlargements of the testicle, from haematocele, and from varicocele. Hydrocele and hernia, too, are often combined, particularly omental herniae.\n\nSect. II. Of Reducible Inguinal Hernia, and of Trusses.\n\nHerniae are either reducible, irreducible, or strangulated. In the reducible state, the parts may be returned into the cavity of the abdomen. To prevent the escape of the bowels, and the danger of such an accident, a constant pressure should be applied at the part where the hernia opens into the abdomen, to shut the mouth of the sac, and thus oppose an effectual resistance to the protrusion of its contents. To accomplish these purposes, various trusses have been contrived. The truss should be made of steel, and the spring not stronger than what is sufficient to keep up the bowels; for, if the pressure be great, the abdominal muscles, where it is applied, are weakened, and even absorbed. Mr Cooper advises the pad to be made of a conical form, the apex of which should rest on the mouth of the sac. But, as there will be found much variety in the situation and size of the opening through which the hernia passes, it will often be necessary to vary the form and bulk of the pad. The truss ought to be applied so that it makes pressure not on the inguinal ring where the hernia comes out, but upon that part where the spermatic cord, and with it the hernia, first quit the abdomen; and this point may always be determined, by making the patient cough after the hernia has been reduced, and ascertaining the furthest part from the inguinal ring, where the hernial sac is found to protrude. On this point the pad should rest. If the pad be too large, and press merely on the inguinal ring, it will allow the bowels to pass through the internal or abdominal ring, and enter into the inguinal canal. On the other hand, the pad should\nChap. XIII.\n\nSURGERY.\n\nOf Inguinal not be too small, so as to press into the mouth of the Hernia sac and plug it up, for that would prevent all chance of a permanent cure; the bowels may be prevented from entering into the sac; but the pad will act as a dilator or bougie, keep the mouth of the sac constantly open, and even increase its diameter. The pad, therefore, ought always to be made of such a size and shape, as to make a pressure on the abdominal ring, inguinal canal, and inguinal ring.\n\nSect. III. Of Irreducible Hernia.\n\nHerniae become irreducible when the protruded parts are suffered to remain long in the hernial sac and increase much in bulk, when membranous bands form across the sac and entangle its contents, or when an adhesion takes place between the sac and its contents, or among the contents themselves.\n\nTreatment.—In such cases, a bag truss ought to be worn, so as to keep up a uniform and steady pressure on the scrotum. The application of ice, too, has been known to procure the return of a hernia which appeared irreducible.\n\nSect. IV. Of Strangulated Hernia.\n\nA hernia is said to be strangulated when not only the intestine and omentum are irreducible, but when the protruded bowels are inflamed, and when the passage of the feces through the strangulated portion is completely interrupted.\n\nThe tumor is attended with considerable pain, which sometimes extends through the abdomen, and is often situated at the umbilicus. Hiccup and vomiting succeed; at first the contents of the stomach only are evacuated, but afterwards those of the lower portions of the alimentary canal. The bowels are completely obstructed, except that portion below the seat of strangulation. The pulse is commonly quick and hard; sometimes, however, it is full. If the disease continues, the skin covering the tumor becomes discoloured and slightly oedematous, and the abdomen tender and tense; the pulse becomes small and thready, the countenance has an expression of anxiety; and all these symptoms are subject to exacerbations. They are greatly mitigated for a while, but soon recur with increased violence.\n\nAfter having suffered great pain during the first stage of the disease, the patient becomes suddenly easy, and the tumor becomes of a purple colour, and has a cracking feel. The abdomen becomes more tense, a cold sweat covers the body, and the pulse is weak and intermittent. At last the patient, deluded with the hopes of a recovery, sinks under the complaint.\n\nOn dissection, the hernial sac is generally found to contain a quantity of dark bloody serum. The intestine is of a dark chocolate brown, with black spots interspersed over it, which are easily torn on being touched with the finger. The surface is covered with a layer of coagulated lymph. Even when the intestine is not mortified the colour is extremely dark, but then the black spots do not appear. Within the abdomen the whole intestinal canal sometimes appears quite natural; at other times portions of the intestines appear inflamed, and in some rare cases they are glued together by an effusion of lymph.\n\nVol. XX. Part I.\n\nOn examining the seat of stricture, it will be found to take place either at the abdominal or inguinal ring. In large herniae, Mr Cooper has remarked that the stricture is most frequent at the external opening, and then it may be often seen from the particular shape of the tumor, a constriction being distinguishable at that part. In other cases the stricture is seen at the entrance of the spermatic vessels into the inguinal canal; so that, in operating for hernia, it is not sufficient to dilate the external ring, but it becomes necessary to dilate the upper part of the canal.\n\nTreatment.—In the treatment of strangulated hernia, the leading object which is to be kept in view, is to return the displaced viscera as speedily as possible, and, at the same time, while doing this, to diminish the symptoms of inflammation or prevent their accretion. The first thing to be attempted, except when the tumor is much inflamed and painful, is the reduction of the hernia. In doing this, it is necessary to attend to the position of the patient and the mode of applying the pressure. The body of the patient should be placed on an inclined plane, with the head downwards, and the thighs bent towards the trunk of the body. The pressure which is employed on the tumor should always be directed upwards and outwards along the course of the spermatic cord, and it may be persevered in from a quarter to half an hour. Besides these mechanical means, tobacco clysters, and cold, have been useful in accomplishing the reduction. Ice is the easiest and best mode of applying cold to hernial tumors; but, when this cannot be procured, Mr Cooper uses a mixture of equal parts of sal ammoniac and nitre. To one pint of water in a bladder, ten ounces of the mixed salts are added, the bladder tied up, and then laid over the tumor. If, after four hours, the symptoms become mitigated, and the tumor lessens, this remedy may be persevered in for some time longer; but if they continue with equal violence, and the tumor resists every attempt to reduction, no further trial should be made of the application.\n\nThe operation which it is now necessary to perform, consists in making an incision through the integuments along the upper part of the tumor, making an opening into the hernial sac, and extending it, so as to allow the contents to be examined, and the forefinger to reach the seat of stricture. The stricture will be readily detected by the point of the finger, and may be easily divided by introducing the bitoury along the finger, till the point of it passes below the stricture.* A very slight prelude of the edge of the instrument will be sufficient to divide the stricture, and allow the bowels to be returned into the abdomen. If merely the stricture is divided, and it is never necessary to extend the incision further, it is of little importance in which direction the incision is made; though surgeons have been at great pains to point out the dangers which might arise were it of too great an extent.\n\nSect. V. Of Femoral Hernia.\n\nIn femoral hernia, the hernial sac lies beneath the crural arch, being pushed through an opening between the edge of the broad insertion of Poupart's ligament, and the pubic side of the femoral vein.+ As the tumor enlarges, instead of falling downwards like the inguinal hernia,\nOf Femoral hernia, it passes forwards, and often turns over the anterior edge of the crural arch. As it proceeds, the swelling increases more laterally than upwards or downwards; so that it assumes an oblong shape. In the crural hernia, the fascia has two coverings besides the integuments; the superficial fascia of the external oblique muscle, and the fascia propria of Mr Cooper, which is formed by the protrusion of the fascia which naturally covers the opening through which the hernia passes, and the fascia of the crural sheath. The taxis and use of trusses are the same in femoral as in inguinal hernia; and the same series of symptoms indicate the necessity of an operation in both when strangulated.\n\nOperation.—Mr Cooper recommends that the incision of the integuments be made in the form of a T, beginning one incision about an inch and a half above the crural arch, in a line with the middle of the tumor, and extending it downwards below the arch, and meeting a second incision nearly at right angles with the other, the whole length of the tumor. The two fascias are next to be divided, and the hernial fasc opened at its lower part, sufficiently large to admit readily the finger. The seat of the stricture is to be ascertained by the introduction of the point of the fore finger under the crural arch, and it may be readily divided in a direction upwards and inwards, of a sufficient extent to liberate the intestine; generally a very slight motion of the edge of the bitoury will be found sufficient for that purpose.\n\nCHAP. XIV.\n\nOf Hare-lip.\n\nThe hare-lip is a fissure in the upper lip, very seldom in the under one.* It is attended with want of sublance, and has its name from a resemblance to the lip of a hare. In general it is only a simple fissure, though sometimes it is double.\n\nIn proceeding to the operation, the patient, if a child, should be secured upon a table; but if an adult, he is to be seated upon a chair, in a proper light. The frenum connecting the gums to the upper lip is to be divided; if a fore-tooth projects so much as to prevent the parts from being brought properly together, it is to be extracted; or when the fissure runs through the bones of the palate, if a small portion of the bone projects, this must be removed. The operator is then to lay hold of one side of the fissure between the thumb and fore-finger, or between the forceps†, then with a pair of sharp and very strong scissors, or with a scalpel, to cut off a thin portion of the lip, and to repeat the same thing upon the other side of the fissure, so as to render the whole edges of the fissure completely raw; by which, if the operation be properly performed, a piece will be separated in form like an inverted V. After the incisions have been made, the vessels should be allowed to bleed freely to prevent inflammation; and when the bleeding has ceased, the sides of the wound are to be brought accurately together, and kept in that state by the twisted sutures. The first pin ought to be as near as possible to the red edge of the lip; another is to be inserted near the upper angle; and if the patient be an adult, a third pin will generally be necessary, half way between the other two. In passing them, they ought to go rather deeper than half through the Amputa-\n\n* See Plate DXXIV.\n\n† Plate DXXIV.\n\ntion of the Amputation of the thigh.\n\nThe patient should be placed on a table of a convenient height, in such a manner that the diseased limb may hang over the edge of it, and be secured by an assistant seated on a low chair before him; the other limb and the arms are also to be secured by proper assistants. The tourniquet (see Plate DXVI.) is to be placed on the thigh, three or four inches below Poupart's ligament, where the femoral artery may be most easily and completely compressed. Default preferred to the tourniquet, the finger of a strong and intelligent assistant. A cushion fixed on a handle answers very well for making pressure on the artery when a tourniquet is not to be used; and it is a useful instrument to have in readiness, in case the tourniquet should go wrong; or when it becomes necessary to amputate the thigh so far up, that a tourniquet cannot be safely fixed.\n\nAfter the operator has determined on the place for the incision of the integuments, an assistant should grasp the limb with both hands a little above the place where the skin is to be divided, and draw it upwards as far as possible. The operator then with the knife (see Plate DXII. fig. 10.) makes a circular incision through the skin and cellular membrane, down to the muscles; and this may be done, either by one stroke of the knife, or by first making one semicircular incision round the under part of the limb, and afterwards another incision upon the upper part corresponding with the former. When this is made, the integuments retract considerably from their natural elasticity, and they are to be separated from the muscles and dissected with the point of the knife, as far back as to leave a sufficient quantity of skin to cover the stump. The skin being turned back, the operator,\noperator, by a second incision carried close to its inverted edge, cuts the muscles perpendicularly down to the bone. During this part of the operation, care should be taken to avoid wounding the edge of the skin, by tracing attentively the edge of the knife during the whole course of the incision. After the muscles are divided, a considerable retraction takes place, and any muscular fibres attached to the periosteum should be separated from it by the point of the knife, in order to allow the bone to be drawn through as high as possible, and thus secure to it a firm fleecy covering. All the soft parts next to be drawn upwards as far as their separation from the bone will admit of. They are to be kept in this situation by an instrument called the retractors, until the bone is drawn through. The retractors may be either made of iron plates (see Plate DXXII. fig. 5.), or a piece of linen or leather cut as represented in fig. 6. The assistant who uses either of these instruments, should take care when he applies them, that the soft parts are completely out of the reach of the saw, and that they are held back as far as the place where the bone is to be divided. Any sharp edges which may be left on the end of the bone after it has been drawn through, should be taken away with pliers, Plate DXXII. fig. 8. The arteries are next to be tied, and both the femoral artery and vein may be included in one ligature. The bleeding being stopped, and the wound cleaned, the tourniquet is to be altogether taken away, and the soft parts drawn down, so as to cover the extremity of the bone. In order to keep them in this situation, a bandage of thin flannel or cotton cloth, not exceeding two inches and a half in breadth for an adult, is to make one or two circular turns round the body above the ilium; it is then to be carried obliquely over the groin, and turned round the upper part of the thigh pretty firmly two or three times, forming as it were at this place a point of support to the muscles and skin. It is afterwards to be passed in a spiral manner downwards to near the edge of the wound, taking care to pull the soft parts towards the stump, whilst applying each turn of the bandage. The turns should not be so tight as to cause pain, but sufficient to keep the parts in the situation in which they are placed. The surface of the muscles and the edges of the skin are now to be accurately brought together in such a direction, that the wound forms a straight line, extending from the anterior to the posterior aspect of the limb. Strips of adhesive plaster, about half an inch in breadth, and eight or ten inches in length, should be applied, in order to keep the lips of the wound in this position. Those over the middle part of the wound ought to be put on first; and great attention is necessary in their application, to prevent the edges of the skin from overlapping and puckering. They should be of such a number as completely to cover the surface of the wound, leaving only a small opening for the ligatures of the arteries to be brought out at that part of the wound nearest the place where the artery is situated. The wound is to be afterwards covered with a piece of linen or canvas spread with simple ointment, and a compress of fine tow laid over it, the whole being secured by a few turns of the roller.\n\nThe bedclothes should be kept from pressing upon, and coming in contact with the stump, by a frame or cradle, as it is called. (See Plate DXXIII. fig. 11.)\n\nWhen this operation is to be performed, the incision Lithotomy of the integuments may be made, either with a common scalpel, or with the end of the amputating knife, as represented in Plate DXXII. fig. 10. After the skin is divided, it is of importance to allow it to retract as much as possible, by cutting the fibres of cellular membrane which connect it with the fascia of the thigh, before dividing the muscles. If the limb be much emaciated, the division of the muscles may be also made with the scalpel; if, on the contrary, the limb be bulky, the incision ought to be made by a common amputating knife, in order that the surface of the flaps be plain and uniform. After dividing the muscles obliquely upwards down to the bone, they should be separated from it a sufficient way, so as to leave enough to cover the end of the bone, and they should be allowed to contract as much as possible before the bone is drawn through. After the limb is amputated, and the circular bandage applied, the flaps will be found to meet very accurately together, and to form a round and smooth stump. From the angles of the skin being removed, no puckering or corners are left, and the two surfaces and muscles being applied to each other, and covering the end of the bone, give it a firm and fleecy covering, whereas in amputations performed in the common mode, the bone is covered by integuments alone. The adhesive plasters are to be applied in the same manner, and the patient is to be treated afterwards as in the other modes of operating.\n\nThe general rules to be attended to in amputation in other parts of the body, are the same as those already mentioned; and in Plate DXXII. and DXXIII., we have delineated the place and direction of the incisions.\n\n**Chap. XVI.**\n\n**Of Lithotomy.**\n\nThe manner of preparing the patient for this operation depends upon a variety of circumstances. If he be plethoric, a few ounces of blood should be taken away, and at proper intervals the bowels ought to be emptied by any gentle laxative which will not gripe. The diet should consist of light food for some time previous to the operation. If the pain be violent, opium is necessary. Sometimes it is relieved by keeping the patient in bed with the pelvis raised, so as to remove the stone from the neck of the bladder. He ought not to fit up, or take any exercise, in the time of preparation. The warm bath ought to be used two or three times, and the patient should remain in it half an hour at each time. A laxative ought to be given on the day preceding the operation, and an injection a few hours before it is performed. The patient ought to drink plentifully of some diluent liquor, and to retain the urine several hours previous to the operation. If this cannot be readily effected, a slight compression, by means of a ligature, may be made upon the penis, so as to have the bladder sufficiently distended, that there may be no danger of the posterior surface being hurt by the end of the gorget. The perineum and parts about the anus should be well shaved.\n\nA table somewhat more than three feet in height, and of sufficient strength, is to be firmly placed,\nLithotomy, and properly covered with blankets, pillows, &c. Upon this the patient is to be laid and properly secured; and for this purpose there ought to be two pieces of broad firm tape, each about five feet in length, which are to be doubled, and a noose formed upon them. A noose is to be put upon each wrist, and the patient desired to lay hold of the middle of his foot upon the outside. One end of the ligature is to go round the hand and foot, and the other round the ankle and hand, and cross again, so as to repeat the turns in the reverse way. A running knot is to be tied, by which the hand and foot will be properly secured. The buttocks are then to be made to project an inch or two over the table, and to be raised considerably higher than the shoulders by a couple or more pillows, and one pillow ought to be put under his head.\n\nThe operator is now to introduce a grooved staff (Plate DXXI. fig. 5.) of proportionable size, and open to the end, through the urethra into the bladder; and having fully satisfied himself of the existence of a stone, he inclines the staff, if he be right-handed, obliquely over the right groin, so that the convex part of the staff may be felt in the perineum on the left side of the raphe. He then fixes it, and delivers it to his assistant, who is to hold it with his right hand, desiring him to press it gently, in order to make the fulcrum of the staff project in the direction in which he received it. With his left hand the same assistant is to raise and support the scrotum.\n\nThe thighs of the patient being sufficiently separated by the assistants, and the surgeon being seated upon a chair of a proper height, and in a convenient light, he makes an incision with a common convex-edged scalpel through the skin and cellular substance, below the symphysis of the os pubis, which is a little below the scrotum, and where the crus penis and bulb of the urethra meet, and on the left side of the raphe, and continues it in a slanting direction downwards and outwards to the space between the anus and tuberosity of the ischium, ending somewhat lower than the basis of that process, by which a cut will be made of three or four inches in length. This incision ought not to be shorter than is here directed, otherwise there will not be room for the rest of the operation. As soon as the integuments are divided, he ought to introduce two of the fingers of the left hand. With one he keeps back the lip of the wound next the raphe, and with the other he presses down the rectum. He ought likewise particularly to guard against cutting the crura of the penis, which he can readily feel, and separate at their under part with one of his fingers. He next makes a second incision almost in the same direction with the first, but rather nearer to the raphe and anus, by which he preserves the trunk of the arteria pudica. By this incision he divides the transversalis penis, and as much of the levator ani and cellular substance within these as will make the prostate gland perceptible to the finger. If any considerable vessel be cut, it is immediately to be secured, though this is seldom necessary. He is now to search for the groove of the staff with the fore finger of his left hand, the point of which he presses along from the bulb of the urethra to the prostate gland, which surrounds the neck of the bladder. He keeps it there; and turning the edge of the knife upwards, he cuts upon the groove of the staff, and freely divides the membranous part of the urethra, till the staff can be felt perfectly bare, and that there is room to admit the nail of the finger; and as the finger assists in keeping the parts stretched, and effectually prevents the rectum from being hurt, the incision into the urethra may be made with perfect ease and safety.\n\nThe next part of the operation, viz. dividing the prostate gland and neck of the bladder, might, by a dexterous operator, be safely performed with a common scalpel, with the edge turned the opposite way. But to guard against accidents, a more convenient instrument, called the cutting gorget, is now in general use. It was originally invented by Mr. Hawkins of London, and since his time has undergone various alterations.* The membranous part of the urethra being now divided, and the fore finger still retained in its place, the point of the gorget, previously fitted to the groove, is to be directed along the nail of the finger, which will serve to conduct it into the groove of the staff; and as this is one of the nicest parts of the operation, the most particular attention is required that the point of the gorget be distinctly felt to rub in the bare groove.\n\nThe operator now rises from his seat, takes the staff from the assistant, raises it to near a right angle, and presses the concave part against the symphysis of the os pubis; satisfies himself again that the point or beak is in the groove, and then pushes on the gorget, following the direction of the groove till the beak slip from the point of the staff into the bladder. The gorget is not to be pushed farther than this, otherwise it may wound the opposite side of the bladder, &c.\n\nThe gorget having now entered the bladder, which is readily known by the discharge of urine from the wound, the staff is to be withdrawn, and the finger introduced along the gorget to search for the stone, which, when felt, will point out the direction to be given to the forceps; at any rate, the introduction of the finger serves to dilate the wound in the bladder; and this being done, a pair of forceps† of a proper size, and with their blades as nearly together as their form will allow, are to be introduced, and the gorget withdrawn slowly, Fig. 6. &c., and in the same direction in which it entered, so as to prevent it from injuring the parts in its return. After the forceps are introduced, and passed till they meet with a gentle resistance, but no farther, the handles ought to be depressed till they are somewhat in an horizontal direction, as this will most correspond with the fundus of the bladder. One blade of the forceps is to be turned towards the symphysis of the pubes, to defend the soft parts there; the other of consequence will guard the return. After they have distinctly touched the stone, by moving them a little in various directions, they are then to be opened, and the stone laid hold of, which may generally be done with considerable ease. It frequently happens, however, that when the stone is small, it is not readily felt with the forceps; and instances may happen where the under and back part of the bladder may be so depressed as to conceal the stone. In such a situation, nothing will more readily bring it in the way of the forceps than to introduce the finger into the rectum, and elevate this part of the bladder. Straight forceps are generally used; crooked ones, in some very rare cases, however, may be necessary, and therefore the surgeon ought to be provided with them.\n\nAfter\nLithotomy. After the forceps has laid hold of the stone, if it be small and properly placed, it may readily be extracted; but if, on the contrary, the handles of the forceps are now observed to be greatly expanded, it is certain the stone is improperly fixed, or that it is remarkably large: in either case it should not be held fast, but allowed to move into the most favourable situation; or the finger is to be introduced so as to place it properly for extraction. If this cannot be done with the finger, it ought to be allowed to slip out of the forceps, in order to get it more properly fixed; and as the most common form of the stone is flat and oval, or somewhat like a flattened egg, the forceps should have hold of the smallest diameter, while an end presents to the neck of the instrument. The stone should be grasped with no greater firmness than is merely sufficient to bring it fairly out, and it should be extracted in a slow gradual manner.\n\nEXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.\n\nPlate DXIII.\n\nFig. 1. and 2.

Lat. 6° 16'. This river is navigable for 90 miles up the country. The chief productions of Surinam are, wood for dyeing, indigo, cotton, sugar, tobacco, gums, and different species of fruit. Prodigious numbers of monkeys infest the woods, as well as very large serpents. This settlement was ceded to the Dutch in 1674, as an equivalent for New York, but was retaken by the British in 1799. Paramaribo is the capital. N. Lat. 6° 16'. W. Long. 56° 0'. The productions of this country, when in the hands of the Dutch, yielded, in the year 1775, the sum of £22,955 sterling; and it may be presumed that the value of these will not diminish in the hands of its present proprietors. Population about 100,000 persons.\n\nDemerara.—Connected with Surinam we may notice the colony of Demerara, which surrendered to the British troops in 1781; was taken soon after by a French frigate, and afterwards recaptured by the forces of Great Britain. Its productions cleared from the port of Demerara from January 1856 to the same month of 1867, were 19,337 hogheads, 474 tierces, and 801 barrels of sugar; 4,722 puncheons and 17 hogheads of rum; 23,604 bales, two bags of cotton; 12,390,102 pounds of coffee; and 1,604 casks of mafasses; a produce which we hope will be constantly increasing under the mild and humane conduct of the British government, by the troops of which it was last taken in 1799, under Sir Ralph Abercromby. It is deemed a valuable acquisition, on account of its flourishing condition. Stabroek is the capital of Demerara.\n\nEefecoubo, on the banks of a river of the same name, was first founded in 1668, but came into the hands of the British much about the same time with the preceding. The unaccountable neglect shewn by Holland towards her colonies rendered them an easy conquest.\n\nBerbice is situated between Demerara and Surinam, containing about 104 small plantations, scattered at considerable distances from each other, the produce of which was long ago valued at £50,000 sterling, but may be expected to have a rapid increase. Population between 8,000 and 9,000 persons of various descriptions.\n\nPomeroon is a country which has a rich and fertile soil; yet the inhabitants chiefly confine themselves to the cultivation of cotton, for the produce of which it is found to be admirably adapted. It is not so well fitted to yield good crops of coffee or sugar, as the land is by far too rich, and strongly impregnated with saline matters. In 1799 and 1800; a thirst for planting cotton was greatly increased, as the crops of that article were then the largest ever known to be produced in the colonies.\n\nSURMOUNTED, in Heraldry, is when one figure is laid over another.\n\nSURMULLET. See Mullus, Ichthyology Index.\n\nVol. XX. Part I.\n\nSurname, that which is added to the proper name for distinguishing persons and families. It was originally distinguished from surname, which denotes the name of the sire or progenitor: thus Macdonald, Robertson, are surnames expressing the son of Donald, the son of Robert. The word surname, again, signified some name superadded to the proper name to distinguish the individual, as Artaxerxes Longimanus, Harold Harefoot, Malcolm Canmore. From this it is evident that every surname was a surname, though the reverse was not so. In modern times they are confounded; and as there is now no occasion to preserve the distinction, Dr Johnson has rejected the word surname altogether. See Name.\n\nSurnames were introduced among all nations at an early period, and seem to have been formed at first by adding the name of the father to that of the son. This was the practice among the Hebrews, as appears from the scriptures. Caleb is denominated the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. That the same thing was customary among the Greeks, every one who has read the poems of Homer must remember. We have an instance of it in the very first line of the Iliad: Ἀχιλλεύς Πελασγός, \"Achilles the son of Peleus.\" This is perhaps the general origin of surnames, for it has been common among most nations (a).\n\nThe Romans generally had three names. The first called praenomen answered to our Christian name, and was intended to distinguish the individuals of the same family; the second called nomen corresponded to the word clan in Scotland, and was given to all those who were sprung from the same stock; the third called cognomen expressed the particular branch of the tribe or clan from which an individual was sprung. Thus Publius Cornelius Scipio, Publius corresponded to our names John, Robert, William; Cornelius was the name of the clan or tribe, as Campbell was formerly the name of all the duke of Argyle's clients, and Douglas the name of the retainers of the duke of Hamilton's progenitors. Scipio being added, conveyed this information, that Publius, who was of the tribe of the Cornelii, was of the family of the Scipios, one of the branches or families into which that tribe was divided. Reflecting the three names which were common among the Romans, we may say that the first was a name and the other two surnames.\n\nDu Chesne observes, that surnames were unknown in France before the year 987, when the lords began to assume the names of their demesnes. Camden relates, that they were first taken up in England, a little before the conquest, under King Edward the Confessor: but he adds, they were never fully established among the common people till the time of Edward II.; till then they varied with the father's name; if the father, e.g., was called Richard, or Roger, the son was called Richardson, or Hodgson; but from that time they were settled, some say, by act of parliament. The oldest surnames are those we find in Domesday-Book, most of them\n\n(a) This might be supported by examples borrowed from many nations. The old Normans used Fitz, which signifies son; as Fitzherbert, Fitzsimmons, the son of Herbert, the son of Simmons. The Irish used O; as O'Neal, the son of Neal. The Scotch Highlanders employed Mac; as Macdonald, the son of Donald. The Saxons added the word son to the end of the father's name, as Williamson.\nSurname, them taken from places, with the addition of de; as Godefridus de Mannevilla, Walterus de Vernon, Robert de Oylly, &c. Others from their fathers, with filius, as Gulielmus filius Othoerii; others from their offices, as Eudo Dapifer, Gulielmus Camerarius, Gillebertus Cocut, &c. But the inferior people are noted simply by their Christian names, without any surnames at all.\n\nSurnames seem to have been introduced into Scotland in the time of William the Conqueror by the English who accompanied Edgar Atheling when he fled into that kingdom. These had their proper surnames, as Mowbray, Lovell, Lisle, using the particle de before them; which makes it probable that these surnames had been derived from the lands which their ancestors or they themselves had possessed. In Kenneth II.'s time in 800 the great men had indeed begun to call their lands by their own names; but the ordinary distinctions then used were only personal, and did not descend to succeeding generations, such as those employed by the Hebrews and Greeks: For example, John the son of William; or the names of office, as Stewart; or accidental distinctions from complexion or stature, as Black, White, Long, Short; or the name of their trade, as Tailor, Weaver.\n\nIt was long before any surnames were used in Wales, except that of son, as Evan ap Rice, Evan the son of Rice; Evan ap Howel, Evan the son of Howel: but many of them have at length formed separate surnames, as the English and Scots, by leaving out the a in ap, and joining the p to the father's name: thus Evan ap Rice becomes Evan Price; Evan ap Howel, Evan Powel.—We are told, surnames were unknown in Sweden till the year 1514, and that the common people of that country use none to this day; and that the same is the case with the vulgar Irish, Poles and Bohemians.\n\nWhen we come to inquire into the etymology of surnames, we must allow that many of them were originally significant of the qualities of mind, as Bold, Hardy, Meek; some of the qualities of body, as Strong, Low, Short; others expressive of the trade or profession followed by the persons to whom they were applied, as Baker, Smith, Wright; Butler, Page, Marshal. But the greatest number, at least of the ancient surnames, were borrowed from the names of places. Camden says, that there is not a village in Normandy but has given its name to some family in England. He mentions as examples, Percy, Devereux, Tankerville, Mortimer, Warren, &c. They were introduced with William the Conqueror. Several have been derived from places in the Netherlands, as Gaunt, Tournay, Grandison; and many from the names of towns and villages in England and Scotland, as Wentworth, Markham, Murray, Aberdeen. Many have been formed from the names of animals, as quadrupeds, birds, fishes; from vegetables, and parts of vegetables, as trees, shrubs, flowers, and fruits; from minerals of different kinds. Others are formed from such a variety of accidents that it is impossible to particularize them.\n\nSURPLICE, the habit of the officiating clergy in the church of England. By Can. 58, every minister saying the public prayers, or ministering the sacrament or other rites of the church, shall wear a decent and comely surplice with sleeves, to be provided at the charge of the parish. But by 1 Eliz. c. 2. and 13 and 14 Car. II. the garb prescribed by act of parliament, in the second year of King Edward VI. is enjoined; and this requires that in the saying or fingering of matins and even longs, baptizing and burying, the minister in parish churches and chapels shall use a surplice. And in all cathedral churches and colleges, the archdeacon, dean, provosts, masters, prebendaries, and fellows, being graduates, may use in the choir, besides their surpluses, such hoods as pertain to their several degrees. But in all other places every minister shall be at liberty to use a surplice or not. And hence in marrying, churching of women, and other offices not specified in this rubric, and even in the administration of the holy communion, it seems that a surplice is not necessary. Indeed for the holy communion the rubric appoints a white alb plain, which differs from the surplice in being clove-leaved, with a vestment or cope.\n\nSURREBUTTER, in Law, is second rebutter; or the replication of the plaintiff to the defendant's rebutter.\n\nSURREJOINDER, is a second defence of the plaintiff's declaration, by way of answer to the defendant's rejoinder.\n\nSURRENDER, in Common Law, a deed, or instrument, testifying that the particular tenant of lands and tenements, for life or years, doth sufficiently consent and agree, that he who has the next or immediate remainder or reversion thereof, shall have the present estate of the same in possession; and that he hereby yields and gives up the same to him, so that the estate for life or years may merge or drown by mutual agreement of the parties. Of surrenders there are three kinds; a surrender properly taken at common law; a surrender of copyhold or customary estates; and a surrender improperly taken, as of a deed, a patent, &c. The first is the usual surrender, and it is usually divided into that in deed, and that in law.\n\nSURRENDER, in deed, is that which is really made by express words in writing, where the words of the lessor to the lessee prove a sufficient assent to surrender his estate back again.\n\nSURRENDER, in Law, is that wrought by operation of the law, and which is not actual.—As if a man have a lease of a farm for life or years, and during the term he accepts a new lease; this act is, in law, a surrender of the former.\n\nSURRENDER of a bankrupt. See COMMISSION of Bankruptcy.\n\nSURRENDER of Copyholds is the yielding up of the estate by the tenant into the hands of the lord, for such purposes as are expressed in the surrender: as to the use and behoof of A and his heirs, to the use of his own will, and the like. This method of conveyance is so essential to the nature of a copyhold estate, that it cannot possibly be transferred by any other assurance. No Blackfriars, feoffment, fine, or recovery (in the king's courts) hath Comment. any operation upon it. If I would exchange a copyhold with another, I cannot do it by an ordinary deed of exchange at the common law, but we must surrender to each other's use, and the lord will admit us accordingly. If I would devise a copyhold, I must surrender it to the use of my last will and testament; and in my will I must declare my intentions, and name a devisee, who will then be entitled to admission.\n\nSURRENDER\nSURRENDER of Letters Patent and Offices. A surrender may be made of letters patent to the king, so that he may grant the estate to whom he pleases, &c., and a second patent for years to the same person for the same thing is a surrender in law of the first patent.\n\n10 Rep. 66. If an officer for life accept of another grant of the same office, it is in law a surrender of the first grant; but if such an officer take another grant of the same office to himself and another, it may be otherwise.\n\nSURREPTITIOUS.

It is 38 miles in length from east to west, 23 in breadth from north to south, and 112 in circumference. It contains 13 hundreds, 140 parishes, of which 35 are vicarages, 13 market-towns, 450 villages, 592,000 acres, and about 269,043 inhabitants. The members sent from it to parliament are 14, of which two are sent by each of the following boroughs, viz. Southwark, Bleechingley, Ryegate, Guildford, Gatton, Haffemere, and two for the county.\n\nThe air of this county, towards the middle, which consists mostly of hills and heath, is sharp, but pure and wholesome. About the skirts, where it is more level, and the soil richer, the air is milder, but also salubrious. In the middle parts the soil is barren enough in general; but towards the extremities, and where the country is open and champaign, it is fruitful in grass and corn, particularly on the south side of Holmdale, in which meadows, woods, and corn-fields, are agreeably intermixed. The soil is also very fertile along the Thames, especially towards London, where it greatly contributes to maintain plenty in the London markets. It has several rivers, abounding with fish, the chief of which are the Wye, the Mole, and the Wandle.\n\nSURSOLID, or SURDESOLID, in arithmetic, the fifth power of a number, or the fourth multiplication of any number, considered as a root.\n\nSURVEYING. That part of practical mathematics which teaches the method of ascertaining the limits and extent of lands or estates, and of representing these in maps or plans, is called surveying, or land surveying; but this term, in a more extended sense, includes the valuing of landed property, the buying and selling of estates, and the dividing or laying out of landed property to the best advantage.\n\nConsidered as a branch of practical mathematics, surveying depends for its principles on GEOMETRY and TRIGONOMETRY, and as far as it is confined to the mensuration of plain surfaces, has already been considered under the article MENSURATION. It is the object of the present article to explain and illustrate the most approved methods of applying these principles to practice, and in particular to point out the use of the field book, and the mode of surveying large estates, towns, counties, or similar extensive tracts of land. We shall also point out the most approved mode of surveying subterraneous works, as coal-pits, mines, &c., a subject which has hitherto been entirely neglected in works of this nature.\n\nBefore entering on the practical part of the subject, Surveying it may be proper to mention the previous knowledge which a surveyor ought to possess, and to notice the instruments which he is to employ in his operations.\n\nAs a surveyor has perpetual occasion for calculation, proper for it is necessary that he be familiar with the four first rules of ARITHMETIC, and the rule of PROPORTION, both in whole numbers, and in FRACTIONS, especially DECIMALS, with the nature of LOGARITHMS, and the use of LOGARITHMIC TABLES; and with, at least, ALGEBRAIC NOTATION. As it is his business to investigate and measure lines and angles, and to describe these on paper, he should be well acquainted with the elements of GEOMETRY and TRIGONOMETRY, and with the application of these principles to the MENSURATION OF HEIGHTS, DISTANCE, and SURFACES. In particular, he should be familiar with the best practical methods of solving the ordinary geometrical problems, and should be expert in drawing lines and describing figures. He should be acquainted with the principles and practice of LEVELLING; should know something of the principles of OPTICS and MAGNETISM, and should possess at least a smattering of the arts of DRAWING and PAINTING.\n\nThe instruments usually employed in surveying, have been enumerated under MENSURATION, vol. xiii. pp. 511, 519, and of these the chain, the plane-table, the cross, and the theodolite, are there sufficiently described, and the CIRCUMFERENCE, the COMPASS, LEVELS, the PERAMBULATOR, and PROTRACTORS, are described, and their uses explained under their proper heads in the general alphabet of this work.\n\nThe most simple methods of surveying, are those in which the chain or the plane-table are employed, and of these methods a general idea has been given under MENSURATION. It may be necessary in this place to describe a little more at large the use of the plane table, as this instrument is one of the most convenient for surveying fields, or other small plots of ground.\n\nIn preparing the plane table for use, a sheet of paper that will about cover the plane-table, is to be wetted, then spread flat on the table, the marginal frame of which for using is to be pressed down on its edges, so as to keep it smooth and even. On this paper thus stretched, the plan of the field or other plot is to be traced in the following manner.\n\nSuppose it be required to make a plan of a field that has the figure represented at A, B, C, D, E, F, fig. 1. Plate DXXV. and in such a situation, that all its angles are accessible.\n\nThe plane table is to be fixed at one of the angles, as at A, in the position represented at fig. 2, and its surface must be brought to a horizontal plane. A point is then to be made on the paper with a pencil, as at a, to represent the point A, where the plane table is stationed. Fixing a needle perpendicularly at this point, the index of the table is to be applied to the needle, on that side which corresponds with the sight vanes, and is to be turned round this point, sliding on the table, till the eye looking through the sights, perceives a mark set up at the point B. A line is now to be drawn from a along the edge of the index. In the same manner a line is to be drawn from a, marking the direction of the side AF. Thus the angle b af (fig. 2) will be similar to the angle BAF (fig. 1); the plane table is now to be removed from the point A, to another corner\nSurveying of the field, as B, and a pole or other mark is to be left at A. The length AB is to be measured by the chain, and a proportional length marked off on the paper, in the direction a, b, from a plotting scale, or scale of equal parts. Proceeding as at first, a line is to be drawn from b towards c, in the direction of the side BC, and marking the measure of the angle CBA. In this manner, by placing the plane table successively at each corner of the field or plot of ground, the outline figure of the whole will be transferred to the paper, and a, b, c, d, e, f, will be the plan of the field A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\nIf it be not convenient to place the plane table at the corners of the ground to be surveyed, the plan may be taken by placing the instrument anywhere within the area, as at E (fig. 3), in the middle of the field A, B, C, D. In this case we can readily find the direction of the lines EA, EB, EC, ED, and the angles which they form at the point E. By measuring the distances from E to the several angular points, and transferring the proportional distances from the plane scale upon the paper, and then joining the points thus found, there is easily traced the outline of the whole field.\n\nIt may happen that no part of the ground to be measured is accessible, except one line, as the line AE in the space A, B, C, D, E, F, G (fig. 4).\n\nIn this case, the plane table is to be fixed at the point A, of the base line AE, and a point made on some part of the paper at pleasure, to represent the station A, and the base line AE is in the usual manner to be ascertained and laid down. Then from the station A, the situation or direction of the points B, C, D, E, F, G, are to be observed through the sights of the index; and lines corresponding to the lines AB, AC, AD, AE, AF, AG, are to be laid down on the paper, but of an indefinite length. When this is done, great attention must be paid to preserve the table steady and perfectly horizontal. The length of the base line AE being determined, the table is now to be removed to the other extremity E, and so disposed that the base line on the paper may be exactly over the base line EA of the field; and proceeding as before, the directions of the lines EA, EB, EC, ED, EF, EG, are to be determined, and corresponding indefinite lines drawn on the paper. The points where these last lines cross those before traced, are to be carefully noted, and the outline joining all these points of section, will correspond to the outline of the plot to be surveyed.\n\nThe following general directions to be observed in using the plane table, are given by Dr Hutton. 1. Let the lines on which stations are made be directed towards objects as far distant as possible; and when any such object is set, go round the table and look through the sights from the other end of the index, to see if any other remarkable object be directly opposite; if there be none such, endeavour to find another forward object, such as shall have a remarkable backward opposite one, and make use of it, rather than the other; because the back object will be of use in fixing the table in the original position, either when you have measured too near to the forward object, or when it may be hid from your sight at any necessary station by intervening hedges, &c.\n\n2. Let the said lines, on which the stations are taken, be pursued as far as conveniently can be done; for that will be the means of preserving more accuracy in the Surveying work.\n\n3. At each station it will be necessary to prove the truth of it, that is, whether the table be straight in the line towards the object, and also whether the distance be rightly measured and laid down on the paper. To know whether the table be set down straight in the line, lay the index on the table in any manner, and move the table about, till through the sights you perceive either the fore or back object; then, without moving the table, go round it, and look through the sights by the other end of the index, to see if the other object can be perceived; if it be, the table is in the line; if not, it must be shifted to one side, according to your judgment, till through the sights both objects can be seen. The aforesaid observation only informs you if the station be straight in the line; but to know if it be in the right part of the line; that is, if the distance has been rightly laid down; fix the table in the original position, by laying the index along the station line, and turning the table about till the fore and back objects appear through the sights, and then also will the needle point at the same degree as at first. Then lay the index over the station point and any other point on the paper representing an object which can be seen from the station; and if the said object appear straight through the sights, the station may be depended on as right; if not, the distance should be examined and corrected till the object can be so seen. And for this very useful purpose, it is advisable to have some high object or two, which can be seen from the greatest part of the ground accurately laid down on the paper from the beginning of the survey, to serve continually as proof objects.\n\nWhen from any station, the fore and back objects cannot both be seen, the agreement of the needle with one of them may be depended on for placing the table straight on the line, and for fixing it in the original position.\n\nThe foregoing examples are extremely simple, as the Method of bounding lines are straight and regular. Here, therefore, measuring the offsets, or the perpendicular distances between a base line, and the several angles which it subtends. It seldom happens, however, that the work can be carried on in so regular a way, as the bounding lines, even of small pieces of ground, are generally more or less crooked.\n\nLet us suppose A, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, (fig. 5,) to be a crooked hedge, or other boundary of a piece of ground, and A B the general base line subtending its several angles. In measuring along this base, when the surveyor comes opposite to any of the bendings or corners of the fence, as at c, d, e, &c., he measures the perpendicular offsets c l, d m, e n, &c., either with the offset staff; or, if they are of considerable length, with the chain. These offsets are to be noted down, as will be explained immediately.\n\nWhen the offsets are not very large, their places may be determined pretty exactly by the eye, especially when assisted by laying down the offset staff in a direction perpendicular to the base, and opposite to the angles; but when the offsets are very large, their positions are best determined by the cross, or the plane table, in the following manner. In measuring along A B (fig. 5), when\nSurveying, when coming nearly opposite to \\( l \\), where an offset is likely to stand, the crofs or plane-table is there to be fixed, as at \\( c \\) in the line \\( A B \\), and its index is to be turned till the extremities of the base \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) can be seen through the sights, both backward and forward. Then looking along the crofs sights of the crofs, or the crofs line on the index of the plain table, it is easy to observe whether the station of the instrument be exactly opposite to the corner. If it be not, the instrument must be moved backward or forward along the line \\( A B \\), preserving the index in the same situation till the station and the point \\( l \\) be exactly opposite to each other. The exact measured distance between \\( A \\) and \\( c \\), is then to be noted and registered, and the measure of the offset \\( c l \\) is to be set down opposite to the former, and on the left hand of it, as the work is advancing from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\). In the opposite direction the offsets would of course appear on the right hand. In this method, no field book or register is usually necessary, but where the survey is more extensive, and where the theodolite or other complex instruments are required, it is necessary to have recourse to some method of registering the successive operations.\n\nThe field book employed on these occasions is variously constructed, according to the taste or particular object of the surveyor. The following is a specimen of the usual field book, as described by Dr Hutton.\n\n| Offsets and remarks on the left. | Stations, Bearings, and Distances. | Offsets and remarks on the right. |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| \\( O_1 \\)                        | \\( 105^\\circ 23' \\)               | \\( 25 \\) corner.                 |\n| \\( 92 \\)                         | \\( 73 \\)                          | \\( 248 \\) Brown's hedge.         |\n| Crofs a hedge, \\( 24 \\)          | \\( 610 \\)                         | \\( 35 \\)                         |\n| \\( 954 \\)                        | \\( 00 \\)                          |                                  |\n| \\( O_2 \\)                        | \\( 53^\\circ 10' \\)                | \\( 00 \\)                         |\n| House corner, \\( 51 \\)           | \\( 25 \\)                          | \\( 21 \\)                         |\n| \\( 120 \\)                        | \\( 34 \\)                          | \\( 734 \\)                        |\n| \\( 34 \\)                         | \\( 40 \\)                          | \\( 40 \\) a file.                 |\n| \\( O_3 \\)                        | \\( 67^\\circ 20' \\)                | \\( 35 \\)                         |\n| A brook, \\( 30 \\)                | \\( 248 \\)                         | \\( 639 \\)                        |\n| \\( 16 \\)                         | \\( 810 \\)                         | \\( 16 \\) a spring.               |\n| Footpath, \\( 18 \\)               | \\( 973 \\)                         | \\( 20 \\) a pond.                  |\n\nOf the three columns which compose this field book, the middle or principal column is for noting down the stations, angles, bearings and distances, as they are ascertained, and the columns on the right and left are for the offsets to the right and left of the principal course, which are placed against their corresponding distances in the middle column, as also for occasional remarks or memorandums, to which it may be useful to refer in drawing the plan of the surveyed lands.\n\nHere \\( O_1 \\) is the first station, where the angle or bearing is \\( 105^\\circ 23' \\). On the left, at 73 links in the distance or principal line, is an offset of 92; and at 610 an offset of 24 to a crofs hedge. On the right, at \\( c \\), or the beginning, an offset 25 to the corner of the field; at 248 Brown's boundary hedge commences; at 610 an offset 35; and at 945, the end of the first line; the \\( o \\) denotes its terminating in the hedge. And so on for the other stations. A line is drawn at the end of every station line, to prevent confusion.\n\nVarious improvements have been made on the field-book, especially by Mr Abraham Crocker, and Mr John Bodham. We shall give a specimen of each.\n\nFig. 6 represents a page of Mr Crocker's field-book, exhibiting a part of the survey of an estate called the Mill Estate; the outlines of which were surveyed with the theodolite, and the interior parts filled up with the chain. In this book the operations are noted down, so as to begin from the foot of the page, carrying them on upwards.\n\nIn surveying after this method, Mr Crocker advises to choose two or more eminences, as principal stations, and measure a general base line from one station to the other, noting each hedge, brook, or other remarkable object as it is passed by; measuring also such short perpendicular lines to such bends of hedges as may be near the base. From the extremities of this base-line, or from any convenient parts of it, the surveyor must proceed with other lines to some remarkable object situated towards the sides of the estate, without regarding the angles they make with the base-line or with one another, remembering to note every hedge, brook, or other object by which he passes. These lines, when laid down by intersections, will with the base-line form a principal triangle on the ground to be surveyed; several of which, if necessary, being thus laid down, the surveyor may proceed to form other smaller triangles and trapezoids, on the sides of the former; and so on till the several enclosures are finished.\n\nThis principal triangle being completed, and laid down on the rough plan paper, the parts, exterior as well as interior, are to be completed by smaller triangles and trapezoids.\n\nWhen the whole plan is laid down on paper, the contents of each part of the estate may be calculated by the methods already explained under MENSURATION.\n\nIn countries where the lands are enclosed with high hedges, and where many lanes or roads pass through an estate, a theodolite may be employed with advantage, in ascertaining the angles of such lands; and by these means an outline of the estate may be obtained, and the lane lines serve as the bases of such triangles and trapezoids as are necessary to fill up the interior parts.\n\nTo illustrate this method, let us take \\( AB \\) in the plan of the estate, (fig. 8.) for the principal base line. From \\( B \\) go off to the tree at \\( C \\), noting down in the field book every crofs hedge as you measure on, and from \\( C \\) measure back to \\( A \\), noting down everything remarkable, as before directed. This figure also illustrates the method of measuring the crofs lines, offsets, and interior parts and enclosures.\n\nFig. 7 represents a page from Mr Rodham's field-book. His method of procedure is as follows:—Like field-book Mr Crocker, he begins from the bottom of the page, fig. 7, and writes upwards; denoting the crofting of fences, by \\( g \\) lines.\nSurveying. lines drawn across the middle column, or only a part of such a line on the right and left opposite the figures, to avoid confusion, and the corners of fields, and other remarkable turnings in the fences, towards which offsets are taken, by lines joining like the fences, as will be best seen by comparing the specimen at fig. 7, with the plan at fig. 9.\n\nThe marks called \\(a, b, c, \\&c.\\) are best made in the fields, by making a small hole with a spade, and placing there a chip or small piece of wood, with the particular letter marked on it, to prevent one mark being taken for another, on any return to it, though in general the name of a mark is very easily seen, by referring in the book to the line in which it was made. After the small Italic letters have been gone through, the capitals may be next employed, and the Roman letters afterwards, and so on. Perhaps it would be preferable to distinguish the marks by figures.\n\nThe letters in the left hand corner at the beginning of each line, denote the mark or place measured from; and that at the right hand corner of the end, is the mark measured to. But when it is not convenient to go exactly from a mark, the place measured from is described such a distance from one mark towards another; and where a mark is not measured to, the exact place is ascertained by writing, turn to the right or left hand, such a distance to such a mark, it being always understood that those distances are taken in the chain line.\n\nThe characters used are \\(T\\) for turn to the right hand, \\(L\\) for turn to the left hand, and \\(A\\) placed over an offset, to show that it is not taken at right angles with the chain line, but in the line with some straight fence, being used chiefly when crossing their directions, and is a better mode of ascertaining their true places than by offsets at right angles.\n\nWhen a line is measured whose position is determined, either by former operations (as in the case of producing a given line or measuring from one known place or mark to another) or by itself (as in the third side of a triangle) it is called a fixed line, and a double line is drawn across the book at the conclusion of it; but if its position be not determined (as in the second side of a triangle) it is called a loose line, and a single line is drawn across the book. When a line becomes determined in position, and is afterwards continued, a double line is drawn half through the book.\n\nWhen a loose line is measured, it becomes absolutely necessary to measure some line that will determine its position. Thus, the first line \\(ab\\), (fig. 9.) being the base of a triangle, is always determined, till the third side \\(j b\\) is measured; then the triangle may be constructed, and the position of both is determined.\n\nAt the beginning of a line to fix a loose line to the mark or place measured from, the sign of turning to the right or left hand must be added (as at \\(j\\) in the third line); otherwise a stranger, when laying down the work, may as easily construct the triangle \\(h j b\\), on the wrong side of the line \\(a h\\), as on the right side; but this error cannot be committed, if the sign above named be carefully observed.\n\nIn choosing a line to fix a loose one, care must be taken that it does not make a very acute or obtuse angle, as in the triangle \\(p B r\\); by the angle at \\(B\\) being very obtuse, a small deviation from truth would make the error at \\(B\\) when constructed very considerable; but Surveying, by constructing the triangle \\(p B g\\), such a deviation is of no consequence.\n\nWhen the words leave off are written in the field book, it is to signify that the taking of offsets is from thence discontinued; and of course something is wanting between that and the next offset.\n\nThe general use of the theodolite in measuring separate plots, has been described under MENSURATION, directions for the use of this instrument are given by Mr Crocker, and apply to his theodolite, field book, exemplified at fig. 6, and the plan at fig. 10.\n\nSuppose the surveyor to plant his theodolite in the road \\(O 1\\), and having duly adjusted it, by placing its head exactly horizontal, by the levels; and letting the index part of the limb exactly at \\(360^\\circ\\); and by moving the whole head about till \\(360^\\circ\\) in the compass-box comes to the line in the north end of the needle; there fixing all fast, by the screw under the head, between the legs, he will have his instrument completely adjusted.\n\nThe theodolite thus adjusted, the surveyor sends one of his assistants forward as far as he can conveniently see how to measure a straight line, as at \\(O 2\\). Taking then his angle of observation, by his telescope, to the picket at that station, he finds it to be \\(60^\\circ\\) from the north part of his magnetic meridian line towards the east, which he enters in his field book, noting it with NE, as a memorandum on which side of the magnetic meridian it lies. He is now to fasten his limb to the other part of the head, by a screw for that purpose.\n\nHis chain-man having laid the chain in the direction to the picket \\(O 2\\), in order to measure the line, he makes such offsets to the right and left, in this first chain's length, as may be necessary. At his first station, he finds that on the right, the general road fence is 30 links, and also a moat of 40 links more, and 30 links broad; and that on the left of his station he has an offset of 10 links, all of which he must note in his field book. Proceeding forward on this line, he finds at 300 he has an offset of 25 on the right, where is a gate, which he has to notice; and, on the left 20, which determines the breadth of the road at that spot. At 400, he will find 10 on the right and 20 on the left to be the breadth; and at 700 (the end of the line) he will find 35 on the right and 15 on the left to be the breadth of the road; where also he will find a small road branching off to the right. Thus the first station line is finished.\n\nTo this spot (which is his second station) he brings the theodolite; and after setting it level, he unlocks the under screw, and turns the whole head about, till, through the telescope, he sees the back picket or station staff to be cut by the cross hairs. Here, again, locking the head of his theodolite firm by the under screw, he must unscrew the limb, and turn it about, till through the telescope, he has a view of the picket at \\(O 3\\); the bearing of which he will find to be \\(253^\\circ 10'\\) from the north to the eastward, which he will enter in his field book. Measuring on from \\(O 2\\), towards \\(O 3\\), he will find at 130 links, that he is come to a turnpike, where the breadths at the right and left are 30 and 15. At 200, he has an offset of 15 on the left, and a break off at the right of another road, at 25 from his line, with two other offsets, as expressed in the field book. It must\nSurveying must be noted where this road leads to. At 263 he has offsets of 30 on the left, and 20 on the right. Thus ends the second station line.\n\nNow bringing his instrument to O3, he is to adjust it in the manner before directed at O2; and turning the limb about towards the picket forward, he will find the angle of bearing to be $57^\\circ 45'$, still from the north to the eastward. At 20 links he will be opposite to a cross hedge on the left, belonging to the estate he is surveying. At 293 he ends the line of this station, where the offsets are 5 and 35, as noted in the field book.\n\nComing next to O4, and having adjusted his theodolite, he finds his next angle = $226^\\circ$ NE. At 120 his offsets are 20 and 15. At 410, they are 15 and 35, where, on the left, is a cross hedge, of a backward direction. At 480 his offsets are 5 and 25, where is another cross hedge. At 750, there is a break-in of the fence, and the offsets are 30 and 15 on the left, and 10 on the right. At 1050, the offsets are 20 on each hand, and another cross hedge on the left. At 1150 are offsets of 20 and 423, where stands a house. At 1300, the offset of 30 on the right terminates the house; and at 5 on the left is a cross hedge, of a backward direction. 1350 ends this line, where roads diverge to the right and left.\n\nAt O5, the instrument being adjusted, the angle is found to be $284^\\circ 50'$ nearly W. At 50, his offset to the hedge is 15; at 220 it is also 15, where is a cross hedge, the other end of which was noted at 1050 in the last line. At 320 the offset is 25; at 350, the end of the O, the distance from the fence is 15.\n\nAt O6, the bearing is $305^\\circ 35'$ N.W. At 130 the offset is 30, where a cross hedge goes off to the point which was noted at 750, in the line from O4 to O5. At 160 the line is nearly close to the fence, ending at 210.\n\nAt O7, the angle forward is $106^\\circ 25'$ N.W. The line is 143 long, with an offset at the end of 15.\n\nAt O8 the bearing is $260^\\circ 20'$ N.W. At 100 and at 300 the offsets are 15 and 10.\n\nThe bearing at O9 is $70^\\circ 45'$ S.W. At 30 the measurer finds it expedient to cross the fence, and proceed within the bounds of the estate. At 90 he has an offset of 30 to the right, where he crosses a hedge. At 880 he crosses another hedge, having there an offset of 20; at 940 is an offset of 50. At 990 he again crosses the hedge; and at 1020 is an offset of 20 to the left; at 1040 he again crosses the hedge; at 1080 he comes to the corner of the farm house; and 1165 ends his line, where is a small curve at the right.\n\nAt O10, the bearing is $204^\\circ$ S.W. At 70 is an offset of 5 at the right: at 200 is 15 at the left, and a cross hedge: at 600 is 25 on the left, and 20+15 on the right: 600 ends the line, where are 15 on each side, where there is also a cross hedge.\n\nThe angle at O11 is $355^\\circ 30'$ S.E. At 280 is an offset of 30 on the right, and 10 with a cross hedge on the left: at 400 is an offset of 30, and another cross hedge on the left; and 470 ends the line, where are offsets of 10 and 20 on the right and the left.\n\nAt O12 the angle is $155^\\circ$ S.E. At 60 is a cross hedge: at 219 the offsets are 10 and 15; and at 229 he comes to close his work at O1, from which he set out.\n\nHaving thus taken the circuit of this estate, the measurer must proceed to plot the same on paper, with some convenient scale*. The scale usually employed for this purpose is that called the plotting scale, plane scale, or scale of equal parts, represented at fig. 11 and 12. This instrument contains different scales or divided lines, on both sides. There are on one side a number of plane scales, or scales of equal divisions, each of a different number to the inch, and also scales of chords for laying down angles, and sometimes the degrees of a circle marked on one edge, answering to a centre marked on the opposite edge, by which means it also answers the purpose of a protractor. There are several diagonal scales on the other side, of different sizes, or different dimensions to the inch, serving to take off lines expressed by numbers to three dimensions, as units, tens, hundreds, as also a scale of divisions which are the 100th parts of a foot. The most useful of all the lines which can be laid down on this instrument, though not always done, is a plane scale on the two opposite edges, made thin for the purpose. This line is very useful in surveying; for by laying down the instrument on paper, with its divided edge along a line wherein several distances are to be laid off, for the places of offsets, &c.; these distances are all transferred at once from the instrument to the line on the paper, by making small points or marks against the respective divisions on the edge of the scale.\n\nThe business of plotting or laying down a plan of an estate from the memoranda of a field book, is a very important branch of the surveyor's office. This will best be understood by an example, which we shall take also from Mr Crocker. It is adapted to the page of his field book, already alluded to; and the plan, when completed, is seen at fig. 10.\n\nThe vellum or paper on which the plan is to be drawn, being smoothly laid on a drawing board, the magnetic meridian is to be represented by a line drawn from the bottom to the top.\n\nA point is to be made about the middle of this line, on which is to be laid the centre of the circular protractor, placing the straight edge in such a manner as to coincide with the said meridian line: draw a pencil line around at the edge of the protractor.\n\nThe protractor being thus placed, and firmly fixed by means of pins in that position, or by a lead weight, the field book is to be inspected for the quantity of angle at O1, which, in the present case is stated at $69^\\circ$ north-easterly. This degree is then to be looked for on the circular edge of the protractor, and a mark made on the paper with a fine plotting-pin, at that number, which is to be marked 1, denoting O1.\n\nThe field-book is then to be inspected for the angle at O2, which in this case is $253^\\circ 10'$, where a mark is to be made as before.\n\nA similar process is to be followed with all the other angles, till the surveyor comes to the close on O1.\n\nAll the angles being thus marked off, the protractor is to be removed.\n\nThe place where the beginning of the work should be placed is then to be considered, that the whole may come within the compass of the paper laid down; where a mark is to be made, noting it as O1, the beginning of the plot.\n\nThe fore edge of the parallel ruler is then laid from\nSurveying: the central point where the protractor lay, to the mark on the pencilled circle denoting \\( \\odot 1 \\). The fore edge of the parallel ruler is next moved till it touch the point determined on for the beginning of the plot, from which a pencil line in the direction from the north to the eastward, is drawn, about the length of the whole line of this \\( \\odot = 760 \\).\n\nA feather-edge scale is applied to this pencil or obscure line, the division of it at the beginning, marking off every progressive number where any offsets have been made, as at 300, 400, and 760.\n\nThe scale is then turned across the line (by some cross division), and the offsets on each side of the station line are pricked off. At \\( \\odot \\) or \\( \\odot 1 \\), the field book shows that on the left hand, at 15 links, is the boundary line of that side, where there is likewise a small road branching off. The offset on the right hand is 30, which, with +40, goes to the extent of a small corner, also 40 links in breadth. At 300 on the left there is an offset of 20, and on the right another of 25, where there is also a gate to be noticed. At 760 there is an offset on the left of 15; and on the right, one of 35, where a small roadway branches off. All these offsets are to be pricked off as the surveyor proceeds. The boundary lines are drawn through these offset points, and in this manner the first station is completed.\n\nThe parallel ruler is then laid from the centre to the angular point of \\( \\odot 2 \\); the limb of it is moved till it touches the end of the last station line, from which another obscure line is drawn, from the north-easterly, as noted in the field book.\n\nThe edge of the scale is then applied as before, and the numbers 30, 200, and 265 are pricked off. There is a toll gate at 30 links, and a lane of 30 links broad, going off at an acute angle. At 265, the end of this station, the offsets are 30 and 10.\n\nThe line from \\( \\odot 3 \\) is then laid off, as before directed, north-easterly, and the numbers 20 and 293 are pricked off. Opposite to 20 is a hedge branching off to the left, and at 293 the offsets are 35 and 5.\n\nThe line north-easterly is laid off from \\( \\odot 4 \\), and the numbers on that line are pricked off as they appear in the field book, and the offsets are made as follows. At 120, 15 and 20 are set off; at 410 are 30 and 15, where two hedges branch off nearly in the direction of the side sketches. At 480 the offsets are 25 and 5, where there is a cross hedge on the left. At 750 on the left, is 30+15 with a cross hedge, and on the right 10. At 1250 on the left, is 20 with a cross hedge, and 20 on the right. At 1150 on the right, is 20+20, where stands a house. At 1300 on the left, is 5 with a cross hedge; on the right is 30, with a road branching from it: 1350 completes this line.\n\nAt \\( \\odot 5 \\) the work takes another direction, and goes backward towards the west. The ruler is laid from the centre to this station, and an obscure line drawn in the direction mentioned. The distances and offsets are pricked off as in the field book. Here are offsets on one side only, not being in a road way.\n\nAt \\( \\odot 6 \\) set off the line south-westernly, pricking off the distances and offsets as in the field-book.\n\nThis specimen is sufficient to give a complete idea of the practice of plotting; and more would be only a tedious repetition. It must, however, be observed, that the accuracy and facility of the work greatly depend on Surveying the judgement and care exercised in keeping a correct and clear field-book.\n\nWhen a circuit is plotted off, the measurer must fill up the interior, by separately completing the measure of each field with the chain, so that they may be laid down on the plan in their proper situations and dimensions. The lines taken with the theodolite will here be of great service, as the base lines of a number of interior angles.\n\nThe surveyor having thus on paper, a representation of the estate, must draw such measuring lines on it, as will enable him to calculate the content of each field separately. Having made out a fair plot of his work, another line must be drawn for the true meridian, to the eastward of the former, according to the variation of the magnetic needle, where the estate lies. On this true meridian line may be placed any device whatever, as a north point. A title must also be given to the map, a scale drawn of the proportion used in the plotting, and a border to the whole.*\n\nHaving thus explained the general practice of surveying according to the latest improvements, we shall shew how a surveyor is to proceed in measuring and planning counties and towns.\n\nTo survey a County or large Tract of Land.—1. Chuse Method of two, three, or four eminent places for stations, such as the tops of high hills or mountains, towers, or church steeples, which may be seen from one another, and from which most of the towns, and other places of note, may also be seen. And let them be as far distant from each other as possible. On these places raise beacons, or long poles, with flags of different colours flying at them, so as to be visible from all the other stations.\n\n2. At all the places which are to be set down in the map, plant long poles with flags at them of several colours, to distinguish the places from each other, fixing them on the tops of church steeples, or the tops of houses, or in the centres of smaller towns.\n\nIt is not necessary to have these marks at many places at once, as suppose ten at a time. For when the angles have been taken at the two stations, to all these places, the marks may be removed to new ones, and so successively to all the places required. These marks being set up at a convenient number of places, and such as may be seen from both stations, go to one of these stations, and with an instrument for taking angles, standing at that station, take all the angles between the other station, and each of these marks, observing which is blue, which red, &c., and on which hand they lie; and set all down with their colours. Next go to the other station, and take all the angles between the first station, and each of the former marks, and set them down with the rest, each against those corresponding with the same colour. If practicable, the angles may also be taken at some third station, which may serve to prove the work, if the three lines intersect in that point where any mark stands. The marks must be allowed to remain till the observations are finished at both stations, and then they must be taken down, and set up at fresh places. The same operations must be performed at both stations, for these fresh places, and the like for others. The instrument for taking angles must be exceedingly accurate, made on purpose with telegraphic sights,\nSurveying sights, and of three, four, or five feet radius. A circumferentor is reckoned a good instrument for this purpose.\n\n3. Though it be not absolutely necessary to measure any distance; because a stationary line being laid down from any scale, all the other lines will be proportional to it; yet it is better to measure some of the lines, to ascertain the distances of places in miles: and to know how many geometrical miles there are in any length; and from thence to make a scale for measuring any distance in miles. In measuring any distance, it will not be exact enough to go along the high roads, on account of their turnings and windings, and scarcely ever lying in a right line between the stations, which would cause endless reductions, and create trouble to make it a right line, for which reason it can never be exact. But a better way is to measure in a right line with a chain, between station and station, over hills and dales, or level fields, and all obstructions. Only in cases of water, woods, towns, rocks, banks, &c. where one cannot pass, such parts of the line must be measured by the method of inaccessible distances; and besides, allowing for ascents and descents, when we meet with them. A good compass that shows the bearing of two stations, will always direct to go straight, when the two stations are not seen; but when a straight progress can be made, offsets may be taken to any remarkable places, likewise noting the intersection of the stationary line, with all roads, rivers, &c.\n\n4. From all the stations, and in the whole progress, care must be taken to observe sea coasts, the mouths of rivers, towns, castles, houses, churches, windmills, watermills, trees, rocks, lands, roads, bridges, fords, ferries, woods, hills, mountains, rills, brooks, parks, beacons, sluices, floodgates, locks, &c. and in general every thing remarkable.\n\n5. When the first and main station lines are done, which command the whole country, inner stations are then to be taken at some places already determined, which will divide the whole into several partitions, and from these stations may be determined the places of as many of the remaining towns as possible. If any remain in that part, more stations may be taken at some places already determined, from which the rest may be determined. Proceeding thus through all parts of the country, station may be taken after station, till all that are required be determined. In general, the station distances must always pass through such remarkable points as have been formerly determined by the preceding stations.\n\n6. The position of the station line measured, or the point of the compass on which it lies, must be determined by astronomical observation. Hang up a thread and plummet in the sun over some part in the station line, observing when the shadow runs along that line, and at that moment take the sun's altitude; then having his declination, and the latitude, the azimuth will be found by spherical trigonometry. The azimuth is the angle which the station line makes with the meridian, and therefore a meridian may easily be drawn through the map; or a meridian may be drawn through it by hanging up two threads in a line with the pole star, when due north, which may be known from astronomical tables. Or thus: Observe the star Alioth, or that in the rump of the Great Bear, being that next the square; or else Cassiopeia's hip; observing by a line and plummet when either of these stars and the pole star comes into a perpendicular; and at that time they are due north. Therefore two perpendicular lines being fixed at that moment, towards these two stars, will give the position of the meridian.\n\nA Town or City may be surveyed with any of the instruments for taking angles, but best of all with the plane table, where every minute part is drawn while in sight. It is also proper to have a chain of 50 feet long, divided into 10 links, and an offset-staff of 10 feet long.\n\nBegin at the meeting of two or more of the principal streets through which the longest station lines may be had, to get the longest station lines. Having there fixed the instrument, draw lines of direction along those streets, using two men as marks, or poles set in wooden pedestals, or perhaps some remarkable places in the houses at the farther ends, as windows, doors, corners, &c. Measure these lines with the chain, taking offsets with the staff, at all corners of streets, bendings, or windings, and to all remarkable objects, as churches, markets, halls, colleges, eminent houses, &c. Then remove the instrument to another station along one of these lines, and there repeat the same process as before, and so on till the whole be completed.\n\nThus, in fig. 13. (part of the New Town of Edinburgh) fix the instrument at A, and draw lines in the direction of all the streets meeting in that place, and measure AB, noting the street on the left at m. At the second station B, draw the directions of the streets meeting there, and measure CD. Do the same at D, and measure DE, noting the place of the cross streets at p. In this manner go through all the principal streets. This being done, proceed to the smaller and intermediate streets; and lastly to the lanes, alleys, courts, yards, &c., and every part which it may be deemed expedient to re-surveying present.\n\nWe shall conclude this article with a few practical remarks on subterraneous surveying, or the method of surveying mines, and other works below ground, taken chiefly from Mr. Fenwick's work on subterraneous surveying, lately published.\n\nThe instruments employed in surveying under ground, are the circumferentor, the chain (in coal mines) containing 100 links, and an instrument for taking the angles of elevation or depression, to reduce the measurements to horizontal distances, where the lines are not level. In lead mines, they sometimes employ a cord, divided into 10 feet, instead of a chain.\n\nIn conducting a subterraneous survey, the instrument used is placed where the survey is intended to commence, and a person goes forward in the direction of the line to be surveyed, holding a lighted candle in his hand, to the remotest point at which his light can be seen through the sights of the instrument; its bearing is then taken by the circumferentor, and noted down in the survey book. The surveyor then proceeds to take the distance of the light, or object, from the instrument, which is afterwards removed, and a person stands on the spot where it stood, holding one end of the chain in his hand, while another, going towards the object, holds the other end, together with a lighted candle, in the same hand, and being directed by the former, till the hand holding the candle\nSurveying: candle and the chain is in a direct line with the object or light whose bearing was taken. At that place, the first chain is marked. The person who stood where the instrument was placed then comes forward to the mark at the end of the first chain, the other advancing forward another chain, with the chain and candle in the same hand, as before directed: here the second chain is to be marked. Proceeding in this manner till the distance of the object be determined, which being noted down in chains and links in the survey book, opposite to the bearing, the first bearing and distance is completed. Fixing the instrument again where the light as an object stood, or at the termination of the foregoing bearing and distance, and taking the second bearing, by directing the person to go forward as before, so far as his light can be seen, or at any convenient distance, the surveyor is to proceed as before, till the whole is completed.\n\nSuch surveys would require five people to be employed, that the work may be expeditiously performed; viz. one to carry forward the survey, and make the requisite observations and remarks; another to carry the instruments employed; another to direct the chain; a fourth person to lead it, and a fifth to go forward with a light, as an object, from one station to another. During the time of making the survey, care must be taken not to admit any iron or steel within four feet of the instrument, for fear of attracting the needle, which has been known to be affected at nearly three times that distance, by a malleable piece of iron. If the glass of the instrument should require cleaning, it must be rubbed as gently as possible, and not with any silken substance, by means of which electric matter may be excited, and prevent the needle from traversing. Should such matter be excited, it may be discharged by touching the surface of the glass with a wet finger.\n\nTo render this system of surveying familiar to the young miner, it would be necessary for him to put up a number of marks on the surface, taking afterwards their bearing and distance from each other, according to the method before directed; but to make a nearer approach to the form of subterranean surveying, it would be better to perform it at night, by the assistance of candles; and many evenings might be found favourable for this method of practising. Lanterns may be employed, if the current of air should be too strong for the flame of a candle.\n\nThe method of surveying and recording bearings is as follows,\n\nSuppose the bearing of ABC (fig. 14) is required. Set the circumferentor on A (the north being represented by N, and the south by S); then turning that part of the instrument having the fleur de lis, or other device, from you, or towards B, turn the instrument till the object B is seen through, and cut by the hair in the sights; and the angle NBA being the angle that the sights and line AB make with the magnetic meridian, NS will be the bearing of B from A, suppose 35°; which also being to the right side of the north meridian, will be north 35° east. Then bring the instrument forward to B, fixing it there, and directing the same sight at B towards C, as was directed at A, towards B; then observe the angle that BC makes with the magnetic meridian, which suppose 25° NBC; and being to the left of the meridian, will be north 25° west. To Surveying, prove the work, and try the accuracy of the instrument when it is standing at B, apply the eye to that sight which was next B when it stood at A; then take the bearing of A from B, which, if found to be the reverse of B from A, shows the work to be so far true. The bearing of B being taken in like manner from C, will prove the truth of the survey. The degrees of each bearing must always be taken by the same end of the needle.\n\nSuppose the bearing of B from A, C from B, and D from C, (fig. 15.) be required. Fix the instrument at A, with the fleur de lis, or other arbitrary device, towards B; then take the bearing of B, as before described, which suppose to make an angle of 30° NAB to the right with the magnetic meridian, or north 30° east; let the instrument be removed to B, and take the bearing of C, which suppose 30° NBC to the left, or north 30° west; then remove the instrument to C, and take the bearing of D, which suppose 65° SCD to the left, or south 65° east. Thus,\n\nFrom A to B north 30° east.\n— B to C north 30° west.\n— C to D south 65° east.\n\nThis survey may be proved in the same manner as the preceding.\n\nSuppose the subterraneous working ABCDA (fig. 16.) to be surveyed, beginning at the pit A: Fix the instrument at the centre of the pit A; then let a person hold a lighted candle at B (being the utmost distance at which it can be seen through the sights of the instrument), the bearing of which being taken from A, suppose due south, or in the direction of the magnetic meridian of A, and its distance from A suppose 6 chains 57 links, which is placed in the survey book as under:\n\nRemove the instrument to B, where the candle stood, and direct the person to place the lighted candle at C; then take its bearing from B, which suppose it to make an angle CBS = 80° with the magnetic meridian, or to bear south 80° west, and its distance being found 7 chains 10 links, remove the instrument to C, the candle being removed to D; then take its bearing and distance as before, which suppose north 10° west 5 chains; remove the instrument to D, and direct the candle to be placed at the centre of the pit A, where the survey commenced; then take its bearing from D, north 70° east 8 chains 35 links, and the survey is finished.\n\n| Chains | Links |\n|--------|-------|\n| AB     | south | 6     | 57    |\n| BC     | south | 80    | west  | 7     | 10    |\n| CD     | north | 10    | west  | 5     | 0     |\n| DA     | north | 70    | east  | 8     | 35    |\n\nThis survey may be proved by adding together the degrees contained in the interior angles, which, if they amount to 360°, the work will be right.\n\nThe proof may be made by finding the northings, southerings, eastings and westings of all the bearings and distances. If the northings are equal to the southerings, and the eastings equal to the westings, then will the work be right.\n\nThus,\nThe southings and northings therefore being equal, as also the eastings and westings, the work is thus proved to be right.\n\nMr Fenwick gives the following directions for planning subterraneous surveys, and for determining errors that may arise in plotting, through inattention to the magnetic variation.\n\nAs the magnetic meridian is always changing, the bearings of the same object, taken by such a meridian at different times, must also vary from each other, except reduced to bearings with the true meridian. Let NS (fig. 17.) represent the meridian of a plan, which is also supposed to be the true meridian; and if a subterraneous excavation is to be plotted on it from the pit A, and this excavation is found to form a bearing of north 10° west 10 chains, by an instrument whose needle had 23° of west variation; now if the excavation north 10° west 10 chains be plotted on the plan by its meridian NS, which is the true meridian, it will be represented by AB; but the bearing being taken by a needle having 23° of west variation, it should form a bearing of north 30° west with the meridian NI, as represented by A b; then A b will be the true direction of the excavation from the pit A, and b will be the magnitude of the error. Or, instead of reducing the excavation to its bearing with the true meridian NI, it will be equally as true if NS is drawn on the plan, and made to represent the magnetic meridian of the needle by which the bearing was taken, with which AB will form a bearing of north 10° west.\n\nWe shall add a few examples illustrative of the error arising from plotting a subterraneous survey on a plan, without attending to the variation of the magnetic meridian, and also how its magnitude can be ascertained.\n\nExample I.—The following is a subterraneous survey, commencing at a pit called the B pit, north 30° west 6 chains, north 70° east 10 chains, north 30° east 5 chains, and north 25° west 8 chains, which was surveyed by an instrument whose needle had 24° of west variation; under what bearings must the survey be plotted on a plan whose delineated meridian has 15° of west variation?\n\nReduce the bearings, as taken by a meridian having 24° of west variation, to bearings with a meridian having 15° of west variation: thus,\n\n| Northings | Southings | Eastings | Westings |\n|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|\n| Thus, S.  | C.

By reversions are meant payments not to take place till some future period. Survivorship forms one of the most difficult and complicated parts of the doctrine of reversions and life-annuities. It has been very fully treated of by Mr Thomas Simpson in his Select Exercises, and considerably improved by Dr Price and Mr Morgan, who have bestowed a great deal of attention on this subject; though some parts of their principles are erroneous.\n\nThe calculations are founded on the expectation of lives at different ages, deduced from tables formed from bills of mortality, of which see several examples under the article Bills of MORTALITY. By the expectation of life is meant the mean time that any single or joint lives at a given age is found to continue; that is, the number of years which, taking one with another, they actually enjoy, and may be considered as sure of enjoying; those who survive that period enjoying as much more time in proportion to their number as those who fall short of it enjoy less. Thus, supposing 46 persons alive all 40 years of age, and that one will die every year till they are all dead in 46 years, half 46 or 23 will be the expectation of each of them. If M. de Moivre's hypothesis were true, that men always decrease in an arithmetical progression, the expectation of a single life is always half its complement (A), and the expectation of two joint lives one-third of their common complement. Thus, supposing a man 40, his expectation would be 23, the half of 46, his complement; the expectation of two joint lives, each 40, would be 15 years 4 months, or the third part of 46.\n\nThe number expressing the expectation, multiplied by the number of single or joint lives (of which it is the expectation), added annually to a society, gives the whole number living together, to which such an annual addition would in time grow. Thus, since 19, or the third of 57, is the expectation of two joint lives, whose common age is 29, twenty marriages every year between persons of this age would in 57 years grow to 20 times 19.\n\n(A) By the complement of a life is meant what it wants of 86, which M. de Moivre makes the boundary of human life. Thus if a man be 30, the complement of his life is 56.\nSurvivorship.\n\n19, or 380 marriages, always existing together. And since the expectation of a single life is always half its complement, in 57 years 20 single persons added annually to a town will increase to 20 times 28.5, or 570; and when arrived at this number, the deaths every year will just equal the accretions, and no farther increase be possible. It appears from hence, that the particular proportion that becomes extinct every year, out of the whole number constantly existing together of single or joint lives, must, wherever this number undergoes no variation, be exactly the same with the expectation of those lives, at the time when their existence commenced. Thus, it was found that a 19th part of all the marriages among any bodies of men, whose numbers do not vary, are dissolved every year by the deaths of either the husband or wife, it would appear that 19 was, at the time they were contracted, the expectation of these marriages. In like manner, was it found in a society, limited to a fixed number of members, that a 28th part dies annually out of the whole number of members, it would appear that 28 was their common expectation of life at the time they entered. So likewise, were it found in any town or district, where the number of births and burials are equal, that a 20th or 30th part of the inhabitants die annually, it would appear that 20 or 30 was the expectation of a child just born in that town or district. These expectations, therefore, for all single lives, are easily found by a table of observations, showing the number that die annually at all ages out of a given number alive at those ages; and the general rule for this purpose is, to divide the sum of all the living in the table, at the age whose expectation is required, and at all greater ages, by the sum of all that die annually at that age and above it; or, which is the same, by the number (in the Table) of the living at that age; and half unity subtracted from the quotient will be the required expectation. Thus, in Dr Halley's table, given in the article ANNUITY, the sum of all the living at 20 and upwards is 20,724, which, divided by 598, the number living at the age of 20, and half unity subtracted from the quotient, gives 34.15 for the expectation of 20.\n\nIn calculating the value or expectation of joint lives, M. de Moivre had recourse to the hypothesis, that the probabilities of life decrease in a geometrical progression; believing that the values of joint lives, obtained by rules derived from it, would not deviate much from the truth. But in this he was greatly mistaken; they generally give results which are near a quarter of the true value too great in finding the present value of one life after it has survived another in a single payment, and about two-fifths too great when the value is sought in annual payments during the joint lives. They ought therefore to be calculated on the hypothesis (if they are calculated on hypotheses at all), that the probabilities of life decrease in arithmetical progression, which is not very far from the truth. Even this hypothesis never corresponds with the fact in the first and last periods of life, and in some situations not in any period of life. Dr Price and Mr Morgan therefore have given tables of the value of lives, not founded on any hypothesis, but deduced from bills of mortality themselves. Some of these we shall give at the end of this article. Mr Morgan has likewise given rules for calculating values of lives in this manner.\n\nM. de Moivre has also fallen into mistakes in his rules for calculating the value of reverberations depending on survivorship: these have been pointed out by Dr Price in the third essay in the first volume of his Treatise on Reversionary Payments; who has also given proper rules for calculating these values, the most important of which are comprehended in the following paragraphs.\n\nSuppose a set of married men to enter into a society in Method of order to provide annuities for their widows, and that it is found the number limited to a certain number of members, and constantly annuitants kept up to that number by the admission of new members that will be the old ones are lost; it is of importance, in the course of a first place, to know the number of annuitants that after society, some time will come upon the establishment. Now since every marriage produces either a widow or widower; and since all marriages taken together would produce as many widows as widowers, were every man and his wife of the same age, and the chance equal which shall die first; it is evident, that the number of widows that have ever existed in the world, would in this case be equal to half the number of marriages. And what would take place in the world must also, on the same suppositions, take place in this society. In other words, every other person in such a society leaving a widow, there must arise from it a number of widows equal to half its own number. But this does not determine what number, all living at one and the same time, the society may expect will come to be constantly on it. It is, therefore, necessary to determine how long the duration of survivorship between persons of equal ages will be, compared with the duration of marriage. And the truth is, that, supposing the probabilities of life to decrease uniformly, the former is equal to the latter; and consequently that the number of survivors, or (which is the same, supposing no second marriages) of widows and widowers alive together, which will arise from any given set of such marriages constantly kept up, will be equal to the whole number of marriages; or half of them (the number of widows in particular) equal to half the number of marriages. Now it appears that in most towns the decrease in the probabilities of life is in fact nearly uniform. According to the Breslaw Table of Observations (see ANNUITY), almost the same numbers die every year from 20 years of age to 77. After this, indeed, fewer die, and the rate of decrease in the probabilities of life is retarded. But this deviation from the hypothesis is inconsiderable; and its effect, in the present case, is to render the duration of survivorship longer than it would otherwise be. According to the London Table of Observations, the numbers dying every year begin to grow less at 50 years of age; and from hence to extreme old age there is a constant retardation in the decrease of the probabilities of life. Upon the whole, therefore, it appears that, according to the Breslaw Table, and supposing no widows to marry, the number inquired after is somewhat greater than half the number of the society; but, according to the London Table, a good deal greater. This, however, has been determined on the supposition that the husbands and wives are of equal ages, and that there is an equal chance who shall die first. But in reality husbands are generally older than wives, and males have been found to die sooner than females, as appears incontestably from several of the tables in Dr Price's Treatise on Reverberations. It is therefore more than an equal chance that the husband will die before his wife. This will increase considerably the duration of\nSurvivorship on the part of the women, and consequently the number which we have been inquiring after. The marriage of widows will diminish this number, but not so much as the other causes will increase it.\n\nIf the society comprehends in it from the first all the married people of all ages in any town, or among any class of people where the numbers always continue the same, the whole collective body of members will be at their greatest age at the time of the establishment of the society; and the number of widows left every year will at a medium be always the same. The number of widows will increase continually on the society, till as many die every year as are added. This will not be till the whole collective body of widows are at their greatest age, or till there are among them the greatest possible number of the oldest widows; and therefore not till there has been time for an accession to the oldest widows from the youngest part.\n\nLet us, for the sake of greater precision, divide the whole medium of widows that come on every year into different classes according to their different ages, and suppose some to be left at 50 years of age, some at 46, some at 36, and some at 26. The widows, constantly in life together, derived from the first class, will come to their greatest age, and to a maximum, in 30 years, supposing, with M. de Moivre, 86 to be the utmost extent of life. The same will happen to the second class in 40 years, and to the third in 50 years. But the whole body composed of these classes will not come to a maximum till the same happens to the fourth or youngest class; that is, not till the end of 60 years. After this the affairs of the society will become stationary, and the number of annuitants on it of all ages will keep always nearly the same.\n\nIf a society begins with its complete number of members, but at the same time admits none above a particular age: If, for instance, it begins with 200 members all under 50, and afterwards limits itself to this number, and keeps it up by admitting every year, at all ages between 26 and 50, new members as old ones drop off; in this case, the period necessary for bringing on the maximum of annuitants will be just doubled.\n\nTo determine the sum that every individual ought to pay in a single present payment, in order to intitle his widow to a certain annuity for her life, let us suppose the annuity 3l. per annum, and the rate of interest four per cent. It is evident, that the value of such an expectation is different, according to the different ages of the purchasers, and the proportion of the age of the wife to that of the husband. Let us then suppose that every person in such a society is of the same age with his wife, and that one with another all the members when they enter may be reckoned 40 years of age, as many entering above this age as below it. It has been demonstrated by M. de Moivre and Mr Simpson, that the value of an annuity on the joint continuance of any two lives, subtracted from the value of an annuity on the life in expectation, gives the true present value of annuity on what may happen to remain of the latter of the two lives after the other.\n\nIn the present case, the value of an annuity to be enjoyed during the joint continuance of two lives, each 40, is, by Table II. 9.826, according to the probabilities of life in the Table of Observations formed by Dr Halley from the bills of mortality of Breslaw in Silesia.\n\nThe value of a single life 40 years of age, as given by M. de Moivre, agreeably to the same table, is 13.20; and the former (subtracted from the latter, leaves 3.37; or the true number of years purchase, which ought to be paid for any given annuity, to be enjoyed by a person 40 years of age, provided he survives another person of the same age, interest being reckoned at four per cent. per annum. The annuity, therefore, being 30l., the present value of it is 30 multiplied by 3.37; or 101.1.\n\nIf, instead of a single present payment, it is thought preferable to make annual payments during the marriage; what the annual payments ought to be is easily determined by finding what annual payments during two joint lives of given ages are equivalent to the value of the reverification annuity in present money. Suppose, as before, that the joint lives are each 40, and the reverification annuity 30l. per annum. An annual payment during the continuance of two such lives is worth (according to Table II.) 9.82 years purchase. The annual payment ought to be such as, being multiplied by 9.82, will produce 101.1, the present value of the annuity in one payment. Divide then 101.1 by 9.82, and 10.3 the quotient will be the annual payment. This method of calculation supposes that the first annual payment is not to be made till the end of a year. If it is to be made immediately, the value of the joint lives will be increased one year's purchase; and therefore, in order to find the annual payments required, the value of a present single payment must be divided by the value of the joint lives increased by unity. If the society prefer paying part of the value in a present single payment on admission, and the rest in annual payments; and if they fix these annual payments at a particular sum, the present single payment paid on admission is found by subtracting the value of the annual payment during the joint lives from the whole present value of the annuity in one payment. Suppose, for instance, the annual payments to be fixed at five guineas, the annuity to be 30l., the rate of interest four per cent. and the joint lives each 40; the value of the annuity in one present single payment is 101.1. The value of five guineas or 5.25 per annum, is (5.25 multiplied by 9.82 the value of the joint lives) 51.55; which, subtracted from 101.1, gives 49.5l. the answer.\n\nIf a society takes in all the marriages among persons of a particular profession within a given district, and subjects them for perpetuity to a certain equal and common tax or annual payment, in order to provide life annuities for all the widows that shall result from these marriages; since, at the commencement of such an establishment, all the oldest, as well as the youngest, marriages are to be intitled equally to the proposed benefit, a much greater number of annuitants will come immediately on it than would come on any similar establishment which limited itself in the admission of members to persons not exceeding a given age. This will check that accumulation of money which should take place at first, in order to produce an income equal to the disbursements at the time when the number of annuitants comes to a maximum; and therefore will be a particular burden upon the establishment in its infancy. For this some compensation must be provided; and the equitable method of providing it is, by levying fines at the beginning of the establishment on every member exceeding...\nSuppose we wish to know the present value of an annuity to be enjoyed by one life, for what may happen to remain of it beyond another life, after a given term; that is, provided both lives continue from the present time to the end of a given term of years; the method of calculating is this: Find the value of the annuity for two lives, greater by the given term of years than the given lives; discount this value for the given term; and then multiply by the probability, that the two given lives shall both continue the given term; and the product will be the answer. Thus, let the two lives be each 32, the term seven years, the annuity 10l. interest four per cent. The given lives, increased by seven years, become each 37. The value of two joint lives, each 37, is (by Table II.) 12.25. The value of a single life at 37 is (by the table under the article Annuity) 13.67. The former subtracted from the latter is 3.42, or the value of an annuity for the life of a person 37 years of age, after another of the same age, as has been shown above. 3.42 discounted for seven years (that is, multiplied by 0.76 the value of 1l. due at the end of seven years) is 2.6. The probability that a single life at 30 shall continue seven years is \\( \\frac{4}{8} \\) (B). The probability, therefore, that two such lives shall continue seven years, is \\( \\frac{4}{8} \\times \\frac{4}{8} \\), or in decimals 0.765; and 2.6 multiplied by 0.765 is 1.989, the number of years purchase which ought to be given for an annuity to be enjoyed by a life now 30 years of age, after a Survivorship of the same age, provided both continue seven years. The annuity then being 10l. its present value is 19.89l.\n\nSuppose the value is required of an annuity to be enjoyed for what may happen to remain of one life after the death of another, provided the life in expectation continues a given value for a given time. 1. Find the present value of the annuity for what may happen to remain of the life in expectation after the given time, which is done in this manner: Multiply the present value of the life at the given time by the present value of 1l. to be received at that time, and multiply their product again by the probability that the life in expectation will continue to long. Let the given time in expectation which the life in expectation is to continue be 15 years, and let the person then be arrived at 50 years of age. A life at fifty, according to M. de Moivre's valuation of lives, and reckoning interest at four per cent, is worth 11.34 years purchase. The present value of 1l. to be received at the end of 15 years, is 0.5553, and the probability that a life at 35 will continue 15 years is \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\). These three values multiplied into one another give 4.44l. for the present value of the life in expectation. 2. Find the value of the reverification, provided both lives continue the given time, by the rule given in parag. 5th. 3. Add these values together, and the sum will be the answer in a single present payment. We shall now illustrate this rule by an example.\n\nAn annuity of 10l. for the life of a person now 30, is to commence at the end of 11 years, if another person now 40 should be then dead; or, if this should not happen at the end of any year beyond 11 years in which the former shall happen to survive the latter: What is the present value of such an annuity, reckoning interest at four per cent, and taking the probabilities of life as they are in Dr Halley's table, given in the article Mortality?\n\nThe value of 10l. per annum, for the remainder of the life of a person now 30, after 11 years is 69.43l. The probability that a person 40 years of age shall live 11 years, is, by Dr Halley's table \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\). The probability, therefore, that he will die in 11 years, is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\); subtracted from unity (c), or \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\); which multiplied by 69.43l. gives 17.16l.—The value of the reverification, provided both live 11 years, is 17l., and this value added to the former, makes 34.16l. the value required in a single present payment; which payment divided by 11.43l. the value of two joint lives, aged 30 and 40, with unity added, gives 3l.; or the value required in annual payments during the joint lives, the first payment to be made immediately.\n\n(B) The probability that a given life shall continue any number of years, or reach a given age, is (as is well known) the fraction, whose numerator is the number of the living in any table of observations opposite to the given age, and denominator, the number opposite to the present age of the given life.\n\n(c) For the difference between unity and the fraction expressing the probability that an event will happen, gives the probability that it will not happen.\n### Table I.

The following rules will show, that it would be a needless labour to compute these values (in strict conformity to the observations) for any other rates of interest.\n\nACCOUNT of a method of deducing, from the correct values (according to any observations) of any single or joint Lives at one rate of Interest, the same values at other rates of Interest.\n\nPRELIMINARY PROBLEMS.\n\nPROB. I. The expectation given of a single life by any table of observations, to find its value, supposing the decrements of life equal, at any given rate of interest.\n\nSolution. Find the value of an annuity certain for a number of years equal to twice the expectation. Multiply this value by the perpetuity increased by unity, and divide the product by twice the expectation: The quotient subtracted from the perpetuity will be the value required.\n\nExample. The expectation of a male life aged 10, by the Sweden observations, is 43.94. Twice this expectation is 87.88. The value of an annuity certain for 87.88 years is (reckoning interest at 4 per cent.) 24,200. The product of 24,200 into 26 (the perpetuity increased by unity) is 629.2, which, divided by 87.88, gives 7.159. And this quotient subtracted from 25 (the perpetuity) gives 17.84 years purchase, the value of a life aged ten, deducted from the expectation of life at that age, according to the Sweden observations. (See the Tables in Dr Price on Reverences, vol. ii.)\n\nPROB. II. Having the expectations given of any two lives by any table of observations, to deduce from thence the value of the joint lives at any rate of interest, supposing an equal decrement of life.\n\nSolution. Find the difference between twice the expectation of the youngest life and twice the expectation of the oldest life increased by unity and twice the perpetuity. Multiply this difference by the value of an annuity certain for a time equal to twice the expectation of the oldest life; and by twice the same expectation divide the product, referring the quotient.\n\nWhen twice the expectation of the youngest life is greater than twice the expectation of the oldest life increased by unity and twice the perpetuity, the reserved quotient, instead of being subtracted from twice the perpetuity, must be added to it, and the sum, not the difference, multiplied by the perpetuity increased by unity.\n\nExample. Let the joint lives proposed be a female life aged 10, and a male life aged 15; and let the table of observations be the Sweden table for lives in general, and the rate of interest 4 per cent. Twice the expectations of the two lives are 90.14 and 83.28. Twice the expectation of the oldest life, increased by unity, and twice the perpetuity, is 134.28, which lessened by 90.14 (twice the expectation of the youngest life), leaves 44.14 for the reserved remainder. This remainder multiplied by 24.045 (the value of an annuity certain for 83.28 years), and the product divided by 83.28 (twice the expectation of the oldest life), gives 12.744, the quotient to be referred; which subtracted from double the perpetuity, and the remainder (or 37.255) multiplied by the perpetuity increased by unity (or by 26) gives 968.630, which divided by 90.14 (twice the expectation of the youngest life) and the quotient subtracted from the perpetuity, we have 14.254 for the required value.\n\nThe value of an annuity certain, when the number of years is a whole number with a fraction added (as will be commonly the case) may be best computed in the following manner. In this example the number of years is 83.28. The value of an annuity certain for 83 years is 24.035. The same value for 84 years is 24.072. The difference between these two values is 0.37; which difference multiplied by .28 (the fractional part of the number of years), and the product (.0103) added to the least of the two values, will give 24.045 the value for 83.28 years.\n\nGeneral Rule. Call the correct value (supposed to be computed for any rate of interest) the first value. Call the value deduced (by the preceding problems) from the expectations at the same rate of interest, the second value. Call the value deduced from the expectations for any other rate of interest the third value.\n\nThen the difference between the first and second values added to or subtracted from the third value, just as the first is greater or less than the second, will be the value at the rate of interest for which the third value has been deduced from the expectations.\n\nThe following examples will make this perfectly plain.\n\nExample I. In the two last tables the correct values are given of two joint lives among mankind at large, without distinguishing between males and females, according to the Sweden observations, reckoning interest at 4 per cent. Let it be required to find from these values the values at 3 per cent. and let the ages of the joint lives be supposed 10 and 10.\n\nThe correct value by Table IV. (reckoning interest at 4 per cent.) is 16.141. The expectation of a life aged 10 is 45.07. The value deduced from this expectation at 4 per cent. by Prob. II. is 14.539. The value deduced by the same problem from the same expectation at 3 per cent. is 16.808. The difference between the first and second values is 1.662, which, added to the third value (the first being greater than the second), makes 18.410, the value required.\n\nExample II. Let the value be required of a single male life aged 10, at 3 per cent. interest, from the correct value at 4 per cent. according to the Sweden observations.\n\nFirst, or correct value at 4 per cent. (by Table III.) is 18.674. The expectation of a male life aged 10 is 43.94.\n\nThe second value (or the value deduced from this expectation by Prob. I.) is 17.838.\n\nThe third value (or the value deduced from the same expectation at 3 per cent.) is 21.277.\n\nThe difference between the first and second is .836; which (since the first is greater than the second) must be added to the third; and the sum (that is, 22.113) will be the value required.\nThe third value at 5 per cent. is 15.286; and the difference added to 15.286 makes 16.122 the value of a male life aged 10 at 5 per cent., according to the Sweden observations. The exact value at 5 per cent. is (by Table III.) 16.014.\n\nAgain: The difference between 16.014 (the correct value at 5 per cent.), and 15.286 (the value at the same interest deducted from the expectation), is .728; which, added (because the first value is greater than the second) to 13.335 (the value deducted at 6 per cent. from the expectation) gives 14.063, the value of the same life, reckoning interest at 6 per cent.\n\nThese deductions, in the case of single lives particularly, are so easy, and give the true values so nearly, that it will be scarcely ever necessary to calculate the exact values (according to any given observations) for more than one rate of interest.\n\nIf, for instance, the correct values are computed at 4 per cent. according to any observations, the values at 3, 3½, 4½, 5, 6, 7, or 8 per cent. may be deduced from them by the preceding rules as occasion may require, without much labour or any danger of considerable errors. The values thus deduced will seldom differ from the true values so much as a tenth of a year's purchase. They will not generally differ more than a 20th or 30th of a year's purchase. In joint lives they will differ less than in single lives, and they will come equally near to one another whatever the rates of interest are.\n\nThe preceding tables furnish the means of determining the exact differences between the values of annuities, as they are made to depend on the survivorship of any male or female lives; which hitherto has been a disfideratum of considerable consequence in the doctrine of life-annuities. What has made this of consequence is chiefly the multitude of societies lately established in this and foreign countries for providing annuities for widows. The general rule for calculating from these tables the value of such annuities is the following.\n\nRule. \"Find in Table III. the value of a female life at the age of the wife. From this value subtract the value in Table IV. of the joint continuance of two lives at the ages of the husband and wife. The remainder will be the value in a single present payment of an annuity for the life of the wife, should she be left a widow. And this last value divided by the value of the joint lives increased by unity, will be the value of the same annuity in annual payments during the joint lives, and to commence immediately.\"\n\nExample. Let the age of the wife be 24, and of the husband 30. The value in Table III. (reckoning interest at 4 per cent.) of a female life aged 24, is 17.252. The value in Table IV. of two joint lives aged 24 and 30, is 13.455, which subtracted from 17.252 leaves 3.797, the value in a single present payment of an annuity of 1l. for the life of the wife after the husband; that is, for the life of the widow. The annuity, therefore, being supposed 20l. its value in a single payment is 20 multiplied by 3.797, that is, 75.94l. And this last value divided by 14.455 (that is, by the value of the joint lives increased by unity), gives 5.25, the value in annual payments beginning immediately, and to be continued during the joint lives of an annuity of 20l. to a wife aged 24 for her life, after her husband aged 30.\n\nSURYA, the orb of the sun personified and adored by a sect of Hindoos as a god. He seems to be the same divinity with the Phoebus of Greece and Rome; and the sect who pay him particular adoration are called Sauras. Their poets and painters describe his car as drawn by seven green horses, preceded by Arun, or the Dawn, who acts as his charioteer, and followed by thousands of genii worshipping him and modulating his praises. He has a multitude of names, and among them twelve epithets or titles, which denote his distinct powers in each of the twelve months; and he is believed to have descended frequently from his car in a vol. i. p. human shape, and to have left a race on earth, who are equally renowned in the Indian stories with the Heliadai of Greece: it is very singular, that his two sons called Afiwinau or Afiwinicumarau, in the dual, should be considered as twin-brothers, and painted like Caflor and Pollux; but they have each the character of Æsculapius among the gods, and are believed to have been born of a nymph, who, in the form of a mare, was impregnated with sunbeams.\n\nSUS, the Hog, a genus of quadrupeds belonging to the class of mammalia and order of belluae. See MAMMALIA Index.\n\nSUSA, the ancient royal residence of the kings of Persia, built by Darius Hystaspis, according to Pliny; though he probably only restored it, being a very ancient city, founded by Tithonus father of Memnon. It was in compass 120 stadia, of an oblong quadrangular form, with a citadel called Memnonium. In scripture it is called Sufan, the royal citadel, from the great number of lilies growing in that district (Athenaeus); situated on the river Uhli, or Eulaeus (Daniel): and the Spaniards call at this day a lily asyena (Pinedo). Sufa was the winter, as Ecbatana was the summer, residence of the kings of Persia, (Xenophon, Strabo, Plutarch). Here the kings kept their treasure, (Herodotus). Now called Tyfer.\n\nSUSSEX, a county of England, deriving its name from its situation in respect of the other Saxons, and called Suffex, i.e. the country of the South Saxons, has Hampshire on the west, the British channel on the south, Surrey on the north, and Kent on the east. Its length is 65 miles, its breadth 30, and its circumference 170. It is divided into 6 rapes, and these into 65 hundreds, in which are 342 parishes, of which 123 Gongb's are vicarages, one city, 16 market-towns, 1,140,000 acres, and about 159,311 souls. It has few good ports, though it lies along the channel for 65 miles, which is its greatest length, the coast being encumbered in many places with rocks; and where it is more open, such quantities of sand are thrown upon it by the south-west winds, and the harbours so choked up, that they will not admit vessels of any great draught or burden. The county is well watered by the rivers Arun, Adar, Ouse, Rother, Lavant, Cuckmeer, Ashburn, and Afton, by which it is well supplied with fish, as well as from the sea. Hence different places of the county are famed for different sorts of fish, as the Arun for mullets, which enter it from the sea in summer in shoals, and by feeding upon a particular kind of herb become extremely delicious: Chichester for lobsters, Selby for cockles, Amberley for trout, Pulborough for eels, Rye for herrings,\nSuffex, and the county in general for carp. It is remarkable, Sutherland, that all the rivers above mentioned rise and fall into the sea within the county.\n\nThe air, as well as the soil, is various in different parts of the county. Upon the coast the air is aguish, upon the hills and downs pleasant and wholesome; but somewhat moist and foggy in the valleys, the soil being deep and rich, and the vegetation in summer very vigorous. The downs in some places are very fertile in corn and grass; in others they feed great flocks of sheep, whose flesh and wool are very fine; but of the latter no inconsiderable quantity is clandestinely exported to France. In the Weald and the valleys the roads are very deep, especially in winter. In the north quarter are many woods, and some forests in other places; whence the king's yards are supplied with the largest and best timber in England, beside what is made into charcoal and consumed in the iron-works; for on the eft side is plenty of iron ore, with furnaces, forges, and mills for manufacturing it. The gunpowder of this county is said to excel that of any other. Those delicious birds called wheat-ears are bred in this shire; they are not bigger than a lark, but very fat. That part now called the Wild or Weald of Suffex, was anciently a mere desert for hogs and deer, of great extent, taking in a part of Kent and Surry; and was called Anderida Silva, Coid Andred, and Andradweald, from Anderida an adjoining city. This county is in the home-circuit and diocese of Chichester, giving title of earl to the family of Yelverton, and sends 28 members to parliament, viz. two for the county, two for the city of Chichester, and two for each of the following towns, Horham, Lewes, Bramber, East-Grimstead, Midhurst, Shoreham, Staining, Arundel, Haflings, Rye, Winchelsea, and Seaford; of which the four last are cinque ports.\n\nSUTHERLAND, one of the most northerly counties of Scotland, bordering on Caithness to the east, and bounded by the ocean on the north, the country of Affynt on the west, Ross-shire on the south, and by the German sea on the south-east. It stretches about 70 miles in length, and 40 in breadth; is generally hilly, though in many parts arable; well watered with small rivers and streams replete with fish, and containing about 60 lakes, the habitation of various fish, swans, ducks, geese, &c. One of the largest of these is Lochshin, extending 18 miles in length. Some of them are interspersed with small verdant islands, which in summer yield a very agreeable prospect. On the coast are many commodious harbours, and all the bays swarm with fish. Sutherland affords iron-stone, freestone, limestone, marble and slate, in abundance. Turf and peat are the common fuel. Lead ore, and some copper ore have been met with in some parts of the county.\n\nThe air is so temperate, and the soil so good, that saffron has here been brought to perfection. Many parts of the country are remarkably fruitful in corn, and the pasturage is everywhere excellent. Deer and some other game are abundant in Sutherland. On the hills are fed numerous flocks of sheep and black cattle. The northern part, called Strathnaver, and separated from the rest by a ridge of mountains, is bounded on the north by the Deucaledonian sea, on the west by the channel called the Minch, on the east by Caithness, and on the south by Affynt. The length from east to west is 34 miles; but the breadth from north to south does not exceed 12 in some places. It is very hilly; and the Sutherland mountains are so high, that the snow remains on the tops of them till midsummer. It is watered by the Naver, from whence it derives its name: this district gives a title to the eldest son of the earl of Sutherland. Strathnaver has many fresh-water lakes or lochs; the chief of which are Loch Naver and Loch Lye: there are several islands on the northern coast. In various parts of the country there are monuments of victories obtained over the Danes or other foreign invaders. The inhabitants are hardy, bold, and enterprising; courteous to strangers; cheerful, open, frugal, and industrious. The salmon-fishery in this county is considerable, as well as the trade in black cattle, sheep, and horses, at the neighbouring fairs; corn, barley, salmon, butter, cheese, wool, hides, and tallow, are exported. Dornoch is the capital of the county. The population of Sutherland in 1851 amounted to 23,000. The following table shows the population at two different periods*.\n\n| Parish    | Population in 1755 | Population in 1790—1798 |\n|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Affynt    | 1934              | 3000                   |\n| Clyne     | 1406              | 1660                   |\n| Creich    | 1705              | 1730                   |\n| Durness   | 1000              | 1182                   |\n| Dornoch   | 2780              | 2541                   |\n| Edderachillis | 869          | 1024                   |\n| Farr      | 2800              | 2600                   |\n| Gollpie   | 1790              | 1700                   |\n| Kildonan  | 1433              | 1365                   |\n| Lairg     | 1010              | 1350                   |\n| Loth      | 1193              | 1370                   |\n| Rogart    | 1761              | 2000                   |\n| Tongue    | 1093              | 1439                   |\n\nTotal: 20,774\n\nIncrease: 2,187\n\nSUTLER, in War, one who follows the army, and furnishes the troops with provision.

He afterwards came to London, commenced brewer, and kept a coffee house in Aldergate-street, which was well frequented by the learned men of that time, by whom Mr Sutton was much respected, as a man of strong natural parts and uncultivated genius. About the year 1740 he schemed a very simple and natural method for extracting the foul air from the wells of ships, by pipes communicating with the fire-places of the coppers; which operated as long as any fire was kept burning for the ship's use. He took out a patent in 1744, to secure the profits of his invention; and died about the year 1752.\nSUTURE, in Anatomy, a kind of articulation peculiar to the cranium or skull.

See ASCLEPIAS, BOTANY Index.\n\nSWAMMERDAM, JOHN, a celebrated and learned natural philosopher, was the son of John James Swammerdam, an apothecary and famous naturalist of Amsterdam, and was born in 1637. His father intended him for the church, and with this view had him instructed in Latin and Greek; but he, thinking himself unequal to so important a task, prevailed with his father to consent to his applying himself to physic. As he was kept at home till he should be properly qualified to engage in that study, he was frequently employed in cleansing his father's curiosities, and putting every thing in its proper place. This inspired our author with an early taste for natural history; so that, not content with the survey of the curiosities which his father had purchased, he soon began to make a collection of his own, which he compared with the accounts given of them by the best writers. When grown up, he feriously attended to his anatomical and medical studies; yet spent part of the day and the night in discovering, catching, and examining the flying insects proper to those times, not only in the province of Holland, but in those of Guelderland and Utrecht. Thus initiated in natural history, he went to the university of Leyden in 1653; and in 1653 was admitted a candidate of physic in that university. His attention being now engaged by anatomy, he began to consider how the parts of the body, prepared by dissection, could be preserved, and kept in constant order for anatomical demonstration; and herein he succeeded, as he had done before in his nice contrivances for dissecting and managing the minuteest insects. Our author afterwards made a journey into France, where he spent some time at Saumur, and where he became acquainted with several learned men. In 1667 he returned to Leyden, and took his degree of Doctor of Physic. The next year the grand duke of Tuscany being in Holland in order to see the curiosities of the country, came to view those of our author and his father; and on this occasion Swammerdam made some anatomical dissections of insects in the presence of that prince, who was struck with admiration at our author's great skill in managing them, especially at his proving that the future butterfly lay with all its parts neatly folded up in a caterpillar, by actually removing the integuments that covered the former, and extricating and exhibiting all its parts, however minute, with incredible ingenuity, by means of instruments of inconceivable fineness. On this occasion the duke offered our author 12,000 florins for his share of the collection, on condition of his removing them himself into Tuscany, and coming to live at the court of Florence; but Swammerdam, who hated a court life, declined his highness's proposal. In 1663, he published a General History of Insects. About this time, his father began to take offence at his inconsiderately neglecting the practice of physic, which might have supported him in affluence; and would neither supply him with money nor clothes. This reduced him to some difficulties. In 1675 he published his History of the Ephemeras; and his father dying the same year, left him a fortune sufficient for his support; but he did not long survive him, for he died in 1682.

Before the treaty concluded in 1809, between Sweden and Russia, the Swedish territory extended over a considerable tract of country on the east of the gulf of Bothnia; but by that treaty, the whole of these provinces were ceded to Russia. At present the boundaries of Sweden are, Norway and Lapland to the north; to the west Norway, from which it is separated by the mountains; the Baltic to the south; and to the east the gulf of Bothnia, the sea of Aland, and the rivers of Tornia and Muonio, which separate it from the Russian empire. From north to south it lies between the latitudes of 69° 30' and 55° 20'; and it extends from the 12th degree to about the 24th degree of longitude east from Greenwich. Formerly its extent in British miles was computed at 1150 in length, and 600 in breadth, and its area at about 210,000 square miles. Its length continues undiminished; but its breadth is probably lessened at least one half, and we can scarcely estimate its present extent at more than 110,000 square miles. The following table will show the present divisions of the Swedish territories.\n| Provinces          | Subdivisions                  | Chief Towns |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|\n| SWEDEN PROPER     | Upland, Sudermanland, Nerike, Vastmanland, Dalecarlia | STOCKHOLM   |\n| GOTHLAND          | West Gothland, East Gothland, South Gothland | Gottenburgh |\n| WEST NORLAND      | Jemtland, Angermanland, Medelpad, Hälsingland, Gästrikland, Hergedalen |             |\n| WEST BOTHNIA      |                               | Tornea      |\n| SWEDISH LAPLAND   | Afele Lappmark, Umea Lappmark, Pitea Lappmark, Lulea Lappmark, Tornea Lappmark, Kemi Lappmark |             |\n| SWEDISH POMERANIA (A) |                               | Stralsund   |\n\nThe only colonial territory belonging to Sweden is the island of St Bartholomew, in the West Indies.\n\nSweden is diversified in a most picturesque manner, with extensive lakes, large rivers, winding streams, cataracts, gloomy forests, fertile vales, stupendous rocks, and cultivated fields. It possesses more navigable rivers than the neighbouring countries of Norway and Denmark.\n\nSweden is by no means remarkable for the fertility of its soil, most of the country being rocky and unproductive. The valleys and the banks of the rivers afford the best land for tillage.\n\nThe principal mountains belonging to Sweden are those of the elevated chain which divides it from Norway, and which branch off in a south-easterly direction. One of the highest of these is Swucku.\n\nThe chief rivers are the Gotha connecting Lake Werner with the Categat; the Motala, forming the outlet of Lake Weter; the Dahl rising in the Norwegian mountains, and flowing through Dalecarlia into the gulf of Bothnia, and the Tornea forming the north-eastern boundary, and emptying itself into the gulf of Bothnia at the town of the same name.\n\nThere are several considerable lakes in Sweden, chiefly in the province of Sweden Proper. The most remarkable are Werner, Weter, and Maela, on the banks of which last stands the city of Stockholm.\n\nSweden abounds with forests, especially in Dalecarlia, forests, and on the borders of the lakes.\n\nThe climate and seasons of Sweden nearly resemble those of the same latitudes in Russia. The winters are severe, and the summers short and sudden. The gulf of Bothnia is generally frozen over during winter, so as to admit of travellers passing over into Finland, and East Bothnia. The summer, though short, is generally hot, and seldom cloudy or insubstantial. In the higher latitudes the sun of course is seen in the middle of summer for several days together, and the nights of winter are proportionably long.\n\nMuch of the natural history of Sweden has been already given under the article Lapland. In the more southern provinces there are found in the forests the bear, lynx, wolf, beaver, otter, glutton, and flying squirrel. The Swedish horses are commonly small, but spirited, and are considered as superior to those of Germany for cavalry. The cattle and sheep present little remarkable, being similar to those of the neighbouring nations. Seals are found in the gulf of Bothnia; and the lakes and rivers of Sweden produce pikes that are remarkably large, and which are salted and pickled for exportation.\n\n---\n\n(a) That district of Germany, called Swedish Pomerania, was long in possession of the Swedish monarchs; till, in the contests with France and Russia, it was taken possession of by the former. By the late treaty (in 1809) between France and Sweden, Pomerania has been restored to its old master.\n\nThe map of Sweden is attached to that of Denmark and Norway, in Plate CLXX.\nSweden. The forests produce a great variety of game, especially the large black cock, called in Scotland the cock of the forest. Among the reptiles the *rana bombina*, and the *coluber chersea*, are considered as almost peculiar to Sweden.\n\nThe principal vegetable productions of Sweden are its immense forests of pine and fir trees, though the country is not deficient of a great variety of shrubs and plants common to it with Denmark and Russia.\n\nThe principal riches of the natural history of Sweden are to be found in the mineral kingdom. It produces crystals, amethysts, topazes, porphyry, lapis lazuli, agate, cornelian, marble, and other trifles. The chief wealth of the country, however, arises from her mines of silver, copper, lead, and iron. The last mentioned metal employs not fewer than 450 forges, hammering-mills, and melting houses. A kind of a gold mine has likewise been discovered in Sweden, but so inconsiderable, that from the year 1741 to 1747, it produced only 2398 ducats, each valued at 9s. 4d. sterling. The first gallery of one silver mine is 100 fathoms below the surface of the earth; the roof is supported by prodigious oaken beams, and from thence the miners descend about 40 fathoms to the lowest vein. This mine is said to produce 22,000 crowns a year. The product of the copper mines is uncertain; but the whole is loaded with vast taxes and reductions to the government, which has no other resources for the exigencies of the state. Those subterraneous mansions are astonishingly spacious, and at the same time commodious for their inhabitants, so that they seem to form a hidden world. The waterfalls in Sweden afford excellent conveniency for turning mills for forges; and for some years the exports of iron from Sweden brought in 300,000 sterling.\n\nThere are likewise in Sweden some silver mines, of which that of Sahlberg is the richest, as well as the most ancient. It existed to early as 1183, and during the whole of the 14th century, it yielded 24,000 marks of silver per annum. In the 15th century the quantity was diminished to 20,000. In the reign of Charles X., it gave only 2,000; and it furnishes at present still less, the ore yielding only one ounce of pure metal per quintal. The chief gallery, where the purest silver was obtained, having fallen in, is not yet cleared, notwithstanding their incessant labour. They are also digging pits in a perpendicular direction, in order to arrive at the principal vein, which extends itself from the north to the south-east. Formerly lead employed in separating the metal was imported from England; but the mine furnishes at present a sufficient quantity for the purpose.\n\nThe most remarkable mineral waters in Sweden are those of Medewi in East Gothland.\n\nThe early history of Sweden is not less involved in fable than that of most other nations. Some historians have pretended to give regular catalogues of the princes who reigned in Sweden in very early times; but they differ so much that no credit can be given to them. All indeed agree that ancient Scandinavia was first governed by judges elected for a certain time by the voice of the people. Among these temporary princes the country was divided, until, in the year of the world 2054, according to some, or 1951, according to others, Eric, or, if we believe Puffendorf, Sueno, was raised to the supreme power, with the prerogatives of all the temporary magistrates united in his person for life, or until his conduct should merit deposition.\n\nFrom this very early period till the year 1366 of the Christian era, the histories of Sweden present us with nothing but what is common to all nations in their early periods, viz. the endless combats of barbarians, tending to no other purpose than the effusion of blood. At the time just mentioned, however, Albert of Mecklenburg, having concluded a peace between Sweden and Denmark, which had been at violent war for some time before, was proclaimed king of Sweden. The peace was of short duration, being broken in 1368; on which Albert entered into an offensive and defensive league with the earl of Holstein, the Jutland nobility, the dukes of Siefwick, Mecklenburg, and the Hanse-towns, against the kings of Denmark and Norway. Albert proved very successful against Waldemar, king of Denmark at that time, driving him entirely out of his dominions; and Norway, who himself was defeated by the king of Norway, who laid siege to his capital. Soon after this, a new treaty was concluded, by which Albert was allowed to enjoy the crown of Sweden in peace. Having formed a design however of rendering himself absolute, he displeased his subjects that Margaret of Norway was proclaimed queen of Sweden by the malecontents. A war immediately ensued, in which Albert was defeated and taken prisoner; but as the princes of Mecklenburg, the earls of Holstein, and the Hanse-towns, entered into a league in his favour, the war raged with more fury than ever.\n\nAt length, in 1394, the contending parties were reconciled. Albert was set at liberty, on condition that he should in three years give up to Margaret all pretensions to the city of Stockholm; and the Hanse-towns engaged to pay the sum of 60,000 marks of silver if Albert should break that treaty. Not long after this, Eric the son of Albert died; and he, having no other child, did not think it worth his while to contend for the kingdom of Sweden: he therefore acquiesced in the pretensions of Margaret, and passed the remainder of his days at Mecklenburg.\n\nMargaret died in 1415, and was succeeded by Eric of Pomerania. This prince's reign was cruel and oppressive. The consequence of this was a revolt; and Eric, a Charles Canutson, grand marshal of Sweden and governor of Finland, having joined the malecontents, was declared commander in chief of their army. Eric was now formally deposed: Canutson was chosen regent; but beginning to oppress the people, and aspiring openly to the crown, the Swedes and Danes revolted; in consequence of which a revolution took place, and Christopher duke of Bavaria, nephew to Eric, was chosen king of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, in 1442.\n\nOn the accession of the new prince, complaints against Charles Canutson were brought from all quarters; but, through Canutson's interest of his friends, he escaped punishment; and in 1448, Christopher having died after a tyrannical reign of about five years, he raised to the throne to which he had so long aspired. The kingdoms of Denmark and Norway however refused allegiance to him; on which a war immediately commenced. In 1454 peace was concluded, and Denmark for the present freed from the Swedish yoke. Nor did Canutson long enjoy even the crown of Sweden. Having quarrelled with\nThe Swedish affairs continued to be involved in dreadful confusion till the year 1520, when a great revolution was effected by Gustavus Ericson, a nobleman of the first rank, who restored the kingdom to its liberty, and laid the foundation of its future grandeur. The occasion of this great revolution was as follows: In 1518, Christian king of Denmark invaded Sweden, with a design to subdue the whole country; but being defeated with great loss by young Steen Sture, at that time regent, he fell for Denmark. But meeting with contrary winds, he made several descents on the Swedish coast, which he ravaged with all the fury of an incensed barbarian. The inhabitants, however, bravely defended themselves, and Christian was reduced to the utmost distress; one half of his forces having perished with hunger, and the rest being in the most imminent danger by the approach of a rigorous winter. He then thought of a stratagem, which had almost proved fatal to the regent; for having invited him to a conference, at which he designed either to assassinate or take him prisoner, Sture was about to comply, had not the senate, who suspected the plot, interfered and prevented him. Christian then offered to go in person to Stockholm in order to confer with Sture, on condition that five hostages should be sent in his room. This was accordingly done; but the wind happening then to prove favourable, he fell for Denmark with the hostages, of whom Gustavus Ericson was one. Next year he returned; and having drawn Sture into an ambush, the regent received a wound of which he died some time after.\n\nThe kingdom being thus left without a head, matters soon came to the most desperate crisis. The army disbanded itself; and the senate, instead of taking proper measures to oppose the enemy, spent their time in idle debates. Christian in the meantime advanced into the heart of the kingdom, destroying everything with fire and sword; but on his arrival at Strängnäs, he granted a suspension of arms, on condition that they would elect him king. This they accordingly did; and Christian proved one of the most bloody tyrants that ever sat on the throne of any kingdom. Immediately after his coronation, he gave grand entertainments for three days; during which time he projected the diabolical design of extirpating at once all the Swedish nobility, and thus for ever preventing the people from revolting, by depriving them of their proper leaders. As the tyrant had signed articles, by which he promised indemnity to all who had borne arms against him, it became necessary to invent some cause of offence against those whom he intended to destroy. To accomplish his purpose, Gustavus Trolle, formerly archbishop of Upsal, but who had been degraded from that dignity, in an oration before his majesty lamented the demolition of Stocka, his place of residence, and the losses sustained by the see of Upsal, amounting to near a million of money. He then proceeded in a bitter accusation against the widow and the son-in-law of Sture the late regent, comprehending in the same accusation about 15 of the principal nobility, the whole senate, and the burghers of Stockholm. In consequence of this, about 60 of the principal nobility and people of first rank in Sweden were hanged as traitors. Innumerable other cruelties were committed; part of which are owned by the Danish historians, and minutely related by those of Sweden.\n\nAt last he departed for Denmark, ordering gibbets to be erected, and causing the peasants to be hanged on them for the slightest offences.\n\nThis monstrous cruelty, instead of securing him on the throne, exasperated the whole nation against him. It has already been mentioned, that Gustavus Ericson, or, as he is commonly called, Gustavus Vasa, was among along the number of hostages whom Christian had perditionally carried to Denmark in 1519. Large promises of Gustavus' adventures had been made in order to reconcile him to Christian, Vasa or all means had been employed, but in vain. Secret orders were given to strangle him in prison; but the officer to whom the assassination was committed remonstrated to the king about the consequences of it, and prevailed on him to change the sentence of death into close confinement in the castle of Copenhagen. Some of the hostages perished in consequence of the rigorous treatment they met with; but Gustavus withstood all hardships. At last one Banner, a Danish nobleman, prevailed on the king to put him into his hands, in order to try whether or not he could prevail on him to change his sentiments. The king, however, told Banner, that he must pay 6000 crowns if the prisoner should make his escape. Banner generously confessed; and having brought the noble prisoner to his fortress of Calo in Jutland, soon allowed him all the liberty he could desire, and otherwise heaped favours on him. All this, however, could not extinguish his remembrance of the cruelties of Christian, and the desire he had of being serviceable to his country. He therefore determined to make his escape; and the liberty he enjoyed soon put from Denmark in a capacity of effecting it. Having one day mounted his horse, under pretence of hunting as usual in the forest, when he got at a proper distance, he changed his dress to the habit of a peasant; and quitting his horse, travelled for two days on foot through by-paths, and over mountains almost impassable, arriving on the third at Elsinburgh. Here no one was admitted without a passport; and Gustavus dreaded presenting himself to the governor or the officer on guard, for fear of being discovered. Gustavus hired himself to a cattle merchant; and in this disguise escaped out of the Danish territories, and arrived at Lubeck.\n\nBanner was no sooner acquainted with his escape, than he set out after him with the utmost diligence, found him at Lubeck, and reproached him with great warmth as ungrateful and treacherous; but he was soon appeased by the arguments urged by Gustavus, and especially by a promise of indemnifying him in the loss of his ransom. On this Banner returned, giving out that he could not find his prisoner. Christian was enraged at his escape, apprehending that he might reverse all his designs in Sweden; and gave orders to Otho his general to make the strictest search, and leave no means untried to arrest him. Gustavus applied to the regency for a ship to convey him to Sweden, where he hoped he should be able to form a party against the Danes. He likewise endeavoured to draw the regency of Lubeck into his views; and reasoned with so much zeal and energy of ability, that Nicholas Gemins, first consul, was entirely gained; but the regency could never be prevailed on to his side declare for a party without friends, arms, money, or credit. Before his departure, however, the confidant gave him\nhim assurances, that if he could raise a force sufficient to make head against the enemy in the field, he might depend on the services of the republic, and that the regency would immediately declare for him. Gustavus desired to be landed at Stockholm; but the captain of the ship, either having secret orders to the contrary, or butinels elsewhere, steered a different course, and put him on shore near Colmar; a city then garrisoned by the troops of Christina widow of the regent. In fact, the governor held this place for his own purposes, and only waited to make the best terms he could with the Danes. When Gustavus arrived, he made himself known to him and the principal officers of the garrison, who were mostly Germans, and his fellow-soldiers in the late administrator's army; but the mercenary band, seeing him without troops and without attendants, regarded him as a desperate person devoted to destruction, refused to embrace his proposals, and even threatened to kill or betray him, if he did not instantly quit the city.\n\nDisappointed in his expectations, Gustavus departed; and his arrival being now publicly known, he was again forced to have recourse to his peasant's disguise to conceal him from the Danish emissaries dispersed over the country to search for him. In a waggon loaded with hay he passed through the Danish army, and at last repaired to an old family castle in Sodermania. Hence he wrote to his friends, intimating his return to Sweden, and beseeching them to assemble all their forces in order to break through the enemy's army into Stockholm, at that time besieged; but they refused to embark in so hazardous and desperate an attempt.\n\nGustavus next applied himself to the peasants; but they answered, that they enjoyed salt and herrings under the government of the king of Denmark; and that any attempts to bring about a revolution would be attended with certain ruin, without the prospect of bettering their condition; for peasants they were, and peasants they should remain, whoever was king. At length, after several attempts to throw himself into Stockholm, after that city was surrendered to the king, after the horrid massacre of the senate, and after running a thousand dangers, and undergoing hardships and fatigues scarcely to be supported by human nature, he formed the resolution of trying the courage and affection of the Dalecarlians. While he was in the deepest obscurity, and plunged in almost insurmountable adversity, he never relinquished his designs nor his hopes. The news of the massacre had, however, nearly sunk him into despondency, as by it he lost all his friends, relations, and connections, and indeed almost every prospect of safety to himself or deliverance to his country. This suggested the thought of going to Dalecarlia, where he might live with more security in the high mountains and thick woods of that country, if he should fail in the attempt of exciting the inhabitants to revolt.\n\nAttended by a peasant, to whom he was known, he travelled in disguise through Sodermania, Neritcia, and Westermania, and, after a laborious and painful journey, arrived in the mountains of Dalecarlia. Scarcely had he finished his journey, when he found himself deserted by his companion and guide, who carried off with him all the money which he had provided for his subsistence. Thus forlorn and destitute, he entered among the miners, without relinquishing his hopes of one day ascending the throne of Sweden. His whole object for the present was to live concealed, and gain a maintenance, till fortune should effect something in his favour: nor was it long before this happened. A wondrous discovery in the mines perceived, under the habit of a peasant and tenant, that the collar of his shirt was embroidered. This circumstance excited curiosity; and the graces of his person and conversation, which had something in them to attract the notice of the meanest of the vulgar, afforded room for suspicion that he was some person of quality in disguise, forced by the tyranny of the government to seek shelter in these remote parts. The story came to the ears of a neighbouring gentleman, who immediately went to the mines to offer his protection to the unfortunate stranger; and was astonished on recognizing the features of Gustavus, to whom he had been known at the university of Upsal. Touched with compassion at the deplorable situation of so distinguished a nobleman, he could scarcely refrain from tears. At night he sent for Gustavus, made him an offer of his house, and gave him the strongest assurances of his friendship and protection. He told him, he would there meet with better accommodations, and as much security as in the mines; and that, should he chance to be discovered, he would, with all his friends and vassals, take arms in his defence.\n\nThis offer was embraced by Gustavus with joy, and he remained for some time at his friend's house; but finding it impossible to induce him to take part in his designs, he quitted him, and fled to one Peterfon, a gentleman whom he had formerly known in the service. This man received Gustavus with all the appearance of kindness; and, on the very first proposal, offered to raise his vassals. He even named the lords and peasants whom he pretended to have engaged in his service; but in a few days, he went secretly to a Danish officer, and gave him information of what had passed. The officer immediately caused the house to be surrounded with soldiers, in such a manner that it seemed impossible for Gustavus to escape. Being warned, by Peterfon's wife of the treachery of her husband, he, narrow-eyed by her direction, contrived to flee to the house of a clergyman, her friend, by whom he was received with all the respect due to his birth and merit; and left the domestic who conducted him should follow the treacherous example of his master, he removed him to the church, and conducted him to a small closet, of which he kept the key. Having lived for some time in this manner, Gustavus began to consult with his friend concerning the most proper method of putting their schemes in execution. The priest advised him to apply directly to the peasants themselves; told him that it would be proper to spread a report, that the Danes were to enter Dalecarlia in order to establish new taxes by force of arms; and as the annual feast of all the neighbouring villages was to be held in a few days, he could not have a more favourable opportunity; he also promised to engage the principal persons of the diocese in his interest.\n\nIn compliance with this advice, Gustavus set out for Mora, where the feast was to be held. He found the peasants already informed of his designs, and impatient the peasants to see him. Being already prepossessed in his favour, of Dalecarlia they were soon excited to an enthusiasm in his cause.\nand instantly resolved to throw off the Danish yoke.\n\nIn this design they were more confirmed by their superstition; some of their old men having observed that the wind had blown from the north while Gustavus was speaking, which among them was reckoned an infallible omen of success. Gustavus did not allow their ardour to cool, but instantly led them against the governor's castle; which he took by assault, and put the garrison to the sword. This inconsiderable enterprise was attended with the most happy consequences. Great numbers of the peasants flocked to his standard; some of the gentry openly espoused his cause, and others supplied him with money. Chriiern was soon informed of what had passed; but despising such an inconsiderable enemy, he sent only a slender detachment to assist his adherents in Dalecarlia. Gustavus advanced with 5000 men, and defeated a body of Danes; but he was strenuously opposed by the archbishop of Upsal, who raised numerous forces for Chriiern. The fortune of Gustavus, however, still prevailed, and the archbishop was defeated with great loss. Gustavus then laid siege to Stockholm; but his force being unequal to such an undertaking, he was forced to abandon it with loss.\n\nThis check did not prove in any considerable degree detrimental to the affairs of Gustavus; the peasants from all parts of the kingdom flocked to his camp, and he was joined by a reinforcement from Lubec. Chriiern, unable to suppress the revolt, wreaked his vengeance on the mother and sisters of Gustavus, whom he put to death. His barbarities served only to make his enemies more resolute. Gustavus having assembled the estates at Vadstena, he was unanimously chosen regent, the diet taking an oath of fidelity to him, and promising to assist him to the utmost. Having thus obtained the sanction of legal authority, he pursued his advantages against the Danes. A body of troops appointed to throw succours into Stockholm were cut in pieces; and the regent sending some troops into Finland, struck the Danes there with such terror, that the archbishop of Upsal, together with the Danish governors, fled to Denmark. Chriiern then sent express orders to all his governors and officers in Finland and Sweden to massacre the Swedish gentry without distinction. The Swedes made reprisals by massacring all the Danes they could find; so that the whole country was filled with slaughter.\n\nIn the mean time Gustavus had laid siege to the towns of Calmar, Abo, and Stockholm; but Norby found means to oblige him to raise them with loss. Gustavus, in revenge, laid siege to the capital a third time, and applied to the regency of Lubec for a squadron of ships and other succours for carrying on the siege. This was granted on condition that Gustavus should oblige himself, in the name of the estates, to pay 60,000 merks of silver as the expense of the armament; that, until the kingdom should be in a condition to pay that sum, the Lubec merchants trading to Sweden should be exempted from all duties on imports or exports; that all other nations should be prohibited from trading with Sweden, and that such traffic should be deemed illicit; that Gustavus should neither conclude a peace, nor even agree to a truce, with Denmark, without the concurrence of the regency of Lubec; and that if the republic should be attacked by Chriiern, he should enter Denmark at the head of 20,000 men. On these hard terms Gustavus obtained assistance from the regency of Lubec; nor did his dear-bought allies prove very faithful. They did not indeed go over to the enemy; but in a sea-fight, where the Danes were entirely in the power of their enemies, they suffered them to escape, when their whole force might have been entirely destroyed. This treachery had nearly ruined the affairs of Gustavus; for Norby was now making preparations effectually to relieve Stockholm; in which he would probably have succeeded; but at this critical period news arrived that the Danes had unanimously revolted, and driven Chriiern from the throne; and that the king had retired into Germany, in hopes of being restored by the arms of his brother-in-law the emperor. On hearing this news, Norby retired with his whole fleet to the island of Gotland, leaving but a slender garrison in Calmar. Gustavus did not fail to improve this opportunity to his own advantage, and quickly made himself master of Calmar. Mean time Stockholm continued closely invested; but Gustavus thought proper to protract the siege till he should get himself elected king. Having for this purpose called a general diet, he first filled up the vacancy in the senate occasioned by the massacres of Chriiern. Gustavus had the address to get such nominated as were in his interest. The assembly was no sooner met, than a speech was made, containing the highest encomiums on Gustavus, setting forth in strongest light the many eminent services he had done for his country, and concluded that the estates would show themselves equally ungrateful and blind to their own interest if they did not immediately elect him king. This proposal was acceded to by such tumultuous acclamations that it was impossible to collect the votes; so that Gustavus himself acknowledged, that their affection exceed his merit, and was more agreeable to him than the effects of their gratitude. He was urged to have the ceremony of his coronation immediately performed; but this he delayed, in consequence of some designs which he had formed to reduce the exorbitant power of the clergy. Gustavus had himself embraced the doctrines of the reformed religion, and did all in his power to establish the reformation in his new kingdom. His design could not fail to raise against him the enmity of the clergy, and of all the more superstitious part of his subjects. Accordingly, the first years of his reign were embittered by internal disturbances and revolts, which were aided and fomented by the defeated Chriiern, who was at one time very near regaining possession of the Swedish dominions.\n\nChriiern having established a powerful interest in Norway, once more made an attempt to recover his lost attempt kingdoms, and was joined by the Dalecarlians; but being defeated by the Swedish forces, he forced to return to Norway, where, being obliged to capitulate with the Danish generals, he was kept prisoner all his life.\n\nIn 1542, Gustavus having happily extricated himself out of all his troubles, prevailed on the estates to make the crown hereditary in his family; after which he applied himself to the encouragement of learning and commerce. A treaty was set on foot for a marriage between his eldest son Eric and Elizabeth queen of England; but this negotiation failed of success.\n\nGustavus Vasa died in 1560, and was succeeded by his\nSweden. His son Eric XIV. The new king was possessed of all the exterior ornaments which give an air of dignity to the person; but he had neither the prudence nor the penetration of his father. He created the first nobility that were ever known in Sweden; but this he had no sooner done than he quarrelled with them, by passing some act, which they thought derogatory to their honour and dignity. The whole course of his reign was disturbed by wars with Denmark, and disputes with his own subjects. In the former he was unfortunate, and towards the latter he behaved with the greatest cruelty. At last, he is said to have become mad. He afterwards recovered his senses, but was soon dethroned by his brothers; of whom Duke John succeeded him in the kingdom.\n\nThis revolution took place in the year 1568, but with no great advantage to Sweden. Disputes about religion between the king and his brothers, and wars with Russia, threw matters into the utmost confusion. At last Prince Sigismund, the king's son, was chosen king of Poland, which proved the source of much trouble to the kingdom. In 1590 King John died; and as Sigismund was at a distance, everything fell into the utmost confusion: the treasury was plundered, and the royal wardrobe quite spoiled, before even Duke Charles could come to Stockholm to take on himself the administration until King Sigismund should return. This, however, was far from being the greatest disaster which befell the nation at this time. It was known that the king had embraced the Popish religion, and it was with good reason suspected that he would attempt to restore it upon his arrival in Sweden. Sigismund was also obliged, on leaving Poland, to promise that he would stay no longer in Sweden than was necessary to regulate his affairs. These circumstances served to alienate the minds of the Swedes from their sovereign even before they saw him; and the universal dissatisfaction was increased, by seeing him attended, on his arrival in Sweden in 1593, by the pope's nuncio, to whom he made a present of 30,000 ducats to defray the expenses of his journey to Sweden.\n\nWhat the people had foreseen was too well verified: the king refused to confirm the Protestants in their religious privileges, and showed such partiality on all occasions to the Papists, that a party was formed against him; at the head of which was Duke Charles his uncle. Remonstrances, accompanied with threats, took place on both sides. Sigismund was apparently reconciled to his brother, and promised to comply with the inclinations of the people, though without any inclination to perform what he had promised. The agreement, indeed, was scarcely made, before Sigismund conceived the horrid design of murdering his uncle at the Italian comedy acted the night after his coronation. The duke, however, having notice of the plot, found means to avoid it. This enraged the king so much, that he had resolved to accomplish his designs by force; and therefore commanded a Polish army to march towards the frontiers of Sweden, where they committed all the ravages that could be expected from an enraged and cruel enemy. Complaints were made by the Protestant clergy to the senate; but no other reply was made them, than that they should abstain from those bitter invectives and reproaches, which had provoked the Catholics, till the king's departure; at which time they would be at more liberty.\n\nIn 1595 Sigismund set sail for Dantzig, leaving the administration in the hands of Duke Charles. The consequence of this was, that the differences which had already taken place being continually increased by the obstinacy of the king, Duke Charles assumed the sovereign power; and in 1604 Sigismund was formally deposed. Sigismund and his uncle Charles IX. raised to the throne. He pro-deposed, gave a wife and brave prince, restoring the tranquillity of and is fact, the kingdom, and carrying on a war with vigour against Charles IX. Poland and Denmark. He died in 1611, leaving the kingdom to his son, the celebrated Gustavus Adolphus.\n\nThough Charles IX., by his wife and vigorous conduct had in a great measure retrieved the affairs of Sweden on den, they were still in a very bad situation. The finances of the kingdom were entirely drained by a series of wars and revolutions; powerful armies were preparing in Denmark, Poland, and Russia, while not only the Swedish troops were inferior in number to their enemies, but the government was destitute of resources for their payment.\n\nThough the Swedish laws required that the prince should have attained his 18th year before he was of age, yet such striking marks of the great qualities of Gustavus appeared, that he was allowed by the states to take over on him the administration even before this early period. His first act was to refuse all the crown-grants, that he might be the better able to carry on the wars in which he was engaged; and to fill all places, both civil and military, with persons of merit. At the head of domestic and foreign affairs was placed Chancellor Oxenstierna, a person every way equal to the important trust, and the choosing of whom impressed Europe with the highest opinion of the young monarch's penetration and capacity.\n\nSoon after his accession, Gustavus received an embassy from James I. of Britain, exhorting him to make peace with his neighbours. This was seconded by another from Holland. But as the king perceived that the Danish monarch intended to take every opportunity of crushing him, he resolved to act with such vigour, as might convince him that he was not easily to be overcome. Accordingly he invaded Denmark with three different armies at once; and though the enemy's superiority at sea gave them great advantages, and the number and abilities of the king's enemies distracted his attention, he carried on the war with such spirit, that in 1613 a peace concluded on good terms. This war being finished, the king applied himself to civil polity, and made some reformation in the laws of Sweden. In 1615, hostilities were commenced against Russia, on account of the refusal of that court to restore some money which had been formerly lent them. The king entered Ingria, took Kexholm by storm, and was laying siege to Plescov, when, by the mediation of James I., peace was concluded, on condition of the Russians repaying the money, and yielding to Sweden some part of their territory. In this and the former war, notwithstanding the shortness of their duration, Gustavus learned the rudiments of the military art for which he soon became so famous. Extraordinary, indeed, to have taken every opportunity of improving with a quickness of understanding seemingly tary genius more than human. In one campaign, he not only of the king-learned, but improved, all the military maxims of La Gardie, a celebrated general, brought the Swedish army to a more steady and regular discipline, and formed an invincible\nSweden. invincible body of Finns, who had afterwards a very considerable share in the victories of Sweden.\n\nPeace was no sooner concluded with Russia than Gustavus was crowned with great solemnity at Upsal. Soon after this he ordered his general La Gardie to acquaint the Polish commander Codzowicz, that as the truce between the two kingdoms, which had been concluded for two years, was now expired, he desired to be certainly informed whether he was to expect peace or war from his master. In the mean time, having borrowed money of the Dutch for the redemption of a town from Denmark, he had an interview on the frontiers with Christian the king of that country. At this interview, the two monarchs conceived the utmost esteem and friendship for each other; and Gustavus obtained a promise, that Christian would not affront Sigismund in any design he might have against Sweden. In the mean time, receiving no satisfactory answer from Poland, Gustavus began to prepare for war. Sigismund entered into a negociation, and made some pretended concessions, with a view to feign Gustavus by treachery; but the latter having intimation of his design, the whole negociation was changed into reproaches and threats on the part of Gustavus.\n\nImmediately after this, Gustavus made a tour in disguise through Germany, and married Eleonora the daughter of the elector of Brandenburg. He then resolved to enter heartily into a war with Poland; and with this view set sail for Riga with a great fleet, which carried 20,000 men. The place was well fortified, and defended by a body of veterans enthusiastically attached to Sigismund; but after a vigorous siege, the garrison being reduced to extremity, were obliged to capitulate, and were treated with great clemency.\n\nAfter the reduction of Riga, the Swedish monarch entered Courland, where he reduced Mitau; but ceded it again on the conclusion of a truce for one year. Sigismund, however, no sooner had time to recover himself, than he began to form new enterprises against the Swedes in Prussia; but Gustavus setting sail with his whole fleet for Dantzig, where the king of Poland then resided, so defeated his measures, that he was obliged to prolong the truce for another year. Sigismund, however, was not yet apprised of his danger, and refused to listen to any terms of accommodation: on which Gustavus entering Livonia, defeated the Polish general, and took Derpt, Hockenhausen, and several other places of less importance; after which, entering Lithuania, he took the city of Birden.\n\nNotwithstanding this success, Gustavus proposed peace on the same equitable terms as before; but Sigismund was still infatuated with the hopes that, by means of the emperor of Germany, he should be able to conquer Sweden. Gustavus finding him inflexible, resolved to push his good fortune. His generals Horn and Thurn defeated the Poles in Semigallia. Gustavus himself with 150 ships set sail for Prussia, where he landed at Pillaw. This place was immediately delivered up to him; as were several other places. Sigismund, alarmed at the great progress of Gustavus, sent a body of forces to oppose him, and to prevent Dantzig from falling into his hands. In this he was attended with as little success as before; and in May 1627, Gustavus arrived with fresh forces before Dantzig, which he would probably have carried, had he not been wounded in the belly by a cannon-shot. The States of Holland sent ambassadors to mediate a peace between the two crowns; but Sigismund, depending on the assistance of the emperor of Germany and king of Spain, determined to hearken to no terms, and resolved to make a winter campaign third time. Gustavus, however, was so well entrenched, and all his forts were so strongly garrisoned, that the utmost efforts of the Poles were to no purpose. The city of Dantzig in the mean time made such a desperate resistance as greatly irritated Gustavus. In a sea engagement the Swedish fleet defeated that of the enemy; after which defeated Gustavus, having blocked up the harbour with his fleet, by sea, and pushed his advances on the land side with incredible vigour. He made a surprising march over a morass 15 miles broad, afflided by bridges of a peculiar construction, over which he carried a species of light cannon invented by himself. By this unexpected manoeuvre he got the command of the city in such a manner, that the garrison were on the point of surrendering, when, by a sudden swell of the Vistula, the Swedish works were ruined, and the king was obliged to raise the siege. In obliged by other respects, however, the affairs of Gustavus went on with their usual good fortune. His general Wrangel defeated the Poles before Brodnitz. At Stum the king raised another and more considerable victory in person, siege.\n\nThe emperor had sent 5000 foot and 2000 horse under Arnhelm, who joined the main army commanded by the Polish general Contecpolski, in order to attack the Swedish army encamped at Quidzin. The enemy were so much superior in number, that the friends of Gustavus warmly dissuaded him from attacking them. But the king being determined, the engagement began in two engagements. The Swedish cavalry charged with such impetuosity, contrary to their sovereign's express order, that they were almost surrounded by the enemy; but Gustavus, coming up to their assistance, pushed the enemy's infantry with so much vigour, that they gave way, and retreated to a bridge that had been thrown over the Werder. But here they were disappointed; for the Swedes had already taken possession of the bridge. On this a new action ensued more bloody than the former, in which the king was exposed to great danger, and thrice narrowly escaped being taken prisoner; but at last the Poles were totally defeated, with immense loss. The slaughter of the German auxiliaries was so great, that Arnhelm scarcely carried off one half of the troops which he brought into the field. This defeat did not hinder the Polish general from attempting the siege of Stum; but here again he was attended by his usual bad fortune. Arnhelm was recalled, and succeeded by Henry of Saxe Lawenburg and Philip Count Mansfeldt.\n\nThe change of general officers, however, produced no effect, and good consequences to the Poles; a famine and plague obliged them to consent to a truce for six years, to expire in the fifth year of June 1635. Gustavus kept the port and citadel of Memel, the harbour of Pillau, the town of Elbing, Brunsberg, and all that he had conquered in Livonia.\n\nGustavus having thus brought the war with Poland to an honourable conclusion, began to think of resenting the conduct of the emperor in afflicting his enemies and oppressing the Protestant states. Before embarking for such an important undertaking, it was necessary that he should consult the diet. In this the propriety of engaging\nging in a war with Germany was warmly debated; but, after much altercation, Gustavus in a very noble speech determined the matter, and set forth in such strong terms the virtuous motives by which he was actuated, that the whole assembly wept, and every thing was granted which he could require.\n\nIt was not difficult for Gustavus to begin his expedition. His troops amounted to 62,000 men, hardened by a succession of severe campaigns in Russia, Finland, Livonia, and Prussia. His fleet exceeded 70 sail, carrying from 20 to 40 guns, and manned with 6000 seamen. Embarking his troops, he landed at Uledom on the 24th of June 1630, the Imperialists having evacuated all the fortresses which they possessed there; and the island of Rugen had been before reduced by General Leffy, in order to secure a retreat if fortune should prove unfavourable. Paffing the strait, Gustavus stormed Wolgast and another strong fortress in the neighbourhood, leaving a garrison for the defence of these conquests. He then proceeded to Stettin; which consented to receive a Swedish garrison, and the king persuaded the duke of Pomerania to enter into an alliance with him. In consequence of this the Swedish troops were received into several towns of Pomerania; and the most bitter enmity took place between the Imperialists and Pomeranians.\n\nThese successes of Gustavus struck the empire with consternation; for being already overwhelmed with civil dissensions, they were in no condition to resist so impetuous an enemy. At last Count Tilly was invested with the dignity of veldt marischalk. In the meantime the king being reinforced by a considerable body of troops in Finland and Livonia under the conduct of Gustavus Horn, defeated the Imperialists before Griftenhagen; taking the place soon after by assault. By this and some other conquests he opened a passage into Lusatia and Silesia; but in the mean time Count Tilly cut off 2000 Swedes at New Brandenburg. This advantage, however, was soon overbalanced by the conquest of Franckfort on the Oder, which Gustavus took by assault, making the whole garrison prisoners. Thus he commanded the rivers Elbe and Oder on both sides, and had a fair passage not only to the countries already mentioned, but also to Saxony and the hereditary dominions of the house of Austria. Soon after this, Gustavus laid siege to Landsberg, which he took by assault.\n\nAbout this time the Protestant princes held a diet at Leipzig; to which Gustavus sent deputies, and conducted his negotiations with such address, as tended greatly to promote his interests. Immediately after this he reduced Gripwald, and with it all Pomerania. Then marching to Gutrow, he restored the dukes of Mecklenburg to their dominions.\n\nAll this time Count Tilly was employed in the siege of Magdeburg; but now, being alarmed at the repeated successes of the Swedes, he left Pappenheim with part of the army before that city, while he marched with the rest into Thuringia, to attack the landgrave of Hesse-Cassal and the elector of Saxony. After a most obstinate defence, Magdeburg fell into the hands of Pappenheim, who committed there all imaginable cruelties. Gustavus formed a plan of recovering the city; but was obliged to abandon it, by Pappenheim's throwing himself into the place with his whole army, and by the progress which Tilly was making in Thuringia. Relinquishing this enterprise, therefore, he ordered an attack on Havelburg; which was done with such resolution, that the place was forced in a few hours, and all the garrison made prisoners. Werben was next obliged to submit after an obstinate conflict, in which many succumbed, and fell on both sides.—These successes obliged Count Tilly, the cavalry to attempt in person to check the progress of the Swedish perilists. He detached the vanguard of his army, composed of the defeated flower of the Imperial cavalry, within a few miles of the Swedish camp. An action ensued, in which Bernstein the Imperial general was defeated and killed, with 1500 of his men. Gustavus, after this advantage, placed himself in a situation so much superior to his enemies, that Count Tilly was fired with indignation, and marched up to the Swedish lines to give him battle. Gustavus kept within his works, and Tilly attacked his camp, though almost impregnable fortified, keeping up a mottled terrible fire from a battery of 32 pieces of cannon; which, however, produced no other effect, than obliging the Swedish monarch to draw up his army behind the walls of Werben. Tilly had placed his chief hopes in being able to spike the enemy's cannon, or fell by defeating fire to their camp; after which he proposed making his grand attack. With this view he bribed some prisoners; but they betrayed him, and told his design to Gustavus. The king ordered fires to be lighted in different parts of his camp, and his soldiers to imitate the noise of a tumultuous disorderly rabble. This had the desired effect. The count led his army to the breach made by the cannon; where he was received with such a volley of grape shot as cut off the first line, and put the whole body in disorder, so that they could never be brought back to the charge. In this confusion the Imperial army was attacked, and, after an obstinate conflict, obliged to quit the field.\n\nSoon after this action the queen arrived at the camp, with a reinforcement of 8000 men; at the same time a treaty was concluded with Charles I., of England, by a body of which that monarch allowed the marquis of Hamilton to British raise 6000 men for the service of Gustavus. These auxiliaries were to be conducted to the main army by a body of the 4000 Swedes; and were in every thing to obey the Swedes, while he was personally present, but in his absence were to be subject to the orders of the marquis. With these troops the king had resolved to make a diversion in Bremen; but the marquis finding it impossible to effect a junction with the Swedish army, resolved, without debarking his troops, to steer his course for the Oder, and land at Uledom. Gustavus was very much displeased at finding his project thus disconcerted; but, making the best of the present circumstances, he commanded the British troops to act on the Oder instead of the Weser. The number of this little army was magnified exceedingly by report, insomuch that Count Tilly had some thoughts of marching against them with his whole force; but on the departure of the marquis for Silesia, he reinforced the army in that country with a large detachment, which was thought to contribute not a little to the defeat he soon after received.\n\nSince the late action Gustavus had kept within his intrenchments, where his army was well provided with everything. Tilly made several attempts to surprise or draw him to an engagement; but finding all his endeavours fruitless, he marched into Saxony, and laid siege\nto Leipzig. This precipitate measure proved highly advantageous to the Swedish monarch. A treaty offensive and defensive was immediately concluded with Gustavus; and the elector willingly promised everything that was required of him. Tilly, in the meantime, carried fire and sword into the electorate. At the head of an army of 44,000 veterans, he summoned the city of Leipzig to surrender; denouncing the same vengeance against it as had been executed on Magdeburg, in case of a refusal. By this the governor was so much intimidated, that he instantly submitted; and also surrendered the castle of Paffenberg, which was in a condition to have stood out till the arrival of the Swedish army. The elector, enraged at the loss of these valuable places, ordered his army to join the Swedes with all expedition, and pressed the king so warmly to engage, that at last he yielded to his desire. On the 7th of September 1631, Gustavus led out his army in the finest order, the Swedes forming one column on the right, and the Saxons another on the left; each amounting to 15,000 men. Tilly drew up his men in one vast column, probably with a view of surrounding the flanks of the king's army. Gustavus led on his troops against that wing of the Imperialists commanded by Pappenheim, whom he drove back to a considerable distance. General Banner in the meantime cut in pieces the troops of Holstein, and mortally wounded the duke who commanded them. Pappenheim led on his troops seven times to the charge, but was as often repulsed by the Swedes. Tilly all this while was engaged with the Saxons; but having at last driven them off the field, the whole strength of the Imperial army was turned against the Swedish left wing. The Swedes sustained the attack with the greatest firmness, until the king detached the centre to assist them. The Imperialists then were no longer able to stand their ground; but gave way everywhere except in the centre, which was composed of 18 regiments of veterans accustomed to victory, and deemed invincible. They made incredible efforts to maintain their reputation; and, though swept off in great numbers by the Swedish artillery, never shrunk or fell into confusion. Four regiments, after their officers had been killed, formed themselves, and retired to the skirt of a wood. Tilly retired at the head of 600 men, and escaped by the coming on of the night. Seven thousand Imperialists lay dead on the field of battle; 4000 were taken prisoners; a fine train of artillery was lost, with upwards of 100 standards, ensigns, and other military trophies.\n\nGustavus now determined to penetrate into Franconia, where he reduced several places, especially the fortresses of Workburg. Tilly having collected his scattered troops, which formed an army still superior in number to that of Gustavus, marched to the relief of this place; but came too late. He then directed his march towards Rottenberg, where four regiments were cut in pieces by a Swedish detachment. After this the king reduced Hanau, Franckfort on the Maine, and Mentz; destroying a body of Spaniards, who had attempted to obstruct his passage.\n\nThe court of Vienna was now thrown into the utmost confusion; and sent everywhere begging assistance, and soliciting the Catholic princes to arm in defence of their religion. The emperor was most embarrassed in finding out a general capable of opposing Gustavus in the field; for the late misfortunes of Count Tilly had entirely sunk his reputation. Wallestein, an old experienced officer, was selected; but as he had formerly been disgraced, it was apprehended that he would not accept of the command of which he had once been deprived. This objection, however, was got over; and Wallestein not only by the accepted of the command, but, at his own expense, augmented the army to 40,000 men.\n\nDuring the whole winter the Swedish army kept the great field; and before the approach of summer had reduced a great number of places, while the landgrave William made great progress in Westphalia. Gustavus Horn was repelled before Bamberg; but soon had his revenge, by entirely destroying two regiments of imperialists. To prevent the troops from being affected by the loss before Bamberg, the king resolved to give battle to Tilly, who was marching into Bavaria to prevent the Swedes from gaining a footing in that electorate. He pursued the Imperial general through a vast tract of country, defeated his rear-guard, and, having reduced a variety of towns and fortresses on the Danube, penetrated as far as Ulm. Advancing to the river Leck, Count Tilly posted himself in a wood on the opposite side, to dispute his passage. Gustavus endeavoured to dislodge him by a regular fire from 70 pieces of cannon. The slaughter was dreadful; and Tilly himself, being wounded by a cannon-ball in the knee, died a few days before he was to have been superceded by Wallestein. The following night the Imperial army evacuated the post. Gustavus immediately crossed the river, and seized the towns of Rain and Newburg, which the enemy had abandoned, and Augsburg next submitted.\n\nFrom Augsburg the Swedes advanced towards Ratibon; but were disappointed in their design of getting possession of that city, as the Bavarians had thrown a numerous garrison into the place.—In the mean time, ambassadors arrived from Denmark, offering the mediation of that crown for obtaining a lasting peace between the contending parties. This negotiation, however, failed of success, as the ambassadors had not been instructed to offer terms favourable to the Protestants. Gustavus now, resolving to retort on themselves the cruelties which the Bavarians had inflicted on the Protestants, laid the towns of Morzborg, Friesengen, and Landshut, in ashes. The inhabitants of Munich saved themselves by submission; Gustavus also defeated the forces of the elector, who had been joined by a considerable body of militia.\n\nWhile Gustavus was thus employed, Wallestein had assembled a vast army. He was strongly solicited by the elector of Bavaria to come to his assistance; but, in revenge of the elector's having formerly obtained the command for Count Tilly in preference to himself, he drew off towards Bohemia to encounter the Saxons. Arneheim, who commanded the Saxon forces in that place, was an enemy to Gustavus, who had formerly rallied him for his cowardice. He therefore permitted the Saxon Wallenstein to gain an easy victory, in hopes that his troops defeated by Wallenstein, the elector of Saxony, a prince entirely devoted to his pleasures, might be induced to relinquish the friendship of such a restless and warlike ally as Gustavus; and indeed he used all the eloquence of which he was master to detach him from the Swedish cause. Several advantages, in the mean time, were gained by the Imperialists. Pappenheim defeated the archbishop of Bremen's cavalry at Werden; and three Swedish regiments were\nwere cut off near Kadingen. Pappenheim, however, was forced to retire, and withdraw his forces from Stade; of which the Swedes took possession. Wallenstein and the elector of Bavaria, who had now joined their forces, threatened Gustavus with greatly superior numbers. At last, however, the king, being reinforced with 15,000 men, no longer declined the engagement; but Wallenstein was too wise to trust the fate of the empire to a single battle against such an enemy as the king of Sweden. Gustavus attacked his camp, but was repulsed with the loss of 2000 men. Several other misfortunes happened to the Swedes; and at last, after various manoeuvres, Wallenstein bent his course towards Münster, in order to oblige the elector of Saxony to declare against the Swedes, and to draw them out of Bavaria. Gustavus, notwithstanding the inconstancy of Augustus, immediately set out to assist him. With incredible diligence he marched to Münster, where the Imperialists were assembling their whole strength. Hearing that the enemy were encamped at Wefenfeld, and that Pappenheim had been detached with a strong corps, Gustavus resolved to engage them before they could effect a junction. With this view he marched to Lutzen, where he attacked Wallenstein with incredible fury. The Swedish infantry broke the Imperialists in spite of their utmost efforts, and took all their artillery. The cavalry not being able to pass the river so expeditiously as the king thought necessary, he led the way, attended only by a single regiment and the duke of Saxe-Lauenburg. Here, after charging impetuously, he was killed. The news of his death was in an instant spread over both armies. The courage of the Imperialists revived, and they now made themselves sure of victory. But the Swedes, eager to revenge the death of their beloved monarch, charged with such fury that nothing could resist them. The Imperialists were defeated a second time, just as Pappenheim, with his fresh corps, came up to their assistance. On this the battle was renewed, but the Swedes were still irresistible. Pappenheim was mortally wounded, and his army finally routed, with the loss of 9000 killed in the field and in the pursuit.\n\nThis victory proved more unfortunate to Sweden than the greatest defeat. The crown devolved on Christina, the daughter of Gustavus, an infant of six years old; the nation was engaged in an expensive foreign war, without any person equal to the arduous task of commanding the armies, or regulating domestic affairs, as Gustavus had done. Christina was immediately proclaimed queen. The regency devolved on the grand bailiff, the marshal, the high admiral, the chancellor, and the treasurer of the crown. Oxenstiern was invested with the chief management of affairs, and conducted himself with the greatest prudence. The reign and character of Christina have been fully detailed under the article CHRISTINA, to which we may refer our readers.\n\nFrom the treaty of Westphalia, Sweden enjoyed some years of repose. Charles Gustavus, Count Palatine, having gained the favour of Christina, was appointed generalissimo of the forces, and heir-apparent to the crown. A marriage was proposed between them; but the queen would never listen to this or any other proposal of the kind. In 1650, the ceremony of the queen's coronation was performed; but in four years after, she resigned the crown in favour of Gustavus. (See the article CHRISTINA).\n\nVol. XX. Part I.\nSweden.\n\nrecompended by a complete victory gained by Adolphus the king's brother and General Wrangel. In the mean time the king was taking measures for laying siege to Dantzig; but was prevented by the Dutch, who threatened to oppose him, unless a proper regard was paid to their interest. Charles accordingly granted them advantageous terms; and afterwards gained over the elector of Brandenburg, by ceding to him the sovereignty of Prussia, that he might be at liberty to turn his whole strength against Poland.\n\nBy the treaty just concluded with the elector, the latter was to assist Charles in his war with Poland; but the elector had so procrastinated matters, that the Poles, having obtained assistance from the Tartars, had reduced the city of Warsaw. The two princes, however, now marched in concert against their enemies, who were encamped in a strong situation in the neighbourhood of the city above-mentioned, their camp being fronted by the Vistula. The Poles were driven from their entrenchments with prodigious slaughter. The Poles and Tartars then laboured to break the alliance; with which view they entered Ducal Prussia, and defeated the electoral army, taking many prisoners. The Swedes soon had their revenge. General Steinbock attacked the same Polish army at Philippowa, and overthrew it with such slaughter as obliged the Poles for that season to quit the field. A more formidable enemy than the Poles now began to make their appearance. The Russians invaded the provinces of Carelia, Ingermania, and Livonia; while the elector of Brandenburg began to waver in his fidelity. To preserve this only ally at such a critical juncture, Charles was obliged to give him more advantageous terms than those already mentioned; while the Russians were repulsed in the provinces of Carelia and Ingermania. But in Livonia they had better success. See Russia. For seven months, however, they battered the walls of Riga, without venturing to pass the ditch or storm the practicable breaches.\n\nCharles, notwithstanding the number of his enemies, was now become so formidable by the valour and discipline of his troops, that whole armies often fled on his approach. At last, in 1657, the Poles, finding they could not resist him in the field, contented themselves with harassing the Swedes on their march, and cutting off the foragers and convoys. This proved much more destructive to the Swedes than their former method; so that Charles was obliged to enter into an alliance with Ragotki prince of Transylvania, by affording him certain provinces in his neighbourhood, in order to furnish himself with irregular troops, who might fight the Poles in their own way. This, however, proved of no real advantage; for the confederates, after wasting a whole campaign in Lithuania, were obliged to return without accomplishing more than the reduction of a single fortress; on which Charles returned with the Swedish army to Prussia.\n\nLeopold, the young king of Hungary, having long beheld the Swedes with a jealous eye, now resolved to declare for Poland. The more effectually to curb the ambition of the Swedish monarch, he solicited the king of Denmark to come to a rupture with him. This was instantly complied with, and the Danes invaded Bremen. Charles hastened to oppose this new enemy; which gave such offence to Ragotki, that he neglected to take the proper measures for his own defence in the absence of the Swedes, and suffered his army to be destroyed by the Poles and Tartars. At the same time the Turks invaded Transylvania, under pretence that Ragotki, being a vassal of the Grand Signior, had no right to invade Poland without his leave. Ragotki opposed them in the field; where he was defeated and killed, leaving Charles destitute of the only ally on whom he could depend.\n\nThe king, however, not dismayed by this misfortune, traversed Pomerania and the duchy of Mecklenburg; after which he attacked Holstein, while General Wrangel with another corps entered the duchy of Bremen. The latter executed his measures with the utmost vigour. In 15 days he retaken all the towns which the enemy had reduced; defeated and drove the Danish and Swedish forces out of the country, killing 3000 of their best soldiers. In Holstein the king reduced several fortresses, laid Itzehoe in ashes, defeated a body of Danes, and laid siege to Frederic Udda, into which the Danes had thrown a strong garrison. The conduct of this siege he left to Wrangel, he himself retiring to Wismar in order to oblige the situation of affairs in Poland; but no sooner was he gone than Wrangel attacked the place with such fury, that he became master of it in two hours. In the province of Halland the Swedes were defeated; but the enemy derived no advantage from their victory; at sea the fleets met, and maintained an engagement for two days, without any considerable advantage on either side. In Poland affairs were not better conducted. The house of Austria had now declared war against Sweden.\n\nThe king of Sweden was now surrounded by enemies. The elector of Brandenburg had declared against him; and he had besides to engage the armies of Austria, Poland, Russia, and Denmark. In this dangerous situation he resolved to attack Denmark, so as to oblige that power to come to a speedy accommodation. His designs were forwarded by a very early frost, which enabled him to transport his troops without shipping. Having passed over on the ice to the island of Funen, he cut in pieces a body of 4000 Danish soldiers and 300 peasants. The whole island was reduced in a few days; after which he passed to Langland, then to Laaland, after that to Falster, and lastly to Zealand. The Danes were terrified at this unexpected invasion, and were giving themselves up to despair, when Charles offered to conclude a peace on equitable terms. The king of Denmark gladly consented; intending to renew the war as soon as thought it could be done with safety.\n\nCharles was no sooner retired, than the king of Denmark began to act secretly against him; on which, resolving to anticipate him in his designs, he appeared unexpectedly with a fleet before Copenhagen. The Swedish monarch laid siege to the capital, but with so little renewed prudence that he made no progress, and was at length compelled to turn the siege into a blockade, which continued to the end of the war. Charles X. died of an epidemic fever, and was succeeded by his son Charles XI.\n\nThe new king Charles XI. was a minor at the time of his father's death; and as the kingdom was involved in a dangerous war with so many enemies, the regency determined to conclude a peace, if it could be obtained on\nSweden on reasonable terms. A treaty was accordingly concluded at Oliva; by which Casimir renounced his pretensions to the crown of Poland, and that republic gave up all pretensions to Livonia, Bornholm and Drontheim were ceded to Denmark; and an equivalent in Schonen remained with Sweden. During the minority of the king, nothing remarkable occurs in the history of Sweden. In 1672 he entered into alliance with Louis XIV, which two years after involved him in a war with the elector of Brandenburg. At first the Swedes carried all before them. Almost all the towns in Brandenburg were reduced, when the elector arrived with an army to the relief of his distressed subjects. He took several towns, defeated the Swedes in a general engagement, and soon after forced them to abandon all their conquests. In conjunction with the Danes, he then invaded the Swedish dominions; many places of importance were reduced; and, in 1676, Sweden received a most destructive blow by the defeat of her fleet in an engagement with the combined fleets of Denmark and Holland. Soon after this the king took the government into his own hands, and in some degree restored the fortune of Sweden; but though matters went on in a more prosperous way where the king commanded in person, the same losses and disgrace attended the Swedish arms in every other quarter. In 1678, the Swedish fleet was defeated in two engagements. At Landeroon a most obstinate battle was fought from ten in the morning till six at night; when both parties were obliged, by fatigue, to retire to their respective camps. At Oldeval in Norway, the Swedes were defeated; and the Danes laid desolate the islands of Oeland, Småland, Unno, and Kumo; while the electoral troops and Imperialists reduced Count Königsmark to the utmost distress in the neighbourhood of Stralund.\n\nIn this deplorable situation of affairs Count Königsmark found an opportunity of attacking his enemies to such advantage, that he obtained a complete victory; after which he ravaged the duchy of Mecklenburg. Notwithstanding this success, he could not prevent the elector from reducing Stralund; after which he was obliged to evacuate Pomerania; and, to complete his distress, the fleet which transported the Swedish army from Pomerania was wrecked on the coast of Bornholm.\n\nIn this unprosperous situation of affairs a peace was concluded at St Germain's between France and her enemies, by which the Swedes and Danes were left to decide their quarrel by themselves. Denmark was by no means a match for Sweden, even in the distressed situation to which she was reduced; and therefore a treaty was concluded, on terms much more favourable to Sweden than could have been expected; and the peace was confirmed by a marriage between Charles and Ulrica Eleonora, daughter to the king of Denmark. From this time the Swedish monarch applied himself to the reformation of the state; and by artfully managing the disputes between the nobility and peasants, he obtained a decree empowering him to alter the constitution as he pleased. The proceedings of the king after this decree were such as to exasperate the nobility, and produce violent commotions. See Patkul.\n\nOn the 15th of April 1697, died Charles XI, leaving his crown to his son, the celebrated Charles XII, at that time a minor. On his accession he found himself Sweden, under the tuition of his grandmother Eleonora, who had governed the kingdom during the minority of the late king. Though Charles was at that time only 15 years old, and is of age, he showed a desire of taking the government into his own hands. His counsellors, Count Piper and Axel Sparre, signified his desire to the queen-regent. They were by her referred to the estates; and there all were unanimous: so that the queen, finding that opposition would be vain, resigned her power with a good grace; and Charles was invested with absolute authority in three days after he had expressed his desire of reigning himself alone. He was scarcely seated on the throne when a powerful combination was formed against him. Augustus II, king of Poland, formed designs on Livonia; the king of Denmark revived the disputes he had with the duke of Holstein, as a prelude to a war with Sweden; and Peter the Great of Russia began to form designs on Ingria, formerly a province of Russia. In 1699 the king of Denmark marched an army into Holstein. Charles sent a considerable body of troops to the duke's assistance; but before their arrival the Danes had ravaged Holstein, taken the castle of Gottorp, and laid close siege to Tonningen. Here the king of Denmark commanded in person; and was assisted by the troops of Saxony, Brandenburg, Wolfenbüttel, and Hesse Cassel. England and Holland, as guarantees of the last treaty with Denmark, in concert with Sweden, joined Charles against this confederacy, and sent fleets to the Baltic. They proposed a termination of the war on equitable terms; but these were haughtily refused by the Danish monarch, who despised the youth and inexperience of Charles, and relied too much on the alliance he had formed with Saxony, Brandenburg, Poland, and Russia. Tonningen, however, resisted all his efforts; and when he ordered the place to be stormed, he had the mortification to see his troops driven headlong from the walls by a handful of Swedes.\n\nIn the year 1700, Charles, having entrusted the affairs of the nation with a council chosen out of the senate, set out from Stockholm on the 8th May from his capital, to which he never afterwards returned. He embarked at Carlstede the fleet of crown, and defeated the fleet of the allies. Having made a descent on the island of Zealand, he defeated a body of cavalry that opposed his march, and then proceeded to invest Copenhagen by sea and land. The king of Denmark then saw the necessity of either having his capital destroyed, or of doing justice to the duke of Holstein. He chose the latter; and a treaty was concluded on Obliges the much the same terms as formerly. Charles, being thus at liberty to turn his arms against the other princes who had conspired his destruction, resolved to lead his army against Augustus king of Poland. On the road, however, he received intelligence that the tsar of Russia was against him on his march to oppose him, and had laid siege to Narva with an army of 100,000 men. The contest that ensued between Charles and Peter, with the celebrated battles of Narva and Poltava, have been already related under Russia, so that we shall here confine ourselves chiefly to those events in which Peter the Great was not immediately concerned.\n\nThe Tsar Peter was the chief support of Augustus, and he took the most active measures to oppose the progress of the Swedish monarch. His want of success, and the subsequent\nsequent contests between him and Charles, till the decisive battle of Pultava are related in the article Russia.\n\nIn 1701, as early as the season permitted, Charles, having received a reinforcement from Sweden, took the field, and appeared suddenly on the banks of the Duna, along which the Saxon army was posted to receive him. The king of Poland being at that time sick, the army was commanded by Ferdinand duke of Courland, Marshal Stenau, and General Paykel, all officers of valour and experience. They had fortified certain islands in the mouth of the river, and taken every other precaution against an attack; the soldiers were hardy, well disciplined, and nearly equal to the Swedes in number; yet Charles, having passed the river in boats with high sides, to screen the men from the fire of the enemy, attacked them with such fury, that they were entirely defeated with great loss.\n\nThis victory was followed by the surrender of all the towns and fortresses in the duchy of Courland. Charles then passed into Lithuania, where every town opened its gates to him. At Birken, an army of 20,000 Ruthenians retired with the utmost precipitation on the news of his approach. Here Charles, perceiving that the kingdom of Poland was greatly disaffected to Augustus, began to project the scheme of dethroning him by means of his own subjects. This scheme he executed with more policy than he ever showed on any other occasion.\n\nAugustus, in the mean time, finding his scheme of peace frustrated, had recourse to the senate; but met with such a rough answer from them, that he determined to apply to Charles. To him therefore he sent his chamberlain; but a passport being forgotten, the ambassador was arrested. Charles continued his march to Warsaw, which surrendered on the first summons; but the citadel held out for some days. Augustus, finding at last that no dependence was to be placed on the Poles, determined to trust his fortune wholly to the Saxon army and the nobility of the palatinate of Cracow, who offered to support him to the utmost of their power. The Saxon army was now advanced to the frontiers, and Augustus immediately put himself at its head. Being joined by the nobility of Cracow, he found his forces to amount to 30,000 men, all brave and well-disciplined. With these he marched in quest of his enemy; who did not decline the combat, though he had with him only 12,000 men. Though the Saxons were strongly posted, having their front covered by a morass, besides being fortified with pallisades and chevaux de frise, they were attacked with irresistible impetuosity, and entirely defeated.\n\nThis victory was followed by the loss of Cracow: after which Charles set out in pursuit of the flying army, with a design of preventing them from re-assembling; but his horse falling under him, he had the misfortune to break his thigh, by which he was confined six weeks; and thus Augustus obtained some respite. He improved this interval. Having convoked a diet first at Marienburg, and then at Lublin, he obtained the following resolutions; that an army of 50,000 men should be raised by the republic for the service of the prince; that five weeks should be allowed the Swedes to determine whether they were for war or peace; and that the same time should be granted to the turbulent and discontented nobles of Poland to make their concessions. To counteract the effects of these resolutions, Charles assembled another diet at Warsaw; and while the two assemblies disputed concerning their rights and privileges, he recovered from his wound, received a strong reinforcement from Pomerania, and utterly defeated and dispersed the remains of the Saxon army.\n\nThe ill fortune of Augustus continued still to prevail. In 1704 he was formally deposed by the diet, and the crown conferred by Charles on Stanislaus Leszczinsky, palatine of Posenia. Augustus, however, did not yet tamely give up his kingdom. His adherents daily swarmed with the Swedes; and Augustus himself, being reinforced by 9000 Ruthenians, retook Warsaw, and was near surprising the new king, who lived in perfect security in the city while Charles fought in his cause. Count Horn, with 1500 Swedes, vigorously defended the citadel; but at last, finding it no longer tenable, he was obliged to surrender at discretion. The reduction of Warsaw was among the last advantages gained by Augustus in the course of this war. His troops were now composed of Saxon recruits and undisciplined Poles, who had no attachment to his person, and were ready on all occasions to forswear him. Charles and Stanislaus advanced with the victorious army; the Saxons fled before them, and the towns several miles round sent him their submissions. The Poles and Saxons were under the command of Schullemburg, a most sagacious and experienced general, who used every expedient to check the progress of the Swedes. With all his conduct and caution, he found himself outwitted, and Charles in the neighbourhood of his camp ready to fall on him, while he thought him at 50 leagues distance. The Swedish monarch attacked him with a superior army, but entirely composed of horse. Schullemburg had posted his men in such a manner as rendered it impossible to surround them. His first rank being armed with pikes and fusées, presented a kind of rampart of bayonets; the second line flopping over the first who kneeled, fired over their heads, while the third rank, who stood upon their feet, kept up an incessant fire, by which the Swedish horse were exceedingly alarmed and put in disorder. Charles lost the opportunity of cutting off the whole Saxon army, by omitting to order his men to dismount. This was almost the first time that infantry had been regularly opposed to cavalry, and the superiority of the former was evident. After the engagement had continued about three hours, the Saxons retreated in good order; treat which no enemy had ever done before in any engagement with Charles. The Swedes pursued their enemies towards the Oder, and forced them to retreat through thick woods, almost impervious even to infantry. The Swedish horse, however, pushed their way, and at last inclosed Schullemburg between a wood and the river, where Charles had no doubt of obliging him to surrender at discretion, or die sword in hand, as having neither boats nor bridges; but the genius of Schullemburg supplied every defect. In the night he ordered planks and floats of trees to be fastened together; on which he carried over his troops, while the Swedes were employed in dilogging 300 men, which he had placed in a windmill, for the purpose of defending his flank and keeping the enemy in play. Charles spoke of this retreat with admiration, and said he had been conquered by Schullemburg.\n\nNo material advantage, however, resulted from this to Augustus; who was again obliged to leave Poland, and leaves Pofortify land.\nfortify the capital of his hereditary dominions, which he expected every moment to be invested. In the meantime the Russians having recovered their spirits, attacked the Swedes in Livonia with the utmost fury. Narva, Dorpt, and several other towns, were taken, and the inhabitants and garrisons treated with great barbarity. Soon after, an army of 100,000 Russians entered Poland. Sixty thousand Cossacks under Mazepa entered the country at the same time, and ravaged everything with the fury of barbarians. Schulenberg, too, perhaps more formidable than either, advanced with 14,000 Saxons and 7000 Russians, disciplined in Germany, and reputed excellent soldiers. Could numbers have determined the event of war, the Swedes must certainly have been at this time overpowered. Instead of this, however, Charles seemed to triumph over his enemies with more ease the more numerous they were. The Russians were defeated so fast, that they were all dispersed before one party had notice of the misfortunes of another. The defeating an army of 40,000 men scarcely obstructed the march of the Swedes, while their astonished enemies looked on these actions as the effects of witchcraft, and imagined that the king of Sweden had dealings with infernal spirits. With these apprehensions they fled beyond the Dniepr, leaving the unhappy Augustus to his fate. Schulenberg, with all his skill and experience, succeeded no better. The Swedish general Renschchild engaged and defeated him in half an hour, though the Swedes were vastly inferior in number, and their enemies posted in a most advantageous situation. Nothing could be more complete than this victory. This extraordinary victory, indeed, is said to have been owing to a panic which seized the troops of Schulenberg; but it was regarded with admiration, and thought to make the renown of Renschchild equal to that of his sovereign. Charles himself was jealous, and could not help exclaiming, \"Surely Renschchild will not compare himself with me!\"\n\nSoon after this victory, which was gained on the 12th of February, 1706, Charles entered Saxony at the head of 24,000 men. The diet at Ratibon declared him an enemy to the empire if he crossed the Oder. But to this declaration no regard was paid. Charles pursued his march; while Augustus was reduced to the condition of a vagrant in Poland, where he possessed not a single town except Cracow. Into this city he threw himself with a few Saxon, Polish, and Russian regiments, and began to erect some fortifications for its defense; but the approach of the Swedish general Meyerfeldt, and the news of the invasion of Saxony, disconcerted all his measures, and threw him into despair. The Russians indeed were his faithful allies; but he dreaded them almost as much as the Swedes: so that he was reduced to the necessity of writing a letter to Charles with his own hand, begging for peace on whatever terms he thought proper to grant. However, as he was then at the mercy of the Russians, this transaction was concealed with the greatest care. His emissaries were introduced to the Swedish court in the night-time; and being presented to Charles, received the following answer: That King Augustus should for ever renounce the crown of Poland, acknowledge Stanislaus, and promise never to reassert the throne, should an opportunity offer; that he should release the princes Sobieski, and all the Swedish prisoners made in the course of the war; surrender Patkul, at that time resident at his court as ambassador for the Sweden.\n\nCharles wrote with his own hand, and delivered to Count Piper, ordering him to finish them with the Saxon ambassadors.\n\nAfter his defeat at Pultava by the Russians, Charles fled in a mean calash, attended by a little troop inviolably attached to his person, some on foot, and some on horseback. They were obliged to cross a sandy desert, where neither herb nor tree was to be seen, and where the burning heat and want of water were more intolerable than the extremities of cold they had formerly suffered. The whole had almost perished for Charles' want of water, when a spring was fortunately discovered; after which they reached Otchakoff, a town in Turkey after his Turkish dominions, the bailiff of which supplied the king with every necessary. It was some time, however, before boats could be got ready for transporting the whole of the king's attendants; by which accident 500 Swedes and Cossacks fell into the hands of the enemy. This loss affected him more than all his other misfortunes. He shed tears at seeing across the river Bog, the greater part of his few remaining friends carried into captivity, without having it in his power to assist them. The bailiff waited on him to apologize for the delay, and was severely reprimanded by Charles, as if he had been his own subject.\n\nThe king remained but a few days at Otchakoff, when the feraquier of Bender sent an aga to compliment him on his arrival in the Turkish dominions, and to invite him to that city. Here he was treated with kindly hospitality: the Turks practiced to its fullest extent their generous maxim of regarding as favored the persons of his fortunate princes who had taken shelter in their dominions; and perhaps regarded him, notwithstanding his Russian misfortunes, as an ally that might be useful to themselves against the Russians. Every one, indeed, regarded him in his distress. The French king offered him a safe passage from the Levant to Marfeilles, from whence he might easily return to his own dominions. But Charles was too obstinate to receive advice. Puffed up with the notion of imitating Alexander the Great, he disdained to return except at the head of a numerous army; and he yet expected, by means of the Turks, to dethrone his adversary the tsar. Negotiations for this purpose were carried on in the Turkish divan; and it was proposed to escort Charles with a numerous army to the frontiers of Poland; but the revolution which took place there, put an end to all such projects. Augustus thought himself no longer bound to observe the treaty which he had made, than while Charles was at hand to compel him. After the battle of Pultava, he entered Poland, and took every measure, in concert with the tsar, for the recovery of his kingdom. Stanislaus was not able to stand before such enemies, but was obliged to leave his dominions and fly to Bender, in the disguise of a Swedish officer, in order to share the fortune of Charles.—It was not in Poland alone that the Swedish affairs began to suffer in consequence of the defeat at Pultava. The Danes invaded the province of Schonen with an army of 13,000 foot and 2,500 horse. Only 13,000 Swedish forces remained to defend all the territories possessed by Charles in Germany; and of these only a small part was allotted for the defense of Schonen.\nThe regency of Sweden, however, excited themselves to the utmost to repel this ungenerous invasion; and having collected an army of 12,000 militia and 8,000 regulars, dispatched them under General Steenbock into Schonen. Some Saxon troops were incorporated in this army; and among these a prodigious defection took place, which the general found it impossible to prevent; and thus the Danes gained several advantages, and at last took Christianstadt. Their insolence on this success was so great, that the Swedes demanded to be instantly led against them. Here the good fortune of Sweden seemed once more to revive. The Danes were driven from a very strong situation, with the loss of 3,000 killed and taken prisoners, besides a vast number wounded. The king received the intelligence of this victory with the greatest exultation; and could not help exclaiming, \"My brave Swedes, should it please God that I once more join you, we shall conquer them all!\"\n\nIn the mean time, Charles, by means of his agents the count Poniatoffski and the fieur Neugebar, used his utmost efforts to procure a rupture between the Porte and Russia. For a long time the money bestowed by Peter on the vizirs and janissaries prevailed; but at last, in 1711, the grand signior, influenced by his mother, who was strongly in the interest of Charles, and had been used to call him her lion, determined to support his quarrel with Peter. He therefore gave orders to the vizir to fall on the Russians with an army of 200,000 men. The vizir promised obedience; but at the same time professed his ignorance in the art of war, and disliked the present expedition. The khan of Crim Tartary, who had been gained over by the reputation and presents of the king of Sweden, had orders to take the field with 40,000 of his men, and had the liberty of assembling his army at Bender, that Charles might see that the war was undertaken on his account. See Russia, No. 119.\n\nThe treaty of the Pruth was most violently opposed by Count Poniatoffski and the khan of Tartary. The former had made the king acquainted with the situation of both armies; on which he instantly set out from Bender, filled with the hopes of fighting the Russians, and taking ample vengeance. Having ridden 50 leagues post, he arrived at the camp just as the tsar was drawing off his half-familiarized troops. He alighted at Poniatoffski's tent; and being informed of particulars, instantly flew into a rage to the vizir, whom he loaded with reproaches, and accused of treachery. Recollecting himself, however, he proposed a method by which the fault might be remedied; but finding his proposal rejected, he posted back to Bender, after having by the grossest insults showed his contempt of the vizir.\n\nThe violent behaviour of Charles did not promote his interest. The vizir perceived that his stay in Turkey might prove fatal to himself; and therefore determined to get him out of the country as soon as possible. Succeeding vizirs adopted the same plan; and at last the grand signior himself wrote a letter to Charles, in which he desired him to depart by next winter, promising to supply him with a sufficient guard, with money, and every thing else necessary for his journey. Charles gave an evasive answer, and determined to procrastinate his journey, as well to gratify his own stubborn temper, as because he discovered a correspondence between Augustus and the khan of Tartary, the object of which, he had reason to believe, was to betray him to the Saxons. When he was again pressed to fix the day of his departure, he replied, that he could not think of going before his debts were paid. Being asked how much was necessary for this purpose, he replied, 1,000 purfes (A). Twelve hundred purfes were instantly sent to the serefquier at Bender, with orders to deliver them to the king of Sweden, but not before he should have begun his journey. By fair promises, Charles persuaded him to part with the money; after which, instead of letting out, he squandered away his treasure in presents and gratifications, and then demanded 1,000 purfes more before he would set out. The serefquier was astonished at this behaviour. He shed tears; and, turning to the king, told him, that his head would be the forfeit of having obliged him with the money. The grand signior, on being acquainted with the shameful behaviour of Charles, flew into a rage, and called an extraordinary divan, where he himself spoke, a thing very unusual for the Turkish monarchs. It was unanimously agreed that such a troublesome guest ought to be removed by force, should other means fail. Positive or negative, the Turks were therefore sent to Charles to depart; and, in case of refusal, to attack him in his quarters. Nothing could equal his obstinacy on this occasion: in spite of the menaces of his enemies, in spite of the intrigues of his friends, he persisted in his resolution; and at last His determination to resist, with 300 Swedes, being all the retinue attendants he had, an army of 20,000 janissaries well armed and furnished with cannon. At length he was attacked in good earnest; though it must be owned, that even in this extremity, the Turks showed their regard to him, and were tender of his life, which the king did not return at all in a similar manner. Most of the Swedes surrendered at once, perhaps as thinking it the only method of saving the king's life. This misconduct, however, had a quite contrary effect. Charles became the more obstinate, the more desperate his affairs seemed to be. With 40 mental servants only, and the generals Isabend by all Hord and Dardorff, he determined to defend himself to the last extremity. Seeing his soldiers lay down their arms, he told the generals, \"We must now defend the house. Come, (adds he with a smile), let us fight pro aris et focis.\" The house had been already forced by the Tartars, all but a hall which was near the door, and where his domestics had assembled. Charles forced his way through the janissaries, attended by the generals Hord and Dardorff, joined his people, and then barricaded the door. The moment he entered, the enemy, who were in the house, threw down their booty, and endeavoured to escape at the windows. Charles pursued them from room to room with much bloodshed, and cleared the house in a few minutes. He then fired like fury from the windows, killed 200 of the Turks in a madman, a quarter of an hour, so that the bailaw who commanded them was at length forced to set the house on fire, with all his followers.\n\n(A) Each purfle contained 30 sequins.\nThis was done by arrows with lighted matches shot into the roof; but Charles, instead of quitting it, gave orders for extinguishing the fire, in which he himself assisted with great diligence. All efforts, however, were vain: the roof fell in; and Charles, with his few faithful companions, was ready to be buried in the ruins. In this extremity one called out, that there was a necessity for surrendering. \"What a strange fellow!\" (cries the king), who would rather be a prisoner with the Turks than mix his ashes with those of his sovereign.\" Another had the presence of mind to cry out, that the chancery was but 50 paces off; had a stone roof, and was proof against fire. Pleaded with the thoughts of again coming to blows, the king exclaimed, \"A true Swede! Let us take all the powder and ball we can carry.\" He then put himself at the head of his troops, and fell out with such fury, that the Turks retreated 50 paces; but falling down in the hurry, they rushed upon him, and carried him by the legs and arms to the bawhaw's tent.\n\nThis extraordinary adventure, which favours not a little of infancy, happened on the 12th of February 1713. He was now kept prisoner, with all his retinue; and in this situation he was visited by the unfortunate Stanislaus.\n\nCharles at last seemed inclined to submit to his fate, and began seriously to think of returning to his kingdom, now reduced to the most deplorable situation. His habitation was now fixed at Demotica, a small town about five leagues from Adrianople. Here he was allowed presents for his own table and those of his retinue; but only 25 crowns a day in money, instead of 500 which he had received at Bender. During his residence here he received a deputation from Hesse Cassel, soliciting his consent to the marriage of the landgrave with Eleonora, princess royal of Sweden; to which he readily agreed: a deputation was also sent him by the regency of Sweden, requesting that he would prepare for returning to his own dominions, which were ready to sink under a ruinous war in his absence.\n\nOn the 14th of October 1714, Charles set out for Sweden. All the princes through whole territories he was to pass, had given orders for his entertainment in the most magnificent manner; but the king, perceiving that these compliments only rendered his imprisonment and other misfortunes more conspicuous, suddenly dismissed his Turkish attendants, and assembling his own people, bid them take no care about him, but make the best of their way to Stralund. After this he set out post, in the habit of a German officer, attended only by Colonel During. Keeping the bye-roads through Hungary, Moravia, Austria, Bavaria, Württemberg, the Palatinate, Westphalia, and Mecklenburg, he arrived on the 21st of November at midnight before the gates of Stralund. Being unknown, he was admitted with difficulty; but being soon recognised by the governor, the greatest tokens of joy were thrown all over the town. In the midst of the tumult Charles went to bed.\n\nSweden was now in the greatest distress. On the news of the defeat at Pultava, the Danes had invaded Schonen, but were defeated by General Steenbock. This victory, however, did not put an end to the war. On the contrary, the kings of Denmark and Poland, with the tsar of Russia, entered into stricter bonds of amity than ever. They dreaded the return of Charles to his own dominions, and apprehended that numberless victories would soon efface the remembrance of Pultava. They determined, therefore, to make the best use of their time; and perhaps Charles never took a more imprudent resolution than obstinately to remain too long in the Turkish dominions. The return of Charles seemed to give new life to the whole nation. Though the number of inhabitants was visibly diminished, the levies he had ordered were completed in a few weeks; but the hands left to cultivate the earth consisted of the infirm, aged, and decrepid; so that a famine was threatened in consequence of the military rage which had seized all the youth of the kingdom.\n\nThe presence of Charles did not now produce those consequences which the allies had feared. The king's revenue was too much reduced to furnish the necessary supplies of men and money; and though the king's court, rage and military skill were not in the least diminished, the efforts he made, instead of restoring Sweden to its splendour, served more completely to ruin it. In 1715, Prussia declared against him, on account of his demanding back the town of Stettin, which monarch had seized. To complete his embarrassment, the elector of Hanover, George I. of Britain, also became his enemy.\n\nThe forces of Denmark, Prussia, Saxony, and Hanover, joined to invest Wilmar, while a body of 36,000 men patrolled the siege of Stralund; at the same time that all sides by the tsar, with a fleet of 20 large ships of war, and transports, carrying 30,000 men, threw every part of the Swedish coast into the greatest consternation. The heroism of Charles could not prevail against so many enemies; yet he was still so much dreaded, that the prince of Anhalt, with 12,000 brave troops, did not think himself a match for this furious enemy when at the head of only 2000, till he had entrenched his army behind a ditch, defended by chevaux de frise. It appeared, indeed, that his precaution was unnecessary: for in the night Charles with his men clambered up the ditch, and attacked the enemy in his usual manner. Numbers, however, at last prevailed; and Charles was obliged to retire, after having seen his favourite Grottenhoven, General Dardorff and During, the companions of his exile, killed by his side, he himself being wounded in the breast.\n\nThis rash attempt was made in order to save Rugen, Stralund, whence the town of Stralund was supplied with provisions. The place was well fortified, and garrisoned with 9000 men, with Charles himself at their head; but nothing could resist the efforts of the enemy. By the 17th of December it was proposed to give the assault. The attack on the horn-work was desperate: the enemy was twice repulsed; but at last, by dint of numbers, effected a lodgement. The next day, Charles headed a rally, in which he dealt terrible destruction among the besiegers, but was at length overpowered and obliged to retreat into the town. At last his officers, apprehending that he must either fall into the hands of the enemy, or be buried in the ruins of the place, intreated him to retire. A retreat, however, was taken, now almost as dangerous as to remain in the town, on the account of the fleets of the enemy with which the sea was covered; and it is thought that this very circumstance induced the king to consent to it. Setting out, therefore,\nSweden therefore, in a small boat with sails and oars, he passed all the enemy's ships and batteries, and arrived safe at Ylfeldt in Schonen.\n\nTo revenge himself for these losses, Charles invaded Norway with an army of 25,000 men. The Danes were everywhere defeated and pursued with that vigour for which the king of Sweden was so remarkable; but strong reinforcements arriving from Denmark, and provisions failing, he was at last obliged to retire. Soon after this the Swedes lost Wilmar; but when everything seemed hopeless, Baron Goertz the chief minister and favourite of Charles contrived to set on foot a treaty with the tsar of Russia, by which the most formidable of all Charles's enemies was taken off. The minister found means to work on the inflexible temper of Charles, by representing to him that the cession of certain provinces to Peter would induce him to assist him in his projects of again dethroning Augustus, and of replacing James on the throne of Britain; which last scheme he had projected out of revenge for the elector of Hanover having seized on the duchies of Bremen and Verden. In consequence of the conferences between the tsar and Goertz, the former engaged to lend into Poland an army of 80,000 men, in order to dethrone that prince whom he had so long defended. He engaged also to furnish ships for transporting 30,000 Swedes to Germany and 10,000 into Denmark. This treaty, however, was not ratified; and the king's death, which happened in 1718, put a final stop to all the great prospects of Sweden.\n\nThe king had resolved on the conquest of Norway before he dethroned Augustus; and as no difficulties ever deterred him, he marched his army into that cold and barren country in the month of October, when the ground was covered with frost and snow. With 18,000 men he formed the siege of Frederickshall, though the severity of the frost rendered it almost impossible to break ground. Charles resolved to form trenches; and his soldiers cheerfully obeyed, digging into the ground with the same labour as if they had been piercing a rock. On the 11th of December the king visited the trenches in the midst of a terrible fire from the enemy, imagining that his men might be animated by his presence. He took his post in the most dangerous station he could choose, standing on a gabion and leaning with which he is arm over the parapet, while the enemy were firing chain shot at the very spot where he stood. He was intreated to change his station; but he remained obstinate. At last he was seen to fall on the parapet with a deep groan, and soon afterwards expired, having been mortally wounded, as is supposed, by a cannon ball. See Charles XII.\n\nCharles XII. was succeeded by his sister the princess Ulrica Eleonora, wife to the hereditary prince of Hesse. On this occasion the states took care to make a previous stipulation for the preservation of their liberties, and obliged the princess to sign a paper to this purpose before entering on the government. Their first care was to make a peace with Great Britain, which the late king intended to have invaded. The Swedes then, to prevent their farther losses by the progress of the Russian, the Danish, the Saxon, and other arms, made many great sacrifices to obtain peace from those powers. The French, however, about the year 1738, formed a dangerous party in the kingdom, which not only broke its internal quiet, but led it into a ruinous war with Russia, by which it lost the province of Finland. Their Swedish majesties having no children, it was necessary to settle the succession; especially as the duke of Holstein was descended from the queen's eldest sister, and was, at the same time, the presumptive heir to the empire of Russia. Four competitors appeared; the duke of Holstein Gottorp, Prince Frederic of Holstein-Gottorp, nephew to the king, the prince of Denmark, and the duke of Deux-Ponts. The duke of Holstein would have carried the election, had he not embraced the Greek religion, that he might mount the throne of Russia. The tsarina interposed, and offered to restore all the conquests she had made from Sweden, excepting a small district in Finland, if the Swedes would receive the duke of Holstein's uncle, Adolphus Frederic bishop of Lubeck, as their hereditary prince and successor to their crown. This was agreed to; and a peace concluded at Abo, under the mediation of his Britannic majesty. This peace was so firmly adhered to by the empress of Russia, that his Danish majesty thought proper to drop all resentment for the indignity done his son. The prince-successor married the princess Ulrica, third sister to the king of Prussia; and in 1751 entered into the possession of his new dignity, which proved to him a crown of thorns. The French had acquired vast influence in all the deliberations of the Swedish senate, who of late had been little better than pensioners to that crown. The intrigues of the senators forced Adolphus to take part in the war against Prussia; but as that war was disagreeable not only to the people, but also to the king of Sweden, the nation never made so mean an appearance; and on Russia's making peace with the king of Prussia, the Swedes likewise made peace. Adolphus died dispirited in 1771, after a ten-seconds reign of twenty years; and was succeeded by his son Gustavus. The most remarkable transaction of this reign is the revolution which took place in the government in the year 1772, by which the king, from being the most limited became one of the most despotic monarchs in Europe. Ever since the death of Charles XII., the whole power of the kingdom had been lodged in the estates; and this power they had much abused. Gustavus therefore determined either to seize on that power of which they made such a bad use, or perish in the attempt. The revolution was effected in the following manner. On the morning of the 16th of August, which he had summoned to attend his majesty. Before ten he was on horseback, and visited the regiment of artillery. As he passed through the streets he was more than usually courteous to all he met, bowing familiarly to the lowest of the people. On the king's return to his palace, the detachment which was to mount guard that day being drawn up together with that which was to be relieved, his majesty retired with the officers into the guard-room. He then addressed them with all that eloquence of which he is said to have been a perfect master; and after intimating to them that his life was in danger, he exposed to them in the strongest colours the wretched state of the kingdom, the shackles in which it was held by means of foreign gold, and the dissensions and troubles arising from the same cause which had distracted the diet during the course of fourteen...\nteen months. He assured them that his only design was to put an end to these disorders; to banish corruption, restore true liberty, and revive the ancient lustre of the Swedish name, which had been long tarnished by a venality as notorious as it was disgraceful. Then assuring them in the strongest terms that he disclaimed for ever all absolute power, or what the Swedes call sovereignty, he concluded with these words: \"I am obliged to defend my own liberty and that of the kingdom, against the aristocracy which reigns. Will you be faithful to me, as your forefathers were to Gustavus Vasa and Gustavus Adolphus? I will then risk my life for your welfare and that of my country.\"\n\nThe officers, most of them young men, of whose attachment the king had been long secure, who did not thoroughly perhaps see into the nature of his majesty's request, were allowed no time to reflect, immediately consented to every thing, and took an oath of fidelity to him.\n\nOnly three refused. One of these, Frederic Cederstrom, captain of a company of the guards, alleged he had already, and very lately, taken an oath to be faithful to the states, and consequently could not take that which his majesty then exacted of him. The king, looking at him sternly, answered, \"Think of what you are doing.\" \"I do,\" (replied Cederstrom;) and what I think to day, I shall think to-morrow: and were I capable of breaking the oath by which I am already bound to the states, I should be likewise capable of breaking that which your majesty now requires me to take.\"\n\nThe king then ordered Cederstrom to deliver up his sword, and put him in arrest.\n\nHis majesty, however, apprehensive of the impression which the proper and resolute conduct of Cederstrom might make on the minds of the other officers, shortly afterwards softened his tone; and again addressing himself to Cederstrom, told him, that as a proof of the opinion he entertained of him, and the confidence he placed in him, he would return him his sword without insisting on his taking the oath, and would only desire his attendance that day. Cederstrom continued firm; he answered, that his majesty could place no confidence in him that day, and that he begged to be excused from the service.\n\nWhile the king was shut up with the officers, Senator Ralling, to whom the command of the troops in the town had been given two days before, came to the door of the guard-room, and was told that he could not be admitted. The senator insisted on being present at the distribution of the orders, and sent to the king to desire it; but was answered, he must go to the senate, where his majesty would speak to him.\n\nThe officers then received their orders from the king; the first of which was, that the two regiments of guards and of artillery should be immediately assembled, and that a detachment of 36 grenadiers should be posted at the door of the council-chamber to prevent any of the senators from coming out.\n\nBut before the orders could be carried into execution, it was necessary that the king should address himself to the soldiers; men wholly unacquainted with his designs, and accustomed to pay obedience only to the orders of the senate, whom they had been taught to hold in the highest reverence.\n\nVol. XX. Part I.\n\nAs his majesty, followed by the officers, was advancing from the guard room to the parade for this purpose, some of them more cautious, or perhaps more timid than the rest, became, on a short reflection, apprehensive of the consequences of the measure in which the soldiers were engaged: they began to express their fears to the king, that unless some persons of greater weight and influence than themselves were to take a part in the same cause, he could scarcely hope to succeed in his enterprise. The king stopped a while, and appeared to hesitate. A sergeant of the guards overheard their discourse, and cried aloud,—\"It shall succeed.—Long live Gustavus!\" His majesty immediately said, \"Then I will venture;\"—and stepping forward to the soldiers, he addressed them in terms nearly similar to those which he had expressed to the officers, and with the same success. They answered him with loud acclamations: one voice only said, No; but it was not attended to.\n\nIn the meantime some of the king's emissaries had spread a report about the town that the king was arrested. This drew the populace to the palace in great numbers, where they arrived as his majesty had concluded his harangue to the guards. They testified by reiterated shouts their joy at seeing him safe; a joy which promised the happiest conclusion to the business of the day.\n\nThe senators were now immediately secured. They had from the window of the council-chamber beheld senators, what was going forward on the parade before the palace; and, at a loss to know the meaning of the shouts of the people, were coming down to inquire into the cause. Whole of them, when 30 grenadiers, with their bayonets fixed, informed them it was his majesty's pleasure they should continue where they were. They began to talk in a high tone, but were answered only by having the door flung and locked on them.\n\nThe moment the secret committee heard that the senate was arrested, they separated of themselves, each individual providing for his own safety. The king then mounting his horse, followed by his officers with their swords drawn, a large body of soldiers, and numbers of the populace, went to the other quarters of the town, where the soldiers he had ordered to be assembled were posted. He found them all equally willing to support his cause, and to take an oath of fidelity. As he passed through the streets, he declared to the people, that he only meant to defend them, and save his country; and that if they would not confide in him, he would lay down his sceptre, and surrender up his kingdom. So much was the king beloved, that the people (some of whom even fell down on their knees) with tears in their eyes implored his majesty not to abandon them.\n\nThe king proceeded in his course, and in less than an hour made himself master of all the military force in Stockholm. In the mean time the heralds, by proclamation, in the several quarters of the city, summoned an assembly of the States for the ensuing morning, and declared all members traitors to their country who should not appear. Thither his majesty repaired in all the pomp of royalty, surrounded by his guards, and holding in his hand the silver sceptre of Gustavus Adolphus. In a very forcible speech, he lamented the unhappy state to which the country was reduced by the conduct of a party.\nparty ready to sacrifice every thing to its ambition, and reproached the states with adapting their actions to the views of foreign courts, from which they received the wages of perfidy. \"If any one dare contradict this, let him rise and speak.\"—Conviction, or fear, kept the assembly silent, and the secretary read the new form of government, which the king submitted to the approbation of the states. It consisted of fifty-seven articles; of which the five following were the chief.\n\n1. The king has the entire power of convoking and dissolving the assembly of the states as often as he thinks proper.\n2. His majesty alone has the command of the army, fleet, and finances, and the disposal of all offices civil and military.\n3. In case of an invasion, or of any pressing necessity, the king may impose taxes, without waiting for the assembly of the states.\n4. The diet can deliberate on no other subjects than those proposed by the king.\n5. The king shall not carry on an offensive war without the consent of the states. When all the articles were gone through, the king demanded if the states approved of them, and was answered by a general acclamation. He then dismissed all the senators from their employments, adding, that in a few days he would appoint others; and concluded this extraordinary scene by drawing out of his pocket a small book of psalms, from which, after taking off the crown, he gave out Te Deum. All the members very devoutly added their voices to his, and the hall resounded with thanksgiving.\n\nThe power thus obtained was employed by the king for the good of his subjects. He took care that the law should be administered with impartiality to the richest noble and the poorest peasant, making a severe example of such judges as were proved to have made justice venal. He gave particular attention and encouragement to commerce, was a liberal and enlightened patron of learning and science, and laboured strenuously to introduce into his kingdom the most valuable improvements in agriculture that had been made in foreign countries.\n\nBut while thus active in promoting the arts of peace, he was not inactive to those of war. The fleet, which he found decayed and feeble, he in a few years restored to a respectable footing, and, besides changing the regulations of the navy, he raised a new corps of sailors, and formed them to the service by continual exercise. The army, which, as well as the navy, had been neglected during the aristocracy, was next to be reformed. The king began by giving cloaks, tents, and new arms to all the regiments. Afterwards, under the direction of Field Marshal Count de Hessenstein, a new exercise was introduced, and several camps were formed, in which the foldery were manoeuvred by the king himself. The sale of military offices, which had been permitted for many years, was entirely suppressed; and the king provided not only for the establishment of discipline and good order in the army, but for the future welfare of the individuals which composed it. These warlike preparations were necessary to a plan which he had formed for entirely abolishing the power of the aristocracy, and freeing Sweden from the factions which had long been formed in it by the court of St. Petersburg. The change which he had introduced was very inimical to the intrigues of that court; and the Russian ambassador exerted himself openly to bring about a rupture between the king and the discontented nobles. Gustavus ordered him to quit the kingdom in eight days, and immediately prepared for war with Russia. To this apparently rash enterprise he was incited by the Ottoman Porte, at that time unable to oppose the armies of the two empires; and his own ambition, together with the internal state of his kingdom, powerfully concurred to make him lend every assistance to his ancient ally. It is needless for us to enter into a detail of the particulars of that war, the principal circumstances of which have already been noticed under Russia, No. 157. Suffice it to say, that neither Gustavus Adolphus nor Charles XII. gave greater proofs of undaunted courage and military conduct in their long and bloody wars than were given by Gustavus the III. from the end of the year 1787 to 1790, when peace was restored between the courts of St. Petersburg and Stockholm. When the court of Copenhagen was compelled, by the means of England and Prussia, to withdraw its troops from the territories of Sweden, the king attacked Russia with such vigour both by sea and land, displayed such address in retrieving his affairs when apparently reduced to the last extremity, and renewed his attacks with such pertinacious courage, that the empress lowered the haughtiness of her tone, and was glad to treat with Gustavus as an equal and independent sovereign.\n\nThe king of Sweden was now at liberty to cherish again the arts of peace, and to humble the haughty spirit of the nobles. For his attempting to deprive those men of that power which they had for many years employed against their country, he has been held up to the world as a despot who trampled on the liberties of his subjects; as a man without sincerity or patriotism; and, in one word, as a perjured tyrant, who overthrew the constitution which he had sworn to maintain. That he was not troubled with a scrupulous conscience, when so artfully conducting the revolution of 1772, must be acknowledged; nor can it be denied, that in his treaties with other powers, he sometimes endeavoured to overreach them; but if the necessities of state could in any case be an apology for falsehood, they would sufficiently apologise for the duplicity of Gustavus. He was engaged in the arduous enterprise of freeing his subjects from an aristocratic tyranny, supported by a foreign power the most formidable in the north; he had been forced into a war with that power, and, as there is reason to believe, promised assistance which he never received; and it cannot excite wonder nor great indignation, that, as soon as he could make an honourable peace, he embraced the opportunity without paying much regard to the interests of an alliance, which tamely looked on while he was struggling with difficulties apparently insurmountable. That the revolution which he effected in his own country was calculated to promote the general welfare of the people is unquestionable; and to gain such an object he might surely restore the crown to its ancient splendour, without bringing on his government the odious epithet of despotism.\n\nThe nobles, however, continued discontented, and a conspiracy was planned against Gustavus under his own roof. He had entered into the alliance that was formed against the revolutionary government of France; and to raise an army, which he was to lead in person to co-operate with the emperor and the king of Prussia, he was obliged to negotiate large loans, and to impose on his subjects heavy taxes. The nobles took advantage of that circumstance to prejudice the minds of many of the people.\npeople against the sovereign who had laboured so long for their good. On the 16th of March 1792 he received an anonymous letter, warning him of his immediate danger from a plot that was laid to take away his life, requesting him to remain at home, and avoid balls for a year; and assuring him that, if he should go to the masquerade for which he was preparing, he would be assassinated that very night. The king read the note with contempt, and at a late hour entered the ball-room.\n\nAfter some time he sat down in a box with the comte d'Elen, and observed that he was not deceived in his contempt for the letter, since had there been any design against his life, no time could be more favourable than that moment. He then mingled, without apprehension, among the crowd; and just as he was preparing to retire in company with the Prussian ambassador, he was surrounded by several persons in masks, one of whom fired a pistol at the back of the king, and lodged the contents in his body. A scene of dreadful confusion immediately ensued. The conspirators, amidst the general tumult and alarm, had time to retire to other parts of the room; but one of them had previously dropped his pistols and a dagger close by the wounded king. A general order was given to all the company to unmask, and the doors were immediately closed; but no person appeared with any particular distinguishing marks of guilt. The king was immediately conveyed to his apartment; and the surgeon, after extracting a ball and some flugs, gave favourable hopes of his recovery.\n\nThe favourable reports of his medical attendants soon appeared to be fallacious, and on the 28th of March a mortification was found to have taken place. He expired on the following day, and on opening his body there were found within the ribs a square piece of lead and two rusty nails.\n\nThe king had by his will appointed a council of regency; but convinced by recent experience how little dependence was to be placed on the attachment of his nobles, and aware of the necessity of a vigorous government in times of such difficulty and danger, he appointed his brother, the duke of Sodermania, sole regent, till his son, then a minor, should attain the age of 18 years. In his dying moments he desired that all the conspirators, except the perpetrator of his murder, might be pardoned.\n\nThe young king, who was about 14 at his father's death, was proclaimed by the name of Gustavus IV. The regent soon took the most vigorous and active measures to apprehend and punish the projectors and perpetrators of the murder of his brother. A nobleman of the name of Ankerdrom confessed himself the assassin, and gloried in the action, which he called liberating his country from a monster and a tyrant. He was executed in a most cruel manner on the 17th of May. Two other noblemen, and two officers, also suffered death; but the rest of the conspirators were either pardoned, or punished only by fine and imprisonment.\n\nFrom the accession of Gustavus IV. till the revolution which has been recently effected in Sweden, few transactions of any importance have occurred. Soon after the king had taken on himself the administration of affairs, he engaged warmly in the war against France, and till the time of his deposition, continued a most faithful ally of Britain. The efforts of the Swedish monarch towards humbling the power of Bonaparte, have been already noticed under the articles Britain and France; and the war with Russia, in which his alliance with Britain had involved him, has been sufficiently touched in the article Russia. This prince seems to have been endowed with great and amiable qualities, but he was certainly rash and imprudent in a high degree. He thus materially injured his kingdom, and alienated the affections of his principal nobles, especially of his uncle the duke of Sodermania.\n\nIn the beginning of March 1809, the plan which appears to have been concerted between the duke of Sodermania and the principal nobility, was carried into effect. The king was arrested; the duke assumed the reins of government, and issued the following proclamation.\n\n\"We, Charles, by the grace of God, Hereditary Prince of Sweden, the Goths, Vandals, &c. Duke of Sodermania, Grand Admiral, &c. &c. do declare, that under existing circumstances, his majesty is incapable of acting, or of conducting the important affairs of the nation. We have therefore (being the nearest and only branch of the family of age) been induced, for the time being, as administrator of the kingdom, to take the reins of government into our hands, which, with the help of the Almighty, we will conduct so that the nation may regain peace, both at home and abroad, and that trade and commerce may revive from their languishing state.\n\n\"Our inviolable intention is, to consult with the states on the means to be taken to render the future time happy to the people of Sweden. We invite and command, therefore, all the inhabitants of our nation, our forces by sea and land, and also the civil officers of all degrees, to obey us, as our real intention, and their welfare demand.\n\n\"We recommend you all to the protection of God Almighty.\n\nDone at Stockholm palace,\nthe 13th March, 1809.\n\n(Signed) \"Charles.\n\"C. Laberlering.\"\n\nSoon after Gustavus was prevailed on to abdicate the Deposition government, and the duke of Sodermania was declared king of Sweden, by the title of Charles XIII.\n\nThe new king soon made propositions to the emperors of France and Russia for a cessation of hostilities between XIII. and these powers and Sweden. Peace was speedily obtained, but on terms the most humiliating and disadvantageous to Sweden, as she has been compelled to surrender to the emperor Alexander all her territory to the eastward of the gulf of Bothnia and the river Torne. A new constitution has been promulgated by King Charles; but the particulars of this code, which, from the enfeebled state of Sweden, reduced almost to the condition of a Russian province, is not likely to be of long continuance, can scarcely be interesting to our readers (B).\n\n(B) It is understood that the health of the reigning monarch is in a declining state, so that a new vacancy in the throne of Sweden may be expected soon to take place. It is not impossible, that on such an event, the ambitious views\nThe population of Sweden, even before the late treaty, was very inconsiderable, and is usually supposed not to have exceeded 3,000,000, of which number Swedish Lapland scarcely contained 75 part. As Finland appears to have been among the most populous districts, we may conjecture that the loss of that territory must have reduced the population by at least 500,000; so that it is probable the present population of the countries subject to the crown of Sweden does not exceed 2,500,000. The most numerous part of this population is of course formed by peasants, who have been computed at 3/4 of the whole. Of the rest the nobility was supposed to form 1/5 part, comprehending at least 2,500 families.\n\nWe have seen, that from the reign of Charles XII. to the revolution under Gustavus III. in 1772, the government of Sweden was a limited monarchy, and that since that time, till the accession of the present king (Charles XIII.) the power of the monarchs has been absolute. The new constitution aims at bringing affairs back to their former state; but how far it will be productive of that effect time alone can determine.\n\nThe revenue of Sweden, since the unfortunate reign of Charles XII., has been much reduced. Her gold and silver specie, in the reign of Adolphus Frederick, arose chiefly from the king's German dominions. Formerly the crown lands, poll-money, tithes, mines, and other articles, are said to have produced 1,000,000l. sterling, and probably the whole present revenue does not amount to a million and a half. The national debt of this country, due chiefly to the moneyed men in Hamburg, is supposed to amount to about 10,000,000 sterling.\n\nThe Swedish army is composed of national troops, and of foreign auxiliaries; the latter being estimated at about 12,000, while the former do not amount to 40,000. The soldiers are of distinguished valour, and very hardy, and still retain the remembrance of the heroic deeds of their ancestors.\n\nBefore the year 1792, the Swedish fleet consisted of about 30 ships of the line; but at present it is reduced to not more than one-half, and these but ill appointed.\n\nThe only gold coin in Sweden is the ducat, worth about 9s. sterling. Of the silver currency, the crown is valued at 2s. 6d. sterling; and the shilling at about 1d. of English money. The copper coinage consists chiefly of half and quarter shillings; but formerly the copper money consisted of heavy pieces nearly as large as tiles, so that a cart or barrow was sometimes required to carry home a moderate sum that had been received in payment for merchandise. These large pieces are now rarely seen.\n\nChristianity was introduced into Sweden in the 9th century. Their religion is Lutheran, which was propagated among them by Gustavus Vasa about the year 1523. The Swedes are surprisingly uniform and unremitting in religious matters; and have such an aversion to Popery, that if a Roman Catholic priest be discovered in the country, he is treated with the greatest indignity.\n\nThe archbishop of Upsal had a revenue of 400l. a year, Sweden, and had under him 13 suffragans with moderate stipends. No clergyman had the least direction in the affairs of state. Their morals, and the sanctity of their lives, were such as to endear them to the people. Their churches are neat, and often ornamented. A body of ecclesiastical laws and canons direct their religious economy. A conversion to Popery, or a long continuance under excommunication, which cannot pass without the king's permission, was punishment and exile.\n\nThe language of Sweden is a dialect of the Gothic, and nearly allied to those of Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. In the two grand divisions of the Gothic, consisting of the German and Scandinavian dialects, the latter is distinguished by greater brevity and force of expression. In the south of Sweden, which contains the chief mass of population, some German and French words have been adopted; while the Dalecarlian, in the north-west, is esteemed a peculiar dialect, perhaps only because it contains more of the ancient terms and idioms.\n\nIn the antiquity of literature, Sweden cannot pretend to vie with Denmark, Norway, or Iceland; the most early native chronicle, or perhaps literary composition, being not more ancient than the 14th century. In return, while the Danes seem occupied with internal policy and public regulation, the Swedes have, in modern times, borne the palm of genius in many departments of literature and philosophy.\n\nBut Swedish literature can scarcely be said to have dawned till the middle of the 17th century, when Queen Christina, finding the country immersed in ignorance, invited Grotius, Descartes, and other celebrated men, who, though they did not reside long in the kingdom, sowed the seed of letters, which gradually began to prosper in the wise and beneficent reign of Charles XI. In the succeeding or 18th century, the name of Linne alone might distinguish the national literature; and it is joined in natural history with those of Scheele, Bergman, Tilas, Wallerius, Quist, Cronstedt, and others. In history, Dalin and Lagerbring have distinguished themselves by a precision and force, which the Danes seem to sacrifice to antiquarian difficulties. Sweden also boasts of native poets and orators; and the progress of the sciences is supported by the institution of numerous academies.\n\nThe Swedes, since the days of Charles XII., have been at incredible pains to correct the nature and barrenness of their country, by erecting colleges of agriculture, and in some places with great success. Till of late, they had not sufficient industry to remedy or improve the disadvantages of their soil. The peasants now follow the agriculture of France and England; and some late accounts say, that they rear almost as much grain as maintains the natives. Gothland produces wheat, rye, barley, oats, peas, and beans; and in cases of deficiency, the people are supplied from Livonia and the Baltic provinces. In summer, the fields are verdant, and covered with flowers, and produce strawberries, raspberries, currants, and other small fruits. The common views of the emperors of the north and south of Europe will ultimately destroy the small remains of Swedish independence.\ncommon people know, as yet, little of the cultivation of apricots, peaches, nectarines, pine-apples; and other high-flavoured fruits; but melons are brought to the greatest perfection in dry seasons.\n\nThe Swedish commonly subsist by agriculture, mining, hunting, grazing, and fishing. Their materials for traffic are the bulky and useful commodities of masts, beams, and other kinds of timber for shipping; tar, pitch, bark of trees, potash, wooden utensils, hides, flax, hemp, peltry, furs, copper, lead, iron, cordage, and fish.\n\nEven the manufacturing of iron was introduced into Sweden so late as the 16th century; for till then they sold their own crude ore to the Hanse towns, and bought it back again manufactured into utensils. About the middle of the 17th century they set up some manufactures of glass, starch, tin, woollen, silk, soap, leather-dressing, and saw-mills. Bookselling was at that time unknown in Sweden. They have since had sugar making, tobacco plantations, and manufactures of full cloth, cotton, fulutan, and other stuffs; also of linen, alum, brickstone, paper-mills, and gunpowder-mills. The iron mine of Dannemora is said to yield 600 tons of metal in 100 lbs. of ore, and others about 300 lbs. The iron extracted from this is known in Europe by the name of Oregrund, which name is derived from a seaport on the Baltic. A large portion of it is employed by different nations for making the best steel. The mine was discovered in 1472. The unwrought ore was first sold to the merchants of Lubeck. It is said that the mine of Dannemora yields 40,000 stones of bar-iron per year, which is supposed to be 1/5th of the quantity produced by all the iron-mines of Sweden. Of this product of 400,000 stones, 300,000 are annually exported, and the remainder is manufactured at home. It is computed that not fewer than 25,600 men are employed in mining, and the branches immediately connected with it, viz. 4000 for breaking the rocks; 10,800 for hewing timber and burning it into charcoal; 2000 are employed in melting; 1800 in transporting the metal from the furnaces to the forges; 600 in transporting sand, fuel, &c.; 4000 for transporting the charcoal, and 2400 at forges. They have also foundries for cannon, manufactories for fire-arms and anchors, armories, wire and rolling mills, also mills for fulling, and for boring and stamping; and of late they have built many ships for sale.\n\nCertain towns in Sweden, 24 in number, are called fleete-towns, where the merchants are allowed to import and export commodities in their own ships. Those towns which have no foreign commerce, though lying near the sea, are called land-towns. A third kind are termed mine-towns, as belonging to mine districts. About the year 1752, the Swedes had greatly increased their exports, and diminished their imports, most part of which arrive or are sent off in Swedish ships; the Swedes having now a kind of navigation act like that of the English. According to the tables drawn up by Mr Coxe, the Swedish exports amounted, about 30 years ago, to 1,368,830l. while the imports amounted to 1,008,391l., leaving a balance in favour of Sweden of 360,000l. The imports are chiefly corn, hemp, tobacco, sugar, coffee, drugs, silk, wine, and brandy.\n\nThere is a great diversity of characters among the people of Sweden; and what is peculiarly remarkable among them, they have been known to have different characters in different ages. At present, their peasants seem to be a heavy plodding race of men, strong and hardy, but without any other ambition than that of subsisting themselves and their families as well as they can: they are honest, simple, and hospitable; and the mercantile classes are much of the same cast; but great application and perseverance is discovered among them all. One could form no idea that the modern Swedes are the descendants of those who, under Charles XII. and Gustavus Adolphus, carried terror in their names through the most distant countries, and shook the foundations of the greatest empires. The principal nobility and gentry of Sweden are naturally brave, polite, and hospitable; they have high and warm notions of honour, and are jealous of their national interests. The dress of the common people is almost the same with that of Denmark: the better sort are infatuated with French modes and fashions. The common diversions of the Swedes are skating, running races in sledges, and sailing in yachts upon the ice. They are not fond of marrying their daughters when young, as they have little to spare in their own life-time. The women go to plough, thresh out the corn, row upon the water, serve the bricklayers, carry burdens, and do all the common drudgeries in husbandry.\n\nSWEDENBORG, Emanuel, was born at Stockholm in Sweden, in January 1689. His father was bishop of Väst Gothland; member of a society for the propagation of the gospel, formed on the plan of that of England; and president of the Swedish church in Pennsylvania and London. To this last office he was appointed by Charles XII. who seems to have had a great regard for the bishop, and to have continued that regard to his son.\n\nOf the course of young Swedenborg's education we have procured no account; but from the character of the father, it may be supposed to have been pious; and by his appearing with reputation as an author, when but 20 years of age, it is proved to have been successful. His first work was published in 1709; and the year following he sent into the world a collection of pieces on different subjects, in Latin verse, under the title of Ludus Heliocinii, five Carmina Miscellanea quae variis in locis occident. The same year he began his travels, first into England, afterwards into Holland, France, and Germany; and returning to Stockholm in 1714, he was two years afterwards appointed to the office of professor in the Metallic College by Charles XII. who honoured him with frequent conversations, and bestowed upon him a large share of his favour. At this period of his life Swedenborg devoted his attention principally to physic and mathematical studies; and in 1718 he accompanied the king to the siege of Fredericksburg, where he gave an eminent proof that he had not studied in vain. Charles could not send his heavy artillery to Fredericksburg from the badness of the roads, which were then rendered much worse than usual by being deeply covered with snow. In this extremity Swedenborg brought the sciences to the aid of valour. By the help of proper instruments he cut through the mountains, and raised the valleys which separated Sweden from Norway, and then sent to his master two galleys, five large boats, and a sloop, loaded with battering-pieces, to be employed in the siege. The length of this canal...\ncanal was about two miles and a half. The execution of this great work, however, did not occupy all his time. In 1716 he had begun to publish essays and observations on the mathematical and physical sciences, under the title of *Dedalus Hyperboreus*; and he found leisure during the siege to complete his intended collection, and also in the same year to publish an introduction to algebra, under the whimsical title *The Art of the Ruler*.\n\nAt the siege of Frederickshall he lost his patron Charles, but found another in Ulrica Eleonora, the fitter and successor of that hero, by whom in 1719 he was ennobled, and took of course his seat among the senators of the equitential order in the triennial assemblies of the states. His promotion did not lessen his ardour for the sciences; for he published in the same year *A Method to fix the Value of Money, and to determine the Swedish Measures in such a way as to suppress all the Fractions and facilitate the Calculations*. About the same time he gave the public a treatise on the Position and Course of the Planets; with another on the Height of the Tides, and Flux and Reflux of the Sea; which, from information gathered in different parts of Sweden, appeared to have been greater formerly than when he wrote.\n\nAs Swedenborg continued, under the new sovereign, to hold the office of advisor to the Metallic College, he thought it necessary, for the discharge of his duty, to make a second journey into foreign countries, that he might himself examine their mines, particularly those of Saxony and Hartz. During these travels, which were undertaken for the improvement of the manufactures of his native country, he printed at Amsterdam, 1. *Prodromus principiorum Naturae, sive novorum tentantium, Chemiam et Physicam experimentalem geometricè explicandi*. 2. *Nova observata et inventa circa Ferrum et Ignem, praecipue naturam Ignis Elementarum, una cum nova Camini inventione*. 3. *Methodus nova inventendi Longitudines locorum terrae marique ope Luna*. 4. *Modus confiriendi receptacula navalia, vulgo en Suedois, Dockbynadder*. 5. *Nova constructio aggeris aquatici*. 6. *Modus explorandi virtutes Navigiorum*. And at Leipzig and Hamburg, 7. *Miscellanea observata circa res naturales, praetium Mineralia, Ignem, et Montium strata*.\n\nThis journey was made, and these tracts published, in the compass of a year and a half; and perhaps there has not been another man, Linnaeus excepted, who has done so much in so short a time. After his return in 1722, Swedenborg divided his time to equally between the duties of his office and his private studies, that in 1733 he finished his grand work, entitled *Opera Philosophica et Mineralia*, and had it printed under his own direction in 1734, part at Dresden and part at Leipzig; in which year he also went to inspect the mines of Austria and Hungary. This work is divided into three volumes folio; the title of the first is *Principia rerum Naturalium sive novorum tentantium, Phænomena Mundi elementaris philosophice explicandi*. The second, *Regnum Subterraneum sive Minerales de Ferro*; and the third, *Regnum Subterraneum sive Minerales de Cupro, et Orichalo*; all of them written with great strength of judgement, and ornamented with plates, to facilitate the comprehension of the text.\n\nIn the year 1729 he was enrolled among the members of the Society of Sciences at Upsal, and was, probably about the same time, made a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm; nor were strangers less willing than his own countrymen to acknowledge the greatness of his merit. Wolfius, with many other learned foreigners, was eager to court his correspondence. The Academy of St. Petersburg sent him, on the 17th of December 1734, a diploma of association as a correspondent member; and soon afterwards the editors of the *Acta Eruditorum* at Leipzig found in his works a valuable supplement to their own collection.\n\nBy many persons the approbation of learned academies would have been highly valued; but by Baron Swedenborg it was considered as of very little importance. \"Whatever of worldly honour and advantage may appear to be in the things before mentioned, I hold them (says he) but as matters of low estimation, when compared to the honour of that holy office to which the Lord himself hath called me, who was graciously pleased to manifest himself to me, his unworthy servant, in a personal appearance, in the year 1743, to open in me a flight of the spiritual world, and to enable me to converse with spirits and angels; and this privilege has continued with me to this day. From that time I began to print and publish various unknown Arcana, which have been either seen by me or revealed to me, concerning heaven and hell, the state of men after death, the true worship of God, the spiritual sense of the Scriptures, and many other important truths tending to salvation and true wisdom.\"\n\nWe shall not affront the understandings of our readers by making upon this account of the Baron's call such reflections as every person of a sound mind will make for himself; but it is rather remarkable, that a man who had devoted the better part of his life to the study of such sciences as generally fortify the mind against the delusions of fanaticism, and who had even excelled in these sciences, should have fallen into such a reverie as this. After this extraordinary call, the Baron dedicated himself wholly to the great work which he supposed, was assigned him, studying diligently the word of God, and from time to time publishing to his fellow-creatures such important information as was made known to him concerning another world. Among his various discoveries concerning the spiritual world, one is, that it exists not in space. \"Of this (says he) I was convinced, because I could there see Africans and Indians very near me, although they are so many miles distant here on earth; nay, that I could be made present with the inhabitants of other planets in our system, and also with the inhabitants of planets that are in other worlds, and revolve about other suns. By virtue of such presence (i.e., without real space), not of place, I have conversed with apostles, departed popes, emperors, and kings; with the late reformers of the church, Luther, Calvin, and Melanchthon, and with others from distant countries.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the want of space in the spiritual world, he tells us, \"that after death a man is so little changed that he even does not know but he is living in the present world; that he eats and drinks, and even enjoys conjugal delight as in this world; that the resemblance between the two worlds is so great, that in the spiritual world there are cities, with palaces and houses,\"\nhoues, and also writings and books, employments and merchandises; that there is gold, silver, and precious stones there. In a word (he says), there is in the spiritual world all and every thing that there is in the natural world, but that in heaven such things are in an infinitely more perfect state.\"\n\nSuch was his zeal in the propagation of these whimsical and sometimes sensual doctrines, that he frequently left his native country to visit distant cities, particularly London and Amsterdam, where all his theological works were printed at a great expense, and with little prospect or probability of a reimbursement. \"Wherever he resided when on his travels, he was (says one of his admirers) a mere solitary, and almost inaccessible, though in his own country of a free and open behavior. He affected no honour, but declined it; pursued no worldly interest, but spent his time in travelling and printing, in order to communicate instruction and benefit to mankind. He had nothing of the precise in his manner, nothing of melancholy in his temper, and nothing in the least bordering on enthusiasm in his conversation or writings.\" This is too much. We believe he was an inoffensive visionary; of his conversation we cannot judge; but the specimens that we have given of his writings are frantic enthusiasm. He died at London, March 29th, in the year 1773; and after lying in state, his remains were deposited in a vault at the Swedish church, near Radcliff Highway.\n\nThough Baron Swedenborg's followers appear not to have been numerous during his life, they have increased since his death; and a sect subsists at present in England which derives its origin from him, and is called the New Jerusalem Church. The discriminating tenets of this sect seem to be the following: \"Holding the doctrine of one God, they maintain that this one God is no other than Jesus Christ, and that he always existed in a human form; that for the sake of redeeming the world, he took upon himself a proper human or material body, but not a human soul; that this redemption consists in bringing the hells or evil spirits into subjection, and the heavens into order and regulation, and thereby preparing the way for a new spiritual church; that without such redemption no man could be saved, nor could the angels retain their state of integrity; that their redemption was effected by means of trials, temptations, or conflicts with evil spirits; and that the last of them, by which Christ glorified his humanity, perfecting the union of his divine with his human nature, was the passion of the cross. Though they maintain that there is but one God, and one divine person, they hold that in this person there is a real Trinity; consisting of the divinity, the humanity, and the operation of them both in the Lord Jesus; a Trinity which did not exist from all eternity, but commenced at the incarnation. They believe that the Scriptures are to be interpreted not only in a literal but in a spiritual sense, not known to the world till it was revealed to B. Swedenborg; and that this spiritual sense extends to every part of Scripture, except the Acts of the Apostles. They believe that there are angels attending upon men, residing, as B. Swedenborg says, in their affections; that temptation consists in a struggle between good and bad angels within men; and that by this means God afflicts men in these temptations, since of themselves they could do nothing. Indeed B. Swedenborg maintains, that there is an universal influx from God into the souls of men, inspiring them especially with the belief of the divine unity. This efflux of divine light on the spiritual world he compares to the efflux of the light from the sun in the natural world.\n\n\"There are (says B. Swedenborg) two worlds, the natural and the spiritual, entirely distinct, though perfectly corresponding to each other; that at death a man enters into the spiritual world, when his soul is clothed with a body, which he terms substantial, in opposition to the present material body, which, he says, is never to rise out of the grave.\"\n\nSWEEP, in the sea-language, is that part of the mould of a ship where she begins to compass in the rung-heads; also when the hawser is dragged along the bottom of the sea to recover any thing that is sunk, they call this action sweeping for it.\n\nSWEET, in the wine trade, denotes any vegetable juice, whether obtained by means of sugar, raisins, or other foreign or domestic fruit, which is added to wines with a design to improve them.\n\nSWEIN-MOT. See FOREST COURTS.\n\nSWERTIA, Marsh Gentian, a genus of plants belonging to the class pentandra, and in the natural system ranging under the 20th order, rotaeeae. See Botany Index.\n\nSWIETENIA, Mahogany, a genus of plants belonging to the class decandra, and in the natural system arranged under the 54th order, miscellanea. See Botany and Materia Medica Index.\n\nThe first use to which mahogany was applied in England, was to make a box for holding candles. Dr Gibbons, an eminent physician in the latter end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century, had a brother, a West India captain, who brought over some planks of this wood as ballast. As the Doctor was then building a house in King-street, Covent Garden, his brother thought they might be of service to him. But the carpenters, finding the wood too hard for their tools, they were laid aside for a time as useless. Soon after, Mrs Gibbons, wanting a candle-box, the Doctor called on his cabinet-maker to make him one of some wood that lay in his garden. Wollaston, the cabinet-maker also complained that it was too hard. The Doctor said he must get stronger tools. The candle-box was made and approved; inomuch, that the Doctor then insisted on having a bureau made of the same wood, which was accordingly done; and the fine colour, polish, &c., were so pleasing, that he invited all his friends to come and see it. Among them was the duchess of Buckingham. Her Grace begged some of the same wood of Dr Gibbons, and employed Wollaston to make her a bureau also; on which the fame of mahogany and Mr Wollaston was much raised, and things of this sort became general.\n\nSWIFT, Dr Jonathan, so universally admired as a wit and classical writer of the English language, was born in Dublin on November 30th 1667. His father was an attorney, and of a good family; but dying poor, the expense of his son's education was defrayed by his friends. At the age of five young Swift was sent to the school of Kilkenny, whence he was removed in his 13th year to Trinity College, Dublin.\n\nIn his academical studies (says Dr Johnson) he was either not diligent or not happy. The truth appears to\nbe, that he despised them as intricate and useless. He told Mr Sheridan, his last biographer, that he had made many efforts, upon his entering the college, to read some of the old treatises on logic writ by Smeglelius, Keckermannus, Burgerdicius, &c. and that he never had patience to go through three pages of any of them, he was so disgusted at the fluidity of the work. When he was urged by his tutor to make himself master of this branch, then in high estimation, and held essentially necessary to the taking of a degree, Swift asked him, What it was he was to learn from those books? His tutor told him, The art of reasoning. Swift said, That he found no want of any such art; that he could reason very well without it; and that, as far as he could observe, they who had made the greatest proficiency in logic had, instead of the art of reasoning, acquired the art of wrangling; and instead of clearing up obscurities, had learned how to perplex matters that were clear enough before. For his own part, he was contented with that portion of reason which God had given him; and he would leave it to time and experience to strengthen and direct it properly; nor would he run the risk of having it warped or falsely baffled by any system of rules laid down by such stupid writers, of the bad effects of which he had but too many examples before his eyes in those reckoned the most acute logicians. Accordingly, he made a firm resolution, that he never would read any of those books; which he so pertinaciously adhered to, that though his degree was refused him the first time of fitting for it, on account of his not answering in that branch, he went into the hall a second time as ill prepared as before; and would also have been slapped a second time, on the same account, if the interest of his friends, who well knew the inflexibility of his temper, had not stepped in, and obtained it for him; though in a manner little to his credit, as it was inferred in the College Registry, that he obtained it \"special gratia,\" \"by special favour?\" where it remains upon record. But this circumstance is explained by others, that the favour was in consequence of Swift's distinguished talents.\n\n\"He remained in the college near three years after this, not through choice, but necessity, little known or regarded. By scholars he was reckoned a blockhead; and as the lowest of his circumstances would not permit him to keep company with persons of an equal rank with himself, upon an equal footing, he scorned to take up with those of a lower class, or to be obliged to those of a higher. He lived therefore much alone, and his time was employed in pursuing his course of reading in history and poetry, then very unfashionable studies for an academic; or in gloomy meditations on his unhappy circumstances. Yet, under this heavy prelude, the force of his genius broke out, in the first rude draught of the Tale of a Tub, written by him at the age of 19, though communicated to nobody but his chamber-fellow Mr Waring; who, after the publication of the book, made no scruple to declare, that he had read the first sketch of it in Swift's hand-writing when he was of that age.\"\n\nIn 1688, being, by the death of Godwin Swift his uncle, who had chiefly supported him, left without subsistence, he went to consult his mother, who then lived at Leicester, about the future course of his life; and, by her direction, solicited the advice and patronage of Sir William Temple, whose father had lived in great friendship with Godwin Swift. Temple received him with great kindness, and was so much pleased with his conversation, that he detained him two years in his house, and recommended him to King William, who offered to make him a captain of horse. This not failing his disposition, and Temple not having it quickly in his power to provide for him otherwise, Swift left his patron (1694) in discontent; having previously taken his master's degree at Oxford, by means of a testimonial from Dublin, in which the words of disgrace were omitted. He was resolved to enter into the church, where his first preferment was only 100l. a-year, being the prebend of Kilroot in Connor; which some time afterwards, upon Sir William Temple's earnestly inviting him back to his house at Moorpark, he resigned in favour of a clergyman far advanced in years and burdened with a numerous family. For this man he solicited the prebend, to which he himself inducted him.\n\nIn 1699 Swift lost his patron Sir William Temple, who left him a legacy in money, with the property of his manuscripts; and, on his death-bed, obtained for him a promise from the king of the first prebend that should become vacant at Westminster or Canterbury. That this promise might not be forgotten, Swift dedicated to the king the posthumous works with which he was entrusted, and for a while attended the court; but soon found his solicitations hopeless. He was then invited by the earl of Berkeley to accompany him into Ireland, where, after suffering some cruel disappointments, he obtained the livings of Laracor and Rathbeggin in the diocese of Meath; and soon afterwards invited over the unfortunate Stella, a young woman of the name of Johnson, whose life he contrived to embitter, and whose days, though he certainly loved her, we may confidently affirm, he shortened by his caprice.\n\nThis lady is generally believed to have been the daughter of Sir William Temple's steward; but her niece, Miss Hearne, affirms Mr Berkeley, the editor of a volume of letters entitled Literary Relics, that her father was a merchant, and the youngest brother of a good family in Nottinghamshire; that her mother was the intimate friend of Lady Gifford, Sir William's sister; and that she herself was educated in the family with his niece, the late Mr Temple of Moorpark by *See Im- Farnham*. This story would be intitled to the fullest credit, had not Miss Hearne affirmed, in the same letter, that, before the death of Sir William Temple, Mrs Johnson's little fortune had been greatly injured by the South Sea bubbles, which are known to have injured notary Re- perlon till the year 1720: (See COMPANY, II. i.), i.e., printed in 1735, When one part of a narrative is so palpably false, the remainder will always be received with hesitation. But Mr Kay, whether Miss Johnson was the daughter of Temple's steward or of the friend of Lady Gifford, it is certain that Sir William left her 1000l.; and that, accompanied by Mrs Dingley, whose whole fortune amounted to an annuity of 27l. for life, he went, in consequence of Swift's invitation, to Laracor. With these two ladies he passed his hours of relaxation, and to them he opened his bosom; but they never resided in the same house, nor did he see either without a witness.\n\nIn 1701, Swift published A Discourse of the Contests and Difficulties in Athens and Rome. It was his first work, and indeed the only which he ever expressly acknowledged.\nAccording to his constant practice he had concealed his name; but after its appearance, paying a visit to some Irish bishop, he was asked by him if he had read that pamphlet, and what its reputation was in London. Upon his replying that he believed it was very well liked in London; \"Very well liked!\" said the bishop with some emotion. \"Yes, Sir, it is one of the finest tracts that ever was written, and Bishop Burnet is one of the best writers in the world.\" Swift, who always hated Burnet with something more than political rancour, immediately questioned his right to the work, when he was told by the bishop that he was \"a young man;\" and still persisting in doubt of the justice of Burnet's claim, on account of the dissimilarity of the style of the pamphlet from that of his other works, he was told that he was \"a very positive young man,\" as no person in England but Bishop Burnet was capable of writing it. Upon which Swift replied, with some indignation, I am to assure your lordship, however, that Bishop Burnet did not write the pamphlet, for I wrote it myself. And thus was he forced in the heat of argument to avow what otherwise he would have for ever concealed.\n\nEarly in the ensuing spring King William died; and Swift, on his next visit to London, found Queen Anne upon the throne. It was generally thought, upon this event, that the Tory party would have had the ascendancy; but, contrary to all expectation, the Whigs had managed matters so well as to get entirely into the queen's confidence, and to have the whole administration of affairs in their hands. Swift's friends were now in power; and the Whigs in general, knowing him to be the author of the Discourse on the Contests, &c., which was written in defence of King William and his ministers against the violent proceedings of the house of commons, considered themselves as much obliged to him, and looked upon him as faithful to their party. But Swift thought with the Whigs only in the flatter; for with respect to the church his principles were always those of a Tory. He therefore declined any intimate connection with the leaders of the party, who at that time professed what was called low church principles. But what above all shocked him, says Mr Sheridan, was their inviting Deists, Freethinkers, Atheists, Jews, and Infidels, to be of their party, under pretence of moderation, and allowing a general liberty of conscience. As Swift was in his heart a man of true religion, he could not have borne, even in his private character, to have mixed with such a motley crew. But when we consider his principles in his political capacity, that he looked upon the church of England, as by law established, to be the main pillar of our newly erected constitution, he could not, consistently with the character of a good citizen, join with those who considered it more as an ornament than a support to the edifice; and could therefore look on with compunction while it was undermining, or could even open the gate to a blind multitude, to try, like Sampson, their strength against it, and consider it only as sport. With such a party, neither his religious nor political principles would suffer him to join; and with regard to the Tories, as is usual in the violence of factions, they had run into opposite extremes, equally dangerous to the state. He was therefore during the earlier part of the queen's reign of no party, but employed himself in discharging the duties of his function, and in publishing from time to time such tracts as he thought might be useful. In the year 1704 he published the Tale of a Tub, which, considered merely as a work of genius, is unquestionably the greatest which he ever produced; but the levity with which religion was thought to be there treated, raised up enemies to him among all parties, and eventually excluded him from a bishopric. From that period till the year 1708, he seems to have employed himself in folioary study; but he then gave effectively to the public The Sentiments of a Church of England man, the ridicule of astrology under the name of Bickerstaff, the Argument against abolishing Christianity, and the defence of the Sacramental Test.\n\nSoon after began the busy and important part of Swift's life. He was employed (1710) by the primate of Ireland to solicit the queen for a remission of the first fruits and twentieth parts to the Irish clergy. This introduced him to Mr Harley, afterwards earl of Oxford, who, though a Whig himself, was at the head of the Tory ministry, and in great need of an auxiliary so able as Swift, by whose pen he and the other ministers might be supported in pamphlets, poems, and periodical papers. In the year 1710 was commenced the Examiner; of which Swift wrote 33 papers, beginning his first part of it on the 10th of November 1711. The next year he published the Conduct of the Allies ten days before the parliament assembled; and soon afterwards, Reflections on the Barrier Treaty. The purpose of these pamphlets was to persuade the nation to a peace, by showing that \"mines had been exhausted and millions destroyed\" to secure the Dutch and aggrandize the emperor, without any advantage whatever to Great Britain. Though these two publications, together with his Remarks on the Bishop of Sarum's Introduction to the third Volume of his History of the Reformation, certainly turned the tide of popular opinion, and effectually promoted the designs of the ministry, the best preferment which his friends could venture to give him was the deanery of St Patrick's, which he accepted in 1713. In the midst of his power and his politics he kept a journal of his visits, his walks, his interviews with ministers, and quarrels with his servant, and transmitted it to Mrs Johnson and Mrs Dingley, to whom he knew that whatever befell him was interesting; but in 1714 an end was put to his power by the death of the queen, which broke down at once the whole system of Tory politics, and nothing remained for him but to withdraw from persecution to his deanery.\n\nIn the triumph of the Whigs, Swift met with every mortification that a spirit like his could possibly be exposed to. The people of Ireland were irritated against him beyond measure; and every indignity was offered him as he walked the streets of Dublin. Nor was he insulted by the rabble only; for persons of distinguished rank and character forgot the decorum of common civility to give him a personal affront. While his pride was hurt by such indignities, his more tender feelings were also often wounded by base ingratitude. In such a situation he found it vain to struggle against the tide that opposed him. He silently yielded to it, and retired from the world to discharge his duties as a clergyman, and attend to the care of his deanery. That no part of his time might lie heavy on his hands, he employed his leisure hours on some historical attempts relating to the change of the ministers and the conduct of the ministry;\nand completed the history of the four last years of the queen, which had been begun in her lifetime, but which he never published. Of the work which bears that title, and is said to be his, Dr Johnson doubts the genuineness; and it certainly is not such as we should have expected from a man of Swift's sagacity and opportunities of information.\n\nIn the year 1716 he was privately married to Mrs Johnson by Dr Althe bishop of Clogher; but the marriage made no change in their situation, and it would be difficult to prove (says Lord Orrery) that they were ever afterwards together but in the presence of a third person. The dean of St Patrick's lived in a private manner, known and regarded only by his friends, till about the year 1720 that he published his first political pamphlet relative to Ireland, intitled A Proposal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufactures; which so roused the indignation of the ministry that they commenced a prosecution against the printer, and thus drew the attention of the public to the pamphlet, and at once made its author popular.\n\nWhilst he was enjoying the laurels which this work had wreathed for him, his felicity, as well as that of his wife, was interrupted by the death of Mrs Van Homrigh, and the publication of his poem called Cadmus and Vanea, which brought upon him much merited obloquy. With Mrs Van Homrigh he became acquainted in London during his attendance at court; and finding her possessed of genius and fond of literature, he took delight in directing her studies, till he got infinitely possession of her heart. From being proud of his praise, she grew fond of his person; and despising vulgar restraints, she made him sensible that she was ready to receive him as a husband. She had wit, youth, beauty, and a competent fortune to recommend her; and for a while Swift seems to have been undetermined whether or not he should comply with her wish. She had followed him to Ireland, where she lived in a house about twelve miles distant from Dublin; and he continued to visit her occasionally, and to direct her studies as he had done in London; but with these attentions she was not satisfied, and at last sent to him a letter written with great ardour and tenderness, insisting that he should immediately accept or refuse her as a wife. His answer, which probably contained the secret of his marriage, he carried himself; and having indignantly thrown it on the lady's table, instantly quitted the house, we believe without speaking to her, and returned to Dublin to reflect on the consequences of his own conduct. These were dreadful. Mrs Van Homrigh survived her disappointment but a few weeks; during which time she cancelled a will that she had made in his favour, and ordered the poem to be published in which Cadmus had proclaimed her excellence and confessed his love.\n\nHis patriotism again burst forth in 1724 to obstruct the currency of Wood's halfpence; and his zeal was crowned with success. Wood had obtained a patent to coin 180,000l. in halfpence and farthings for the kingdom of Ireland; and was about to turn his brafs into gold, when Swift, finding that the metal was debased to an enormous degree, wrote letters under the name of M.B. Draper to show the folly of giving gold and silver for coin not worth a third part of its nominal value. A prosecution was carried on against the printer; and Lord Carteret, then lord-lieutenant, issued a proclamation, offering 300l. for discovering the author of the fourth letter. The day after it was published there was a full levee at the castle. The lord-lieutenant was going round the circle, when Swift abruptly entered the chamber, and pushing his way through the crowd, never stopped till he got within the circle; where, with marks of the highest indignation in his countenance, he addressed the lord-lieutenant with the voice of a senator, that re-echoed through the room, \"So, my lord-lieutenant, this is a glorious exploit that you performed yesterday, in issuing a proclamation against a poor shopkeeper, whose only crime is an honest endeavour to save his country from ruin. You have given a noble specimen of what this devoted nation is to hope for from your government. I suppose you expect a statue of copper will be erected to you for this service done to Wood.\" He then went on for a long time, inveighing in the bitterest terms against the patent, and displaying in the strongest colours all the fatal consequences of introducing that execrable coin. The whole assembly were struck mute with wonder at this unprecedented scene. For some time a profound silence ensued. When Lord Carteret, who had listened with great composure to the whole speech, made this fine reply, in a line of Virgil's:\n\nRes dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt\nMaliri.\n\nFrom this time Swift was known by the name of the Dean, and was acknowledged by the populace as the champion, patron, and instructor of Ireland.\n\nIn 1727 he returned to England; where, in conjunction with Pope, he collected three volumes of miscellanies; and the same year he sent into the world his Gulliver's Travels, a production which was read by the high and the low, and filled every reader with a mingled emotion of merriment and amazement. Whilst he was enjoying the reputation of this work, he was suddenly called to a home of sorrow. Poor Stella was sinking into the grave; and after a languishing decay of about two months, died in her 44th year, on January 28, 1728. How much he wished her life is shown by his papers; nor can it be doubted that he dreaded the death of her whom he loved most, aggravated by the confidences that himself had hastened it. With her vanished all his domestic enjoyments, and of course he turned his thoughts more to public affairs; in the contemplation of which he could see nothing but what served to increase the malady. The advances of old age, with all its attendant infirmities; the death of almost all his old friends; the frequent returns of his most distempering maladies, deafness and giddiness; and, above all, the dreadful apprehensions that he should outlive his understanding, made life such a burden to him, that he had no hope left but a speedy dissolution, which was the object of his daily prayer to the Almighty.\n\nThe severity of his temper increasing, he drove his acquaintance from his table, and wondered why he was deserted. In 1732, he complains, in a letter to Mr Gay, that \"he had a large house, and should hardly find one visitor if he was not able to hire him with a bottle of wine;\" and, in another to Mr Pope, \"that he was in danger of dying poor and friendless, even his female friends having forsaken him;\" which, as he says, \"vexed...\"\nThese complaints were afterwards repeated in a strain of yet greater lassitude: \"All my friends have forsaken me.\"\n\n\"Vertigo, insop, furdus, male gratus amicis.\"\n\"Dizzy, giddy, helpless, left alone,\"\n\"To all my friends a burden grown.\"\n\nThe fits of giddiness and deafness to which he had been subjected from his boyish years, and for which he thought walking or riding the best remedy, became more frequent and violent as he grew old; and the presentiment which he had long entertained of that wretchedness which would inevitably overtake him towards the close of life, clouded his mind with melancholy and tinged every object around him. How miserable he was rendered by that gloomy prospect, we may learn from the following remarkable anecdote mentioned by Mr Faulkner in his letter to Lord Chesterfield. \"One time, in a journey from Drogheda to Navan, the dean rode before the company, made a sudden stop, dismounted from his horse, fell on his knees, lifted up his hands, and prayed in the most devout manner. When his friends came up, he desired and insisted on their alighting; which they did, and asked him the meaning. 'Gentlemen,' said he, 'pray join your hearts in fervent prayers with mine, that I may never be like this oak tree, which is decayed and withered at top, while the other parts are sound.'\"\n\nIn 1736, while he was writing a satire called the Legion Club against the Irish parliament, he was seized with so dreadful a fit of his malady, that he left the poem unfinished; and never after attempted a composition that required a course of thinking. From this time his memory gradually declined, his passions perverted his understanding, and, in 1741, he became utterly incapable of conversation; and it was found necessary to appoint legal guardians to his person and his fortune. He now lost all sense of distinction. His meat was brought to him cut into mouthfuls; but he would never touch it while the servant stood; and at last, after it stood perhaps an hour, would eat it walking; for he continued his old habit, and was on his feet ten hours a day. During next year a short interval of reason ensuing, gave hopes of his recovery; but in a few days he sunk into lethargic stupidity, motionless, heedless, and speechless.\n\nAfter a year of total silence, however, when his housekeeper told him that the usual illuminations were preparing to celebrate his birth, he answered, \"It is all folly; they had better let it alone.\" He at last sunk into a perfect silence, which continued till the 29th of October 1745, when he expired without a struggle, in his 78th year. The behaviour of the citizens on this occasion gave the strongest proof of the deep impression he had made on their minds. Though he had been so many years to all intents and purposes dead to the world, and his departure from that state seemed a thing rather to be wished than deplored, yet no sooner was his death announced, than they gathered from all quarters, and forced their way in crowds into the house, to pay the last tribute of grief to their departed benefactor. Nothing but lamentations were heard all around the quarter where he lived, as if he had been cut off in the vigour of his years. Happy were they who first got into the chamber where he lay, to procure, by bribes to the servants, locks of his hair, to be handed down as sacred relics to their posterity; and so eager were numbers to obtain at any price this precious memorial, that in less than an hour, his venerable head was entirely stripped of all its silver ornaments, so that not a hair remained.\n\nBy his will, which was dated in May 1740, just before he ceased to be a reasonable being, he left about £200l. in specific legacies; and the rest of his fortune, which amounted to about £1,000l., to erect and endow an hospital for lunatics and idiots. He was buried in the most private manner, according to directions in his will, in the great aisle of St Patrick's cathedral, and, by way of monument, a slab of black marble was placed against the wall, on which was engraved the following Latin epitaph, written by himself:\n\nHic depositum est corpus\nJonathan Swift, S.T.P.\nHujus Ecclesiae Cathedralis\nDecani:\nUbi seva indignatio\nUlterius cor lacere nequit.\nAbi, viator,\nEt imitare, si poteris,\nStrenuum pro virili libertatis vindicem.\nObit anno (1745)\nMensis Octobris die (29.)\nÆtatis anno 78.\n\nSwift undoubtedly was a man of native genius. His fancy was inexhaustible; his conceptions were lively and comprehensive; and he had the peculiar felicity of conveying them in language equally correct, free, and perspicuous. His penetration was as quick as intuition; he was indeed the critic of nature; and no man ever wrote so much, and borrowed so little.\n\nAs his genius was of the first class, so were some of his virtues. The following anecdote will illustrate his filial piety. His mother died in 1710, as appears by a memorandum in one of the account-books which Dr Swift always made up yearly, and on each page entered minutely all his receipts and expenses in every month, beginning his year from November 1. He observed the same method all his lifetime till his last illness. At the foot of that page which includes his expenses of the month of May 1710, at the glebe house of Laracor in the county of Meath, where he was then resident, are these remarkable words, which show at the same time his filial piety, and the religious use which he thought it his duty to make of that melancholy event. \"Mem. On Wednesday, between seven and eight in the evening, May 10, 1710, I received a letter in my chamber at Laracor (Mr Percival and Jo. Beaumont being by) from Mrs F—, dated May 9, with one inclosed, sent by Mrs Worral at Leicester to Mrs F—, giving an account that my dear mother, Mrs Abigail Swift, died that morning, Monday April 24, 1710, about ten o'clock, after a long sickness: being ill all winter, and lame; and extremely ill about a month or six weeks before her death. I have now lost my barrier between me and death. God grant I may live to be as well prepared for it as I confidently believe her to have been! If the way to heaven be through piety, truth, justice, and charity, she is there. J.S.\" He always treated his mother, during her life, with the utmost duty and affection; and sometimes came to Ireland to visit him after his settlement at Laracor.\n\nThe liberality of the dean hath been a topic of just encomium\nencomium with all his admirers; nor could his enemies deny him this praise. In his domestic affairs, he always acted with strict economy. He kept the most regular accounts; and he seems to have done this chiefly with a view to increase his power of being useful. \"His income, which was little more than 700l. per annum, he endeavoured to divide into three parts, for the following purposes. First, to live upon one-third of it. Secondly, to give another third in pensions and charities, according to the manner in which persons who received them had lived: and the other third he laid by, to build an hospital for the reception of idiots and lunatics.\" \"What is remarkable in this generous man, is this (says Mr F.), that when he lent money upon bond or mortgage, he would not take the legal interest, but one per cent. below it.\"\n\nHis charity appears to have been a settled principle of duty more than an indiscriminate effort of good nature: but as it was thus founded and supported, it had extraordinary merit, and seldom failed to exert itself in a manner that contributed most to render it beneficial. He did not lavish his money on the idle and the worthless. He nicely discriminated characters, and was seldom the dupe of imposition. Hence his generosity always turned to an useful account; while it relieved distress, it encouraged industry, and rewarded virtue. We dwell with great pleasure on this truly excellent and distinguishing part of the dean's character: and for the sake of his charity we can overlook his oddities, and almost forgive his faults. He was a very peculiar man in every respect. Some have said, \"What a man he would have been, had he been without those whims and infirmities which shaded both his genius and his character!\" But perhaps the peculiarities complained of were inseparable from his genius. The vigour and fertility of the root could not fail now and then of throwing out superfluous suckers. What produced these, produced also the more beautiful branches, and gave the fruit all its richness.\n\nIt must be acknowledged, that the dean's fancy hurried him into great absurdities and incongruities, for which nothing but his extraordinary talents and noble virtues, discovered in other instances, could have atoned. The rancour he discovered on all occasions towards the dissenters is totally unjustifiable. No fact could have merited it in the degree in which he always showed it to them; for, in some instances, it bordered on downright persecution. He doubtless had his reasons for exposing their principles to ridicule, and might perhaps have sufficient grounds for some of his accusations against their principal leaders in Ireland; but nothing could justify his virulence against the whole body. In a short poem on one class of dissenters he bestowed a stricture upon Bettelworth, a lawyer eminent for his influence to the clergy, which, from a very considerable reputation, brought him into immediate and universal contempt. Bettelworth, enraged at his disgrace and loss, went to the dean, and demanded whether he was the author of that poem? \"Mr Bettelworth (answered he), I was in my youth acquainted with great lawyers, who, knowing my disposition to satire, advised me, if any scoundrel or blockhead whom I had lampooned should ask, 'Are you the author of this paper?' to tell him that I was not the author; and therefore, I tell you, Mr Bettelworth, that I am not the author of these lines.\"\n\nSwift has been accused of irreligion and misanthropy, on account of his Tale of a Tub, and his Yahooes in Gulliver's Travels; but both charges seem to be ill-founded, or at least not supported by that evidence. The Tale of a Tub holds up to ridicule superstitious and fanatical absurdities; but it never attacks the essentials of religion: and in the story of the Yahooes, diluting we confess, there appears to us as little evidence that the author hated his own species, as in the poems of Strophon and Chloe, and the Ladies Dressing Room, that he approved of groanings and filth in the female sex. We do not indeed, with his fondest admirers, perceive the moral tendency of the Voyage to the Houyhnhnms, or consider it as a satire admirably calculated to reform mankind; but neither do we think that it can possibly corrupt them, or lead them to think meanly of their rational nature. According to Sheridan, \"the design of this apologue is to place before the eyes of man a picture of the two different parts of his frame, detached from each other, in order that he may the better estimate the true value of each, and see the necessity there is that the one should have an absolute command over the other. In your merely animal capacity, says he to man, without reason to guide you, and actuated only by a blind instinct, I will show you that you would be degraded below the beasts of the field. That very form, that very body, you are now so proud of, as giving you such a superiority over all other animals, I will show you, owe all their beauty, and all their greatest powers, to their being actuated by a rational soul. Let that be withdrawn, let the body be inhabited by the mind of a brute, let it be prone as theirs are, and suffer like theirs to take its natural course, without any assistance from art, you would in that case be the most deformed, as to your external appearance, the most detestable of all creatures. And with regard to your internal frame, filled with all the evil dispositions and malignant passions of mankind, you would be the most miserable of beings, living in a continued state of internal vexation, and of hatred and warfare with each other.\n\n\"On the other hand, I will show another picture of an animal endowed with a rational soul, and acting uniformly up to the dictates of right reason. Here you may see collected all the virtues, all the great qualities, which dignify man's nature, and constitute the happiness of his life. What is the natural inference to be drawn from these two different representations? Is it not evidently a lesson to mankind, warning them not to suffer the animal part to be predominant in them, lest they resemble the vile Yahoo, and fall into vice and misery; but to emulate the noble and generous Houyhnhnm, by cultivating the rational faculty to the utmost; which will lead them to a life of virtue and happiness.\"\n\nSuch may have been the author's intention; but it is not sufficiently obvious to produce the proper effect, and is indeed hardly consistent with that incapability under which he represents the Yahooes of ever acquiring, by any culture, the virtues of the noble Houyhnhnms.\n\nWith respect to his religion, it is a fact unquestionable, that while the power of speech remained, he continued constant in the performance of his private devotions; and in proportion as his memory failed, they were\nwere gradually shortened, till at last he could only repeat the Lord's prayer, which he continued to do till the power of utterance for ever ceased. Such a habit as this could not have been formed but by a man deeply impressed with a conviction of the truth and importance of revelation.\n\nThe most inexcusable part of Swift's conduct is his treatment of Stella and Vanessa, for which no proper apology can be made, and which the vain attempts of his friends have only tended to aggravate. One attributes his singular conduct to a peculiarity in his constitution; but if he knew that he was incapable of fulfilling the duties of the married state, how came he to tie one of the ladies to himself by the marriage ceremony, and in the most explicit terms to declare his passion to the other? And what are we to think of the sensibility of a man who, strongly attached as he seems to have been to both, could, without speaking, fling a paper on the table of the one, which \"proved (as our author expresses it) her death-warrant,\" and could throw the other, his beloved Stella, in her last illness, into unspeakable agonies, and \"never see her more, for only adoring him, by their friendship, to let her have the satisfaction of dying at least, though she had not lived, his acknowledged wife?\" Another apologist infatuated, upon something like evidence, that Stella bore a son to Swift, and yet labours to excuse him for not declaring her his wife, because he had agreed at the marriage that it should remain a secret from all the world unless the discovery should be called for by urgent necessity; but what could be meant by the term urgent necessity, unless it alluded to the birth of children, he confesses that it would be hard to say. The truth we believe to be what has been said by Johnson, that the man whom Stella had the misfortune to love was fond of singularity, and desirous to make a mode of happiness for himself, different from the general course of things and the order of Providence; he wished for all the pleasures of perfect friendship, without the uneasiness of conjugal restraint. But with this state poor Stella was not satisfied; she never was treated as a wife, and to the world she had the appearance of a mistress. She lived fullonly on, hoping that in time he would own and receive her. This, we believe, he offered at last to do, but not till the change of his manners and the depravation of his mind made her tell him, that \"it was too late.\"\n\nThe natural acrimony of Swift's temper had been increased by repeated disappointments. This gave a plematic tincture to his writings, and amidst the duties of private and domestic life it too frequently appeared to shade the lustre of his more eminent virtues.—The dean hath been accused of avarice, but with the same truth as he hath been accused of infidelity. In detached views, no man was more liable to be mistaken. Even his genius and good sense might be questioned, if we were only to read some passages of his writings. To judge fairly and pronounce justly of him as a man and as an author, we should examine the uniform tenor of his disposition and conduct, and the general nature and design of his productions. In the latter he will appear great, and in the former good; notwithstanding the puns and puerilities of the one, and the absurdities and inconsistencies of the other.\n\nSwift, a species of swallow. See Hirundo, Ornithology Index.\n\nSWIMMING, the art of suspending one's self on swimming-water, and at the same time making a progressive motion through it.\n\nAs swimming is not natural to man, it is evident that swimming at some period it must have been unknown among the human race. Nevertheless there are no accounts of its origin to be found in the history of any nation; nor are there any nations so barbarous but that the art of swimming is known among them, and that in greater perfection than among civilized people. It is probable, therefore, that the art, though not absolutely natural, will always be acquired by people in a savage state from imitating the brute animals, most of whom swim naturally. Indeed so much does this appear to be the case, that very expert swimmers have recommended it to those who wished to learn the art, to keep some frogs in a tub of water constantly beside them, and to imitate the motions by which they move through that element.\n\nThe theory of swimming depends upon one very simple principle; namely, that if a force be applied to any simple body, it will always move towards that side where there is the least resistance. Thus, if a person standing in a boat pushes with a pole against the side or any other part of the vessel in which he stands, no motion will ensue; for as much as he presses in one direction with the pole, just so much does the action of his feet, on which the pressure of the pole must ultimately rest, push the vessel the other way: but if, instead of the side of the vessel, he pushes the pole against the shore, then only one force acts upon it, namely, that of the feet; which being resisted only by the fluid water, the boat begins to move from the shore. Now the very same thing takes place in swimming, whether the animal be man, quadruped, bird, or fish. If we consider the matter simply, we may suppose an animal in such a situation that it could not possibly swim: thus, if we cut off the fins and tail of a fish, it will indeed float in consequence of being specifically lighter than the water, but cannot make any progressive motion, or at least but very little, in consequence of wriggling its body; but if we allow it to keep any of its fins, by striking them against the water in any direction, the body moves the contrary way, just as a boat moves the contrary way to that in which the oars strike the water. It is true, that as the boat is but partly immersed in the water, the resistance is comparatively less than when a frog or even any other quadruped swims; but a boat could certainly be rowed with oars though it was totally immersed in water, only with less velocity than when it is not. When a man swims, he in like manner strikes the water with his hands, arms, and feet; in consequence of which the body moves in a direction contrary to the stroke. Upon this principle, and on this only, a man may either ascend, descend, or move obliquely in any possible direction, in the water. One would think, indeed, that as the strength of a man's arms and legs is but small, he could make but very little way by any stroke he could give the water, considering the fluidity of that element. Nevertheless it is incredible what expert swimmers will perform in this way; of which Mr Forster gives a most remarkable instance in the inhabitants of Otaheite; whose agility, he tells us, was such, that when a nail was thrown overboard, they would jump after it into the sea, and never fail to catch it before it reached to the bottom.\n\nAs to the practice of swimming, there are but few directions\nThe great obstacle is the natural dread which people have of being drowned; and this it is impossible to overcome by anything but accustoming ourselves to go into the water. With regard to the real danger of being drowned, it is but little; and on innumerable occasions arises entirely from the terror above mentioned, as will appear from the following observations by Dr Franklin.\n\n1stly, That though the legs, arms, and head, of a human body, being solid parts, are specifically somewhat heavier than fresh water, yet the trunk, particularly the upper part, from its hollowness, is so much lighter than water, that the whole of the body, taken together, is too light to sink wholly under water, but some part will remain above until the lungs become filled with water; which happens from drawing water into them instead of air, when a person in the fright attempts breathing while the mouth and nostrils are under water.\n\n2ndly, That the legs and arms are specifically lighter than salt water, and will be supported by it; so that a human body would not sink in salt water though the lungs were filled as above, but from the greater specific gravity of the head.\n\n3rdly, That therefore a person throwing himself on his back in salt water, and extending his arms, may easily lie so as to keep his mouth and nostrils free for breathing; and by a final motion of his hands may prevent turning, if he should perceive any tendency to it.\n\n4thly, That in fresh water, if a man throws himself on his back near the surface, he cannot long continue in that situation, but by a proper action of his hands on the water. If he uses such action, the legs and lower part of the body will gradually sink till he comes into an upright position; in which he will continue suspended, the hollow of the breast keeping the head uppermost.\n\n5thly, But if in this erect position the head is kept upright above the shoulders, as when we stand on the ground, the immersion will, by the weight of that part of the head that is out of the water, reach above the mouth and nostrils, perhaps a little above the eyes; so that a man cannot long remain suspended in water with his head in that position.\n\n6thly, The body continued suspended as before, and upright, if the head be leaned quite back, so that the face looks upwards, all the back part of the head being then under water, and its weight consequently in a great measure supported by it, the face will remain above water quite free for breathing, will rise an inch higher every inspiration, and sink as much every expiration, but never so low as that the water may come over the mouth.\n\n7thly, If therefore a person unacquainted with swimming, and falling accidentally into the water, could have presence of mind sufficient to avoid struggling and plunging, and to let the body take this natural position, he might continue long safe from drowning, till perhaps help would come; for as to the clothes, their additional weight while immersed is very inconsiderable, the water supporting it; though when he comes out of the water, he would find them very heavy indeed.\n\nThe method of learning to swim is as follows: The person must walk into water so deep that it will reach to the breast. He is then to lie down gently on the belly, keeping the head and neck perfectly upright, the breast advancing forward, the thorax inflated, and the back bent; then withdrawing the legs from the bottom, and stretching them out, strike the arms forwards in unison with the legs. Swimming on the back is somewhat similar to that on the belly; but with this difference, that although the legs are employed to move the body forwards, the arms are generally unemployed, and the progressive motion is derived from the movement of the legs. In diving, a person must close his hands together, and, pressing his chin upon his breast, make an exertion to bend with force forwards. While in that position, he must continue to move with rapidity under the surface; and whenever he chooses to return to his former situation, he has nothing to do but bend back his head, and he will immediately return to the surface.\n\nIt is very common for novices in the art of swimming to make use of corks or bladders to assist in keeping the body above water. Some have utterly condemned the use of these; however, Dr Franklin allows that they may be of service for supporting the body while one is learning what is called the stroke, or that manner of drawing in and striking out the hands and feet that is necessary to produce progressive motion. \"But (says he) you will be no swimmer till you can place confidence in the power of the water to support you: I would therefore advise the acquiring that confidence in the first place, especially as I have known several who, by a little of the practice necessary for that purpose, have infallibly acquired the stroke, taught as it were by nature.\n\nThe practice I mean is this: Choosing a place where the water deepens gradually, walk coolly into it quivering till it is up to your breast; then turn round your face towards the shore, and throw an egg into the water, between you and the shore; it will sink to the bottom, and be easily seen there, if the water is clear. It must lie in the water so deep as that you cannot reach it to take it up but by diving for it. To encourage yourself in order to do this, reflect that your progress will be from deeper to shallower water; and that at any time you may, by bringing your legs under you, and standing on the bottom, raise your head far above the water; then plunge under it with your eyes open, throwing yourself towards the egg, and endeavouring, by the action of your hands and feet against the water, to get forward till within reach of it. In this attempt you will find that the water buoy you up against your inclination; that it is not so easy a thing to sink as you imagined; that you cannot but by active force get down to the egg. Thus you feel the power of the water to support you, and learn to confide in that power; while your endeavours to overcome it, and to reach the egg, teach you the manner of acting on the water with your feet and hands; which action is afterwards used in swimming to support your head higher above water, or to go forward through it.\"\n\nAs swimming is a healthy exercise and a pleasant amusement, and as a dexterity in it may frequently put a pleasant it in a man's power to save his own life and the lives of and useful his fellow-creatures, perhaps of his dearest friends, it exercise can neither be useless nor uninteresting to consider a few of the evolutions which a swimmer must be master of, that he move in any direction without difficulty, without danger, and without being unnecessarily fatigued.\nThere are several different ways of turning one's self in swimming. You may do it in this way: Turn the palm of the right hand outwards, extend the arm in the same manner, and make a contrary movement with the left hand and left arm; then, by a gradual motion, incline your head and whole body to the left side, and the evolution will be finished. There is another way which is easier still: Bend your head and body toward that side to which you are going to turn. If you wish to turn to the left, incline the thumb and the right hand toward the bottom, bend the fingers of the right hand, stretch it out, and use it for driving away the water side-wise, or, which is the same thing, for pushing yourself the contrary way. At the same time, with your left hand, the fingers being close, push the water behind you, and all at once turn your body and your face to the left, and the manoeuvre will be accomplished. If you wish to turn to the right, you must do with your right hand what you did with your left, and with your left what you did with your right. You must be careful when turning yourself never to stretch out your legs, and be sure that the water be so deep that you be in no danger of hurting yourself.\n\nWhen you are swimming on your belly, and wish to turn on your back, draw your feet in quickly, and throw them before you; stretch out your hands behind you, and keep your body firm and steady. When you wish to turn from swimming on your back, fold your feet at once under your body as if you were throwing them to the bottom, and at the same instant dart your body forwards, that you may fall upon your belly.\n\nIn swimming, the eyes ought to be turned towards heaven. This is a most important rule, and to the neglect of it many of the accidents which befall swimmers are owing. For when they bend their eyes downwards, they infensibly bend their head too, and thus the mouth being too deep in the water, may admit a quantity of it in breaking; besides, the more the body is stretched, it covers a greater part of the surface of the water, and consequently its specific gravity is less. Any person who will make the experiment will find it impossible to dive while he keeps his head erect and his eyes fixed on the heavens (A).\n\nThe easiest posture in swimming is lying on the back. When you wish to swim in this posture, lay yourself softly on your back, and raise your breast to the surface of the water, keeping your body extended in the same line. Put your hands easily over the upper part of your thighs, and throw out your legs and draw them in alternately, keeping them within two feet of the surface. In this way you may advance in any direction you please. You may perhaps not like having so much of your head under water; there is, however, no way of swimming so easy, so safe, and so little fatiguing. If you wish to swim with great rapidity, you may use your arms as well as your feet; and you will find this the easiest way of breaking the force of the waves.\n\nIn swimming on the back, one may advance forward and as well as backward. For this purpose the body must always be kept straight and extended; the breast inflated, so that the hollow of the back may assume a semicircular form. The hands must recline over the upper parts of the thighs. It is also necessary to raise the legs one after another, and draw them in strongly towards the hams, and then leave them suspended in the water. This way of swimming is not only pleasant, but may serve to rest you when fatigued.\n\nWhen you are tired with swimming on your back and How to turn from the belly to throw on one side. When you wish to swim on the belly, you may swim on one side. Do this, sink a little your left side and raise your right; you will immediately find yourself on your left side. Move then your left hand without either raising or sinking it; you have only to stretch it and draw it back, as in a straight line, on the surface of the water. Independent of the pleasure which this kind of motion will give you, you will have the satisfaction of seeing both sides of the river.\n\nIt is possible to swim on the belly without the assistance of the hands. For this purpose you must keep your breast erect, your neck straight, and fix your hands behind your head, or upon your back, while you move the assistants by employing your feet. This way is not without its advantages. It is an excellent resource when the hands are seized with a cramp, or with any indisposition which makes it painful to exert them. This in some cases may be preferable to swimming on the back; for while in that attitude, one cannot see before them without turning every instant. If one of your legs be seized with a cramp, take hold of it with the hand opposite to it, and use the other hand and leg to advance or support yourself.\n\nA very ancient and graceful mode of swimming, is that of swimming with the hands joined. When you swim with this in practice, join your hands, keeping the thumbs and fingers towards heaven, so that they joined may appear above the water; then draw them back and push them forwards alternately from your breast. This method of swimming may be useful in several circumstances, but above all if you are entangled with grass or weeds. Your hands will then open a passage for you.\n\nAs a person may sometimes have occasion to carry something in his hand in swimming, which he is anxious hands elevated. To perform this well, the swimmer must raise his breast, and keep it as much inflated as\n\n(A) An interesting question occurs here, which deserves to be considered. Since the body, when spread upon the surface, can be supported with so little exertion, and frequently without any at all, as in swimming on the back, how comes it to pass that a person when drowned sinks and frequently rises again some time afterwards? The reason is this: In the act of drowning, the lungs are filled with water, and consequently the body, being specifically heavier, sinks. It is well known that the human body contains a great quantity of air; this air is at first compressed by the water; and while this is the case the body remains at the bottom; but as soon as the air by its elasticity endeavours to disengage itself from the compression, the body is swollen and expanded, becomes specifically lighter than the water, and consequently rises to the top.\nSwimming as he can, at the same time that he supports the arms above the water. It must not be concealed, that this method of swimming is attended with some danger to one who is not dexterous at the art; for if one should imprudently draw in his breath, when his arms are raised, he would immediately sink to the bottom.\n\nWhen a man plunges into the water, and has reached the bottom, he has only to give a small stroke with his foot against the ground, in order to rise; but an experienced swimmer, if he misses the ground, has recourse to another expedient, which is very pretty, and which has not been much considered. Suppose him at a considerable depth, when he perceives that he cannot reach the bottom. In such a case, he first puts his hands before his face, at the height of his forehead, with the palms turned outwardly; then holding the fore part of his arm vertically, he makes them move backwards and forwards from right to left; that is to say, these two parts of his arms, having the elbow as a kind of pivot, describe very quickly, both the hands being open, and the fingers joined, two small portions of a circle before the forehead, as if he would make the water retire, which he in fact does; and from these strokes given to the water, there results an oblique force, one part of which carries the swimmer upwards.\n\nThere are many artificial methods of supporting oneself in water, but we have not room to describe them.—Those who wish to see a full account of them may consult the Encyclopédie Methodique.\n\n**Swimming of Fish.** A great proportion of the inhabitants of the waters have an air-bladder, by which they poise themselves.

The independent cantons were, 1. Berne, including the Pays de Vaud; 2. Fribourg; 3. Basil; 4. Soleure; 5. Schaffhausen; 6. Zurich; 7. Appenzell; 8. Lucerne; 9. Zug; 10. Schwitz; 11. Unterwalden; 12. Uri; 13. Glaris. The districts dependent on these cantons were, the principality of Neuchâtel; the bishopric of Bafel; county of Baden; the free Bailiages; Turgovia; Tobenburgh; the Rheintal; lands of the Abbey of St Gal; county of the Grisons; Valais; Italian Bailiages; the Vallais. Since its subjection to France, the country has been divided into the following 10 cantons; viz. Appenzell, Argovia, Bafel, Friburg, Glaris, Grisons, Lucerne, St Gal, Schaffhausen, Schwitz, Soleure, Tiffin, Turgovia, Unterwalden, Uri, Vaad, Zug, and Zurich. An account of the most important of these cantons, and of their capitals, will be found under their proper heads in this work.\n\nWith respect to the air, soil, and produce, that part of the canton of Berne to the east of the lake of Ge- neva, together with the cantons of Uri, Schwitz, Un., &c., derwalen, Glaris, and Appenzell, and part of the canton of Lucerne, consist of stupendous mountains, whose summits are said to be from 9000 to 12000 feet above the level of the sea, consisting of inaccessible rocks, of which some are quite bare, while others are always covered with ice and snow. Among the mountains are many excellent medicinal and other springs, cold and warm baths, water-falls, precipices, deep narrow valleys, and caverns. The highest are those in the canton of Uri. Many of the valleys are covered with lakes, or watered by brooks and rivers.\n\nIn some of them are towns, villages, woods, vineyards, and corn-lands. Both on the mountains and in the valleys the air is extremely cold in winter; but in summer it is very pleasant, cool, and refreshing in the former, but excessively hot in the latter. Sometimes it is winter on the north side of a mountain when it is summer on the other; nay, flowers may be gathered sometimes with one hand and snow with the other. Prodigious masses of ice and snow often fall from them in winter, and do a great deal of damage; and most of the streams and rivers take their rise from the thawing of the ice and snow on their sides and tops. From the rising or descending of the clouds, with which they are commonly enveloped, the inhabitants can, for the most part, pretty exactly foretell the changes of the weather; so that they serve them instead of weather glasses.\n\nThe other and lower parts of Switzerland are very pleasant and fertile, being diversified with vineyards, corn-fields, meadows, and pasture-grounds. The mountains in these are but mole-hills in comparison of the others; there is neither snow nor ice on them in summer; and they frequently afford not only good pasturage, but arable ground. Many petrifications are found both among\nthese and the others, with a variety of fossils. The sands of the rivers yield gold dust, particularly those of the Rhine, the Emme, and the Aar, the Reuss, the Arve, and the Inn.\n\nThe metals of this country being generally found to be brittle, the only mines that are worked are a few of iron. In the lower parts of Switzerland they sow rye, oats, barley, flax, hemp. Wines of various sorts are also produced in some of them, with a variety of fruits. Of wood for fuel and other uses there is generally plenty; in some places, however, they are obliged to burn sheep's dung, and in others a kind of heath and small shrubs. In the valleys they cultivate saffron with success. The Swiss derive their principal subsistence from their flocks and herds of cattle, which in summer graze on the mountains. Their cheese is much esteemed, especially that of Berne and Griers in the canton of Fribourg. Great numbers of horses are also bred here, and bought up for the French cavalry. Besides the above-mentioned rivers, the Rhone and the Tresin have their sources in this country. The lakes are very numerous; but the chief are those of Geneva, Neufchatel, Biel, Zurich, Thun, Brienz, Constance, and Lucerne. Both rivers and lakes abound with fish, and afford a cheap water-carriage. Switzerland is not so populous as many other countries in Europe; and the Popish cantons less so than the Protestant. The total number of the inhabitants is computed at 2,000,000.\n\nThe language generally spoken here is the German, in which also public affairs are transacted; but in those parts of the country that border on Italy or France, a corrupt French or Italian prevails. The two predominant religions are Calvinism and Popery. Of the former are the cantons of Zurich and Berne, the towns of St Gal, Geneva, Muhlhausen, and Biel, the principality of Neufchatel, the greater part of Baffe, Schaffhausen, the country of the Grifons, the Thurgau, Toggenburg, Glaris, and the Rhine valley; the frontiers of Appenzell, with a small part of Solothurn, and some places in the mountains of Baden and Sargans. The rest of the Swiss cantons, allies, and dependents, are Popish. For the education of youth there is an university at Baffe, and academies at Zurich, Berne, Lausanne, and Geneva; besides gymnasia and schools illustrious, both in the Popish and Protestant cantons. There are also societies among them for the improvement of the German language, and the sciences.\n\nThe principal manufactures are snuff and tobacco, linen of several sorts, lace, thread, silk, and worsted stockings, neckcloths, cotton stuffs, gloves, handkerchiefs, silks of several sorts, gold and silver brocades, a variety of woollen manufactures, hats, paper, leather of all sorts, earthen wares, porcelain, toys, watches, clocks, and other hardwares, &c. The trade of Switzerland is generally promoted by many navigable lakes and rivers. In some of the above manufactures, and in cheese, butter, sheep, horses, black cattle, hides, and skins, the exports are considerable; and as the imports are chiefly grain and salt, with some American and Asiatic goods, there is probably a large balance in their favour. In some parts of Switzerland dress is restrained by sumptuary laws.\n\nThe Swiss are a brave, honest, hospitable, hardy people; very true to their engagements, friendly and humane. In short, there is not a people in Europe whose national character is better. In their persons they are generally tall, robust, and well-made; but their complexions are none of the best, and those that live in the neighbourhood of the mountains are subject to wens. The women are said to be generally handsome and well-shaped, sensible, and modest, yet frank, easy, and agreeable in conversation. Few of the peasants are miserably poor; many of them are rich, especially in the Protestant cantons, and that of Berne in particular.\n\nIn the very confined limits to which we are now reduced, we cannot give more than a faint outline of the history of Switzerland. In the first century before the Christian era, we find the natives involved in frequent wars with the Romans, by whom the Helvetii and the Rhaetii, two of the most powerful tribes, were entirely subjugated. In the beginning of the 4th century of the Christian era, the Allemanni, a German tribe, made an irruption into Switzerland, occupied the country, and, as is supposed, extirpated the Helvetii. Soon after we find the western part of Switzerland, as far as the Reuss, occupied by the Franks, by whom it was annexed to Burgundy, while the eastern part, or the Grifons, was subject to Theodoric the Goth, and other Italian princes. In the beginning of the 7th century, Christianity was introduced, chiefly by two Irish monks, Columbanus and Gallus. In the beginning of the 10th century, that part of Switzerland which was occupied by the Allemanni, was invaded by the Huns or Ugurs, who in particular ravaged the abbey of St Gal, at that time famous for its power and its literature. The Huns were defeated by Conrad king of Burgundy, about the year 928. Soon after the commencement of the 11th century, the districts of Switzerland began to be regarded as a part of the German empire, and in the two following centuries they gradually became subject to the house of Hapsburgh. In 1357 commenced the struggles of the Swiss with the house of Austria, those glorious struggles which finally terminated in the complete emancipation of that brave people, and in the formation of a confederacy which continued to be the admiration of Europe for nearly five centuries. The transactions which mark this contest between the inhabitants of a small district and a mighty monarch, and in particular the heroism of their great champion William Tell, are familiar to most of our readers. We shall therefore only give a short account of the government and institutions of the Swiss cantons, as they existed previous to the late revolution, and shall conclude this article with a brief narrative of the proceedings of the French, when they entered Switzerland in 1797.\n\nWith respect to the government and constitution of the Swiss cantons, it must be remarked that some of them were aristocracies and some democracies. In the former, both the legislative and executive power were lodged in the burgheers or citizens of the capital of each canton; and of those there were seven, viz. Zurich, Berne, Baffe, Fribourg, Soleure, and Schaffhausen; an account of the most important of which may be seen under their respective names. In the others, the legislative power was lodged in the whole body of the people, and every male above 16, whether master or servant, had a vote in making laws and in the choice of magistrates. For what concerned the whole Helvetic body, there were diets ordinary and extraordinary; the former were held...\nSwitzerland held annually, and the others on particular emergencies; and both were summoned by the city of Zurich, which appointed the time and place of their meetings. Besides the general diets since the Reformation, there were particular diets of the two religions, at which all public affairs of consequence that regarded the two parties were treated separately; for though a sense of their common interest obliged them to study the maintaining the league and union, yet it is certain that the mutual confidence between the cantons was in some measure lost through the zeal of each party for their particular opinions, especially of the Roman Catholics. The annual general diets were held always at Frauenfeld or Baden, principally to regulate the affairs of the common bailiages. Lucerne took the lead of the Roman Catholic cantons, being the most powerful of that denomination; but Zurich, though less powerful than that of Berne, took the precedence of all the other cantons, both Protestant and Popish. These cantons did not make one commonwealth, but were so many independent states, united together by strict alliances for their mutual defence. The extraordinary diets or congresses were held at Aldorf. Each canton usually deputed two envoys, both to the ordinary and extraordinary, to which also the abbot and the town of St Gal, and the town of Biel, sent representatives. To the 13 cantons belonged in common 21 bailiages, 2 towns, and 2 lordships. The allies, as they were called, were the abbot and town of St Gall, the three Grison leagues, the republic of the Valais, the towns of Muhlhausen and Biel, the principality of Neuenburg, Geneva, and the bishop of Balle. Of these, the abbot and town of St Gal, and the town of Biel, were regarded as members of the Helvetic body, but the rest only as allies.\n\nThe public revenues were in general very considerable, though they have been computed at about 1,000,000l. sterling, arising chiefly from the usual regalia, appropriated everywhere to the sovereign, the demesnes, and public granaries, voluntary contributions, the sale of salt, and a land-tax; in the Protestant cantons, from the church lands also that were seized at the reformation. Except in Zurich, Berne, Balle, and Schaffhausen, where the people are more industrious, have a greater trade, and are richer than in the others, they defrayed only the ordinary charges.\n\nThe cantons never kept any standing troops except for a few garrisons; but their militia was reckoned to be the best regulated of any in Europe. Every male from 16 to 60 was enrolled, and about one-third of them formed into regiments. They were all obliged to provide themselves with arms, clothing, accoutrements, and to appear on the stated days for exercise; and the several cantons and districts were obliged to furnish themselves with a sufficient train of artillery, and all the other implements of war. The Swiss of the several cantons were allowed to engage in the service of such foreign princes and states as were in alliance with those cantons, or with whom they had made a previous agreement. Such states paying an annual subsidy to the respective cantons, were allowed to make levies. Every man enlisted voluntarily, for what number of years he pleased, at the expiration of which he was at liberty to return home. Many thus always returning from foreign service, Switzerland was never unprovided with able and experienced officers and soldiers.\n\nIt was scarcely to be expected that a country so long and so intimately connected with France, by its position, by perpetual alliance, by commerce, and partly by language, should escape the influence of the principles Origin of its revolution, when states far more remote and distant were strongly imbued with their spirit. But between previous to the epoch of the French revolution, various parts of the Swiss confederation had been the seat of French civil discord, and popular murmurs. In some cantons public, the indignant spirit of the subject had led him to revolt against what he deemed the oppressive administration of the ruler; in others, the distinctions which exist in society, and which form the different classes of privileged and unprivileged individuals, were strangely and inversely distributed. The French revolution, declaring the principle of equality, found a wide predisposition among the subjects of the Swiss confederacy to embrace the cause, and as strong a resistance on the part of the governors, who were deeply interested in opposing the progress of opinions so immediately subversive of authority. Conscious that with such a system no brotherhood could be cherished, many of the leading cantons kept themselves in a state of watchfulness, bordering on hostility, against the principles established by the French national assembly. But with so powerful a sanction, the frowns of power were ineffectual to calm the murmurs of discontent; and claims, which fear or policy had hitherto shut up in silence, were now produced, with confidence that they would be admitted from the sentiment of fear, if not of justice.\n\nAmong those who were most active in demanding a review of their grievances were the inhabitants of the French part of the canton of Berne, known by the name of the Pays-de-Vaud. The nobles and the higher classes of this province had long transmitted to their children a hereditary hatred of the government of Berne. This dissatisfaction was not concealed; nor is it singular that the desire of change should operate on the titled and the rich, while they saw their political existence depending on the will of a self-elected sovereign, and their provinces subjected to the administration of an emissary of those whom they considered as usurpers of their rights.\n\nBut however strongly the sensibility of the subject inhabitants of the Pays-de-Vaud was excited by this political degradation, they were compelled to submit, or brood over their grievances in silence. They were incapable of procuring redress by force; and the sovereign burghers of Berne were too firmly leant to regard the remonstrances of impotent claimants, or to listen to the murmurs of discontent. Partial insurrections against the governments of certain cantons had often taken place in Switzerland. These disorders had sometimes been suppressed and punished with the interposition of the neighbouring cantons, where the danger was not excessive; but when these insurrections wore the ferocious characters of rebellion or revolt, the whole confederation marched against the conspirators. France before the revolution had even lent its aid to the suppression of those domestic quarrels, and had become the instrument of vengeance to the insulted sovereign; so that, whatever was the degree of oppression, or whatever the desire of resistance, redress became hopeless, and change impossible.\n\nIt was chiefly among the classes of burghers and artisans who inhabited the towns, that discontent against the\nThe ruling power prevailed. The peasants, less oppressed, because more ignorant of their rights and privileges, not only did not oppose the aggressions of the chief men in power, but even assisted them in quelling insurrections which arose among their rival classes.\n\nAll writers agree in the existence of vexatious and oppressive abuses among all the governments of the Swiss cantons, at the time of which we are now writing. The debasement of their institutions; the abuse of election to foreign councils; the daily and encroaching spirit of authority; the overgrown influence of patrician families; the striking inequality which prevailed, even on this basis, of aristocratical power; the monopoly of places of profit to the exclusion of worth and talent; the undefined limits of proconsular administration; the want of encouragement to the arts and sciences; the neglect of education among those who were destined to rule, the void of which was filled up by idleness, arrogance, ignorance, and dissipation,—are so many features presented by writers of different characters and discordant sentiments, to fill up the picture of this vaunted region of happiness and liberty.\n\nThe severity exercised by the government of Berne over those inhabitants of the Pays-de-Vaud who had assembled on the 14th of July 1791, to commemorate the taking of the Bastille at Paris, and express their approbation of the French revolution, had created in the minds of the French people sensations of jealousy towards their Swiss neighbours; while the disbanding and disaffiliation of the Swiss regiments in the service of France, had contributed to exasperate the government of the cantons against the new republic.\n\nAll the cantons, except that of Berne, appeared for a long time disposed to preserve a neutrality towards revolutionary France; but that canton, under pretence of supporting the people of Geneva against the aggressions of the French, first displayed an avowed hostility, and marched a body of 15,000 troops towards the frontiers of the French republic. The true cause of this movement in the canton of Berne, has been by others stated to be the hopes entertained by some individuals of that government, of sharing in the plans of emolument and preferment which were expected to arise on the re-establishment of monarchy in France. The mutual jealousy subsisting between the Swiss cantons and the ruling power in France, was heightened by the protection given by some of the cantons to the French emigrants, and by the correspondence which others of the cantons had held with the bloody tribunal of Robespierre. After the retreat of the allied armies from the frontiers of France, the Swiss found it politic to make at least a show of amity towards the victorious republic; and accordingly recognized the existing government of the republic, and openly received M. Barthélemy as its charge d'affaires. Still, however, the sincerity of the cantons was justly doubted by the French directory, who appear to have long formed designs against the independence of Switzerland.\n\nThe directory, confirmed in power, and relieved from the control of a popular legislature, hastened, towards the close of the year 1797, to put into force their project of subjugating the Swiss republics. The first hostile movement on the part of the French, was to take possession of the Helvetic part of the bishopric of Basle, under some frivolous pretence, and contrary to an existing treaty concluded with the Swiss in the year 1792. Either too weak or too prudent to resent this infraction of their rights, the Helvetic body still flattered themselves with an amicable termination of their difference with France; when an insurrection, which broke out in the Pays-de-Vaud, probably through French instigation, or at least through the influence of French principles, afforded a fuller pretext for the overthrow of the government. In the month of December, the French directory thought proper to interfere in this domestic dispute, and demanded from the government of Berne, what they termed the restoration of the rights of that people, and the assembling of the estates of the Pays-de-Vaud in their ancient form. This demand they immediately prepared to enforce by arms; and General Menard was ordered to march, with a body of 15,000 men, to support the claims of the petitioning party in the Pays-de-Vaud. The designs of the French were for the moment frustrated by the timidity or generosity of the supreme council of Berne. On the 5th of January, 1798, they issued a proclamation, enjoining the citizens of the Pays-de-Vaud to assemble in arms, to renew the oath of allegiance, to proceed immediately to the reform of every abuse in the government, and to assert and re-establish all their ancient rights. A commission had been previously appointed at Lausanne, for determining on the claims of the petitioners, and for reinstating the country in its former tranquillity. From what causes it happened, we have not as yet been correctly informed, but the proceedings of the commission seemed involved altogether in embarrassment and delay. The people became impatient, and the insurrection at once broke out into actual hostility. The castle of Chillon was seized by the insurgents; and the commotions which took place in the southern districts of the province appeared no less formidable. The government of Berne now determined to reduce the insurgents by force; and a body of 20,000 troops, under the command of Colonel Weis, was dispatched to disperse them. Whether the lenient measures pursued by this general, were consistent with sound policy or not, it is impossible, from the materials which have hitherto fallen under our inspection, to determine. Suffice it to say, that though it is not certain that more precipitate movements would have saved the country, yet his inactivity undoubtedly served to increase at once the power and the audacity of the insurgents. Thus situated, the approach of the French decided the contest. On passing the boundary, Menard dispatched an aide-de-camp, attended by two hussars, to General Weis, at Yverdon; on their return, a fatal affray took place at the village of Thierens, in which one of the hussars was killed. Who were the aggressors in this unfortunate business is not correctly ascertained, but it was regarded by Menard as a declaration of war. His troops immediately advanced, while those of Weis retreated, and the whole of the Pays-de-Vaud was, by the beginning of February, in the possession of the French.\n\nThe government of Berne still hoped, it appears, to avert the destruction which now seemed to await them; the centenials who had killed the hussar at Thierens were delivered up, and fresh negotiations were entered on. In the mean time, however, new insurrections were planned in different parts, and the revolutionary mania appeared to increase. In the sedulous assemblages\non these occasions, the French envoy, Mengaud, was observed to take a decided part; and, on the 2d of January, he formally reclaimed some persons who had been arrested for treasonable practices by the government of Berne, as the friends and allies of the French republic. To this reclamation the government of Berne paid little attention; and the standard of revolt having been erected at Arau, they determined on effective measures for its suppression and their own defence. The Argovian militia marched to Arau; the town and province were immediately reduced, and the leaders of the insurrection were taken into custody.\n\nWar now appeared inevitable. To conciliate the minds of the people, and induce them more freely to lend their assistance, the government of Berne decreed, that 52 deputies from the principal towns and communes should be added to the supreme council; and, on the 2d of February, these new deputies took their seats. A general reform of all the abuses of the government was the first resolution agreed on in their deliberations; and the example of Berne was followed by the cantons of Lucerne, Fribourg, Soleure, Schaffhausen, and Zurich.\n\nWhile, in this state of things, fresh negotiations were commenced with the French directory, a defensive force of about 20,000 men was collected. The other Swiss cantons dispatched their quotas to the defence of Berne, which amounted to about 54,500 men. A truce had been concluded with the French general in the Pays-de-Vaud, where an officer of the name of Brune had succeeded Menard in the command. The truce was to have expired on the 1st of March; but General d'Erlach, fearful lest the spirit of his troops should slacken, demanded, on the 26th of February, positive orders to put his army in motion, and the council immediately made a decree to that effect. The plan of the campaign was now arranged by M. d'Erlach, and notice had been given to the posts that hostilities were to commence on the evening of the 1st of March; when the movements of the Swiss general were frustrated by the repeal of the decree which had been so hastily passed, and the negotiation was renewed with the French commander.\n\nM. Mallet du Pan affirms, that the French general Brune, had agreed to prolong the truce for 30 hours; but, on the 2d March, the castle of Dornach, at the northern extremity of the canton of Soleure, was attacked and carried by the French; and at the same time, 13,000 men were marched under the walls of Soleure, which capitulated to General Schauenbourg on the first summons. Fribourg was immediately after reduced by General Brune, and the Swiss army was forced to retreat.\n\nWhile disaffection prevailed in the army of General d'Erlach, the inhabitants of Berne saw the rapid approach of the victorious army. On the 3d of March, the levy of the Landvöllurm, or the rising of the people in a mass, was proclaimed. The expedient did not succeed in favour of the magistrates; the people were no sooner assembled in arms, than they of themselves dissolved the government; a provisional regency was elected for the occasion; the event was notified to General Brune; and to facilitate a pacification, an order was issued to dismiss the army, on condition that the French would keep the posts they at present occupied.\n\nUnsatisfied with this concession, the French general inflicted on the town receiving a French garrison. In the mean time all was confusion, both in Berne and in the army; the left division of which had mutinied, deserted their posts, and put to death some of their officers. By defection, the Swiss army was now reduced to 14,000, to which might be added the undisciplined rabble which the Landvöllurm had called forth. About 8000 of the regular forces were stationed at Newenegg, and 6400 held the position of Frauenbrunnen, against which General Schauenbourg advanced from Soleure, at the head of 18,000 men. On the morning of the 5th March, both posts were attacked by the French, and a momentary success seemed to crown the valorous efforts of the division at Newenegg; but those stationed at Frauenbrunnen were, after a vigorous resistance, obliged to retreat; M. d'Erlach rallied his men at Uteren, where a second engagement took place, but with no better success on the part of the Swiss. At Grouholtz, however, they again made a stand, whence they were driven to the gates of the capital, where they were completely routed. The Swiss, in this engagement, lost 2000 killed and wounded; while the loss of the French was about 1800.\n\nOn the evening of the 5th, General Brune entered Berne, the city of Berne by capitulation. The divisions of the Swiss army stationed at Newenegg and Gummen retreated; the soldiers of this last column, in despair, put their officers to death; and the unfortunate d'Erlach, in flying from the field of battle, was murdered by his countrymen and soldiers.\n\nThe submission of nearly the whole of Switzerland followed the defeat of the Bernese. The democratic republics, however, still made a glorious stand, defeated General Schauenbourg, and forced him to retire with the loss of 3000 men.\n\nThe Swiss confederacy, after this revolution, changed its constitution, and even its name. Provisional governments, under the direction of the French generals, were formed in the different districts, and the whole assumed the name of the Helvetic republic. Contributions were levied as usual, by the French commissioners; and some shocking enormities are reported to have been committed, chiefly by the army of the Rhine; for the divisions which belonged to the army of Italy are said to have conducted themselves with superior humanity and justice.\n\nIn the beginning of 1802, a new constitution was framed for the Helvetic republic, under the direction of Bonaparte. Its leading features are as follows.\n\nThe Helvetic republic is one. Every citizen has a right of settling in any canton of the republic, and of exercising all the civil and political rights in the same manner as the citizens of the canton.\n\nBerne is the capital of Helvetia. The Helvetic territory is divided into 21 cantons. The ecclesiastical property, in general, can be employed only for establishments of religious instruction, or of charity.\n\nThere is a central administration of the republic for the exercise of the national sovereignty, and an administration of the cantons. The administration of the cantons is composed of a diet and a senate. The diet is formed by the union of representatives from all the cantons, in the following proportions.—Berne, six; Zurich, two; Lucerne, five; Uri, one; Schwyz, three; Unterwalden,\nSwitzerland. Underwalden, one; Zug, one; Glaris, one; Soleure, two; Fribourg, three; Baille, two; Schaffhausen, one; Appenzell, one; St Gal, four; Turgovia, two; Argovia, two; Baden, two; Vaud, four; Grisons, one; Tellin, three; Valais, two. The members of the diet remain five years in office. The diet is to assemble regularly every year on the 1st of March. It shall be extraordinarily convoked by the senate when the majority of the cantons require it, or when itself shall judge that measure necessary. The president of the diet shall be the landamtmann who is not in office. He has a casting vote, in case the votes shall be equally divided. A deputation of four members from the senate shall assist at the diet, and shall take part in its deliberations, but without having a right to vote.\n\nThe senate is composed of two landamtman, two stadtholders or lieutenants, and 26 councillors. Each canton must have at least one member in it. The senate forms the projects of laws and regulations, and submits them to the sanction of the cantons. The two landamtman and their lieutenants have the direction of foreign affairs. The senate names and recalls diplomatic agents, on a proposition from the landamtman. The landamtman in office is to receive a salary of 16,000 livres, Swif's currency; the second landamtman, his two lieutenants, and the members of the petty council, 6,000 livres; those of the senate 4,000. The senate may adjourn for three months. During this interval, the petty council exercises the executive power.\n\nSWIVELS, a kind of ring made to turn round in a flapple, or other ring. These are used when a ship lies at her moorings; also in tedders for cattle, that they may turn round without unwarping the tedder.\n\nSWIVEL-Cannon, is a small piece of artillery belonging to a ship of war, which carries a shot of half a pound, and is fixed in a socket on the top of the ship's side, stern, or bow, and also in her tops. The trunnions of this piece are contained in a fort of iron crotch, of which the lower end terminates in a cylindrical pivot resting in the socket, so as to support the weight of the cannon. The socket is bored in a strong piece of oak, reinforced with iron hoops, in order to enable it to sustain the recoil. By means of this frame, which is called the swivel, and an iron handle on its escutcheon, the gun may be directed by the hand to any object. It is therefore very necessary in the tops, particularly when loaded with musket-balls, to fire down on the upper decks of the adversary in action.\n\nSWOONING. See Medicine, No. 274.\n\nSWORD, an offensive weapon worn at the side, and serving either to cut or stab. Its parts are, the handle, guard, and blade; to which may be added the bow, scabbard, pommel, &c.\n\nSWORD of State, which is borne before the king, lords, and governors of counties, cities, or boroughs, &c. For or before the king, it ought to be carried upright; the hilt as low as the bearer's waist, the blade up between his eyes. For or before a duke, the blade must decline from the head, and be carried between the neck and the right shoulder. For or before an earl, the blade is to be carried between the point of the shoulder and the elbow; and for or before a baron, the blade is to be borne in the bend of the arm. This ceremonial form no less denotes the dignity of a governor than the coronet set on his coat of arms.\n\nSWORD-Fish. See Xiphias, Ichthyology Index.\n\nSWORN BROTHERS (fratres jurati), persons who, by mutual oath, covenanted to share each other's fortune. Formerly, in any notable expedition to invade and conquer an enemy's country, it was the custom for the more eminent soldiers to engage themselves by reciprocal oaths to share the rewards of their service. This practice gave occasion to the proverb of sworn brothers or brethren in iniquity, because of their dividing plunder and spoil.\n\nSYCAMORE-TREE. See Acer, Botany Index.\n\nSYCOPHANT, an appellation given by the ancient Athenians to those who informed of the exportation of figs contrary to law; and hence it is still used in general for all informers, parasites, flatterers, cheats, &c.\n\nSYDENHAM, Dr Thomas, an excellent English physician, was the son of William Sydenham of Winford Eagle in Dorsetshire, and was born there about the year 1624. He studied at Magdalen-hall, Oxford; but left that university when Oxford was garrisoned for King Charles I. and went to London: where, becoming acquainted with Dr Thomas Cox, an eminent physician, that gentleman persuaded him to apply himself to the study of physic; accordingly, after the garrison was delivered up to the parliament, he retired again to Magdalen-hall, entered on the study of medicine, and in 1648 was created bachelor of physic. Soon after, he was made a fellow of All-Souls college, and continued there several years: when, leaving the university, he settled at Westminster, became doctor of his faculty at Cambridge; grew famous for his practice; and was the chief physician in London from the year 1660 to 1670; at which period he began to be disfabled by the gout. He died in 1689. His works are highly esteemed both at home and abroad. He was famous for his cool regimen in the small-pox; for giving the bark after the paroxysm in agues; and for his use of laudanum. He regulated his practice more by his own observations and inquiries, than by the method either of his predecessors or contemporaries.\n\nSYENE, an ancient city of Egypt, situated, according to Mr Bruce, in north latitude 24° 0' 45\". Pliny and Strabo both say that it lay directly under the tropic of Cancer. Whether Mr Bruce's authority be sufficient to overturn the evidence of Pliny and Strabo, we shall leave to others to determine.\n\nSyene is remarkable for being the place where the first attempt was made to measure the circumference of the earth. This was done by Eratothenes, whom Ptolemy Euergetes had invited from Athens to Alexandria. In this attempt two positions were assumed, viz. that Alexandria and Syene were exactly 5,000 stadia distant from each other, and that they were precisely under the same meridian; but both these are denied by Mr Bruce, who has made many observations on the subject, which our limits will not allow us to take notice of at present. He tells us, that there is at Asium an obelisk erected by Ptolemy Euergetes, the patron of Eratothenes, without hieroglyphics, directly facing the south, with its top first cut into a narrow neck, then spread out like a fan into a semicircular form, with\nWith pavements curiously levelled to receive the shade, and make the separation of the true shadow from the penumbra as distinct as possible. This is supposed by Mr Bruce to have been constructed with a design to vary the experiment of Eratosthenes with a larger radius; and the inquiry concerning the dimensions of the earth, in our author's opinion, was the occasion of many obelisks being erected in this kingdom; a demonstration of which is, that the figure of the top is varied; being sometimes very sharp, and sometimes a portion of a circle, in order to get rid of the great impediment arising from the penumbra, which makes it difficult to determine the length of the shadow with precision. It is now called Aegaeon.\n\nSYLLA, Lucius Cornelius, was descended from the illustrious family of the Scipios. His behaviour in his younger years by no means corresponded with the excellent education which he had received. But debauchery, instead of bringing along with it infamy and ruin, its usual attendants, served only to increase the wealth of this fortunate Roman; for Nicopolis, a rich courtezan, whose affections he had gained, left him heir to her great estate.—He learned the art of war under Marius, whom he attended to Numidia in quality of quaestor. Though hitherto unaccustomed to arms, he became in a short time the most skilful soldier in the army, while by his polite and obliging behaviour he gained the love and esteem of every body. His courage and dexterity contributed a great deal towards the success of the war; it was his eloquence in particular that persuaded Bocchus to deliver up Jugurtha. He served afterwards in the Social war, where his actions entirely eclipsed those of every other commander. As a reward for this conduct he was raised to the praetorship. It is pretended by some that Sylla purchased this dignity; and that when he threatened one day to make use of the powers of his office against Strabo the father of Pompey, that Roman replied with a smile, \"You are in the right to say so; your office is certainly yours, since you purchased it.\" Be this as it may, after the conclusion of the Social war he was made consul, and soon after declared general of the army which was to be sent against Mithridates king of Pontus. Marius, at that time the most renowned of the Roman generals, expected that the management of this war would have been committed to him, and was therefore much exasperated at the disappointment. The people were persuaded by his intrigues to reverse the former decree, and substitute him in place of Sylla. Upon this he sent down officers to take the command of the army; but Sylla by this time had gained over the soldiers; who, instead of obeying the decree of the people, flew Marius's officers, and intreated Sylla to lead them instantly to Rome. Accordingly he entered the city sword in hand, flew Sulpicius the consul, obliged Marius to flee, new-modelled the laws, and afterwards marched into the East, and immediately laid siege to Athens; for that city, together with the rest of Greece, had fallen into the power of Mithridates. He wrote to the Amphictyons, who were assembled at Delphi, to send him all the gold which was deposited in the temple of Apollo, because he stood in need of money; promising, at the same time, to restore it again at the end of the war. When he received this treasure, he observed, with an air of rillery, that he now no longer despaired of victory, since the gods themselves furnished him with money to pay his troops. Famine soon obliged the Athenians to think of a surrender. Their ambassadors waited on Sylla, and began to harangue about Theseus and Codrus, and Marathon and Salamis,—when he interrupted them, and exclaimed, \"Go, repeat these fine orations in your schools; I have come hither, not to learn your history, but to chastise rebels.\" Athens was at last taken by assault, and Sylla was upon the point of destroying it, when he recollected its ancient glory, and spared (as he said) the living for the sake of the dead. After burning the Piraeus, he gained two decisive victories over the generals of Mithridates. In the second battle, which was fought at Orchomenus, he was almost defeated; his troops began to flee, when, leaping from his horse, he snatched up a standard, and advanced against the enemy, crying out, \"I will die here gloriously; and, soldiers, when you are asked where you abandoned your general, answer, At Orchomenus.\" This reproach recalled the courage of the Romans; they followed him to the charge, and gained a complete victory. Mithridates, humbled by these disasters, sent ambassadors to sue for peace.\n\nMean time Cinna had declared against Sylla in Italy; and Marius returning from banishment, had taken the most severe vengeance on all his enemies. Sylla was declared a traitor; his laws were repealed, his friends murdered, and the government new-modelled. The news of these transactions induced Sylla to conclude a treaty with Mithridates, and march directly to Rome. His approach terrified the Romans. Marius and Cinna were both dead; but the consuls made vigorous preparations to oppose him. A civil war was begun; but Sylla in the end subdued all his enemies, and entirely ruined the Marian faction. He entered Rome at the head of his victorious army, and publicly assumed the surname of Happy. Happy, indeed, had he ceased to live when he ceased to conquer. The remainder of his life contains nothing else but a catalogue of the most abominable cruelties. He declared that every one who expected a pardon for their late offences, must gain it by destroying the enemies of the state. The sword of the assassin was thus unheathed, and murder encouraged as the path to power and distinction. The noblest of the Romans were everywhere massacred; slaves were rewarded for cutting off their masters; children were seen dragging their parents to execution; and brothers claiming a recompense for the murder of brothers. Sylla ordered 8000 wretches, who had thrown themselves upon his clemency, to be butchered in the Campus Martius. In the mean time he entered the senate-house, and began to talk with great coolness about his exploits. The senate, alarmed at the horrid outrages of the sufferers, at first thought that the city was given up to be plundered; but Sylla informed them, with an unembarrassed air, that it was only some criminals punished by his orders, and that they needed not be apprehensive about their own fate.\n\nTo carry on these cruelties with the appearance of justice, he commanded the people to elect him dictator. He kept this office for more than two years; and then, to the amazement of all, laid it down, and offered to stand his trial before the people. Soon afterwards he retired into the country, and plunged headlong into every kind of debauchery. Nor did he relinquish his cruelty\nSYLLABLE, in Grammar, one or more letters pronounced by a single impulse of the voice, forming a complete sound, and constituting a word or a part of a word. No single letter can form a syllable except a vowel. The longest syllable in the English language is the word strength.\n\nThe most natural way of dividing words into syllables is, to separate all the simple sounds of which any word consists, so as not to divide those letters which are joined close together according to the most accurate pronunciation.\n\nSYLLABUB, a kind of compound drink, most used in the summer season; ordinarily made of white wine, sugar, and nutmeg, into which is milked a quantity of new milk from the cow. Sometimes it is made of canary in place of white wine; in which case the sugar is spared, and a little lemon and nutmeg are added instead of it. To prepare it the best way, the wine and other ingredients, except the milk, are to be mixed over night, and the milk or cream added in the morning. The proportion is, a pint of wine to three of milk.\n\nFor SYLLABUS, whipt, to half a pint of white wine or Rhenish is put a pint of cream, with the whites of three eggs. This they seethe with sugar, and beat with birchen rods, or work with a syringe. The froth is taken off as it rises, and put into a pot; where, after standing to settle two or three hours, it is fit to eat.\n\nSYLLOGISM, in Logic, an argument or term of reasoning, consisting of three propositions; the two first of which are called premises; the last, the conclusion. See LOGIC, Part III.\n\nSYLVIA, a genus of birds, belonging to the order of parrakeets, formed by Dr Latham by limiting the motacilla to the wagtail, and arranging the other species, formerly classified under that genus, under the sylvia. He makes 13 species of the motacilla, and 174 species of symbol the sylvia. See MOTACILLA, ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nSYMBOL, a sign or representation of something moral, by the figures or properties of natural things. Hence symbols are of various kinds; as hieroglyphics, types, enigmas, parables, fables, &c.\n\nSYMMACHUS, a citizen and senator of ancient Rome, and consul in the year 391, has left us ten books of epistles; from which, as well as from other things, we collect, that he was a warm opposer of the Christian religion. He was banished from Rome by Valentinian or some account or other, but afterwards recalled and received into favour by Theodosius. Ammianus Marcellinus speaks of him as a man of great learning and modesty. Scipio, Pareus, and other learned men, have written notes upon the epistles of Symmachus: we know of no later edition of them than that of Frankfort, 1642, 8vo. Ambrose bishop of Milan wrote against Symmachus, and so did the Christian poet Prudentius.\n\nSYMMETRY, the just proportion of the several parts of any thing, so as to compose a beautiful whole.\n\nSYMMETRY, in Painting. See PAINTING, Part I, Sect. III.\n\nSYMONDSBOROUGH, a remarkable large barrow of Flints, near Wellington in Devonshire, in the northern extremity of Hemyock. The common people have a notion that a king called Symon was buried here. The tradition of the country plainly shows that it was the burial-place of some person or persons of eminence.\n\nSYMPATHETIC, something that acts or is acted upon by sympathy. Thus we say, sympathetic diseases, inks, &c.\n\nSYMPATHETIC INKS. See Sympathetic INK.\n\nSYMPATHY, an agreement of affections and inclinations, or a conformity of natural qualities, humours, temperaments, which make two persons delighted and pleased with each other.\n\nSYMPATHY, also denotes the quality of being affected by the affection of another; and may subsist either between different persons or bodies, or between different parts of the same body. It is either similar or dissimilar; similar, when the affection or action in the sympathizer is similar to the affection or action in the sympathant; and dissimilar, when those are different.—Sympathy too, is often an imitative faculty, sometimes involuntary, frequently without consciousness: thus we yawn when we see others yawn, and are made to laugh by the laughing of another.\n\nSympathy, according to Dr Jackson*, relates to the * Treatise operations of the affections of the mind, to the operations of sympathies of the imagination, and to the affections of the external senses.\n\n1. The passions and affections of the mind produce in the body different sensations and impressions, and, as sympathies of consciousness, determine in general the spirits to those parts which labour most, or are most apt to be affected. Thus fear and anger determine to the heart; lust to the eyes, &c.; joy, pity, wonder, and the like, to the head. See PASSION, page 14.\n\nThe affections of the mind of one person will often work upon the spirits of many. Thus whole companies are sometimes disposed to be sad and melancholy, or merry and jovial, when any one is present much inclined to either of those states of mind; and it has been observed,\nSympathy observed, that old people, who have loved the company of the young, and have been conversant continually with them, have generally lived long. But young people must not conclude from this, that the company and conversation of the grave and old will operate upon the living and sensitive principle, through the affections of their mind, and dispose them to be short-lived. On the contrary, by thus improving their understanding, they will be more enabled to fortify their constitution and resist the ravages of youthful indulgence.\n\nIt may also be further observed, that those tender sympathetic affections which lay hold of the mind, at the representation of theatrical performances, originate from the same principle, while they are to be considered as the surest test of just execution in the actor, and of the expressive language of the author. Indeed all stage effect depends on sympathy.\n\nIt has been said, that the passions of the mind are occasionally infectious, particularly some of them. Thus fear and shame are sometimes very suddenly so. We frequently may have occasion to see, that the starting of one will make another ready to start. Again, when one man is out of countenance in company, others will often blush in his behalf. However, the serious passions may surely be so under the control of reason as to resist infection, whatever may be the case of temporary, muscular, or nervous attraction.\n\n2. Our author is inclined to think, that a connection between the affections and sensations of the female mind and uterus, is very materially concerned in the process of generation, and probably can alone give efficacy to those actions and impressions subservient to conception, through the sympathizing affections of the mind. But this is a subject of which we know so little, that the speculations of even the most distinguished philosophers respecting it have been nothing but the wild ravings of imagination.\n\nWith respect to the depravity and force of the imagination in the production of sympathies, they always operate most upon \"weak minds and spirits, and therefore most on women, superstitious and fearful persons, sick people, children, and young creatures.\" Their effects, however, sometimes fail to appear, because they are encountered and overcome by the mind and spirit before they work any manifest effects.\"\n\nSuch effects are obviated upon the same principle which establishes the prevention of bodily disease: \"for in infection and contagion from body to body (as, for example, during the plague), the miasma may be received; but from the strength and good disposition of the body, it is expelled and wrought out before it has had sufficient time to form the disease.\"\n\nIt has been said, and many are of the opinion, that the force of imagination doth often forward the end professed. Thus, for instance, it has been put as a question, \"Whether a man, when he constantly and strongly believes that such a thing shall be (as that such a one will love him, and the like), helps any thing to the effecting the thing desired?\" Certainly not in the manner which has been advanced, namely, \"by a secret operation on the spirit of another.\" If he succeeds, it is either because he persevered, or because his perseverance and earnestness (and not any occult operation) makes him at length he attended to.\n\nThere is not a doubt but the force of imagination often gives energy to our actions. It may, however, unless we are much on our guard, easily delude us aside from reason. It has been the tree which has yielded the fruits of superstition in former times, and which has often fed the human mind with the most extravagant notions of sympathy. Sympathies of this kind, such as the power of charms, and the like, are now pretty generally exploded.\n\n3. The five senses, hearing, tasting, smelling, feeling, and seeing, are conscious of a sympathetic impression from odious objects. \"1. A disagreeable sound will set the teeth on edge, and make all the body shiver. 2. The swallowing of a nauseous medicine will be attended with a shaking of the head and neck. 3. Disagreeable smells produce nearly the same effect, which are felt perceived, because there is a remedy at hand by stopping the nose. 4. If you come suddenly out of the sun into the shade, the sense of feeling is disturbed by a chillness or shivering of the whole body. 5. And even sudden darkness produces a propensity to shivering.\n\nThere is a very apparent reason why a sympathy should take place between the eyes. Hence their motions are synchronous. It may be said, that custom and habit dispose the eyes to move one and the same way; \"for when one moveth towards the nose, the other eye moveth from the nose.\"\n\nThough the eyes are by nature prone to move in concert, custom will, however, destroy this natural concert, and produce the contrary effect. Thus some people can squint when they will. Our author therefore gives this caution to mothers and nurses: \"Let them not suffer infants to sit with a candle placed behind them; for both their eyes will be disposed to move outwards, as affecting to see the light of the candle, which may bring on the habit of squinting.\"\n\nIt appears as a quality in the senses of hearing and seeing, \"that the instrument of each separate sense has a sympathy and similitude to that which giveth the reflection.\" Thus it has been observed, \"that the eye will sympathize with a crystal glass or water, and the ear with caves and such hollow places as are suited to report echo.\"\n\nSympathies have been compared to unisons of sound in music. Unisons of sound produce agreeable sympathetic feelings; the reverse produce disagreeable feelings. \"All concords and discords of music are (no doubt) sympathies and antipathies of sound.\" Moreover, \"they are said to work as well by report of sound as by motion.\"\n\nThe most agreeable as well as obvious objects operate in a secondary way, in producing those sympathetic impressions and actions which they commonly give rise to. An increased secretion of saliva often takes place at the sight of a favourite dish; and the running of water from a bottle, or otherwise, will sometimes affect individuals of a particular temperature, with an involuntary propensity to void urine.\n\nMany have attempted to account for the remarkable sympathy which takes place between parts of the body seemingly unconnected with each other; but as these attempts are merely conjectures, without any solid principles to rest on, we pass them over as the dreams of ingenious men. It would be fortunate for science, if men would confine themselves to those subjects which can be known,\nSYMPHONIA, a genus of plants belonging to the clas of monadelphus. See BOTANY Index.\n\nSYMPHONY, in Music, properly denotes a concordance or concert of several sounds agreeable to the ear, whether vocal or instrumental, called also harmony.

This office was sometimes performed by the person at whose charge the entertainment was provided; sometimes by another named by him; and at other times, especially in entertainments provided at the common expense, he was elected by lot, or by the suffrages of the guests.\n\nSYMPTOM, in Medicine, any circumstance which indicates the existence, nature, or stage of a disease. Pain, waking, drowsiness, convulsions, suppression of urine, difficulty of breathing and swallowing, coughs, distastes, nausea, thirsts, swoonings, faintings, loofenels, collyvenels, drynels and blackness of the tongue, are the principal symptoms of diseases. See MEDICINE, No. 41.\n\nSYMPTOMATIC, in Medicine, is a term often used to denote the difference between the primary and secondary causes in diseases; thus a fever from pain is said to be symptomatical, because it rises from pain only.\n\nSYNÆRESIS, CONTRACTION, in Grammar, a figure whereby two syllables are united in one; as venem for vellemen.\n\nSYNAGOGUE, among the Jews, is a place where that people met to worship God. Authors are not agreed about the time when the Jews first began to have synagogues.—Some suppose them as old as the ceremonial law, and others fix their beginning to the times after the Babylonish captivity. They erected synagogues not only in towns and cities, but also in the country, especially near rivers, that they might have water for their purifications and ceremonious washings. No synagogue was built in any town, unless there were ten persons of leisure in it; but there might be many in one town, or in one quarter of a town, provided it was very populous. Jerusalem is said to have contained 480. The chief things belonging to a synagogue were, 1. The ark or chest, made after the model of the ark of the covenant, containing the Pentateuch. 2. The pulpit and desk in the middle of the synagogue, in which he that was to read or expound the law stood. 3. The seats or pews Synagogue for the people. 4. The lamps to give light at evening service, and the feast of dedication. 5. Rooms or apartments for the utensils and alms chests. The synagogue was governed by a council or assembly, over whom was a president, called The Ruler of the Synagogue. These are sometimes called Chiefs of the Jews, The Rulers, The Priests or Elders, The Governors, The Overseers, The Fathers of the Synagogue. Their business was to punish the disobedient, by censures, by excommunication, or by penalties, such as fines and scourging; to take care of the alms, which are frequently called by the name of righteousness. The chief ruler, or one of the rulers, gave leave to have the law read and expounded, and appointed who should do it. In every synagogue, there were several ministers who had different offices assigned to them. Service was performed three times a day, viz. in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night; at the time of morning sacrifice, evening sacrifice, and after the evening sacrifice on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, there was a more forcible obligation upon the people to attend than upon the other days. There are synagogues at London, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Avignon, Metz, &c.\n\nSYNALOEPHA, in Grammar, a contraction of syllables, performed principally, by suppressing some vowel or diphthong at the end of a word, on account of another vowel or diphthong at the beginning of the next. As, ill' ego, for ille ego, &c.\n\nConticuer' omnes intetiqua' ora tenebant. Virg.\n\nIt is called by the Latins collifo.\n\nSYNARTHROSIS, SYNCHONDROSIS, See ANATOMY, No. 2.\n\nSYNCELLUS, or SINCCELLUS, an ancient officer in the family of the patriarchs, and other prelates of the eastern church. The word, in the corrupt Greek, ευγενειας, signifies a person who lies in the chamber with another; a chamber-fellow, or olum. The syncellus was an ecclesiastic, who lived with the patriarch of Constantinople, to be a witness of his conduct; whence it is, that the syncellus was also called the patriarch's eye, because his business was to observe and watch. The other prelates had also their syncelli, who were clerks living in the house with them, and even lying in the same chamber, to be witnesses of the purity of their manners. Afterwards the office degenerated into a mere dignity; and there were made syncelli of churches.—At last it became a title of honour, and was bestowed by the emperor on the prelates themselves; whom they called pontifical syncelli, and syncelli Augustales.\n\nSYNCHRONISM denotes the happening of several things at the same time. See CHRONOLOGY.\n\nSYNCOPATION, in Music, denotes a striking or beating of time, whereby the distinction of the several times or parts of the measure is interrupted. However, it is more properly used for the connecting the last note of any measure, or bar, with the first of the following measure, so as only to make one note of both. A syncopation is sometimes also made in the middle of a measure. Syncopation is also used when a note of one part ends or terminates on the middle of a note of the other part. This is otherwise denominated binding. It is likewise used for a driving note; that is, when some shorter note at the beginning of a measure, or half measure, is followed.\nSyncope. Lowed by two, three, or more longer notes before another short note occurs, equal to that which occasioned the driving, to make the number even, e.g., when an odd crotchet comes before two or three minims, or an odd quaver before two, three, or more crotchets. In syncopated or driving notes, the hand or foot is taken up, or put down, while the note is sounding.\n\nSyncope, Fainting; a deep and sudden swooning during which the vital functions are suspended. See Medicine, No. 98 and 272.\n\nSyncofe, in Grammar, an elision or retrenchment of a letter or syllable out of the middle of a word, as caldus for caldus.\n\nSyndic, in government and commerce, an officer, in divers countries, intrusted with the affairs of a city or other community, who calls meetings, makes representations and solicitations to the ministry, magistracy, &c., according to the exigency of the case.\n\nSynecdoche, in Rhetoric, a kind of trope frequent among orators and poets.

See Medicine, No. 16.\n\nSynod, in Astronomy, a conjunction or concourse of two or more stars or planets, in the same optical place of the heavens.\n\nSynod signifies also a meeting or assembly of ecclesiastical persons to consult on matters of religion.\n\nOf these there are four kinds, viz. 1. General, or ecumenical, where bishops, &c., meet from all nations. These were first called by the emperors, afterwards by Christian princes; till in later ages the pope usurped to himself the greatest share in this business, and by his legates presided in them when called. 2. National, where those of one nation only come together, to determine any point of doctrine or discipline. The first of this sort which we read of in England, was that of Hereford or Hertford, in 673, and the last was that held by Cardinal Pole, in 1555. 3. Provincial, where those only of one province meet, now called the convocation. 4. Diocesan, where those of but one diocese meet, to enforce canons made by general councils, or national and provincial synods, and to consult and agree upon rules of discipline for themselves. These were not wholly laid aside, till by the act of submission, 25 Hen. VIII. c. 19, it was made unlawful for any synod to meet, but by royal authority. See Council and Convocation.\n\nSynods, Provincial, in the Government of the Church of Scotland. See Presbyterians, No. 14.\n\nSynodals, or Synodists, were pecuniary rents (commonly of two shillings), paid to the bishop, or archdeacon, at the time of their Easter visitation, by every parish priest. They were thus called, because usually paid in synods; because anciently bishops used to visit and hold their diocesan synods once.—For the synodical name reason, they are sometimes also denominated synodalica; but more usually, procurations.\n\nSynodical, something belonging to a synod. Thus, synodical epistles are circular letters written by the synods to the absent prelates and churches; or even those general ones directed to all the faithful, to inform them of what had passed in the synod.\n\nSynoecia, in Grecian antiquity, a feast celebrated at Athens in memory of Theseus's having united all the petty communities of Attica into one single commonwealth; the seat whereof was at Athens, where all the assemblies were to be held. This feast was dedicated to Minerva; and, according to the scholiast on Thucydides, it was held in the month Metageitnion.\n\nSynonymous, is applied to a word or term that has the same import or signification with another.\n\nSeveral works have been composed for the express purpose of explaining synonymous words. In 1777 a work was published on the Latin synonyma at Paris by M. Gardin Dumfri. The abbé Girard published one on the synonymous terms of the French language many years ago. Another was published on the same subject in the year 1785 by the abbé Roubaud. An account of the English synonyma was published by an anonymous author in 1766; which is a close imitation, and in some parts a literal translation, of the abbé Girard's Synonymes François. Mrs Pizzzi has written some essays on the same subject.\n\nSynovia, in Medicine, a term used by Paracelsus and his school for the nutritious juice proper and peculiar to each part. Thus they talk of the synovia of the joints, of the brain, &c.\n\nSyntax, in Grammar, the proper construction or due disposition of the words of a language into sentences and phrases. See Grammar and Language.\n\nSynthesis, in Logic, denotes a branch of method, opposite to analysis.\n\nIn the synthesis or synthetic method, we pursue the truth by reasons drawn from principles before established or assumed, and propositions formerly proved: thus proceeding by a regular chain, till we come to the conclusion. Such is the method in Euclid's Elements, and most demonstrations of the ancient mathematicians, which proceed from definitions and axioms, to prove propositions, &c., and from those propositions proved to prove others. This method we also call composition, in opposition to analysis or resolution. See Analysis.\n\nSyphilis. See Medicine, No. 350.\n\nSiphon. See Hydrodynamics. Some uncommon phenomena in nature may be accounted for upon the principles of the siphon; as, for instance, that of reciprocating springs. See Pneumatics, No. 373.\n\nSyracuse, a celebrated city of Sicily, and once at what the capital of the island. It was built, according to time built. Thucydides and Strabo, by Archias, one of the Heraclidae, who came from Corinth into Sicily in the second year of the 11th Olympiad, and derived its name from a neighbouring marsh named Syraco. What form of government first prevailed in the city is not known. Many have supposed it originally to have been governed by kings: but if this were the case, the monarchical government continued only for a very short time; since Aristotle, Diodorus Siculus, and Justin, mention it as being very early subject to a democracy. The history\nSyracuse is obscure and unimportant till the time of Gelon, when Syracuse first began to make a conspicuous figure.\n\nGelon was born in the city of Gela in Sicily, of the family of Telines, who had been created priest of the infernal gods. He signalized himself in a war carried on against the Syracusans, by Hippocrates tyrant of Gela, whom he defeated in a pitched battle. Having thus become very powerful among his countrymen, he soon found means to seize on the sovereignty for himself. In a short time, having put himself at the head of some Syracusan exiles, he marched towards that place, where he was received with loud acclamations and obtained possession of the city.\n\nGelon, in order to people the capital of his new dominions, first demolished the neighbouring city of Camarina, and transplanted the inhabitants to Syracuse. Soon after, entering into a war with the Megareans, he defeated them, took and raised their cities, and in like manner transplanted the people. Syracuse thus became powerful, and full of inhabitants; and the friendship of Gelon was courted both by Athens and Lacedaemon at the time of the Persian invasion. In the mean time the Carthaginians had entered into a treaty with the Persians; by which it was agreed, that the former should attack those of the Greek name in Sicily and Italy, in order to divert them from afflicting each other. Sicily was accordingly invaded by the Carthaginians with a vast army; but they were utterly overthrown by Gelon, as is related under the article Carthage, No 7—9. After this victory, the people out of gratitude obliged him to assume the title of king; which till that time he had refused. A decree also passed by which the crown was settled on his two brothers Hiero and Thrasybulus after his death.\n\nThe new king, instead of keeping his subjects in greater awe, studied to make them happy, and was the first man who became more virtuous by being raised to a throne. He was particularly famous for his honesty, truth, and sincerity; is said never to have wronged the meanest of his subjects, and never to have promised a thing which he did not perform.\n\nGelon died in the year 471 B.C. after having reigned three or four years; and was succeeded by his brother Hiero, whose character is differently drawn by different historians. He is highly celebrated in the odes of Pindar; and it is certain that his court was the resort of men of wit and learning, to whom he behaved in the most courteous manner and with the greatest liberality.\n\nIn 459 B.C. Hiero was succeeded by Thrasybulus; who proving a tyrant, was in ten months driven out, and a popular government restored; which continued for the space of 53 years.\n\nAbout this time the Syracusans entered into a war with the Siculi, which terminated in the total subjection of the latter; after which Syracuse became so powerful, that it in a manner gave law to the whole island. The Greek cities indeed enjoyed a perfect liberty; but they all acknowledged Syracuse as their metropolis: by degrees, however, the latter began to assume such an authority over them as was totally inconsistent with liberty; and this occasioned many wars, which involved them in much distress and danger. They began with the Leontines, whose territory they laid waste, and reduced their city to great straits. Leontini was an Athenian colony; and this furnished the Athenians, who had already meditated the conquest of Sicily, with a pretence to attack the Syracusans with their whole force. Under colour of afflicting their countrymen therefore, they sent a fleet of 250 sail to Sicily; but the Leontines, sensible that their pretended allies aimed at nothing less than the conquest of the whole island, concluded a peace with Syracuse; and the disappointed Athenians vented their rage on those who had advised and conducted the expedition.\n\nDuring the continuance of the popular government, the Syracusans took part in the long war between Athens and Sparta. The circumstances which took place in this contest are sufficiently detailed under Attica, No 126—150.\n\nThis war was scarcely ended, when a new formidable invasion by the Carthaginians took place; but the event of that expedition was as unfortunate to the Carthaginians as the former had been, as has been particularly related under the article Carthage, No 12, et seq.\n\nIn the mean time, a considerable revolution had happened in Syracuse. The city of Agrigentum had been taken by the Carthaginians, and of the few inhabitants who escaped, some fled to Syracuse, where they accused the Syracusan commanders of having betrayed the city into the hands of the enemy. Dionysius, a man of great valour and address, but who had become very obnoxious to the populace, took this opportunity of attempting to retrieve his credit. He therefore supported the accusations brought against his countrymen by the Agrigentines, and even impeached the magistrates as having a secret intelligence with the enemy, and attempting to introduce an oligarchy. As his speech was entirely levelled against the more wealthy citizens, it was very agreeable to the lower class: the commanders were instantly degraded; and others, among whom was Dionysius, were appointed. Having once gained this point, he began to consider how he might get all his colleagues turned out. For this purpose he never joined in any council of war with the other commanders, nor imparted to them his resolutions, giving out that he could not trust them, and that they had more regard for their own interest than the welfare of their country. But while he was proceeding in this manner, the more prudent part of the citizens, perceiving what he aimed at, complained of him to the senate and magistrates, and fined him as a disturber of the public peace. According to the laws, the fine was to be paid before he could speak in public, and the circumstances of Dionysius did not allow him to discharge it. In this dilemma he was assisted by Philidrus the historian, a man of great wealth, who not only paid this fine for him, but encouraged him to speak his mind freely, as it became a zealous citizen to do, promising to pay all the fines that should be laid upon him.\n\nBeing extricated out of this difficulty, Dionysius next proceeded to inveigh, with all the eloquence of which he was master, against those who by means of their power or interest were able to oppose his designs, and by degrees brought them into discredit. His next scheme was to get those exiles recalled whom the nobility had banished at different times; as thinking that they would support him with all their power, as well out of gratitude as out of hatred to the opposite party. Having gained this point also, he next found means to ingratiate himself.\nSyracuse.\n\nself with the soldiery to such a degree, that, under pre-\ntence of taking proper measures for resisting the Cartha-\nginians, he was chosen commander in chief, with abso-\nlute and unlimited power. This was no sooner done,\nthan, pretending his life was in danger, he chose out\n1000 men for his guard, whom he attached to his in-\nterest by great promises. As no person durst now op-\npose him, he possessed himself of the citadel, where all\nthe arms and provisions were kept; after which he pub-\nlicly took the title of king of Syracuse in the year\n404 B.C.\n\nThe Syracusans did not tamely submit to their new\nmatter: but Dionysius managed matters so well, that\ntheir frequent revolts answered no other purpose than\nmore certainly to entail slavery on themselves; and he\nwas allowed to possess the throne without much oppo-\nsition till his death, which happened in the year 366\nB.C.\n\nOn the death of Dionysius, he was succeeded by his\nson, called also Dionysius. He was naturally of a mild\nand peaceable temper, averse to cruelty, and inclined to\nlearning; but his father, to whom all merit, even in\nhis own children, gave umbrage, stifled as far as possible\nhis good qualities by a mean and obscure education. He\nno sooner ascended the throne, than Dion, brother to\nAristomache the other wife of Dionysius the Elder, un-\ndertook to correct the faults of his education, and to in-\nspire him with thoughts suitable to the high station in\nwhich he was placed. For this purpose he sent for the\nphilosopher Plato, under whose care he immediately put\nthe young king. This instantly produced a reformation\non Dionysius; but the courtiers, dreading the effects of\nthe philosopher's instructions, prevailed on him to ban-\nnish Dion, and to keep Plato himself in a kind of impris-\nonment in the citadel. At last, however, he let him\nat liberty; upon which Plato returned to his own coun-\ntry.\n\nDion, in the mean time, visited several of the Gre-\ncian cities, and at last took up his residence in Athens;\nbut the honours which were everywhere paid him, rais-\ned such jealousies in the breast of the tyrant, that he\nflipped his revenue, and caused it to be paid into his\nown treasury. In a short time Dionysius again sent for\nPlato; but finding it impossible to dissolve the friendship\nbetween him and Dion, disgraced, and placed him in a\nvery dangerous situation, in the midst of afflatus who\nhated him. Not daring, however, to offer him any vio-\nlence, he allowed him soon after to depart; revenging\nhimself on Dion, whose estate he sold, and gave his\nwife Arete in marriage to Timocrates one of his own\nflatterers.\n\nDion now resolved to revenge himself on the tyrant\nfor the many injuries he had sustained, and at once to\ndeliver his country from the oppression under which it\ngroaned. He began with raising foreign troops pri-\nvately, by proper agents, for the better execution of his\ndesign. Many Syracusans of distinction entered into his\nscheme, and gave him intelligence of what passed in the\ncity; but of the exiles, of whom there were upwards of\n1000 dispersed up and down Greece, only 25 joined\nhim; so much were they awed by the dread of the ty-\nrant. The troops were assembled at the island of Zacyn-\nthus, in number only about 800; but who had all been\ntried on many occasions, were well disciplined, and cap-\nable of animating by their example the forces which\nDion hoped to find in Sicily. When they were about to\nfail, Dion acquainted them with his design, the bold-\nness of which at first occasioned among them no small\nconternation; but Dion soon removed their fears, by tell-\ning them that he did not lead them as soldiers, but as\nofficers, to put them at the head of the Syracusans and\nall the people of Sicily, who were ready to receive\nthem with open arms. Having then embarked in two small trading vessels, they arrived in 12 days at\nCape Pachynum near Syracuse. At last they arrived\nat the port of Minoa, not far from Agrigentum. Here\nthey received intelligence that Dionysius had set sail for\nItaly, attended by a fleet of 80 galleys. On this Dion\nresolved to take advantage of the tyrant's absence, and\nimmediately set sail for Syracuse. On his march he pre-\nvailed on the inhabitants of Agrigentum, Gela, Ca-\nmarina, and other cities, to join him. As soon as he\nentered the territories of Syracuse, multitudes flocked\nto him; and as nobody appeared to oppose him, he\nboldly entered the city, where he quickly found himself\nat the head of 50,000 men. As soon as he had landed\nin Sicily, Timocrates, to whom his wife Arete had been\ngiven by Dionysius, and to whom the care of the city\nhad been left, dispatched a courier to let the tyrant\nknow the danger in which he was. Dionysius was, how-\never, accidentally prevented from receiving a timely ac-\ncount of Dion's arrival; so that when he entered the ci-\ntadel by sea, seven days after Dion's arrival, he found\nhis affairs in a desperate situation. Upon this he had re-\ncourse to artifice; and having amused the Syracusans by\na feigned negotiation, until he observed that they kept\na negligent guard, he attacked them all at once with\nsuch fury, that he had almost taken the city. But Dion\nencouraged the soldiers by his example so much, that he\nat last obtained a complete victory; for which they pre-\nsented him with a crown of gold.\n\nIt was not long, however, before the ungrateful Sy-\nracusans began to think of conferring quite different re-\nwards on their benefactor. Dionysius had the address\nto render him suspected by the multitude; at the same\ntime that Heraclides, an excellent officer, but a secret\nenemy to Dion, did all that lay in his power to fink his\ncredit. Dionysius was soon obliged to fly into Italy,\nbut left Heraclides to oppose Dion.\n\nAt length Dion got possession of the city, Heraclides\nsubmitted to him, and was received into favour; but as\nhis seditious and turbulent behaviour still continued,\nDion at last gave orders to put him to death. This ac-\ntion, however necessary, so affected the mind of Dion,\nthat he became melancholy; and ever after imagined\nhimself haunted by a frightful spectre, resembling a wo-\nman of gigantic stature, with the haggard looks and air\nof a fury. In a short time after he lost his life, through\nthe base treachery of Calippus, or Gyliippus, who pre-\ntended to be his intimate friend, and who immediately\nafter caused his wife and sister to be carried to prison.\n\nCalippus having removed Dion, soon made him-\nself master of Syracuse, where he committed all manner\nof cruelties; but was driven out, and forced to fly to\nRhegium, where he was murdered with the same dagger\nwhich had killed Dion. In 350 B.C. Dionysius again\nmade himself master of Syracuse; and being exasperated\nby his past misfortunes, tyrannized worse than ever. The\nSyracusans first had recourse to Icetas tyrant of Leonti-\nni; but as the Carthaginians took this opportunity to in-\nvade,\nSyracuse vade them with a powerful fleet and army, they were obliged to apply to the Corinthians. By them Timoleon, a celebrated commander, was sent to the assistance of the Syracusans, whom he found in a very distressing situation; Icetas being master of the city, the Carthaginians of the harbour, and Dionysius of the citadel. As all parties were equally the enemies of Dionysius, he found it impossible to hold out, and therefore surrendered himself to Timoleon, by whom he was sent to Corinth; where at last he was reduced to the necessity of teaching a school for his support.\n\nAfter the expulsion of the tyrant, Timoleon withdrew to Catana, leaving only 400 Corinthians, under the command of an experienced officer named Leon, to guard the citadel. These were immediately besieged by Icetas and the Carthaginians, but Timoleon found means to relieve them in spite of all opposition; and having dispersed emissaries through the army of Mago the Carthaginian general, exhorting the mercenary Greeks to forsake him, he was so much intimidated, that in spite of all the remonstrances Icetas could make, he set sail for Africa, leaving his colleague to carry on the war in the best manner he could.\n\nThe day after the departure of Mago, Timoleon assaulted the city so briskly, that the troops of Icetas were driven from the walls, and the Corinthians became masters of the place. Timoleon, by sound of trumpet, invited the inhabitants to come and assist in demolishing the citadel and other castles, which he called the nests of tyrants; after which he caused edifices to be erected in the place where the citadel had stood, for the administration of justice. He found the city in a most miserable situation: for many having perished in the wars and seditions, and others having fled to avoid the oppression of tyrants, Syracuse, once so wealthy and populous, was now become almost a desert; inasmuch that the horses were fed on the grass which grew on the market-place. Timoleon supplied the city with inhabitants from Corinth and other cities of Greece, at the same time that great multitudes from Italy and the other parts of Sicily resorted thither. Timoleon distributed the lands among them gratis; but sold the houses, and with the money arising from the sale established a fund for the support of the poor. Having thus restored Syracuse, he in like manner delivered all the Greek cities of Sicily from the tyrants who had taken possession of them, all of whom he put to death. After this he resigned his authority, and led a retired life, honoured in the highest degree by the Syracusans, and by all the cities in Sicily. After his death he was honoured as a god; the expense of his funeral was defrayed by the public; sports, with horse races and gymnastic exercises, were held annually on the day of his death; and it was decreed, that whenever the Syracusans were at war with the barbarians, they should send to Corinth for a general.\n\nFor 20 years the Syracusans enjoyed the fruits of Timoleon's victories; but new disturbances arising, in a short time another tyrant started up, who exceeded all that had gone before him in cruelty and other vices. This was the celebrated Agathocles, of whose exploits against the Carthaginians a full account is given under the article Carthage, No. 33—53. He was poisoned by one Monon in the year 289 B.C., after having reigned 28 years, and lived 95.—A succession of tyrants followed, till at last the city, being held by two rivals, Temon and Sofistratus, who made war within the very Syracuse walls, Pyrrhus king of Epirus was invited into Sicily, in order to put an end to these distractions. He willingly complied with the invitation; and was everywhere received with loud acclamations, as the deliverer not only of Syracuse, but of all Sicily. As he had a fine army fitted into 30,000 foot and 5000 horse, with a fleet of 200 sail, he drove the Carthaginians from place to place, till he left them only the two strong posts of Eryx and Lilybaeum. The former of these he took by assault, and was himself the first man who mounted the walls, after having killed a great number of Africans with his own hand. The Mamertines likewise, who had conquered a considerable part of the island, were everywhere defeated and driven out, till at last they were shut up in the city of Messina. The Carthaginians, alarmed at the rapidity of his conquests, sent ambassadors with proposals of peace upon very advantageous terms; but Pyrrhus, puffed up with the expectation of reducing the whole island, refused to hearken to any terms unless they would instantly abandon it. So firm was he in the belief of this, that he caused his son to assume the title of king of Sicily; but in the mean time, having displeased the Sicilians by his arbitrary behaviour, they deserted from him in such numbers that he was glad to get off for Italy, for which retreat the embassies he received from the Samnites, Tarentines, and other Italians, furnished him with an honourable pretext. He embarked in the ships which he had brought with him from Italy; but was met at sea by the Carthaginians, who sunk 70 of his vessels, and dispersed or took the rest; so that he saved himself in Italy only with 12 vessels, the poor remains of a fleet of 200 sail. No Syracuse sooner were the Mamertines apprised of his departure, harried than they dispatched a body of 18,000 men to harass him after his landing. These, having passed the straits before him, posted themselves in the road which Pyrrhus must take in marching by land to Tarentum; and concealing themselves among woods and rocks, attacked him unexpectedly, and with great resolution. But Pyrrhus behaved on this occasion with his usual bravery. The attack being made on his rear, he hastened thither, and made a dreadful slaughter of the enemy, till a wound on his head obliged him to retire.\n\nAfter the departure of Pyrrhus, Hiero the son of Hiero chosen general Hierocles, a descendant of Gelon, the first king of Syracuse, was chosen general of the forces, along with another named Artemidorus. The two generals had nothing more at heart than to put an end to the confusion and disorder which reigned in the city; for which reason they entered it at the head of their forces. On this occasion Hiero discovered extraordinary talents for government. By mere dint of insinuation and address, without shedding blood, or hurting a single citizen, he calmed the minds of the people; reconciled the factions; and so gained the affections of all, that he was invested with the whole civil as well as military power in the state. Soon after this, he married the daughter of one of the first citizens; and having distinguished himself by his exploits against the Mamertines, was unanimously elected king of Syracuse, in the year 265 B.C.\n\nSome time after Hiero's accession to the throne, he again defeated the Mamertines, and reduced them to such straits, that they were obliged to call in the Romans.\nmans to their assistance. The consequences of this have been fully related under the articles ROME and CARTHAGE. Hiero, who had allied himself with the Carthaginians, being himself defeated by the Romans, and finding his allies unable to protect him against the power of that republic, concluded an alliance with them; and continued faithful to them even in the time of the second Punic war, when they were in the greatest distress. In his reign flourished the celebrated mathematician Archimedes, whose genius he employed in fortifying the city of Syracuse, by innumerable machines, in such a manner as rendered it absolutely impregnable to every method of attack known at that time.\n\nHiero died about 211 B.C. and was succeeded by his grandson Hieronymus; but he imprudently forsook the councils of his grandfather, and entered into an alliance with the Carthaginians. Soon after this he was murdered, in consequence of his tyranny and cruelty, and the greatest disorders took place in the city; which Hannibal, though then in Italy, found means to foment, in hopes of keeping the Syracusans in his interest. This indeed he effected; but as his own affairs in Italy began to decline*, he could not prevent Marcellus from landing in Sicily with a formidable army, which the Sicilians could by no means resist. Syracuse was soon invested; but the machines invented by Archimedes baffled all attempts to take it by assault. The immense preparations which the consul had made for taking the city by storm, could not have failed to accomplish his purpose, had the place been otherwise defended than by the contrivance of Archimedes. The Roman fleet consisted of 60 quinquercemes, besides a far greater number of other ships. The decks were covered with soldiers armed with darts, flings, and bows, to drive the besieged from the ramparts, which on one side were washed by the sea, and to facilitate the approach to the walls. But a machine of Marcellus's own invention, called a sambuca, was what he chiefly depended on. The consul's design was to bring his sambuca to the foot of the walls of Acradina; but, while it was at a considerable distance (and it advanced very slowly, being moved only by two ranks of rowers), Archimedes discharged from one of his engines a vast stone, weighing, according to Plutarch's account, 1250 pounds, then a second, and immediately after a third; all which, falling upon the sambuca with a dreadful noise, broke its supports, and gave the galleys upon which it stood such a violent shock that they parted, and the machine which Marcellus had raised upon them at a vast trouble and expense was battered to pieces. At the same time, several other machines, which were not visible without the walls, and consequently did not lessen the confidence of the Romans in the assault, played incessantly upon their ships, and overwhelmed them with showers of stones, rafters, and beams pointed with iron; insomuch that Marcellus, being at a loss what to do, retired with all possible haste, and sent orders to his land-forces to do the same; for the attack on the land-side was attended with no better success, the ranks being broken and thrown into the utmost confusion by the stones and darts, which flew with such noise, force, and rapidity, that they struck the Romans with terror, and dashed all to pieces before them.\n\nMarcellus, surprised, though not discouraged, at this artificial storm, which he did not expect, held a council of war, in which it was resolved, the next day before sunrise, to come up close under the wall, and keep Syracuse there. They were in hopes by this means to secure themselves against the terrible shower of stones and darts which fell on the ships when at a distance. But Archimedes had prepared engines which were adapted to all distances. When the Romans therefore had brought their ships close under the wall, and thought themselves well covered, they were unexpectedly overwhelmed with a new shower of darts and stones, which fell perpendicularly on their heads, and obliged them to retire with great precipitation. But they were no sooner got at some distance, than a new shower of darts overtook them, which made a dreadful havoc of the men, while stones of an immense weight, discharged from other machines, either disabled or broke in pieces most of their galleys. This loss they sustained, without being able to revenge it in the least on the enemy. For Archimedes had placed most of his engines behind the walls, and not only out of the reach, but even out of the sight, of the enemy; so that the Romans were repulsed with a dreadful slaughter, without seeing the hand that occasioned it. What most harassed the Romans in the attack by sea, was a sort of crow with iron claws, fastened to a long chain, which was let down by a kind of lever. The weight of the iron made it fall with great violence, and drove it into the planks of the galleys. Then the besieged, by a great weight of lead at the other end of the lever, weighed it down, and consequently raised up the iron of the crow in proportion, and with it the prow of the galley to which it was fastened, sinking the poop at the same time into the water. After this the crow letting go its hold all of a sudden, the prow of the galley fell with such force into the sea, that the whole vessel was filled with water, and sunk. At other times, the machines, dragging ships to the shore by hooks, dashed them to pieces against the points of the rocks which projected under the walls. Other vessels were quite lifted up into the air, there whirled about with incredible rapidity, and then let fall into the sea, and sunk, with all that were in them. How these stupendous works were effected, few, if any, have hitherto been able to comprehend.\n\nThe troops under the command of Appius suffered no less in this second attack than the fleet. In the whole space of ground which the army, when formed, took up, the last files as well as the first were overwhelmed with showers of darts and flints, against which they could not possibly defend themselves. When they had with infinite trouble brought the mantlets and covered galleries, under which they were to work the rams, near the foot of the wall, Archimedes discharged such large beams and stones upon them as crushed them to pieces. If any brave Roman ventured to draw too near the wall, iron hooks were immediately let down from above, which, taking hold of his clothes or some part of his body, lifted him up in the air and dashed out his brains with the fall. Marcellus, though at a loss what to do, could not however forbear expressing himself with pleasantry: Shall we persist, said he to his workmen, in making war upon this Briareus, upon this giant with a hundred hands? But the soldiers were so terrified, that if they saw upon the walls only a small cord, or the least piece of wood, they immediately turned their backs and fled, crying out, that Archimedes was going to discharge some dreadful machine upon them.\nThe consuls, finding themselves thus defeated in every attempt, turned the siege into a blockade, reduced most of the other places in the island, and defeated the forces which were sent against them; and at last Marcellus made himself master of Syracuse itself. He took the opportunity of a festival, when the soldiers and citizens had drunk plentifully, to make a detachment scale the walls of Tyche, in that part of it which was nearest to Epipolis, and which was ill guarded. He presently after possessed himself of Epipolis; whereupon the inhabitants of Neapolis, as well as Tyche, sent deputies to him, and submitted. Marcellus granted life and liberty to all of free condition, but gave up those quarters of the city to be plundered. The soldiers had orders to spare the lives of the citizens; but they were cruel in their avarice, slew many of them, and among the rest the incomparable Archimedes. He was very intent on a demonstration in geometry, and calmly drawing his lines, when a soldier entered the room, and clapped a sword to his throat. \"Hold! (said Archimedes) one moment, and my demonstration will be finished.\" But the soldier, equally regardless of his prayer and his demonstration, killed him instantly. There are different accounts of the manner of his death; but all agree that Marcellus regretted it extremely, and showed a singular favour to his relations for his sake.\n\nThe city of Syracuse continued subject to the western empire till its declension, when the island of Sicily, being ravaged by different barbarians, the capital also underwent various revolutions; till at last, in the 9th century, it was so destroyed by the Saracens, that very few traces of its ancient grandeur are now to be seen. \"The ancient city of Syracuse was of a triangular form, and consisted of five parts or towns. The circuit, according to Strabo, amounted to 180 stadia, or 22 English miles, and four furlongs. An account which Mr Swinburne once suspected of exaggeration; but, after spending two days in tracing the ruins, and making reasonable allowances for the encroachments of the sea, he was convinced of the exactness of Strabo's measurement.\n\nAt present it is strongly fortified towards the land, and the ditches of the battions form the communications between the two havens. It is very weak towards the sea, but the shelves render it hazardous to debar on that side. The garrison is one of the best appointed in the kingdom, but the heights of Acradina command the works.\n\nAbout eighteen thousand inhabitants are now contained in it. The dwellings are far from being memorials of ancient Syracusan architecture or opulence. In any other situation they might be thought tolerable; but to observers who reflect on the style of those buildings that probably once covered the same ground, the present edifices must have a mean appearance. The ancient temple of Minerva is now turned into a cathedral. The walls of the cella are thrown down, and only as much left in pillars as is necessary to support the roof; the intercommunications of the peristyle are walled up. This temple is built in the old Doric proportions used in the rest of Sicily; its exterior dimensions are 183 feet in length and 75 in breadth. There are also some remains of Diana's temple, but now scarcely discernible. Besides these, there are few ruins in the island; and one is surprized that any should exist in a place which had been so often laid waste by enemies, and so often shaken by earthquakes. E. Long. 25. 27. N. Lat. 37. 3.\n\nSYRIA, a very ancient kingdom of Asia, lying between the Mediterranean on the west, the Euphrates on the east, and Arabia Deserta, Phoenicia and Palestine, on the south.\n\nIn ancient times this country was called Aram, pro-Names, doubtless from Aram the youngest son of Shem. At first visions, &c., it was parcelled out into several petty states; all of ancient which seem afterwards to have been reduced under subjection to the four principal ones, Zobah, Damascus, Hamath, and Geshur. Afterwards the whole country was divided into two parts only, viz. Cœle-Syria and Phœnicia; though the Phœnicians, Idumæans, Jews, Gazites, and Azotites, or the whole country of the Philistines, was included. After the death of Alexander, Syria, in the great extent of the word, was divided, according to Strabo, into Comagene, Seleucis of Syria, Cœle-Syria, Phœnicia on the sea coast, and Judea in the midland. Ptolemy, however, subdivides these; and in the Proper Syria reckons only Comagene, Pieria, Cyrrhœtica or Cyrrhœtica, Seleucis, Caffriotis or Caffiotis, Chalybonitis, Chalcidice or Chalcidene, Apamene, Laodicene, Phœnicia Mediterranea, Cœle-Syria and Palmyrene.\n\nThe history of the ancient Syrians, till the time of their being carried away by the kings of Assyria, is totally unknown, excepting a few particulars which may be gathered from Scripture, and which it is needless here to repeat. During the continuance of the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian monarchies, the history of this country affords nothing remarkable; but after the death of Alexander, it gave name to a very considerable empire, which makes a conspicuous figure in ancient history. At this time, however, it was not confined to Syria properly so called, but comprehended all those vast provinces of the Upper Asia which formed the Persian empire; being, in its full extent, bounded by the Mediterranean upon one side, and the river Indus on the other. The first king was Seleucus, one of the generals of Alexander the Great; who, after the death of that conqueror, being made governor of Babylon, was tempted, by the example of Alexander's other captains, to set up for himself. Eumenes, who had him the Great, merely at heart the interest of Alexander's family, solicited his assistance against Antigonus, who had openly revolted; but Seleucus not only refused this assistance, but attempted to destroy Eumenes himself with his whole army. Eumenes, however, found means to escape the danger without the loss of a man. On this Seleucus endeavoured to gain over his troops; but finding that impossible, he made a truce with Eumenes, and granted him a safe passage through his province; but at the same time sent an express to Antigonus, desiring him to fall upon him, before he was joined by the governors of Upper Asia. Antigonus did not fail to follow his advice; but having prevailed against Eumenes through treachery, he next thought of bringing Seleucus himself under subjection. On his return to Babylon, therefore, after having been feasted with his whole army by Seleucus, he demanded of him an account of the revenues of his province. Receiving an unfavourable answer to this requisition, Antigonus was so much exasperated, that Seleucus, not thinking himself a match for him at that time, thought proper to fly into Egypt.\nBy the flight of Seleucus, Antigonus was left master of all his provinces; but his son Demetrius being afterwards defeated by Ptolemy at Gaza, Seleucus began to think of recovering what he had lost. Having received from Ptolemy a very slender force, he set out towards Babylon, and procured reinforcements as he proceeded. As he approached the city, those who favoured Antigonus retired into the citadel, but were soon obliged to surrender; and in that fortress Seleucus found his children, friends, and domestics, whom Antigonus had kept prisoners ever since his flight into Egypt.\n\nSeleucus having made himself master of Babylon, in the year 312 B.C., began to prepare for encountering Antigonus, who he knew would soon attack him with all his force. Nicanor, governor of Media under Antigonus, first advanced against him at the head of 10,000 foot and 7000 horse; but Seleucus, with only 3000 foot and 400 horse, having drawn him into an ambush, cut off almost the whole of his army, and such of the soldiers as had escaped the slaughter willingly enlisted under his banner.\n\nThe consequence of this victory was the submission of all Media and Sufiana; but during his absence from the capital, Demetrius advanced towards it, and made himself master of it.\n\nOn the return of Seleucus to Babylon, he easily drove out the troops left by Demetrius, recovered the castle which he had garrisoned, and settled his authority on such a firm foundation, that it could never afterwards be moved. Having then marched again into Media, he defeated and killed with his own hand Nicanor or Nicator, whom Antigonus had sent against him; after which, having settled the affairs of Media, he reduced all Persia, Bactria, and Hyrcania, subjecting to his new empire these and all the other provinces on this side the Indus which had been conquered.\n\nSeleucus being now master of all the countries which lie between the Euphrates and the Indus, took the title of king of Babylon and Media. But, not satisfied with these possessions, ample as they were, he crossed the Indus, in order to conquer those regions which had submitted to Alexander beyond that river. In this expedition, however, he was unsuccessful; but returning westward against his old enemy Antigonus, he defeated and killed him at Ipsus, and reduced his son Demetrius to a very dependent state. Seleucus now betook himself to the building of a city, which he called Seleucia, and which stood on the place where the city of Bagdad now stands. Besides these, he built a great many others; of which he called Antioch, from the name of his brother Antiochus; nine Seleucia, from his own name; three Apamea, from Apama his first wife; one Stratonicea, from his second wife Stratonice; and six Laodicea, from his mother Laodice.\n\nIn 284 Seleucus entered into a war with Lydimachus, with whom he had hitherto lived in strict amity. Out of 36 general officers left by Alexander the Great, two survived, and both were upwards of 70 years old. Nevertheless they were both filled with the ambition and animosity of young men. The two armies met at a place called Curospion in Phrygia, where an obstinate engagement took place. Victory was long doubtful; but at last Lydimachus was run through with a spear, and died on the spot; on which his troops betook themselves to flight. This victory added to the possessions of Seleucus all those provinces which had formerly been subject to Lydimachus, and from this victory he is generally called Nicator, or the conqueror. His triumph, however, on this occasion, was but short-lived; for, treacherously murdered by Ptolemy Ceraunus, on whom he had conferred innumerable favours.\n\nSeleucus was succeeded by his son Antiochus Soter, who held the empire 19 years. He resigned to Antigonus Gonatas all pretensions to the crown of Macedon; and having engaged in a war with Eumenes king of Pergamus, he was defeated by him, and obliged to yield up part of his dominions. He died in 261 B.C., and Antiochus was succeeded by his son Antiochus Theos; who having engaged in a war with Ptolemy Philadelphus king of Egypt, the Parthians and Bactrians took that opportunity to revolt, and could never afterwards be reduced. In 246 B.C., he was poisoned by his wife Laodice, who raised to the throne her own son, named Seleucus Callinicus. He was succeeded by his eldest son Seleucus Ceraunus, a weak prince, who was poisoned by a conspiracy of two of his officers, when he had reigned one year; after which his brother Antiochus, fuming the Great, ascended the throne in 225 B.C.\n\nIn the very beginning of his reign, two of his generals, Antiochus Alexander and Molo, rebelled against him. The former had been appointed governor of Persia, and the latter of Media. Antiochus marched against the rebels, whom he defeated in a pitched battle; on which their chiefs laid violent hands on themselves. On his return he received the submission of the Atropatini, a barbarous people in Media; and put to death his prime minister Hermias, whom he had found hatching treacherous designs against him. During his lifetime, however, the traitor, by accusing Achaeus of treason, had obliged him to revolt in his own defence; so that the king had still two important wars on his hands, viz. one with Ptolemy king of Egypt, and the other against Achaeus. After some deliberation, he resolved to march first against the king of Egypt; and was at first very successful, reducing many cities in Coele Syria and Palestine, and defeating the Egyptians in a pitched battle; but in the year 217 B.C., being worsted in the battle of Raphia, he was obliged to abandon all his conquests; of which Ptolemy immediately took possession, and Antiochus was obliged to cede them to him, that he might be at leisure to pursue the war against Achaeus.\n\nAntiochus having made vast preparations for his expedition, soon reduced Achaeus to such distress, that he was obliged to shut himself up in the city of Sardis, which he defended for some time with great bravery; till at last, being betrayed by two Cretans, he was delivered up to the king, and by his order put to death. Antiochus then undertook an expedition against the Parthians, whom he obliged to conclude a peace on very advantageous terms. He then turned his arms against the king of Bactria, whom he also compelled to agree to his terms. He then crossed Mount Caucasus, and entered India; where he renewed his alliance with the king of that country. From India he marched into Arachosia, Drangiana, and Carmania, establishing order and discipline in all those countries; then passing through Persia, Babylonia, and Mesopotamia, he returned to Antioch, after an absence of seven years.\nIn the year 204 B.C. Antiochus entered into a league with Philip of Macedon, on purpose to deprive Ptolemy Epiphanes, the infant king of Egypt, of all his dominions. He defeated the Egyptian general, covered all Palestine and Coele-Syria; after which he invaded Asia Minor, in hopes of redacing it also, and restoring the Syrian empire to the same extent it had in the time of Seleucus Nicator. The free cities in Asia Minor immediately had recourse to the Romans, who sent an embassy to Antiochus on the occasion; but as both parties put on those haughty and imperious airs to which they thought the greatness of their power gave them a right, no satisfaction was given, but everything tended to an open rupture. While matters were in this situation, Hannibal the Great being obliged to leave his own country, fled to Antiochus: from whom he met with a gracious reception. As Hannibal had, while a child, sworn perpetual enmity against the Romans, he used all his eloquence to persuade Antiochus to make war with them; and as the many victories which he had gained over them left no room to doubt of his capacity, Antiochus doubted nothing of being able, by his assistance, to conquer that haughty people. Several embassies passed between the two nations; but chiefly with a design, on the part of Antiochus, to gain time. Hannibal endeavoured to draw his countrymen into the confederacy against Rome, but without effect. Antiochus having strengthened himself by several alliances, at last resolved to begin the war in earnest. The king imprudently became the aggressor, by falling on a body of 500 Romans before war had been declared. He also made King Philip his enemy, by entertaining the regent of Athamania, who was a pretender to the crown of Macedon. To complete all, he himself fell in love, though above 50 years of age, with a beautiful young woman of Chalcis, whom he married; and became so great a slave to this passion, that he entirely neglected his affairs; the army gave themselves up entirely to dissipation and debauchery, and every trace of military discipline vanished.\n\nIn the year 191 B.C. Antiochus was raised from his lethargy by a declaration of war against him at Rome, and set out for Aetolia. His army at this time amounted to no more than 10,000 foot and 500 horse. He had been made to believe that he would receive a vast reinforcement in Aetolia; but when he came to make the experiment, he soon found his mistake; all the troops he could raise there amounted to no more than 4000 men. With this force, so exceedingly inadequate to the purpose, he was obliged to oppose the Roman army, who were advancing in conjunction with the Macedonians, and had already made surprising progress. Antiochus seized the straits of Thermopylae; but was driven from them by the Romans, the king himself being the first that fled. Almost his whole army was destroyed in the battle or in the pursuit, and Antiochus returned with disgrace into Asia.\n\nSoon after his return, Antiochus equipped a fleet of 200 sail; on which he immediately embarked for the Thracian Chersonesus, now Crimean Tartary. He fortified the cities of Lydiania, Sestos, and Abydos, with others in that neighbourhood, to prevent the Romans from crossing the Hellespont. In the mean time Polyxenidas the Syrian admiral sent intelligence to the king that the Roman fleet had appeared off Delos; upon which he desired him to seek them out and engage them at all events. He did so, and was defeated with the loss of 40 ships taken or sunk in the engagement. This fleet was soon after revenged by the destruction of the Rhodian fleet by the artifice of Polyxenidas; but in the end that of the king's affairs went everywhere to wreck. Having laid siege to the city of Pergamus, he was obliged to raise it with loss; the Phoenician fleet commanded by Hannibal was defeated by the Rhodians; and soon after the Syrian fleet under Polyxenidas was utterly defeated by the Romans. Antiochus was so much disheartened by these repeated defeats, that he appeared like one in a state of confusion. Instead of fortifying more strongly those cities which lay on the frontiers of his kingdom, he altogether deserted them; and thus Lydiania and Abydos, the two keys to Asia, fell into the hands of the Romans without the least resistance.\n\nThe arrival of the Romans in Asia struck Antiochus with such terror, that he instantly sued for peace. The terms he offered were indeed very advantageous, but by no means agreeable to the expectations of the Romans. They therefore gave him this final answer: \"Sues for 1. That since he had drawn upon himself the war, he should pay the whole expense of it; 2. That he should restore liberty in general to all the Greek cities in Asia; and, 3. That to prevent future hostilities, he should relinquish all Asia on this side Mount Taurus.\" These terms, however, still appeared to him intolerable, that he resolved to continue the war; and determined also to take the most imprudent method of carrying it on, namely, by hazarding all on the event of a general engagement. The king encamped near Magnesia, and strongly fortified his camp. The Romans insulted him in his trenches, and proposed to attack his fortifications if he continued to decline an engagement. At last the king, thinking it would be shameful for him longer to refuse an engagement, being at the head of an army far more numerous than that of the enemy, in a friend's country, and in the midst of his allies, resolved at all events to accept the challenge, and accordingly prepared for a decisive battle.\n\nOn the day of the battle the weather proved very favourable to the Romans; for a thick fog rising in the Magnesian morning, the day was almost turned into night, so that the Syrian commanders could not have all the corps under their command in view, on account of their great extent, nor send them proper orders in time; whereas the fog was not thick enough to prevent the Roman generals from seeing their several bodies at the greatest distance, as they took up but little ground. Besides, the damp which was occasioned by the fog slackened the strings of the enemy's bows, so that the Asiatics who used them could shoot their darts and arrows but faintly. The whole dependence of Antiochus in the first attack was on his armed chariots, which were to cut their way into the Roman army. But Eumenes, king of Pergamus, undertook to render them useless, and even fatal, to the enemy. After this advantage, the Roman cavalry advanced, and fell on those whom the chariots had put in disorder. The Syrians being already intimidated, after a faint resistance gave way; and the Romans made a great slaughter of their men and horses, both being borne down with the weight of their heavy armour. Eumenes charged the left-wing, in which Seleucus commanded, with such vigour, that he put it to flight;\nand the fugitives flying to the phalanx for protection, put that body likewise in disorder: which Domitius observing, advanced against it at the head of his legionaries, but could not break it till he ordered his men to attack the elephants, which the Syrians had placed in the spaces between the companies. The Romans had learned, in their wars with Pyrrhus and Hannibal, not to fear those monsters which were once so terrible to them. They attacked them, therefore, with great resolution; and driving them against the phalanx, put that body into disorder, by means of those very animals which had been posted there for its defense.\n\nAfter a long and bloody contest, the Syrians were totally routed, and the Romans walking over heaps of dead bodies, marched up to the Syrian camp, attacked, and plundered it. The riches they found in it are not to be described; but the taking of it cost the Romans a new battle, which proved more fatal to the Syrians than that in the field; for the Romans having, in spite of a most desperate resistance, forced the intrenchments, gave no quarter, but put all to the sword without distinction. There fell this day in the battle, in the pursuit, and in the plunder of the camp, 50,000 foot and 4000 horse; 2500 were taken prisoners, and 15 elephants. In the consular army there were but 300 foot killed and 25 horse. Eumenes had only 15 of his men killed; so that this victory, as we are told by the ancients, seemed a prodigy to all nations both of the east and west.\n\nAntiochus retired to Sardis with as many of his forces that had escaped the slaughter as he could draw together. From Sardis he soon marched to rejoin his son Seleucus, who had fled to Apamea. As for the consul, he took advantage of the king's defeat and flight, making himself master of all the neighboring countries. Deputies hastened to him from all parts; the cities of Thyatira, Magnesia, Tralles, Magnesia in Caria, all Lydia, and Ephesus itself, though highly favored by Antiochus, declared for the Romans. Polyxenidas, upon the news of the king's defeat, left the port of Ephesus, and sailed to Patara, where he landed with a very small guard, and returned by land into Syria. The consul took the road to Sardis, which opened its gates to him.\n\nAntiochus finding his affairs in a bad situation both by sea and land, and not daring to appear before the consular army in the field, sent Antipater his brother's son, and Zeuxis, who had been governor of Lydia and Phrygia, to sue for a peace. They were ordered to treat chiefly with the elder Scipio, of whose clemency and good nature Antiochus entertained a high opinion. Accordingly, on their arrival at Sardis, where the consul then was with his brother, they addressed the latter, and were by him presented to the consul. Their speech was very submissive, and such as became a vanquished people.\n\nHereupon a council was summoned, and after long debates the ambassadors were called in; and Scipio Africanus proposed terms that were very humiliating.\n\nThe ambassadors of Antiochus had been ordered to refuse no terms; and therefore these were accepted, and the whole affair concluded. So that the Syrian ambassadors now prepared to set out for Rome, to get the conditions of peace proposed by Scipio ratified there. L. Aurelius Cotta was sent with the ambassadors to Rome, to acquaint the senate with the particulars of the treaty. When they appeared before the conscript fathers, they spoke with great submission, and only desired them to ratify the articles which the Scipios had offered to their master. The senate, after examining them, ordered that a treaty of peace should be concluded with Antiochus, and the articles of it engraved on brass, and fixed up in the Capitol. They only added one clause, which was, That the Syrians should change every year all their hostages, except the son of King Antiochus, who should continue at Rome as long as the republic thought fit. The peace being thus ratified, and all Asia on this side Mount Taurus delivered into the hands of the Romans, the Greek cities were by them restored to their liberty, the provinces of Caria and Lydia given to the Rhodians, and all the rest that had belonged to Antiochus bestowed upon Eumenes.\n\nAntiochus did not long survive his misfortune at his death. He died in 187, and with him fell the glory of the Syrian empire. The Romans now gave laws to the B.C. kings of Syria, in formuch, that when Antiochus Epiphanes the grandchild of Antiochus the Great hesitated at obeying the commands of the senate, one of the ambassadors drew a circle round him with a rod on the floor, and told him that he should not go out of that spot before he had told him what he was to do. The most remarkable transactions of this prince are his wars with the Jews, and persecutions of them; of which a Roman full account is given under the article Jews. After a province variety of usurpers and tyrants, the kingdom of Syria fell under Tigranes king of Armenia in the year 83 B.C.; and upon his overthrow by the Romans, it became a province of the dominions of the republic. From them it was taken by the Saracens in the reign of the caliph Omar, and is now a province of Turkey in Asia. See Acre.\n\nSyria is in some measure only a chain of mountains, Climate varying in their levels, situation, and appearances. The soil, &c. of part of the country, however, next the sea is in general the country low, and besides this there are several extensive valleys. The climate on the sea-coast and in these valleys is very hot, but in the higher parts of the country it bears a good deal of resemblance to that of France. Syria is exceedingly fertile, and the variety of its productions is very great. Besides wheat, rye, barley, beans, and the cotton plant, which is cultivated everywhere, Palestine abounds in sesame, from which oil is procured, and doura as good as that of Egypt. Maize thrives in the light soil of Balbec, and even rice is cultivated with success on the borders of the marshy country of Havula. They have lately begun to plant sugarcane in the gardens of Saide and of Beirut, and they find them equal to those of the Delta. Indigo grows without cultivating on the banks of the Jordan, in the country of Bisan, and only requires care to make it of an excellent quality. The hill-sides of Latakia produce tobacco, Gaza Valley produces dates like Mecca, and pomegranates like Al-Traveli, giers; Tripoli affords oranges equal to those of Malta; vol. i. Beirut figs like those of Marfilles, and bananas not inferior to those of St Domingo; Aleppo enjoys the exclusive advantage of producing pistachios; and Damascus justly boasts of possessing all the fruits known in France. Its stone foil fruits equally the apples of Normandy, the plums of Touraine, and the peaches of Paris.\nParis. Twenty sorts of apricots are reckoned there, the stone of one of which contains a kernel highly valued through all Turkey. The cochineal plant, which grows on all that coast, contains perhaps that precious insect in as high perfection as it is found in Mexico and St Domingo.\n\nThe inhabitants may be divided into three principal classes: the descendants of the Greeks of the Lower Empire; the Arabs, their conquerors; and the Turks, the present ruling power: and these again, the first into three, the second into four, classes; besides three wandering tribes of Turkomans, Kurds, and Bedouin Arabs. The ancient inhabitants before the Greeks under Alexander are entirely lost. The inhabitants are in general of a middling stature, and the eyes of the women almost everywhere beautiful, and their shape correct and well proportioned.

See ASTRONOMY.\n\nT.\n\nT, or t, the 19th letter and 16th consonant of our alphabet; the sound whereof is formed by a strong expulsion of the breath through the mouth, upon a sudden drawing back of the tongue from the fore-part of the palate, with the lips at the same time open. The proper sound of t is expressed in most words beginning or ending with that letter; as in take, tell, hot, put. Ti before a vowel has the sound of f, or rather of /b/, as in creation, except when f precedes, as in question; and in derivatives from words ending in ty, as mighty, migh-tier. Th has two sounds; the one soft, as thou, father; the other hard, as thing, think. The sound is soft in these words, then, thence, and there, with their derivatives and compounds; and in the words that, thir, thus, thy, they, though; and in all words in which th comes between two vowels, as, whether, rather; and between r and a vowel, as burthen.\n\nIn abbreviations, amongst the Roman writers, T. stands for Titus, Titius, &c.; Tab. for Tabularius; Tab.

See ENTOMOLOGY Index.\n\nTABARCA, a small island lying opposite to a town of the same name, which divides the maritime coasts of Tunis and Algiers, in Africa. It is two miles from the land, and is in possession of the noble family of the Lamellini of Genoa, who have here a governor and a garrison of 200 men to protect the coral fishery. N. Lat. 36° 50'. E. Long. 9° 16'.\n\nTABASHER, a Persian word, signifying a hard substance found in the cavities of the bamboo or Indian reed, and highly valued as a medicine in the East Indies.\nThough some account was given of the tabaheer by the Arabian physicians, no accurate knowledge of it was obtained till Dr Russel favoured the public with his observations on it.\n\nThe tabaheer is produced from the female bamboo, which is distinguished from the male by a larger cavity. The bamboos containing it, make a rattling noise when shaken. Dr Russel having examined a bamboo brought from Vellore, consisting of six joints, found no tabaheer in two of them: all the rest contained some, but of various quality and quantity; the whole amounting to about 27 grains. The best was of a bluish white resembling small fragments of shells, harder also than the rest, but which might be easily crumbled between the fingers into a gritty powder; and when applied to the tongue and palate, had a slight saline and tasteless taste; the weight not exceeding four grains. The colour of the rest was cineritious, rough on the surface, and more friable; having some particles of a larger size intermixed, but light, spongy, and somewhat resembling pumice stones; which appearance, our author supposes, led the Arabians to think that fire was concerned in the production. The two middle joints were of a pure white colour within, and lined with a thin film. In these the tabaheer was principally found. The other joints, particularly the two upper ones, were discoloured within; and in some parts of the cavity was found a blackish substance in grains or in powder, adhering to the sides, the film being there obliterated. In two or three of the joints a small round hole was found at top and bottom, which seemed to have been perforated by some insect.\n\nGarzius informs us, that it is not found in all bamboos, or in all the branches indiscriminately, but only in those growing about Bifnagur, Batcata, and one part of the Malabar coast. Dr Russel was informed by a letter from a medical gentleman attending the embassy to the Nizam, that though tabaheer bears a high price at Hydrabad, it is never brought thither from Bifnagur; and that some of what is sold in the markets comes from the palls of Atcoun in Canoul; and some from Emma-bad, at the distance of about 80 miles to the north-west; but that the most part comes from Mafulipatam. That sold in the markets is of two kinds; one the rate of a rupee per dram, but the other only half that price; the latter, however, is supposed to be fictitious, and made up mostly of burnt teeth and bones. Dr Russel himself also, is persuaded that the tabaheer met with in commerce is greatly adulterated. The above-mentioned gentleman likewise informed the doctor that tabaheer was produced in great quantities at Sylihat, where it is sold by the pound, from one rupee to one and an half; forming a considerable article of trade from Bengal to Persia and Arabia. There is, however, a third kind, much superior in quality, being whiter, purer, and also harder and heavier.\n\nDr Russel supposes that the tabaheer is the juice of the bamboo thickened and hardened. The following observations on its medical effects were taken from a Persian work, intitled the \"Tofut ul Monein of Mahommend Monein Hofeiny,\" by Mr Williams, a surgeon in the service of the East India company. The tabaheer puts a stop to bilious vomitings and to the bloody flux. It is also of service in cases of palpitation of the heart, in faintings, and for strengthening those members of the body that are weakened by heat. It is useful also for the piles, and for acute or burning fevers, and for pustules in the mouth (thrush); and, given with oxymel, is of service against rattlefines, melancholy, and hypochondriacal affections. The habitual internal use of it is prejudicial to the virile powers. It is also said to be prejudicial to the lungs. Its corrective are the gum of the pine and honey. The dose of it is to the weight of two drachms, or seven mahs.\n\nTABBY, in Commerce, a kind of rich silk which has undergone the operation of tabbying.\n\nTABBYING, the puffing a silk or fluff under a calender, the rolls of which are made of iron or copper variously engraven, which bearing unequally on the stuff renders the surface thereof unequal, so as to reflect the rays of light differently, making the representation of waves thereon.\n\nTABELLIO, in the Roman law, an officer or scrivener, much the same with our notaries public, who are often called tabelliones.\n\nTABERNACLE, among the Hebrews, a kind of building, in the form of a tent, set up, by express command of God, for the performance of religious worship, sacrifices, &c. during the journeying of the Israelites in the wilderness: and, after their settlement in the land of Canaan, made use of for the same purpose till the building of the temple of Jerusalem. It was divided into two parts; the one covered, and properly called the tabernacle; and the other open, called the court. The curtains which covered the tabernacle were made of linen, of several colours, embroidered. There were ten curtains, 28 cubits long and four in breadth. Five curtains fastened together made up two coverings, which covered up all the tabernacle. Over these there were two other coverings; the one of goat's hair, the other of sheep's skins. The holy of holies was parted from the rest of the tabernacle by a curtain made fast to four pillars, standing ten cubits from the end. The length of the whole tabernacle was 32 cubits, that is, about 50 feet; and the breadth 12 cubits or 19 feet. The court was a spot of ground 100 cubits long; and 50 in breadth, enclosed by 20 columns, each 20 cubits high and 10 in breadth, covered with silver, and standing on copper bases, five cubits distant from one another; between which there were curtains drawn, and fastened with hooks. At the east end was an entrance, 20 cubits wide, covered with a curtain hanging loose.\n\nFeast of Tabernacles, a solemn festival of the Hebrews, observed after harvest, on the 15th day of the month Tisri, instituted to commemorate the goodness of God, who protected the Israelites in the wilderness, and made them dwell in booths, when they came out of Egypt. On the first day of the feast, they began to erect booths of the boughs of trees, and in these they were obliged to continue seven days. The booths were placed in the open air, and were not to be covered with cloths, nor made too close to the thickness of the boughs; but so loose that the sun and the stars might be seen, and the rain descend through them. For further particulars of the celebration of this festival, see Levit. ch. xxiii.\n\nTABERNÆ, in Ancient Geography. See TRES Taberna.\n\nTABERNÆMONTANA, in Botany, a genus of plants belonging to the class of pentandria, and order of monogynia; and in the natural system arranged under the\nthe 30th order, Contortae.

The bay which is formed thereby is called the Table-bay.\n\nLaws of the Twelve Tables, were the first set of laws of the Romans; thus called either because the Romans then wrote with a style on thin wooden tablets covered with wax; or rather, because they were engraved on tables or plates of copper, to be exposed in the most noted part of the public forum. After the expulsion of the kings, as the Romans were then without any fixed or certain system of law, at least had none ample enough to take in the various cases that might fall between particular persons, it was resolved to adopt the best and wisest laws of the Greeks. One Hermadorus was first appointed to translate them, and the decemviri afterwards compiled and reduced them into ten tables. After a world of care and application, they were at length enacted and confirmed by the senate and an assembly of the people, in the year of Rome 393. The following year they found something wanting therein, which they supplied from the laws of the former kings of Rome, and from certain customs which long use had authorized; all these being engraven on two other tables, made the law of the twelve tables, so famous in the Roman jurisprudence, the source and foundation of the civil or Roman law.\n\nTABLES of the Law, in Jewish antiquity, two tables on which were written the decalogue, or ten commandments, given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai.\n\nTABOO, a word used by the South Sea islanders, nearly of the same import as prohibited or interdicted. It applies equally to persons and things, and is also expressive of anything sacred, devoted, or eminent.\n\nTabor, a mountain of Galilee, about 12 miles from the city of Tiberias. It rises in the form of a sugar loaf, in the midst of an extensive plain, to the height of 30 stadia, according to Josephus. The ascent is so easy, that one may ascend on horseback. On the top there is a plain two miles in circumference.\n\nThe situation of Mount Tabor is most delightful. Rising amidst the plains of Galilee, it exhibits to the enchanted eye a charming variety of prospects. On one side there are lakes, rivers, and a part of the Mediterranean; and on the other a chain of little hills, with small valleys, shaded by natural groves, and enriched by the hands of the husbandman with a great number of useful productions. Here you behold an immensity of plains interspersed with hamlets, fortresses, and heaps of ruins; and there the eye delights to wander over the fields of Jezreel or Maggeddon, named by the Arabs Ebn-Aamer, which signifies \"the field of the sons of Aamer.\" A little farther you distinguish the mountains of Hermon, Gilboa, Samaria, and Arabia Stony. In short, you experience all those sensations which are produced by a mixture and rapid succession of rural, gay, gloomy, and majestic objects.\n\nIt was upon this enchanting mount that the apostle Peter said to Christ, \"It is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.\"\n\nFlavian Josephus, governor of Galilee, caused the summit of this mountain, for the space of two miles and a half, to be surrounded with walls. The inhabitants of Tabor long braved the power of the Roman armies; but being deprived of water in consequence of the great heats, they were forced to surrender at discretion to Placidus, the general of Vespasian.\n\nSeveral churches were built upon this mountain by St Helen, who founded here also some monasteries. Of the two most remarkable, one was dedicated to Moses, and inhabited by Cenobites of the order of St Benedict, who followed the Latin rites: the other was dedicated to the prophet Elias by monks of the order of St Basil, attached to the Greek rites. The kings of Hungary erected here also a pretty spacious convent for some monks belonging to that nation, of the order of St Paul, the first hermit. Tabor was also the seat of a bishop, dependent on the patriarchate of Jerusalem.\n\nWhen Godfrey of Bouillon seized on this mountain, he repaired the ancient churches, which were beginning to fall into ruins. Under Baldwin I., in 1113, the Saracen troops retook Tabor; and their sanguinary fury gained as many victories as there were priests and Cenobites. This mountain again fell into the hands of the Christians; but the Catholic standard was not long displayed on it. Saladin pulled it down the year following, and destroyed all the churches. The Christians retook it once more in 1253; and their zeal made them rebuild all the sacred places. At this time Rome being accustomed to give away empires, Pope Alexander IV. granted Tabor to the Templars, who fortified it again. At length, in the course of the year 1290, the sultan of Egypt destroyed and laid waste the buildings of this mountain, which could never be repaired afterwards; so that at present it is uninhabited.\n\nTACAMAHACA, in Pharmacy, a gum resin, obtained from the Fagara octandra and populus balsamifera; and having a fragrant smell, a bitterish nauseous taste, and supposed to be stimulant and tonic in its effects.\n\nTACCA, a genus of plants belonging to the clade dodecandra.

See STENOGRAPHY.\n\nTACITUS, Caius Cornelius, a celebrated Roman historian, and one of the greatest men of his time, appears to have been born about the year of Rome 809 or 810, and applied himself early to the labours of the bar, in which he gained very considerable reputation. Having married the daughter of Agricola, the road to Translation public honours was laid open to him in the reign of Vespasian; but during the sanguinary and capricious tyranny of Domitian, he, as well as his friend Pliny, appears to have retired from the theatre of public affairs. The reign of Nerva restored these luminaries of Roman literature to the metropolis, and we find Tacitus engaged, in A.U.C. 856, to pronounce the funeral oration.\noration of the venerable Virginius Rufus, the colleague of the emperor in the consulship, and afterwards succeeding him as consul for the remainder of the year.\n\nThe time of his death is not mentioned by any ancient author, but it is probable that he died in the reign of Trajan.\n\nHis works which still remain are, 1. Five books of his History. 2. His Annals. 3. A Treatise on the different Nations which in his time inhabited Germany; and, 4. The Life of Agricola his father-in-law. There is also attributed to him a Treatise on Eloquence, which others have ascribed to Quintilian. The Treatise on the Manners of the Germans was published in 851.—In the year 853, Pliny and Tacitus were appointed by the Senate to plead the cause of the oppressed Africans against Marius Priscus, a corrupt proconsul, who was convicted before the fathers; and the patriot orators were honoured with a declaration that they had executed their trust to the entire satisfaction of the house. The exact time when Tacitus published his history is uncertain, but it was in some period of Trajan's reign, who died suddenly, A. U. C. 870, A.D. 117.—The history comprises a period of 27 years, from the accession of Galba, 822, to the death of Domitian, 849. The history being finished, he did not think he had completed the tablature of slavery; he went back to the time of Tiberius; and the second work, which, however, comes first in the order of chronology, includes a period of 34 years, from the accession of Tiberius, 767, to the death of Nero, 821: this work is his \"Annals.\"\n\nIt is remarkable, that princes and politicians have always held the works of Tacitus in the highest esteem; which looks as if they either found their account in reading them, or were pleased to find courts, and the people who live in them, so exactly described after the life as they are in his writings. Part of what is extant was found in Germany by a receiver of Pope Leo X. and published by Beroaldus at Rome in 1515. Leo was so much charmed with Tacitus, that he gave the receiver a reward of 500 crowns; and promised not only indulgences, but money also and honour, to any one who should find the other part; which it is said was afterwards brought to him. Pope Paul III., as Muretus relates, wore out his Tacitus by much reading it; and Cosmo de Medicis, who was the first great duke of Tuscany, and formed for governing, accounted the reading of him his greatest pleasure. Muretus adds, that several princes, and privy-counsellors to princes, read him with great application, and regarded him as a sort of oracle in politics. A certain author relates, that Queen Christina of Sweden, though extremely fond of the Greek tongue, which she made \"the diversion of her leisure hours, was not restrained by that from her serious studies; so she called among others Tacitus's History, some pages of which she read constantly every day.\" Lastly, Lord Bolingbroke, an authority surely of no mean rank, calls him, \"a favourite author,\" and gives him manifestly the preference to all the Greek and Roman historians.\n\nNo author has obtained a more splendid reputation than Tacitus. He has been accounted, and with good reason, the most cultivated genius of antiquity; and we must not seek for his parallel in modern times. It is impossible not to admire and recommend his intimate knowledge of the human heart, the spirit of liberty which he breathes, and the force and vivacity with which he perpetually expresses himself. The reader of taste is struck by the greatness of his thoughts and the dignity of his narration; the philosopher by the comprehensive powers of his mind; and the politician by the sagacity with which he unfolds the springs of the most secret transactions. Civil liberty and the rights of mankind never met with a bolder or a more able affter: servitude, debasement, and tyranny, appear not in the writings of any other author in juster or more odious colours. He has been censured as obscure; and indeed nothing can be more certain than that he did not write for the common mass of men. But to those who are judges of his compositions, it is no matter of regret that his manner is his own, and peculiar. Never were description and sentiment so wonderfully and so beautifully blended; and never were the actions and characters of men delineated with so much strength and precision. He has all the merits of other historians, without their defects. He possesses the distinctness of Xenophon without his uniformity; he is more eloquent than Livy, and is free from his superstition; and he has more knowledge and judgment than Polybius, without his affectation of reasoning on every occasion.\n\nOne of the best editions of the works of Tacitus was published at Paris by Brotier, in 4 vols. 4to. There have been four translations of his works into English; the first by Greenway and Sir Henry Saville, in the reign of Elizabeth; the second by Dryden and others; the third by Gordon, which is remarkable for affectation of style, though some think it bears a striking resemblance to the original; and the fourth and best by Murphy, in 1793, in 4 vols. 4to.\n\nTack, a rope used to confine the foremost lower corners of the courses and staysails in a fixed position, when the wind crosses the ship's course obliquely. The same name is also given to the rope employed to pull out the lower corner of a studding-sail or driver to the extremity of its boom.\n\nThe main-sail and fore-sail of a ship are furnished with a tack on each side, which is formed of a thick rope tapering to the end, and having a knot wrought upon the largest end, by which it is firmly retained in the clue of the sail. By this means one tack is always fastened to windward, at the same time that the sheet extends the sail to the leeward.\n\nTack, is also applied, by analogy, to that part of any sail to which the tack is usually fastened.\n\nA ship is said to be on the starboard or larboard tack, when she is close-hauled, with the wind upon the starboard or larboard side; and in this sense the distance which the sails in that position is considered as the length of the tack; although this is more frequently called board.

Thus a ship being close-hauled on the larboard tack, and turning her prow suddenly to windward, receives the impression of the wind on her head-sails, by which she falls off upon the line of the starboard-tack. Tacking is also used in a more enlarged sense, to imply that manoeuvre in navigation by which a ship makes an oblique progression to the windward, in a zig-zag direction.

It stands on a small promontory, at the extremity of which is a fortress of considerable strength, and capable of accommodating a numerous garrison. The streets are wide but unpaved, and from the lightness of the soil, are either intolerably dusty, or ankle deep in mud. The houses, which do not exceed a thousand, are small, built chiefly of wood, plastered with mud, and roofed with bark. It is in north latitude 46°.\n\nTaganrook is remarkable only as a place of trade, but in this view is highly respectable. When Mr McGill visited it in 1835, he found there upwards of 200 vessels of various sizes, waiting for cargoes. From its advantageous situation, at the head of the sea of Azof, and near the mouths of the rivers Don and Volga, and from its being in the vicinity of a very fertile country, it has become the centre of commerce for many staple articles. Hither are brought, for exportation, vast quantities of grain, wool, hides, butter, tallow, bees-wax and honey from the southern provinces of Russia; iron, timber, pitch, and tar from Siberia; caviar to the amount of 50,000 puds annually from the Don and the Volga; hemp and flax from the neighbouring districts. Cordage and canvas are manufactured here, and form a considerable article of traffic. The trade is carried on chiefly by Ragusan and Greek supercargoes, who remain only till their commodities are collected and shipped.

But the tail in all animals is of great use in directing their motions.\n\nTail, or Fee-tail, in Law, is a conditional estate or fee, opposed to fee-simple. See Fee.\n\nA conditional fee, at the common law, was a fee restrained to some particular heirs exclusive of others; as to the heirs of a man's body, by which only his lineal descendants were admitted, in exclusion of collateral heirs; or to the heirs male of his body, in exclusion both of collaterals and lineal females also. It was called a conditional fee, by reason of the condition expressed or implied in the donation of it, that if the donee died without such particular heirs, the land should revert to the donor. For this was a condition annexed by law to all grants whatsoever, that on failure of the heirs specified in the grant, the grant should be at an end, and the land return to its ancient proprietor. Such conditional fees were strictly agreeable to the nature of feuds, when they first ceased to be mere estates of life, and were not yet arrived to be absolute estates in fee-simple.\n\nWith regard to the condition annexed to these fees by the common law, it was held, that such a gift (to a man and the heirs of his body) was a gift upon condition that it should revert to the donor if the donee had no heirs of his body; but if he had, it should then remain to the donee. They therefore called it a fee-simple on condition that he had issue. Now we must observe, that when any condition is performed, it is thenceforth entirely gone; and the thing to which it was before annexed becomes absolute and wholly unconditional. So that as soon as the grantee had any issue born,\nhis estate was supposed to become absolute by the performance of the condition; at least for these three purposes: 1. To enable the tenant to alienate the land, and thereby to bar not only his own issue, but also the donor, of his interest in the reversion. 2. To subject him to forfeit it for treason; which he could not do till issue born longer than for his own life, lest thereby the inheritance of the issue and reversion of the donor might have been defeated. 3. To empower him to charge the land with rents, commons, and certain other encumbrances, so as to bind his issue. And this was thought the more reasonable, because, by the birth of issue, the possibility of the donor's reversion was rendered more distant and precarious; and his interest seems to have been the only one which the law, as it then stood, was solicitous to protect, without much regard to the right of succession intended to be vested in the issue. However, if the tenant did not in fact alienate the land, the course of descent was not altered by this performance of the condition; for if the issue had afterwards died, and then the tenant or original grantee had died, without making any alienation, the land, by the terms of the donation, could descend to none but the heirs of his body; and therefore, in default of them, must have reverted to the donor. For which reason, in order to subject the lands to the ordinary course of descent, the donees of these conditional fee-simple took care to alienate as soon as they had performed the condition by having issue; and afterwards repurchased the lands, which gave them a fee simple absolute, that would descend to the heirs general, according to the course of the common law. And thus stood the old law with regard to conditional fees: which things, says Sir Edward Coke, though they seem ancient, are yet necessary to be known, as well for the declaring how the common law stood in such cases, as for the sake of antiquities, and such-like inheritances, as are not within the statutes of entail, and therefore remain as the common law. The inconveniences which attended these limited and fettered inheritances were probably what induced the judges to give way to this subtle finesse (for such it undoubtedly was), in order to shorten the duration of these conditional estates. But, on the other hand, the nobility, who were willing to perpetuate their possessions in their own families, to put a stop to this practice, procured the statute of Westminster the second (commonly called the statute de donis conditionalibus) to be made; which paid a greater regard to the private will and intentions of the donor, than to the propriety of such intentions, or any public considerations whatsoever. This statute revived in some part the ancient feudal restraints which were originally laid on alienations, by enacting, that from thenceforth the will of the donor be observed; and that the tenements so given (to a man and the heirs of his body) should at all events go to the issue, if there were any; or if none, should revert to the donor.\n\nUpon the construction of this act of parliament, the judges determined that the donee had no longer a conditional fee-simple, which became absolute and at his own disposal the instant any issue was born; but they divided the estate into two parts, leaving in the donee a new kind of particular estate, which they denominated a fee-tail; and vesting in the donor the ultimate fee-simple of the land, expectant on the failure of issue; which expectant estate is what we now call a reversion. And hence it is that Littleton tells us, that tenant in fee-tail is by virtue of the statute of Westminster the second. The expression fee-tail, or feudum talliatum, was borrowed from the feudists (see Crag, l. s. t. 10, § 24, 25.), among whom it signified any mutilated or truncated inheritance, from which the heirs general were cut off; being derived from the barbarous verb talliare, to cut; from which the French tailleur and the Italian tagliare are formed, (Spelm. Glos. 531.).\n\nHaving thus shown the original of estates tail, we now proceed to consider what things may or may not be entailed under the statute de donis. Tenements is the only word used in the statute; and this Sir Edward Coke expounds to comprehend all corporeal hereditaments whatsoever; and also all incorporeal hereditaments which favour of the reality, that is, which issue out of corporeal ones, or which concern or are annexed to or may be exercised within the same; as rents, eftowers, commons, and the like. Also offices and dignities, which concern lands, or have relation to fixed and certain places, may be entailed. But mere personal chattels, which favour not at all of the reality, cannot be entailed. Neither can an office, which merely relates to such personal chattels; nor an annuity, which charges only the person, and not the lands of the grantor. But in these last, if granted to a man and the heirs of his body, the grantee hath still a fee conditional at common law as before the statute, and by his alienation may bar the heir or reverhoner. An estate to a man and his heirs for another's life cannot be entailed; for this is strictly no estate of inheritance, and therefore not within the statute de donis. Neither can a copyhold estate be entailed by virtue of the statute; for that would tend to encroach upon and restrain the will of the lord; but, by the special custom of the manor, a copyhold may be limited to the heirs of the body; for here the custom affects and interprets the lord's will.\n\nAs to the several species of estates-tail, and how they are respectively created; they are either general or special. Tail-general is where lands and tenements are given to one, and the heirs of his body begotten: which is called tail-general; because, how often foever such donee in tail be married, his issue in general, by all and every such marriage, is, in succeeding order, capable of inheriting the estate-tail per formam domi. Tenant in tail-special is where the gift is restrained to certain heirs of the donee's body, and does not go to all of them in general. And this may happen several ways. We shall instance in only one; as where lands and tenements are given to a man and the heirs of his body, on Mary his now wife to be begotten. Here no issue can inherit but such special issue as is engendered between them two; not such as the husband may have by another wife; and therefore it is called special tail. And here we may observe, that the words of inheritance (to him and his heirs) give him an estate in fee; but they being heirs to be by him begotten, this makes it a fee tail; and the person being also limited, on whom such heirs shall be begotten (viz. Mary his present wife), this makes it a fee-tail special.\n\nEstates in general and special tail are farther diversified by the distinction of sexes in such entails; for both of them may either be in tail male or tail female. As\nif lands be given to a man, and his heirs-male of his body begotten, this is an estate in tail male general; but if to a man, and the heirs-female of his body on his present wife begotten, this is an estate in tail female special. And in case of an entail male, the heirs-female shall never inherit, nor any derived from them; nor, è conservo, the heirs-male in case of a gift in tail female. Thus, if the donee in tail male hath a daughter, who dies leaving a son, such grandson in this case cannot inherit the estate-tail; for he cannot deduce his descent wholly by heirs-male. And as the heir-male must convey his descent wholly by males, so must the heir-female wholly by females. And therefore if a man hath two estates-tail, the one in tail male and the other in tail female, and he hath issue a daughter, which daughter hath issue a son; this grandson can succeed to neither of the estates, for he cannot convey his descent wholly either in the male or female line.\n\nAs the word heirs is necessary to create a fee, so, in farther imitation of the strictness of the feudal donation, the word body, or some other words of procreation; are necessary to make it a fee-tail, and ascertain to what heirs in particular the fee is limited. If, therefore, either the words of inheritance or words of procreation be omitted, albeit the others are inserted in the grant, this will not make an estate-tail. As if the grant be to a man and the issue of his body, to a man and his seed, to a man and his children or offspring; all these are only estates for life, there wanting the words of inheritance, \"his heirs.\" So, on the other hand, a gift to a man, and his heirs male or female, is an estate in fee-simple and not in fee-tail; for there are no words to ascertain the body out of which they shall issue. Indeed, in last wills and testaments, wherein greater indulgence is allowed, an estate-tail may be created by a devise to a man and his seed, or to a man and his heirs-male, or by other irregular modes of expression.\n\nThere is still another species of entailed estates, now indeed grown out of use, yet still capable of subsisting in law; which are estates in liberum maritagio, or Frank-marriage. See that article.\n\nThe incidents to a tenancy in tail, under the statute Westminster 2, are chiefly these: 1. That a tenant in tail may commit waste on the estate-tail, by felling timber, pulling down houses, or the like, without being impeached or called to account for the same. 2. That the wife of the tenant in tail shall have her dower, or thirds, of the estate-tail. 3. That the husband of a female tenant in tail may be tenant by the curtesy of the estate-tail. 4. That an estate-tail may be barred, or destroyed, by a fine, by a common recovery, or by lineal warranty defending with affets to the heir. See Assets.\n\nThus much for the nature of estates-tail: the establishment of which family-law (as it is properly styled by Pigott) occasioned infinite difficulties and disputes. Children grew disobedient when they knew they could not be set aside: farmers were ousted of their leases made by tenants in tail; for if such leases had been valid, then, under colour of long leases, the issue might have been virtually disinheritied: creditors were defrauded of their debts; for, if a tenant in tail could have charged his estate with their payment, he might also have defeated his issue, by mortgaging it for as much as it was worth: innumerable latent entails were produced to deprive purchasers of the lands they had fairly bought; of suits in consequence of which, our ancient books are full; and treasors were encouraged, as estates-tail were not liable to forfeiture longer than for the tenant's life. So that they were justly branded as the source of new contentions and mischiefs unknown to the common law; and almost universally considered as the common grievance of the realm. But as the nobility were always fond of this statute, because it preserved their family-estates from forfeiture, there was little hope of procuring a repeal by the legislature; and therefore, by the connivance of an active and politic prince, a method was devised to evade it.\n\nAbout 200 years intervened between the making of the statute de donis, and the application of common recoveries to this intent, in the 12th year of Edward IV.; which were then openly declared by the judges to be a sufficient bar of an estate-tail. For though the courts had, so long before as the reign of Edward III., very frequently hinted their opinion that a bar might be effected upon these principles, yet it was never carried into execution; till Edward IV. observing (in the disputes between the houses of York and Lancaster) how little effect attainders for treason had on families whose estates were protected by the sanctity of entails, gave his countenance to this proceeding, and suffered Taltarn's case to be brought before the court: wherein, in consequence of the principles then laid down, it was in effect determined, that a common recovery suffered by tenant in tail should be an effectual destruction thereof. These common recoveries are fictitious proceedings, introduced by a kind of pia fraus, to elude the statute de donis, which was found so intolerably mischievous, and which yet one branch of the legislature would not then consent to repeal; and that these recoveries, however clandestinely begun, are now become by long use and acquiescence a most common assurance of lands; and are looked upon as the legal mode of conveyance, by which a tenant in tail may dispose of his lands and tenements: so that no court will suffer them to be shaken or reflected on, and even acts of parliament have by a side-wind countenanced and established them.\n\nThis expedient having greatly abridged estates-tail with regard to their duration, others were soon invented to strip them of other privileges. The next that was attacked was their freedom from forfeitures for treason. For, notwithstanding the large advances made by recoveries, in the compass of about three score years, towards unfettering these inheritances, and thereby subjecting the lands to forfeiture, the rapacious prince then reigning, finding them frequently resettled in a similar manner to suit the convenience of families, had address enough to procure a statute, whereby all estates of inheritance (under which general words estate-tail were covertly included) are declared to be forfeited to the king upon any conviction of high-treason.\n\nThe next attack which they suffered, in order of time, was by the statute 32 Hen. VIII. c. 28, whereby certain leases made by tenants in tail, which do not tend to the prejudice of the issue, were allowed to be good in law, and to bind the issue in tail. But they received a more violent blow in the same session of parliament, by the construction put upon the statute of fines, by the statute 32 Hen. VIII. c. 36, which declares a fine duly levied by tenant in tail to be a complete bar to him and his heirs, and all other persons claiming under such entail.\nentail. This was evidently agreeable to the intention of Henry VII., whose policy it was (before common recoveries had obtained their full strength and authority) to lay the road as open as possible to the alienation of landed property, in order to weaken the overgrown power of his nobles. But as they, from the opposite reasons, were not easily brought to consent to such a provision, it was therefore couched, in his act, under covert and obscure expressions. And the judges, though willing to construe that statute as favourably as possible for the defeating of entailed estates, yet hesitated at giving fines so extensive a power by mere implication, when the statute de donis had expressly declared that they should not be a bar to estates-tail. But the statute of Henry VIII., when the doctrine of alienation was better received, and the will of the prince more implicitly obeyed than before, avowed and established that intention. Yet, in order to preserve the property of the crown from any danger of infringement, all estates-tail created by the crown, and of which the crown has the reversion, are excepted out of this statute. And the same was done with regard to common recoveries, by the statute 34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c. 20, which enacts, that no feigned recovery had against tenants in tail, where the estate was created by the crown, and the remainder or reversion continues still in the crown, shall be of any force and effect. Which is allowing, indirectly and collaterally, their full force and effect with respect to ordinary estates-tail, where the royal prerogative is not concerned.\n\nLately, by a statute of the succeeding year, all estates-tail are rendered liable to be charged for payment of debts due to the king by record or special contract; as since, by the bankrupt-laws, they are also subjected to be sold for the debts contracted by a bankrupt. And, by the construction put on the statute 43 Eliz. c. 4, an appointment by tenant in tail of the lands entailed to a charitable use is good without fine or recovery.\n\nEstates-tail being thus by degrees unfettered, are now reduced again to almost the same state, even before issue born, as conditional fees were in common law, after the condition was performed, by the birth of issue. For, first, the tenant in tail is now enabled to alienate his lands and tenements by fine, by recovery, or by certain other means; and thereby to defeat the interest as well of his own issue, though unborn, as also of the reversioner, except in the case of the crown: secondly, he is now liable to forfeit them for high treason: and, lastly, he may charge them with reasonable leases, and also with such of his debts as are due to the crown on specialties, or have been contracted with his fellow-subjects in a course of extensive commerce.\n\nTAILZIE, in Scots Law, the same with TAIL. See LAW, No. clxxx. 9.\n\nTALAPOINS or TALOPINS, priests of Siam.—They enjoy great privileges, but are enjoined celibacy and austerity of life. They live in monasteries contiguous to the temples: and what is singular, any one may enter into the priesthood, and after a certain age may quit it to marry, and return to society. There are talapoinettes too, or nuns, who live in the same convents, but are not admitted till they have passed their fortieth year. The talapoins educate children; and at every new and full moon explain the precepts of their religion in their temples; and during the rainy season they preach from six in the morning till noon, and from one Talapoins in the afternoon till five in the evening. They dress in a very mean garb, go bareheaded and barefooted; and no person is admitted among them who is not well skilled in the Baly language.\n\nThey believe that the universe is eternal; but admit that certain parts of it, as this world, may be destroyed and again regenerated. They believe in a universal pervading spirit, and in the immortality and transmigration of the soul; but they extend this last doctrine, not only to all animals, but to vegetables and rocks. They have their good and evil genii, and particular devils, who preside over forests and rivers, and interfere in all sublunary affairs.\n\nFor the honour of human nature, we are happy to find so pure a system of morality prevail among these people: it not only forbids its followers to do ill, but enjoins the necessity of doing good, and of ridding every improper thought or criminal desire.\n\nThose who wish to peruse a more particular account of the talapoins, may consult Voyage de M. de la Louberge; and Sketches relating to the History, &c. of the Hindoos.\n\nTALC, a species of mineral arranged under the magnesian earths. See MINERALOGY Index.\n\nTALENT, signifies both a weight and a coin very common among the ancients, but very different among different nations.\n\nThe common Attic talent of weight contains 60 Attic minæ, or 6000 Attic drachmæ; and weighed, according to Dr Arbuthnot, 59 lbs. 11 oz. 17½ gr. English troy weight. There was another Attic talent, by some said to consist of 80, by others of 100 minæ. The Egyptian talent was 80 minæ; the Antiochian also 80; the Ptolemaic of Cleopatra 86½; that of Alexandria 96; and the Infular talent 120. In the valuation of money, the Grecian talent, according to Dr Arbuthnot, was equal to 60 minæ, or, reckoning the mina at 3l. 4s. 7d. equal to 103l. 15s. The Syrian talent in this valuation consisted of 15 Attic minæ; the Ptolemaic of 20; the Antiochian of 60; the Euboic of 60; the Babylonic of 70; the Greater Attic of 80; the Tyrian of 80; the Eginene of 100; the Rhodian of 100; and the Egyptian of 80 minæ.\n\nThere is another talent much more ancient, which Dr Arbuthnot calls the Homeric talent of gold, which seems to have weighed six Attic drachms or three darics, a daric weighing very little more than a guinea. According to this talent, some reckon the treasure of King David, particularly that mentioned 1 Chron. xxii. 14, which, according to the common reckoning, would amount in gold talents to the value of 547,500,000l. and the silver to above 342,000,000l.; or, reckoning according to the decuple proportion of gold to silver, the two sums would be equal. As David reigned in Judæa after the siege of Troy, it is not improbable but Homer and he might use the same numeral talent of gold.\n\nAmong the Romans there were two kinds of talents, the little and the great talent: the little was the common talent; and whenever they say simply talentum, they are to be understood of this. The little talent was 60 minæ or Roman pounds; the mina or pound estimated at 150 drachmæ or denarii: it was also estimated at 24 great lefcerces, which amounted to 60 pounds.\n\nThe great talent exceeded the less by one-third part.\nTalent Budaeus computes, that the little talent of silver was worth 75l. sterling, and the greater 99l. 6s. 8d. sterling. The greater of gold was worth 125l. sterling.\n\nTalent, as a species or money, among the Hebrews, was sometimes used for a gold coin, the same with the shekel of gold, called also tater, and weighing only four drachms. The Hebrews reckoned by these talents as we do by pounds, &c. Thus a million of gold, or million of talents of gold, among them, was a million of shekels or nummi; the nummus of gold being the same weight with the shekel, viz. four drachms.\n\nBut the Hebrew talent weight of silver, which they called cicar, was equivalent to that of 3000 shekels, or 113 lb. 10 oz. 1 dwt. 10½ gr. English Troy weight, according to Arbutinot's computation.\n\nTALICOTIUS, Gaspar, chief surgeon to the great duke of Tuscany, was born at Bononia in Italy in 1553. He wrote a Latin treatise intitled Chirurgia Nota de Curtis Membris, in which he teaches the art of engraving noses, ears, lips, &c. giving representations of the instruments and proper bandages; many, however, are of opinion that he never put his art in practice. But his doctrine is not singular; for Alexander Benedictus, a famous chirurgical writer, has described a similar operation.\n\nTALLIO (lex talionis), a species of punishment in the Mosaic law, whereby an evil is returned similar to that committed against us by another; hence that expression, \"Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.\" This law was at first inflicted in the 12 tables amongst the Romans; but afterwards fell aside, and a power given to the praetor to fix upon a sum of money for the damage done.\n\nTALISMAN, magical figures cut or engraved with superstitious observations on the characteristics and configurations of the heavens, to which some astrologers have attributed wonderful virtues, particularly that of calling down celestial influences. The talismans of Samothrace, so famous of old, were pieces of iron formed into certain images, and set in rings; these were esteemed preservatives against all kinds of evils. There were likewise talismans taken from vegetables, and others from minerals.\n\nTALLAGE (tallagium), from the French taille, is metaphorically used for a part or share of a man's substance carved out of the whole, paid by way of tribute, toll, or tax.\n\nTALLOW, in Commerce, the fat of certain animals melted and clarified. It is procured from most animals, but chiefly from bullocks, sheep, hogs, and bears. Some kinds of tallow are used as unguents in medicine, some for making soap and dressing leather, and some for making candles. See FAT, Chemistry Index.\n\nTALLOW Tree. See CROTON, Botany Index.\n\nTALLY, is a stick cut in two parts, on each whereof is marked, with notches or otherwise, what is due between debtor and creditor, as now used by brewers, &c. And this was the ancient way of keeping all accounts, one part being kept by the creditor, the other by the debtor, &c. Hence the tallier of the exchequer, whom we now call the teller. But there are two kinds of tallies mentioned in our statutes to have been long used in the exchequer. The one is termed tallies of debt, which are in the nature of an acquittance for debts paid to the king, on the payment whereof these tallies are delivered to the debtors, who carrying them to the clerk of the tally pipe-office, have there an acquittance in parchment for their full discharge. The other are tallies of reward or allowance, being made to sheriffs of counties as a recompense for such matters as they have performed to their charge, or such money as is cast upon them in their accounts of course, but not leviable, &c. In the exchequer there is a tally-court, where attend the two deputy-chamberlains of the exchequer and the tally-cutter; and a tally is generally the king's acquittance for money paid or lent, and has written on it words proper to express on what occasion the money is received.\n\nTALLY-Man, a person that sells or lets goods, clothes, &c. to be paid by so much a-week.\n\nTALMUD, a collection of Jewish traditions. There are two works which bear this name, the Talmud of Jerusalem, and the Talmud of Babylon. Each of these is composed of two parts; the Mishna, which is the text, and is common to both, and the Gemara or commentary. See Mishna and Gemara.\n\nThe Mishna, which comprehends all the laws, institutions, and rules of life which, beside the ancient Hebrew scripture, the Jews thought themselves bound to observe, was composed, according to the unanimous testimony of the Jews, about the close of the second century. It was the work of Rabbi Jehuda (or Juda) HaKaddosh, who was the ornament of the school at Tiberias, and is said to have occupied him forty years. The commentaries and additions which succeeding Rabbis made were collected by Rabbi Johanan Ben Eliezer, some say in the 5th, others say in the 6th, and others in the 7th century, under the name of Gemara, that is, completion; because it completed the Talmud. A similar addition was made to the Mishna by the Babylonish doctors in the beginning of the 6th century according to Enfield, and in the 7th according to others.\n\nThe Mishna is divided into six parts, of which every one which is intitled order is formed of treatises, every treatise is divided into chapters, and every chapter into mishnas or aphorisms. In the first part is discussed whatever relates to seeds, fruits, and trees; in the second feasts; in the third women, their duties, their disorders, marriages, divorces, contracts, and nuptials; in the fourth are treated the damages or losses sustained by beasts or men, of things found, deposits, usuries, rents, farms, partnerships in commerce, inheritance, sales and purchases, oaths, witness, arrests, idolatry; and here are named those by whom the oral law was received and preserved; in the fifth part are noticed what regards sacrifices and holy things; and the sixth treats on purifications, vessels, furniture, clothes, houses, leprosy, baths, and numerous other articles. All this forms the Mishna.\n\nAs the learned reader may wish to obtain some notion of rabbinical composition and judgement, we shall gratify his curiosity sufficiently by the following specimen: \"Adam's body was made of the earth of Babylon, his head of the land of Israel, his other members of other parts of the world. R. Meir thought he was compact of the earth gathered out of the whole earth; as it is written, three eyes did see my substance. Now it is elsewhere written, the eyes of the Lord are over all the earth. R. Aha expressly marks the twelve hours in which his various parts were formed. His stature was from one end of the world to the other; and it was for his transgression that the Creator, laying his hand in anger on him, leftened...\"\nTalmud fened him; for before (says R. Eleazar), 'with his hand he reached the firmament.' R. Jehuda thinks his sin was hereby; but R. Isaac thinks that 'it was nourishing his forekin.'\n\nThe Talmud of Babylon is most valued by the Jews; and this is the book which they mean to express when they talk of the Talmud in general. An abridgement of it was made by Maimonides in the 12th century, in which he rejected some of its greatest absurdities. The Gemara is stuffed with dreams and chimeras, with many ignorant and impertinent questions, and the style very coarse. The Mishna is written in a style comparatively pure, and may be very useful in explaining passages of the New Testament where the phraseology is similar. This is indeed the only use to which Christians can apply it; but this renders it valuable.\n\nLightfoot had judiciously availed himself of such information as he could derive from it. Some of the popes, with a barbarous zeal, and a timidity of spirit for the success of the Christian religion, which the belief of its divinity can never excuse, ordered great numbers of the Talmud to be burned. Gregory IX. burned about 20 cart-loads, and Paul IV. ordered 12,000 copies of the Talmud to be destroyed.\n\nThe last edition of the Talmud of Babylon, printed at Amsterdam, is in 12 vols folio. The Talmud of Jerusalem is in one large folio.\n\nTALPA, the Mole; a genus of quadrupeds belonging to the order of ferre. See MAMMALIA Index.\n\nTAMANDAU. See MYRMECOPHAGA, MAMMALIA Index.\n\nTAMARINDUS, the Tamarind-tree; a genus of plants; according to Linnaeus belonging to the class of triandra; but Woodville, Schreber, and other botanists, have arranged it under the class of monodelphion. See BOTANY Index.\n\nTAMARIX, the Tamarisc, a genus of plants belonging to the class pentandra; and in the natural system ranging under the 13th order, Succulentae. See BOTANY Index.\n\nTAMBOUR, in Architecture, a term applied to the Corinthian and Composite capitals, as bearing some resemblance to a drum, which the French call tambour. Some choose to call it the vase, and others campana or the bell.\n\nTambour is also used for a little box of timber work, covered with a ceiling, withinside the porch of certain churches; both to prevent the view of persons passing by, and to keep off the wind, &c., by means of folding-doors, &c.\n\nTambour, also denotes a round course of stone, several whereof form the shaft of a column, not so high as a diameter.\n\nTambour, in the arts, is a species of embroidery. The tambour is an instrument of a spherical form, upon which is stretched, by means of a string, and buckle, or other suitable appendage, a piece of linen or thin filken fluff; which is wrought with a needle of a particular form, and by means of filken or gold and silver threads, into leaves, flowers, or other figures.\n\nTAMBOURIN, is the name of a dance performed on the French stage. The air is lively, and the movements are quick.\n\nThe same name is applied to a musical instrument, formed of a hoop, over which is stretched a piece of parchment or vellum, while bells and hollow hemispheres of brass are loosely hung in holes cut in the hoop. The tambourin Tamerlane is used only as an accompaniment to other instruments.\n\nTAMERLANE, or TIMUR BEK, a celebrated prince and conqueror. At the age of 25 he attained the highest dignities, with surprising courage, and an ambition astonishing to all the world. Endeavouring to perfect the great talents which he had received from nature, he spent nine years in different countries; where his great sense and elevated genius appeared in councils and assemblies, while his intrepidity and valour, whether in personal combats or pitched battles, drew upon him the admiration of all mankind. He made himself master of the three empires of Jagatay Khan, Tuthi Khan, and Hulakai Khan; so that his power, riches, and magnificence, were immense. There remain vast monuments of his grandeur in the cities, towns, castles, and walls, which he built: in the rivers and canals which he dug, as well as the bridges, gardens, palaces, hospitals, mosques, and monasteries, which he erected in divers parts of Asia in so great a number, that a king might be accounted very powerful and magnificent, who should have employed 36 years only in building the great edifices which Timur, caused to be founded.\n\nTimur, according to the historian Arabshah, was in his person very corpulent and tall. He had a large forehead and big head. His countenance was agreeable, and his complexion fair. He wore a large beard, was very strong, and well limbed; had broad shoulders, thick fingers, and long legs. His constitution was amazingly vigorous; but he was maimed in one hand and lame of the right side. His eyes appeared full of fire; his voice was loud and piercing; he feared nothing; and when far advanced in years, his understanding was found and perfect, his body vigorous and robust, his mind constant and unshaken like a rock.\n\nHe did not like railing, and could not bear a lie. There was no joking or fooling before him; for he loved the naked truth, even although it was to his own disadvantage. He neither grieved if he miscarried in any attempt, nor appeared overjoyed on any great success. The device of his soul was, \"I am sincere and plain.\" He had a clear and solid understanding, was surprisingly happy in his conjectures; vigilant, active, and unshaken in his resolutions. He took great delight in reading history, and was well versed in the state of countries, provinces, and cities. He was penetrating, subtle, close, and dissembling; just by inclination, liberal from disposition; but ambition had in a great measure extinguished his humanity; war had familiarized him to blood; and his religious zeal had inspired him with the most cruel, implacable, and pernicious fanaticism.\n\nHe died on the 1st of April 1405, in the 71st year of his age and 36th of his reign. When he found death approaching, he sent for his principal officers, declared his grandson his heir, and made them swear to execute his will. Having recommended brotherly love and concord to the princes his children, he ordered one of the doctors to read the Koran at his bed's head, and often repeat the unity of God. At night he several times made profession of his belief, \"That there is no other God than God,\" and then expired. See MOGULS, No 15, &c.\n\nTANTAM, a flat drum used by the Hindoos, resembling a tabor, but it is larger, and sounds louder.\n\nTAMUS, Black Briony, a genus of plants belonging\nTAN, the bark of the oak after it has been ground and used by the tanner. The smallest sort is generally made up in little square cakes called turf, and sold for firing. The coarser sort is sometimes dried in the sun, and used by bakers for heating their ovens, &c., but its chief use is for making hot-beds to raise pine-apples and other plants.—William III. introduced the use of it from Holland, for the purpose of raising orange trees; after which it was discontinued for many years: but about 1719, when ananas were first brought into England, it came into general use, and has ever since been in great estimation with gardeners for all the purposes of forcing, &c., on account of its strong and lasting fermentation. The smaller the tan the quicker it heats; but the larger sort acquires heat more gradually and retains it longer: the skilful gardener therefore uses the one or the other, or a mixture of both, according to the time and purpose for which it is wanted. It is some time after the tan comes out of the tanner's pit before it begins to heat, and therefore it is not fit for immediate use; but having lain a week or two, it enters into a state of fermentation, and if put into hot-beds properly prepared, will retain a moderate heat for three or four months. When it becomes useless for the hot-house, it is said by Miller and others to be an excellent manure for some kinds of land.\n\nThe word tan is sometimes, though improperly, used for the bark itself, which is the chief ingredient in the tanning of leather. Oak bark, on account of its great astringency and gummy-resinous properties, is preferred to all other substances for the purpose of tanning, as it not only preserves the leather from rotting, but also, by condensing the pores, renders it impervious to water.

In 1662, this place belonged to the Portuguese, and was given to King Charles II. upon his marriage with the Infanta of Portugal; but, he growing weary of the charge of keeping it, caused it to be blown up and destroyed in 1684; ever since which time it has been only a poor fishing town.

See TANNING.\n\nTANNER, Dr Thomas, an English prelate and celebrated antiquarian, born in 1674. He was admitted of Queen's college Oxford, where a similarity of taste for antiquities produced a close friendship between him and Edmund Gibson afterwards bishop of London. In 1697, he was chosen fellow of his college; and having already published some specimens of his antiquarian researches, soon after became known to Dr Moore bishop of Norwich, who made him chancellor of his diocese. In 1722, he was made archdeacon of Norwich, and in 1731 bishop of St Asaph. He died at Oxford in 1735; and after his death was published an elaborate work, in which he is said to have been employed for 40 years, under this title, Bibliotheca Britannica Hibernica, sive de Scriptoribus qui in Anglia, Scotia, et Hibernia, ad faciendi XVII. initium floruerunt, &c.\n\nTANNING, the art of converting hides and skins into leather. This art has been practised for many centuries in Britain; but some improvements have been made on it, especially in France, suggested by the discoveries of modern chemistry. These improvements we shall briefly notice after having described the method lately practised in the neighbourhood of London, where the best British leather is manufactured. The general principles on which the improvements are founded, will naturally come to be considered, after describing the processes themselves.\n\nThe leather tanned in England is generally divided by the manufacturers into three kinds, butts or backs, kinds of hides, and skins. Butts, are made from the stoutest and toughest ox hides, and are used chiefly for the soles of stout shoes and boots. Hides, or crop-hides, are made from cow hides, or the lighter ox hides, and are employed for ordinary soles. The term skins is applied to all the other kinds of leather, comprehending that made from the skins of calves, foals, dogs, kids, &c.\n\nButts are tanned as follows. After the horns are taken off, the hides are laid smooth in heaps for two days' tanning, in summer, and five or six in winter; they are then hung on poles in a close room, called a smoke-house, in which is kept a smouldering fire of wet tan; this occasions a small degree of putrefaction, by which means the hair more easily comes off, by spreading the hide on a sort of wooden horse or beam, and scraping it with a crooked knife. The hair being taken off, the hide is thrown into a pool of water, to cleanse it from the dirt, &c., which being done, it is again spread on the wooden beam, and the grease, loose flesh, extraneous filth, &c., carefully taken off: the hides are then put into a pit of strong liquor, called ooze, prepared in pits kept for the purpose, by infusing ground oak bark in water, which is termed colouring. The hides are then removed into another pit, called a scouring, which consists of water strongly impregnated with vitriolic or sulphuric acid, or a vegetable acid prepared from rye or barley. This operation\nTanning operation is called raising. The hides are then taken out of the scouring, and spread smooth in a pit usually filled with water, called a binder, with a quantity of ground bark strewed between each. After lying a month or six weeks, they are taken up, and the decayed bark and liquor being drawn out of the pit, it is again filled with strong ooze, when they are put in as before, with bark between each hide. They now lie two or three months, at the expiration of which the same operation is repeated; they then remain four or five months, when they again undergo the same process, and after being three months in the last pit, are completely tanned, unless the hides are so remarkably stout as to require an additional pit or layer. The whole process requires from 11 to 18 months, and sometimes two years, according to the substance of the hide, and discretion of the tanner. When taken out of the pit to be dried, they are hung on poles; and after being compressed by a steel pin, and beaten out smooth by wooden beatles, the operation is completed.\n\nHides are thus managed. After the horns are taken off, and the hide is washed, they are put into a pit of water, saturated with lime, and having mixed with it a quantity of the same substance, where they remain a few days, when they are taken out, and the hair scraped off on a wooden beam, as before described; they are then washed in a pit or pool of water, and the loose flesh, &c. being taken off, they are removed into a pit of weak ooze, where they are taken up and put down two or three times a day, for the first week; every second or third day they are shifted into a pit of fresh ooze, somewhat stronger than the former, till at the end of a month or six weeks they are put into a strong ooze, in which they are handled once or twice a week with fresh bark for two or three months. They are then removed into another pit, called a layer, in which they are laid smooth, with bark ground very fine, strewed above each hide. After remaining here two or three months, they are generally taken up, when the ooze is withdrawn, and the hides put in again with fresh ooze and fresh bark, where, after lying two or three months more, they are completely tanned; except a very few stout hides which may require an extra layer. They are then taken out, and hung on poles, and being smoothed by a steel pin, are, when dry, ready for sale.\n\nSkins are to be washed in water, &c. and put into lime pits as before mentioned, where they are taken up and put down every third or fourth day for two or three weeks, in order to destroy the scarf-skin. The hair is then scraped off, and the excrescences being removed, they are put into a pit of water impregnated with pigeon's dung, called a grainer, which in a week or ten days soaking out the lime, grease, and saponaceous matter, softens the skins, and prepares them for the reception of the ooze. They are then put into a pit of weak ooze, in the same manner as the hides, and being frequently handled, are by degrees removed into a stronger, and still stronger liquor, for a month or six weeks, when they are put into a very strong ooze, with fresh bark ground very fine, and at the end of two or three months, according to their substances, are sufficiently tanned; when they are taken out, hung on poles, and dried.\n\nThe lighter sorts of hides, called dressing hides, as well as horse hides, are managed nearly in the same manner as skins, and are used for coach work, harnesses, &c.\n\nThe principal objections to this old method of tanning are, that it is extremely tedious, and very expensive. Various means have been suggested for introducing a cheaper and more expeditious method of tanning. Among the earliest of these we may notice that of Dr Macbride. This method consists chiefly in the use of Dr Macfulphuric instead of acetic acid, for raising or distending the pores of the leather, and in substituting lime water, or a solution of lime, for what has been called the milk of lime, or a considerable quantity of lime diffused in water. According to a report made to the committee of commerce of the Dublin society, it appeared that Dr Macbride's method produced a saving of more than 20 per cent. to the manufacturer, while the hides were completely tanned in a much shorter time. It does not appear, however, that this method ever came into general use.\n\nThe experiments of M. Seguin, made in the end of the 18th century, on the nature of the tanning principle, led him to suggest a method of tanning which is certainly much more expeditious than the old method. It has been adopted in England by Mr William Defmon, and by his directions has been practised with considerable success, by some of the principal tanners in Warwickshire, Staffordshire, and some of the neighbouring counties. The following directions, communicated by Mr Defmonad to the editor of the Philosophical Magazine, will sufficiently explain this new process.\n\nProvide five vessels, called digesters, of any convenient materials and dimensions, with an aperture at the bottom of each. Let them be placed near each other, and elevated on stileglasses or otherwise; so that a small vessel may be placed under them. Fill the digesters with tan, viz., the bark of certain trees, such as oak, cut small, or ground to a coarse powder. Pour water on the tan in the first digester, where it may stand some time, or be immediately drawn off. This liquor is to be poured on the tan in the second digester; from that to the third, and so on, until it comes through the tan in the last digester. The liquor is then highly coloured, and marks from 6° to 8° on the hydrometer for salts. This liquor is to be used for tanning the thickest hides, and may be called the tanning lixivium. If you take a small quantity of it in a glass, and pour on it a few drops of a solution of animal glue, the clear liquor becomes turbid, and a whitish substance falls to the bottom. The precipitate thus obtained, is a sure indication that the liquor contains the tanning principle; for this reason, that glue being of the same nature with the skins or hides of which it is made, whatever substance unites itself indissolubly with the former, will do likewise with the latter.\n\nThis solution is made by dissolving a little common glue in water over a moderate fire; by means of it, not only oak bark, but also the bark of several other trees, as well as different shrubs, and plants, all which may be called tan, are found to contain the tanning principle; and by employing the solution as before, it will be always easy to ascertain whether any given substance contains this principle.\n\nIn the course of these lixiviations it may be observed,\n\n1. That the liquor running from the first digester, at length\nTanning length loses its colour. If in this state a little of it be put into a glass, and the former experiment be repeated, the liquor no longer becomes turbid, but remains clear, which shows that it contains no more of the tanning principle; but if a few drops of a solution of sulphate of iron be poured into the same glass, the liquor becomes thick and black, which is not to be poured on the tan in the second digester, but afterwards used for taking off the hair or wool. It is known by the name of *gallic lixivium*, as it appears to contain the same principles with galls.\n\nThe liquid sulphate of iron is obtained by dissolving a small quantity of iron in diluted sulphuric acid, or by dissolving green copperas in water. This solution serves to ascertain such substances as contain the gallic principle. Lime water will also produce this effect.\n\nWhen the liquor ceases to grow black by the mixture of the sulphate of iron, it will be in vain to pour any more water on the tan in the first digester. This tan being thus exhausted, must be removed, and new tan put in its place.\n\nThe liquor, after running through all the digesters, at last grows weak. All the liquor that marks from 6° to 8° on the hydrometer, must be added to the stock of tanning lixivium. What proceeds afterwards from the last digester is to be poured on the new tan in the first. Then the fresh water is to be conveyed on the tan in the second digester, and the liquor of the first let aside, while it marks 6° or 8° on the hydrometer, and added to the tanning lixivium, which must always be carefully separated from the gallic. In this manner, the tan in all the digesters may be renewed, and the lixiviations continued.\n\nThe number of these lixiviations, as well as the mode of making them, may be varied at pleasure; the essential point is to repeat them so as to give the liquor a sufficient degree of concentration, which may be determined by the hydrometer, and proportioned to the quickness required in the operation, and the thickness of the hides and skins to be tanned; all which experience will soon teach. As all kinds of tan are not equally good, it will sometimes happen that five or more filtrations will be necessary to obtain a lixivium of 6° or 8°, in which case the number of digesters must be increased, and the same method pursued as above; and when a weaker lixivium is wanted, three or four filtrations will be sufficient.\n\nThe person directing these lixiviations should be provided with the solution of glue and sulphate of iron, already described, in order to ascertain the qualities of the different lixivia, as well as with a hydrometer properly graduated, to determine their degree of concentration or specific gravity.\n\nIn tanning cow and ox hides with this lixivium, they should first be washed in running water, well cleaned, and fleshed in the usual way. For removing the hair, the hides are to be steeped for two or three days in a vat filled with the gallic lixivium, and a mixture of sulphuric acid, marking 66° on the hydrometer for acids, and in the proportion of one to a thousand, or one pint to 125 gallons. During this steeping, the hair is separated from the hides in such a manner, that it may be easily known when they are to be taken out of the vat, that is, when the hair is quite loose. It is to be scraped off with a round knife on the horse or beam.\n\nWhen raising is necessary, the hides are immersed for 10 or 12 hours in a vat filled with water, and its volume of mineral acid, of the same quality with the former, and the operation of raising is finished. The hides are repeatedly washed, and the round knife is used, after which they are prepared for tanning.\n\nThe rest of the process consists in tanning, properly so called; for which purpose, the hides are to be steeped some hours in a weak lixivium of only 1° or 2°; to obtain which, that is to be taken which runs from the second digester, or some already used for tanning. They are next put into a stronger lixivium, where in a few days they will be brought to the same degree of saturation with the liquor in which they are immersed. The strength of the liquor being then much diminished, it must be renewed; and when the hides are completely saturated, or fully tanned, which is known by cutting off a bit of the edge, remove the leather, and let it dry slowly in a shady place.\n\nFor calf skins, goat skins, &c., these are first fleshed with the knife, and worked in running water like the others. They are then steeped in lime water, in which there should be more lime than the water can dissolve at once. What is not dissolved will subside, but must be mixed with the water, by stirring it several times a day. In two or three days the skins are to be removed; when the hair is found quite loose, it is scraped off on the horse. They are then washed and pressed well, till the water running from them is perfectly clear, and the lime totally extracted. They are first steeped in a weak lixivium, then tanned as above; but the tanning lixivium must not be nearly so strong as that for hides.\n\nLime is used for these soft skins instead of a mixture of gallic lixivium and sulphuric acid, because the acid always swells the leather more or less, and because the lime may be more easily extracted from them, by washing and compressing them, than from the thick hides, which, when limed, are harsh and apt to crack, if the lime be not wholly extracted before they are tanned.\n\nAmong the different methods of immersion which may be practised in the course of these operations, the best way seems to be that of suspending the hides and skins vertically in the lixivia, by means of transverse rods or bars, and at such a distance asunder as not to touch each other in any one point. If they are laid one over the other, they will require frequent handling, in order that all the parts may be equally saturated, and to prevent the folds or plaits that would otherwise be formed in them. In some cases it will be found expedient to mix fresh tan from time to time with the lixivium, which will depend on the state and quality of the hides and skins to be tanned, as well as on the purposes for which they are intended. All these considerations must be left to the judgment of the manufacturer; but they do not change the principle on which this mode of tanning is founded.\n\nMr Desmond affirms, that besides the very great savings in point of time and labour, the leather tanned according to the above method being more completely saturated, will be found to weigh heavier, to wear better, and to be less susceptible of moisture, than the leather tanned in the usual way.\n\nIn explaining the principles on which the several parts of the tanning process depend, we must first remark, that the principal object of tanning is, to combine...\nbine the gelatinous part of the hides with the tanning principle of astringent vegetables as intimately as possible, and thus produce that compound which we call leather, and which is insoluble in water. The chief part of the process therefore consists in steeping the hides in a solution of tannin till they are sufficiently impregnated with the tanning principle; and to this operation the others are subordinated, only as they prepare the hides to be more easily acted on by the tanning principle.\n\nThe infusions of oak bark, when chemically examined, are found to contain two principal substances, one precipitable by solution of gelatine made from glue or isinglass, and this gives a dense black, with solution of common sulphate of iron; the other not precipitable by solution of gelatine, but precipitating the salts of iron of a brownish black, and the salts of tin of a fawn colour.\n\nThe former of these is the tanning principle, or the tannin of Seguin; it is essential to the conversion of skin into leather. The latter is the colouring or extractive matter; it is capable of entering into union with skin, and it gives to it a brown colour; but it does not render it insoluble in boiling water.\n\nIt has been generally supposed that the infusion of oak bark contains a peculiar acid, called gallic acid; but some late experiments render this opinion doubtful; and this principle, if it exists in oak bark, is in intimate combination with the extractive or colouring matter.\n\nIn the common process of tanning, the skin, which is chiefly composed of gelatine, slowly combines in its organized form with the tannin and extractive matter of the infusions of bark; the greater proportion of its increase of weight, however, is owing to tannin, and from this substance the leather derives its characteristic properties; but its colour, and the degree of its flexibility, appear to be influenced by the quantity of colouring matter that it contains. When skin, in large quantity, is subjected to exert its full action on a small portion of infusion of bark, containing tannin and extractive matter, the fluid is found colourless. It gives no precipitation to solution of gelatine, and produces very little effect on the salts of iron or of tin. The tanning principle of oak bark is more soluble in water than the extractive matter; and the relative proportion of tannin to extractive matter is much greater in strong infusions of oak bark than in weak ones; and when strong infusions are used for tanning, a larger proportion of tannin is combined with the matter of skin.\n\nThe state of the skin with regard to its impregnation with tannin may be easily ascertained by cutting it transversely with a sharp knife, as the tanned part will appear of a nutmeg colour, while the unimpregnated part retains its whiteness. Though the impregnation of the skins with tannin be an essential part of the process, something more is required to give the leather its proper degree of strength and pliability. The infusions of oak bark, especially the weaker infusions, contain, besides tannin, more or less of extractive matter, which is absorbed by the skins during the tanning process. Hence it appears, that a solution of tannin alone would not convert the skins into leather; and as concentrated infusions of oak bark contain a less proportional quantity of extractive matter, they are not so well calculated for the purposes of tanning as the weaker infusions. This is an important conclusion, as it shows that the vulgar opinion of tanners respecting the propriety of the old methods, and what they call feeding the leather, is founded on rational principles. In fact it appears that, though, in the quick method, recommended by Seguin and De Mond, the leather may be more expeditiously, and perhaps more completely impregnated with tannin, it is deficient in strength and pliability, from the want of its due proportion of extractive matter.\n\nHaving thus explained the principles on which the material part of the tanning process depends, we must briefly notice the rationale of the preliminary operations.\n\nChaptal has shown, that when skin is immersed in a tanning liquor, without having been previously freed from its cuticle or scarf-skin, the impregnation of tannin takes place only on the flesh side. This shows the necessity, especially in the thicker hides or butts, of removing the cuticle, before steeping the hides in the tanning liquor. The small degree of putrefaction to which the butts are subjected, has this effect, and the steeping of the hides and skins in lime water contributes to the same end; for though lime does not seem to be capable of dissolving the cuticle, it renders it friable, so that it is easily removed by the instruments employed for scraping off the hair. Not only the cuticle, but likewise the soft matter of the extremity of the hair is acted on by lime; and this effect must considerably tend to facilitate the process of depilation. The same substance mixing with the fat on the fleecy side of the skins, forms a foamy compound, which, with other extraneous matter, is removed by the subsequent washings.\n\nIt has been supposed that the acids in which the skins are steeped, previous to their immersion in tanning liquors, have the effect of opening their pores, and thus rendering them more easily penetrable by the tanning principle and extractive matter. We believe that this opinion is erroneous, as we cannot see how acids, the obvious effect of which seems to be that of contracting animal matter, can enlarge the pores of the skins. It is probable that they produce some other advantageous effect not yet sufficiently understood, in preparing the skins for being more perfectly acted on by the tanning liquors.\n\nThe principal effect of the grainer, or the pigeons dung employed in the thinner skins, seems to be that of promoting putrefaction, and rendering the skins less elastic, though the alkali evolved during the fermentation of the dung, may assist in removing the fat on the fleecy side of the skins.\n\nAs from the present great demand, and consequent scarcity of oak timber, oak bark has become a very expensive article, it may be proper to enumerate a few of the principal vegetable substances, especially those indigenous to Great Britain, that may be substituted for it. Of these the bark of the Scotch fir appears to be most deserving of attention, and was some years ago employed by a gentleman in Ireland with great success. Several species of willow afford a good substitute for oak bark, particularly the Leicester willow, of which the entire bark produces a greater quantity of solid extract than the entire bark of oak. Next to these may be mentioned the bark of the common elm, the root of tormentil (Tormentilla vulgaris, Linn.) which has been long employed in the north of Scotland as an article of domestic use.\nTanning mestic tanning. To these may be added the herb avens (geum urbanum, Lin.), several species of cinquefoil, and of bitters, common ladies mantle (alchemilla vulgaris), and the root of the common water-flag (iris pseudacorus, Lin.). Of plants not indigenous to Britain, but generally cultivated here, we may particularly notice the horse-chestnut, the bark of which is a strong astringent, and might be employed, we think, with great advantage in tanning. The most powerful tanning substance, however, with which we are acquainted, is the juice or extract of the mimosa catechu, commonly called Japan earth, one pound of which will tan as much leather as seven or eight pounds of oak bark.\n\nOur limits will not permit us to extend this article, by describing the processes for tanning employed in other countries. On the method pursued in Russia, our readers may consult Tooke's View of the Russian Empire; and of the French method of tanning, an ample account has been given in a publication by De Lalande. Another on the same subject may soon be expected from Chaptal. The most complete work on British tanning, and on other processes to which leather is subjected, with which we are acquainted, is a small volume entitled The Art of Tanning and Currying Leather, published by the Dublin Society in 1780. Several useful papers on this subject may also be found in Nicholson's Philosophical Journal, and Tillock's Philosophical Magazine.\n\nFor an account of other processes connected with the leather manufacture, see Leather and Currying.\n\nTANTALUM, a new metal which has been detected in two minerals. See Mineralogy, p. 250.\n\nTANTALUS, in fabulous history, king of Phrygia and Paphlagonia, was the son of Jupiter and the nymph Plota. He one day entertained the gods at his table; when, to prove their divinity, he served up his son Peleus cut in pieces. All the deities, except Ceres, perceived his cruelty and impiety, and would not touch his provisions. That goddess, whose thoughts were solely employed about her daughter Proserpine, inadvertently ate a part of his left shoulder. Peleus, however, was restored to life; and an ivory shoulder given him in the room of that which had been eaten; while Tantalus was thrown into Tartarus, where he was punished with perpetual hunger and thirst. He was chained in a lake; the water of which reached up to his chin, but retired when he attempted to drink. The branch of a tree loaded with fruit hung down even to his lips, but on his attempting to pluck the fruit the branch sprung upwards.\n\nTANTALUS, a genus of birds belonging to the order of grallae.

See Tanacetum, Botany Index.\n\nTAORMINA, a town in Sicily, which is situated on a high rock, and is 88 miles north of Messina. Of its origin little is known. A colony from the island of Naxos settled at the foot of Etna, at no great distance from the shore, and at about a league or a league and a half from the present situation of Taormina. Dionysius the Tyrant attacked this colony, and either took or set fire to their city. The inhabitants retired to the rocks of Mount Taurus; among which they found a tract of ground sufficiently level and secure, and of sufficient extent. Here, therefore, they built a city; which, after the mountain, they named Tauromenium. It was at length raised to a very flourishing state by trade, and became celebrated as a seat of the arts, the remains of which show that the fine arts must have been once successfully cultivated at Tauromenium.\n\nAmong other remains are still to be seen a spacious theatre, a tomb, and a large natural grotto, which appears to have been anciently adorned within with artificial ornaments. After the inhabitants of Taormina embraced Christianity, they still continued to visit this grotto with devout veneration. Instead of the Pagan divinities to whom it had before been sacred, they substituted a faint, the venerable St Leonard. But St Leonard did not long draw crowds to this grotto; and the Christians have either defaced its Pagan decorations, or suffered them to fall into decay by the injuries of time. It is now black and smoky; and it is with difficulty that any remains of the Greek paintings with which it was once ornamented can be distinguished.\n\nTAPE-WORM. See Taenia, Helminthology Index.\n\nTAPER, TAPERING, is understood of a piece of timber, or the like, when thick at one end, and gradually diminishing to the other; as is the case in pyramids, cones, &c.\n\nTo measure TAPER-Timber, &c. See Sliding Rule.\n\nTaper-Bored, is applied to a piece of ordnance when it is wider at the mouth than towards the breech.\n\nTaper, also denotes a kind of tall wax candle, placed in a candlestick, and burnt at funeral processions, and in other church solemnities.\n\nTapers are made of different sizes; in some places, as Italy, &c. they are cylindrical; but in most other countries, as England, France, &c. they are conical or taper; whence possibly the name; unless we rather choose to derive taper, in the adjective sense from the substantive taper, in the Saxon tapen or tapon, cervex, \"wax-candle.\" Both kinds are pierced at bottom for a pin in the candlestick to enter.—There are two ways of making tapers, the first with the ladle, the second by hand; for which, see Candle.\n\nPafchal Taper, among the Romanists, is a large taper, whereon the deacon applies five bits of frankincense, in holes made for the purpose in form of a cross; and which he lights with new fire in the ceremony of Easter Saturday.\n\nThe Pontifical makes Pope Zosimus the author of this usage; but Baronius will have it more ancient, and quotes a hymn of Prudentius to prove it. That pope supposes to have only established the use thereof in parish churches, which, till then, had been retrained to greater churches.\n\nF. Papebroch explains the original of the pafchal taper more distinctly, in his Conatus Chronico-Historicus, &c. It seems, though the council of Nice regulated the day whereon Easter was to be celebrated, it laid it on the patriarch of Alexandria to make a yearly canon thereof, and to send it to the pope. As all the other moveable feasts were to be regulated by that of Easter, a catalogue of them was made every year; and this was written on a taper, cervex, which was blessed in the church with much solemnity.\nThis taper, according to the abbot Chastelain, was not a wax-candle made to be burnt; it had no wick, nor was it anything more than a kind of column of wax, made on purpose to write the list of moveable feasts on; and which would suffice to hold that list for the space of a year.\n\nFor among the ancients, when any thing was to be written to last for ever, they engraved it on marble or steel; when it was to last a long while, they wrote it on Egyptian paper; and when it was only to last a short time, they contented themselves to write it on wax. In process of time they came to write the moveable feasts on paper, but they still fastened it to the paschal taper. Such is the original of the benediction of the paschal taper.\n\nTAPESTRY, a kind of cloth made of wool and silk, adorned with figures of different animals, &c. and formerly used for lining the walls of rooms, churches, &c.\n\nThe art of weaving tapestry is supposed to have been borrowed from the Saracens; accordingly the workmen employed in this manufacture in France were formerly called Sarazins or Sarazinois. Guicciardini ascribes the invention of tapestry hangings to the inhabitants of the Netherlands; but he has not mentioned at what time the discovery was made. This art was brought into England by William Sheldon, near the end of Henry VIII.'s reign. In 1619 a manufacture was established at Mortlake in Surrey by Sir Francis Crane, who received 2000l. from King James to encourage the design.\n\nThe first manufacture of tapestry at Paris was set up under Henry IV. in 1626 or 1627, by several artists whom that monarch invited from Flanders. Under Louis XIV., the manufacture of the Gobelins was instituted, which has introduced very beautiful cloths, remarkable for strength, for elegance of design, and a happy choice of colours. The finest paintings are copied, and eminent painters have been employed in making designs for the work.\n\nTapestry-work is distinguished by the workmen into two kinds, viz. that of high and that of low warp; though the difference is rather in the manner of working than in the work itself; which is in effect the same in both: only the looms, and consequently the warps, are differently situated; those of the low warp being placed flat and parallel to the horizon, and those of the high warp erected perpendicularly. The English anciently excelled all the world in the tapestry of the high warp; and they still retain their former reputation, though with some little change: their low warps are still admired; but as for the high ones, they are quite laid aside by the French. The French, before the revolution, had three considerable tapestry manufactures besides that of the Gobelins; the first at Aubusson in Auvergne, the second at Felletin in the Upper Marche, and the third at Beauvais. They were all equally established for the high and the low warp; but they had all laid aside the high warp excepting the Gobelins. There were admirable low warps likewise in Flanders, generally exceeding those of France; the chief and almost only Flemish manufactures were at Brussels, Antwerp, Oudenarde, Lille, Tournay, Bruges, and Valenciennes; but of the state of these manufactures now we are ignorant.\n\nThe usual widths of tapestry are from two ells to three ells Paris measure.\n\nThe Manufacture of Tapestry of the High Warp.—The loom on which it is wrought is placed perpendicularly: it consists of four principal pieces; two long planks or cheeks of wood, and two thick rollers or beams. The planks are set upright, and the beams across them, one at the top and the other at the bottom, or about a foot distance from the ground. They have each their trunnions, by which they are suspended on the planks, and are turned with bars. In each roller is a groove, from one end to the other, capable of containing a long round piece of wood, fastened therein with hooks. The use of it is to tie the ends of the warp to. The warp, which is a kind of worsted, or twisted woolen thread, is wound on the upper roller; and the work, as fast as woven, is wound on the lower. Within the planks, which are seven or eight feet high, fourteen or fifteen inches broad, and three or four thick, are holes pierced from top to bottom, in which are put thick pieces of iron, with hooks at one end serving to fasten the coat-flaye: these pieces of iron have also holes pierced, by putting a pin in which the flaye is drawn nearer or set farther off; and thus the coats or threads are stretched or loosened at pleasure. The coat-flaye is about three inches diameter, and runs all the length of the loom; on this are fixed the coats or threads, which make the threads of the warp cross each other. It has much the same effect here as the spring-flaye and treadles have in the common looms. The coats are little threads fastened to each thread of the warp with a kind of sliding knot, which forms a sort of mesh or ring. They serve to keep the warp open for the passage of branches wound with silks, woollens, or other matters used in the piece of tapestry. In the last place, there are a number of little sticks of different lengths, but all about an inch in diameter, which the workman keeps by him in baskets, to serve to make the threads of the warp cross each other, by passing them across; and, that the threads thus crossed may retain their proper situation, a packthread is run among the threads above the stick.\n\nThe loom being thus formed, and mounted with its warp, the first thing the workman does is to draw on the threads of this warp the principal lines and strokes of the design to be represented on the piece of tapestry; which is done by applying cartoons made from the painting he intends to copy to the side that is to be the wrong side of the piece, and then, with a black lead pencil, following and tracing out the contours thereof on the thread of the right side; so that the strokes appear equally both before and behind.\n\nAs for the original design the work is to be finished by, it is hung up behind the workmen, and wound on a long staff, from which a piece is unrolled from time to time as the work proceeds.\n\nBesides the loom, &c. here described, there are three other principal instruments required for working the silk or the wool of the woof within the threads of the warp; these are a broach, a reed, and an iron needle. The broach is made of a hard wood, seven or eight inches long, and two-thirds of an inch thick, ending in a point with a little handle. This serves as a shuttle; the silks, woollens, gold, or silver, to be used in the work.\nTapestry work being wound on it. The reed or comb is also of wood, eight or nine inches long, and an inch thick on the back, whence it grows less and less to the extremity of the teeth, which are more or less apart, according to the greater or less degree of fineness of the intended work. Lastly, the needle is made in form of the common needle, only bigger and longer. Its use is to press close the wool and silks when there is any line or colour that does not fit well.\n\nAll things being prepared for the work, and the workman ready to begin, he places himself on the wrong side of the piece, with his back towards the design; so that he works as it were blindfold, seeing nothing of what he does, and being obliged to quit his post, and go to the other side of the loom whenever he would view and examine the piece, to correct it with his pressing-needle. To put silk, &c., in the warp, he first turns and looks at the design; then, taking a broach full of the proper colour, he places it among the threads of the warp, which he brings across each other with his fingers, by means of the coats or threads fastened to the staff; this he repeats every time he is to change his colour. Having placed the silk or wool, he beats it with his reed or comb; and when he has thus wrought in several rows over each other, he goes to see the effects they have, in order to reform the contours with his needle, if there be occasion. As the work advances, it is rolled upon the lower beam, and they unroll as much warp from the upper beam as suffices them to continue the piece; like they do of the design behind them. When the pieces are wide, several workmen may be employed at once.\n\nWe have but two things to add: the first is, that the high warp tapestry goes on much more slowly than the low warp, and takes up almost twice the time and trouble. The second is, that all the difference that the eye can perceive between the two kinds, consists in this, that in the low warp there is a red fillet, about one-twelfth of an inch broad, running on each side from top to bottom, which is wanting in the high warp.\n\nManufacture of Tapestry of the Low Warp.—The loom or frame, whereon the low warp is wrought, is much like that of the weavers; the principal parts thereof are two strong pieces of wood forming the sides of the loom, and bearing a beam or roller at each end: they are sustained at bottom with other strong pieces of wood in manner of trestles; and, to keep them the firmer, they are likewise fastened to the floor with a kind of buttresses, which prevent any shaking, though there are sometimes four or five workmen leaning on the fore-beam at once.\n\nThe rollers have each their trunnions, by which they are sustained: they are turned by large iron pins three feet long. Along each beam runs a groove, wherein is placed the wish, a piece of wood of about two inches diameter, and almost of the length of the roller: this piece fills the groove entirely, and is fastened therein, from space to space, by wooden pins. To the two wishes are fastened the two extremities of the warp, which is wound on the farther roller, and the work, as it advances, on the nearer.\n\nAcross the two sides, almost in the middle of the loom, passes a wooden bar, which sustains little pieces of wood, not unlike the beam of a balance: to these pieces are fastened strings, which bear certain spring slaves, whereby the workman, by means of two treddles under the loom whereon he sets his feet, gives a motion to the coats, and makes the threads of the warp rise and fall alternately. Each loom has more or fewer of these spring-slaves, and each staff more or fewer coats, as the tapestry consists of more or fewer threads.\n\nThe design or painting the tapestry-man is to follow is placed underneath the warp; where it is sustained from space to space with strings, by means of which the design is brought nearer the warp.\n\nThe loom being mounted, there are two instruments used in working it, viz. the reed and the flute. The flute does the office of the weaver's shuttle; it is made of hard polished wood, three or four lines thick at the ends, and somewhat more in the middle, and three or four inches long. On it are wound the silks or other matters to be used as the woof of the tapestry. The comb or reed is of wood or ivory; it has usually teeth on both sides; it is about an inch thick in the middle, but diminishes each way to the extremity of the teeth: it serves to beat the threads of the woof close to each other, as fast as the workman has passed and placed them with his flute among the threads of the warp.\n\nThe workman is seated on a bench before the loom, with his breast against the beam, only a cushion or pillow between them; and, in this posture, separating, with his fingers, the threads of the warp, that he may see the design underneath, and taking a flute, mounted with a proper colour, he passes it among the threads, after having raised or lowered them, by means of the treddles moving the spring-slaves and coats.\n\nLastly, To press and close the threads of the silk or yarn, &c., thus placed, he strikes each course (i.e. what the flute leaves in its passing and coming back again) with the reed.\n\nTAPIOCA, a species of starch, which the Brazilians make from the roots of the caffada plant.

It is prepared in great quantities in Norway, Sweden, Germany, Russia, and North America, and in other countries where the pine and fir abound.\n\nBecher, the celebrated chemist, first proposed to make tar from pit-coal. Manufactures for this purpose have been established many years ago in the bishopric of Liege, and in several parts of England. In the year 1781, the earl of Dundonald obtained a patent for extracting tar from pit-coal by a new process of distillation. Great hopes were entertained of the value of this discovery, but we have not heard that it has answered expectation.\n\nTar, which is well known for its economical uses, is properly an empyreumatic oil of turpentine, and has been much\nmuch used as a medicine both internally and externally.

See BOTANY Index.\n\nTARGUM, a name given to the Chaldee paraphrases of the books of the Old Testament. They are called paraphrases or expositions, because they are rather comments and explications than literal translations of the text. They are written in the Chaldee tongue, which became familiar to the Jews after the time of their captivity in Babylon, and was more known to them than the Hebrew itself. So that when the Hebrew text was read in the synagogue, or in the temple, they generally added to it an explication in the Chaldee tongue for the service of the people, who had but a very imperfect knowledge of the Hebrew tongue. It is probable, that even from the time of Ezra this custom began, since this learned scribe, reading the law to the people in the temple, explained it, with the other priests that were with him, to make it understood by the people (Nehem. viii. 7—9.).\n\nBut though the custom of making these sorts of expositions in the Chaldee language be very ancient among the Hebrews, yet have they no written paraphrases or targums before the era of Onkelos and Jonathan, who lived about the time of our Saviour. Jonathan is placed about 32 years before Christ, under the reign of Herod the Great. Onkelos is something more modern. The Targum of Onkelos is the most of all esteemed, and copies are to be found in which it is inserted verse for verse with the Hebrew. It is so short and so simple, that it cannot be suspected of being corrupted. This paraphrase wrote only upon the books of Moses; and his style approaches nearly to the purity of the Chaldee, as it is found in Daniel and Ezra. This targum is quoted in the Mishna, but was not known either to Eusebius, St Jerome, or Origen.\n\nThe Targum of Jonathan son of Uziel is upon the greater and lesser prophets. He is much more diffuse than Onkelos, and especially upon the lesser prophets, where he takes great liberties, and runs on in allegories. His style is pure enough, and approaches pretty near to the Chaldee of Onkelos. It is thought that the Jewish doctors who lived above 700 years after him made some additions to him.\n\nThe Targum of Joseph the Blind is upon the Hagiographa. This author is much more modern, and less esteemed than those we have now mentioned. He has written upon the Psalms, Job, the Proverbs, the Canticles, Ecclesiastes, Ruth, and Esther. His style is a very corrupt Chaldee, with a great mixture of words from foreign languages.\n\nThe Targum of Jerusalem is only upon the Pentateuch; nor is that entire or perfect. There are whole verses wanting, others transposed, others mutilated; which has made many of opinion that this only is a fragment of some ancient paraphrase that is now lost. There is no targum upon Daniel, or upon the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.\n\nThese targums are of great use for the better understanding not only of the Old Testament, on which they are written, but also of the New. As to the Old Testament, they serve to vindicate the genuineness of the present Hebrew text, by proving it to be the same that was in use when these targums were made, contrary to the opinion of those who think the Jews corrupted it after our Saviour's time. They help to explain many words and phrases in the Hebrew original, and they hand down to us many of the ancient customs of the Jews. And some of them, with the phraseologies, idioms, and peculiar forms of speech, which we find in them, do in many instances help as much for the better illustration and better understanding of the New Testament as of the Old; the Jerusalem Chaldee dialect, in which they are written, being the vulgar language of the Jews in our Saviour's time. They also very much serve the Christian cause against the Jews, by interpreting many of the prophecies of the Messiah in the Old Testament in the same manner as the Christians do. Many influences are produced to this purpose by Dr Prideaux in his Connexion of the Hist. of the Old and New Testament, vol. iv. p. 777, &c.\n\nThese targums are published in the second edition of the great Hebrew Bible set forth at Basle by Buxtorf the father, anno 1610; for he has rectified the Chaldee text, and reformed the vowel pointings in it; the targums having at first been written without vowel points, which were afterwards added very erroneously by some Jews.\nTARIF, a table containing the names of different sorts of merchandise, with the duties to be paid as settled among trading nations.\n\nTARPA, STURIO MECIUS, a Latin critic in the time of Julius Caesar and Augustus.

The whole country is usually divided into Western Tartary, and Eastern or Chinese Tartary, of which the former includes Western Turkistan, Kharifin, and Great Bucharia; while the latter comprehends the country of the Monguls and the Monghurs, now both subject to Russia, and Little Bucharia. The geography of several parts of this extensive tract has already been considered under the articles BUCHARIA, CHINA, and RUSSIA, and we shall here confine ourselves to that which is now commonly known by the name of Independent Tartary, by which we understand that extent of country now possessed by the Kirghifies, and the Ufbeck Tartars, including the Kharifin, and Great and Little Bucharia.\n\nIndependent Tartary thus defined, extends from the Caspian sea on the west to the mountains of Belur on the east, a space of about 870 British miles, and from the mountains of Gaur in the south, to the southern boundaries of the Russian empire on the north, including nearly 1,300 British miles. About half of this extent is occupied by the Kirghifies to the north, and the Ufbeck to the south.\n\nThe country of the Kirghifies is separated from Siberia by the great steppe or desert of Isthm, an extensive plain intersected by a river of the same name, and abounding with lakes of salt and bitter waters. Even the soil of this steppe is in many places impregnated with salt and nitre, though in several spots the soil is by no means unfruitful. There are no towns, as the inhabitants dwell wholly in tents.\n\nThe Kirghifies have been long divided into three principal hordes, called the great, middle, and lesser. Of these, the two latter are now regarded as subjects of the Russian empire, though they seem by no means to be dependent on that power. The great horde, defended by mountains on the south and east, are properly independent. This last horde is supposed to contain about 60,000 families, while the lesser and middle hordes are said to comprehend each about half that number. The whole population is computed at about 500,000.\n\nThe Kirghifies have gradually moved from the east towards the west. Their manners are described at considerable length by Pallas. Their tents are of a sort of felt; their drink kumis, made of acidulated mare's milk. The great horde is considered as the source of the other two. Being settled near the mountains of Alak, or Ala Tau, this horde has been called the Alatian Kirghifies. They lead a wandering life, from the borders of the Upper Sir, near Tashkund, to the steppe of Isthm. Each horde has its particular khan; but the middle horde, when Pallas visited this country, was contented with a prince, who seemed to acknowledge the khan of the lesser horde; and in 1777, this khan was called Nur Hali, an equitable prince. Their features are Tartaric, with flat nose and small eyes, but not oblique like those of the Monguls and Chinese. They have horses, camels, cattle, sheep, and goats. Some individuals of the middle horde, it is said, had 10,000 horses, 300 camels, 4000 cattle, 20,000 sheep, and upwards of 2000 goats; while in the lesser horde were proprietors of 5000 horses, and a proportional number of the other animals. Their dromedaries furnish a considerable quantity of woolly hair, sold to the Russians and Bucharians, being annually clipped like that of sheep. Their chief food is mutton; and the lamb is so exquisite, that it is sent from Orenburg to St. Petersburg for the tables of the palace. The lamb skins are the most celebrated next to those of Bucharia; but the wool of the sheep is coarse, and used only for domestic purposes, for felts and thick cloths. The steppes supply them with objects of the chase, wolves, foxes, marmots, antelopes, &c. In the southern and eastern mountains are found wild sheep, the ox of Tibet, which seems to delight in snowy alps; with chacals, tigers, and wild asses.\n\nAs the Kirghifies regard each other as brethren, they are obliged to employ slaves who are captives taken in their incursions. Their dress consists of close veils, large trousers and pointed boots. The ladies adorn their heads with the necks of herons, disposed like horns. They appear to be Mahometans, but have a more relaxed creed.\n\nThe Kirghifies carry on some trade with Russia. The chief traffic is at Orenburg, and wholly by exchange; but the middle horde proceed to Omsk. About 150,000 sheep are annually brought to Orenburg, with horses, cattle, lamb skins, camel wool, and sometimes slaves.\nslaves. In return they take manufactured articles, chiefly clothes and furniture. From Bucharia, Khiva, and Tashkund, they receive arms and coats-of-mail, which Russia refuses, in return for camels and cattle. They are extremely fond of the Kalmyk women, who long retain their charms; and often marry them if they will adopt the Mahometan religion. They have an annual festival in honour of the dead. About the beginning of the 17th century this people, who were formerly Shamanists, became children of circumcision, by the exertions of the priests of Turkistan.\n\nThe country of the Uzbek Tartars includes Kharifin and part of Great Bucharia. The former of these extends from the river Gihon to the Caspian sea, and is bounded on the north and east by vast deserts. Its length is about 400 British miles, and its breadth rather less than 350. The chief town is Khiva, besides which there are five walled cities or towns, within half a day's journey of each other. The khan is absolute, and independent of any but the high priest, or lama, by whom he is controlled. The Kieviniski Tartars differ little from the Kirghifies, but surpass even them in treachery. Their manners are nearly the same, except that the Kirghifies live in tents, while the others inhabit cities and villages. Their only trade is with Bokhara and Persia; whither they carry cattle, furs, and hides, which they procure from the Kirghifies and Turkoman Tartars. The place itself produces little more than cotton, lamb furs, of a bad quality, and some raw silk; part of which they manufacture. The town of Khiva stands on a rising ground, with three gates, and a strong thick wall of earth much higher than the houses, with turrets at small distances, and a broad deep ditch full of water. It occupies a large space, and commands a pleasant prospect; but the houses are built with mud, having flat roofs covered with earth. It is 17 days journey from the Caspian sea, and 33 from Orenburg, allowing 40 versts to the day's journey.\n\nThe people of Khiva bring to Orenburg large quantities of raw cotton; but the coasts of the Caspian are held by some remains of Turkomans in the north, and by Uzbeks in the south. A considerable trade is carried on with Mangulik. As the merchants of Khiva brought gold and gems to Astrakhan, probably from the two Bucharias, it was suggested to Peter the Great that these products were found in Kharifin, in consequence of which he attempted a settlement. But the Russians, to the number of 3000, were cut off by the Uzbeks.\n\nGreat Bucharia, by far the most important part of Independent Tartary, extends for about 700 British miles in length from north to south, by a medial breadth of about 350; being bounded on the north by the mountains of Argun, and divided from Kharifin and Corazan by the river Amu, and extensive deserts, while on the south and east it has for its boundaries the mountains of Gaur and of Beber.\n\nThe chief city of Great Bucharia is Samarcand, on the southern bank of the river Sogd. The other places of note are Bokhara on the same river, Balk on the river Dehali, Zout, and Kotkan.\n\nThe face of the country presents a great variety, abounding with rivers, hills, and mountains, but being in general deficient in wood. Near the rivers the soil is very productive, the grass sometimes exceeding the height of a man; and in some parts much industry is shown in the cultivation of rice and other grain.\n\nThe rivers are, the Amu and Sirr. Besides the sea of Aral, already described under that head, there are several considerable lakes, particularly that of Palkai, Tongis, or Balcah, being about 140 miles long by 70 broad.\n\n\"In all the regions of the earth,\" says Sir William Ouseley, \"there is not a more flourishing or a more delightful country than this, especially the district of Bokhara. If a person stand on the Kohendis (or ancient castle) of Bokhara, and cast his eyes around, he shall not see anything but beautiful and luxuriant verdure on every side of the country; so that he would imagine the green of the earth and the azure of the heavens were united; and as there are green fields in every quarter, so there are villas interspersed among the green fields. The Sogd, for eight days' journey, is all delightful country, affording fine prospects, and full of gardens, and orchards, and villages, corn fields, and villages, running streams, reservoirs, and fountains, both on the right hand and on the left. You pass from corn fields into rich meadows and pasture lands; and the straits of Sogd are the finest in the world.\"\n\nThe religion of the Uzbeks and Bucharians is the Mahometan of the Sunni sect, and the government of the Tartars, the khans is despotic. There are no accounts to be met with of the state of the population, but it is believed that on any emergency they could muster an army of 100,000. The revenue of these fertile provinces is not certainly known, though that of Corafan is said to amount to half a million sterling annually, and it is probable that the revenue of Great Bucharia is at least equal to that of Corafan.\n\nBesides the caravans to Persia, Hindostan, and China, some trade is carried on with the Russians; the Bucharian merchants not only furnishing their own products, but others from the eastern countries to which they trade.\n\nThe manners and customs of the Uzbeks are similar to those of the other Tartars; but they are supposed to be the most spirited and industrious of these barbarians. Though many reside in tents in the summer, yet in winter they inhabit the towns and villages. They are accustomed to make sudden incursions into the Persian provinces. The native Bucharians are comparatively fair, and correspond in form and features with those of Little Bucharia. The Bucharians never bear arms. The Uzbeks, on the contrary, are no strangers to the use of the musket, and it is said that even their women are not averse to warfare. The language is Turkish, but that of the Bucharians has never been investigated, though it be probably a dialect of the Persian. Their literature would furnish an ample theme, Samarcard having been a celebrated school of oriental science, cultivated even by monarchs, as Ulug Beg and others.\n\n\"Such are the generosity and liberality of the inhabitants, that no one (says Sir William Ouseley) turns aside from the rites of hospitality; so that a person contemplating them in this light, would imagine that all the families of the land were but one house. When a traveller arrives there, every person endeavours to attract him to himself, that he may have opportunities of performing kind offices for the stranger; and the best proof of their hospitable and generous disposition is that every...\"\nevery peasant, though possessing but a bare sufficiency, allows a portion of his cottage for the reception of a guest. On the arrival of a stranger they contend one with another for the pleasure of taking him to their home, and entertaining him. Thus, in acts of hospitality, they exceed their incomes. I happened once to be in Sogd, and there I saw a certain palace, or great building, the doors of which were fastened back with nails against the walls. I asked the reason of this, and they informed me that it was a hundred years and more since those doors had been shut; all that time they had continued open day and night; strangers might arrive there at the most unreasonable hours, or in any numbers, for the master of the house had provided everything necessary both for the men and for their beasts; and he appeared with a delighted and joyful countenance when the guests tarried a while.\n\nFor a more particular account of the manners and customs of the Tartars, see the articles Bukhara and Kalmuks; Pallas's Travels in the Southern Provinces of the Russian Empire, and Tooke's View of the Russian Empire. An account of the Bashkirs, also a tribe of wandering Tartars, and of the Tartars of the Crimea, has been given under Russia.\n\nWe cannot here enter on the history of Tartary.

He was the son of Bernardo Tasso, and of Portia de Roffi, a lady of an illustrious family of Naples.\n\nAt three years of age Tasso was committed by his father to the care of Angeluzza, a man of great learning, who at this tender age, it is said, began to teach him grammar; at four he was sent to the Jesuits college, and at seven was well acquainted with Latin and Greek. At the age of 12 he went from Rome to Mantua, where his father had entered into the service of the duke Guglielmo Gonzaga; he had then completed his knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages; he was well acquainted with rhetoric and poetry, and matter of Aristotle's Ethics. He was soon after sent to the university of Padua; and at 18, published his Rinaldo, a poem on the plan of Homer's Odyssey. This extended his fame through all Italy; but his father went to Padua, to remonstrate against his apparent purpose of giving himself up to philosophy and poetry, and made use of many harsh expressions, which Tasso heard with great patience. \"Of what use is that philosophy on which you value yourself so much?\" \"It has enabled me (replied Tasso) to endure the harshness of your reproofs.\"\n\nHe soon after went to Bologna, by the invitation of the city and college; but in a short time he returned to Padua at the urgent desire of Scipio Gonzaga, who had been elected prince of the academy established in that city under the name of the Aetherium. In this retreat he formed the design of his Jerusalem Delivered, invented the fable, disputed the parts, and determined to dedicate it to the house of Este; and being pressed to reside at Ferrara, he gave his consent. The duke of Ferrara gave him an apartment in his palace, where he lived in peace and affluence, and prosecuted his work, which he determined to dedicate to the duke, and which was published book by book, as he finished them.\n\nAt the age of 30 he finished his Jerusalem, and the whole was reprinted and published together, the success of which was astonishing. It was translated into Latin, French, Spanish, and even the oriental languages, almost as soon as it appeared. Soon after the publication of his Jerusalem he lost his father, who had been appointed governor of Oria on the Po by the duke of Mantua; and a pretended friend to Tasso, belonging to Ferrara, to whom he had inadvertently committed some transactions of a very delicate nature concerning his patron the duke, had the perfidy to betray him. This coming to the ears of the duke, he shut up Tasso in prison, from which, however, he found means to escape, after a year's confinement, and retired to Turin, being then about 34 years of age, and was recommended to the duke of Savoy, who showed him many marks of esteem and regard. Fearing, however, that he might be delivered up to the duke of Mantua, he secretly retired to Rome, and went directly to his friend Maurizio Cattaneo, by whom he was received with great kindness, and his presence made the whole city rejoice. Here he endeavoured to make his peace with the duke, and was fortunate enough to succeed.\n\nAfter this he lived at Mantua about a year, in great favour with the prince; but growing weary of a state of dependence, he resolved to go to Naples, and endeavour to recover his mother's jointure, which had been seized by her relations; but as this law suit had no appearance of being soon determined, he went from Naples to Rome, where he continued about a year, in high favour with Pope Sextus Quintus, and then went to Florence, at the earnest desire of Ferdinando, grand duke of Tuscany, who had been cardinal at Rome when Tasso first resided there.\n\nHaving spent another year at Florence, he returned to Naples, where he corrected his Jerusalem Delivered. Cardinal Cynthio, who was a great patron of learning and genius, and knew Tasso when he first resided at Rome, prevailed with him once more to leave his retreat at Naples and live with him in that city, where he continued till he was 50, and then returned to Naples to prosecute his law suit, from which place, however, he was soon recalled; and being introduced to the pope, his holiness said, \"that his merit would confer as much honour on the laurel he was about to receive, as the laurel had formerly conferred on others.\"\n\nIt happened that while they waited for fair weather, for the purpose of celebrating the solemnity of Tasso's coronation with laurel, that great poet took his last illness, and died on the 1st day of his sickness, aged 51. His poems have acquired him an immortal reputation, the chief of which are, 1. Jerusalem Delivered. 2. Jerusalem Conquered. 3. Rinaldo. 4. The Seven Days of the Creation. 5. The Tragedy of Torimond.\nTaste. 6. Aminta, &c. All his works were printed together at Florence in 1724, in 6 vols. folio, with the pieces for and against his Jerusalem Delivered.\n\nTASTE, a certain sensation excited in the mind by certain bodies, which are called *sapid*, applied to the tongue and palate, and moistened with saliva. This is the original and proper meaning of the word *taste* (see *Metaphysics*, No. 46); but as the qualities of bodies which produce these sensations are unknown, they have got the names of the sensations themselves, by substituting the cause for the effect. Tastes have been divided into simple and compound, and philosophers have endeavoured to ascertain the number of each species. Attempts have likewise been made to determine from their tastes the effects of different substances on the human body, taken into the stomach as food or physic; but by stating the results of such inquiries, we should be more likely to mislead than to communicate useful information.\n\nTASTE is likewise used in a figurative sense, to denote that faculty by which we perceive whatever is beautiful or sublime in the works of nature or of art. This faculty relishes some things, is disgusted with others, and to many is indifferent. It has also been called an internal sense, and by one philosopher, a reflex sense, while others have considered it as the joint exertion of perception and judgement in some cases, and as a play of the imagination in others.\n\nTo decide among these different opinions, it will be necessary to ascertain, if we can, what are the objects of this faculty. Scarlet, blue, green, and yellow, are all beautiful colours, and a cube and a sphere are beautiful figures; but it does not appear to us, that a man could be said to have either a good or a bad taste for relishing the perception of a scarlet more than that of a yellow colour, or a spherical more than a cubical figure.\n\nWith respect to the objects of the external sense, we are so constituted by nature as to relish those kinds of food which are most wholesome, and such a taste is justly said to be found and uncorrupted. It is in the highest perfection too at first, for it depends not on culture of any kind, and is incapable of improvement. The reverence is the same with respect to internal taste. Every voice, it is true, unites in applauding elegance, simplicity, spirit in writing, and in blaming affectation, or a false brilliancy; but when critics come to particulars, this seeming unanimity vanishes. Perhaps no man ever beheld the rising or setting sun without feeling emotions of pleasure; yet it is certain that the emotions of the clown are not the same, at least in degree, with those of the philosopher. Any beautiful object presented to the eye, gives a pleasing sensation to the mind; and it appears to us that the clown feels nothing more than a mere sensation from the view of the rising sun, similar to what he would feel from a blazing heath. In poetry and painting the vulgar are always delighted with the melody of the verse, and the brilliancy of the colours, and think of nothing else as beauties.\n\nIf this be so, the pleasures which the vulgar derive from what are called objects of taste, are mere gratifications of the senses; but very different is the pleasure which the man of cultivated taste derives from the beauties of nature or of art. The mere sensation of the clown is followed by a train of ideas which hurries him beyond the object before him to its beneficent effects and its Almighty Creator.\n\nThe nature of any person's taste, therefore, is generally determined from the character of his imagination and the soundness of his judgement. The simple perception of the object we find is insufficient to excite these emotions, unless it is accompanied with this operation of mind. Thus, when we feel the beauty or sublimity of natural scenery, we are conscious of a variety of images in our minds, very different from those which the objects themselves can present to the eye.\n\nIf the mind is in such a state as to prevent this freedom of imagination, the emotion is not perceived. In so far as the beauties of nature or art affect the external senses, their effect is the same on every man who is in possession of these senses. But to a man in pain or in grief, the same scene will not produce any feeling of admiration, which at other times would have produced it in perfection.\n\nThere are many objects of taste which produce not their full effect on the imagination, but through the medium of the judgement. The beauty of the Farme Hercules is one kind of beauty; that of the gladiators in the palace of Chigi, another; and that of the Apollo Belvidere a third. Each of these figures is acknowledged to be perfect in its kind; but according to Sir Joshua Reynolds, the highest perfection of the human figure is not to be found but in that form which might be taken from them all, and which would partake of the activity of the gladiator, of the delicacy of the Apollo, and of the muscular strength of the Hercules. In this view the perfection of these statues consists in something which being perceived by the eye, is referred by the understanding to what we know of the characters of Hercules, Apollo, and the gladiator, and which we suppose it was the intention of the statuaries to express. There are besides, objects of which taste is sometimes said to judge, though they have little or no effect whatever on the imagination. A book of abstract science, written in a prolix and intricate style, may be said to be in a bad taste; and had Swift, in his clear and simple style, written an Essay on the Human Understanding, his work, supposing him master of the subject, would undoubtedly have displayed more taste than Locke's, in which the terms are sometimes vague, and the period often encumbered. This is the case of Berkeley, who is admitted by all to have been a writer of good taste, though neither the Principles of Human Knowledge, the Dialogues on Matter, nor the Minute Philosopher, is capable of affording pleasure, either to the senses or the imagination. His beauty consists merely in the perspicuity of his style, of which the understanding alone is the judge. The metaphysical writings of Dr Reid possess in an eminent degree the same beauty; and no man of true taste can read them without admiring the elegant simplicity of the composition as much as the strength of the reasoning, and feeling from the whole a pleasure which the poetical style of Shaftesbury cannot communicate.\n\nIf this be a just account of the pleasures of taste, that faculty cannot be properly considered as a mere internal sense, since to its enjoyments a well-floured fancy is necessary in some cases, and the reasoning power in all; and the poet and the painter who wished to excel in their\ntheir respective professions, must not content themselves, the one with filling the ear of the reader with mellifluous sounds, and the other with dazzling or deceiving the eye of the spectator by the brilliancy of his colours, but both must strive for fame by captivating the imagination; whilst the architect, who aspires to a similar celebrity, must make the purpose of his ornaments obvious to every person capable of judging. The landscapes of Claude Lorrain, the music of Handel, and poetry of Milton, excite feeble emotions in our minds, when our attention is confined to the qualities they present to our senses, or when it is to such qualities of their composition that we turn our regard. It is then only we feel the sublimity or beauty of their productions, when our imaginations are kindled by their power, when we lose ourselves amid the number of images that pass before our minds, and when we waken at last from this play of fancy as from the charm of a romantic dream.\n\nIt is well observed by Sir Joshua Reynolds* that delivered at tafte is sometimes praised in such terms by orators and poets, who call it inspiration, and a gift from heaven, that though a student by such praise may have his attention roused, and a desire excited of obtaining this gift, he is more likely to be deterred than encouraged in the pursuit of his object. \"He examines his own mind, and perceives there nothing of that divine inspiration with which he is told so many others have been favoured. He never travelled to heaven to gather new ideas; and he finds himself possessed of no other qualifications than what mere common observation and a plain understanding are able to confer. Thus he becomes gloomy amidst the splendour of figurative declamation, and thinks it hopeless to pursue an object which he supposes out of the reach of human industry. But on this, as on many other occasions, we ought to distinguish how much is to be given to enthusiasm, and how much to common sense; taking care not to lose in terms of vague admiration that solidity and truth of principle upon which alone we can reason.\" Whoever possesses the ordinary powers of perception, sensibility of heart, good sense, and an imagination capable of being roused by the striking objects of nature and of art, may, without inspiration, become, by mere experience, a man of fine taste in the objects of which he aspires to be a critical judge.\n\nThis being the case, we may easily account for the variety of tastes which prevail among men, not only as individuals but as nations. We have already mentioned the difference in one instance between the European taste and the African respecting female beauty; and we may now affirm, as we hope to prove our affirmation, that the one taste is equally correct with the other. The charms of female beauty exist not in the mere external form and colour considered by themselves (for then the inanimate statue of the Venus de Medicis would give more delight to the European beholder than the finest woman that ever lived); but we associate external beauty with sweetness of disposition, and with all the train of endearments which take place in the union of the sexes; and it is this association which delights the man of taste, as giving refinement to an appetite which itself is gross and sensual. A similar association must be formed in the breast of the African who has any taste; and as he never knew feminine softness, or any of the endearing qualities of the sex, but as united with thick lips, a flat nose, a black skin, and woolly hair—a fable beauty of that description must excite in his breast the same emotions that are excited in the breast of an European by the fair woman with Grecian features.\n\nBut is there not an ideal or perfect beauty of the human form? There certainly is, as of every other natural object; but it cannot be the same in Europe as in Africa, unless to a Being who is acquainted with all the peculiarities of form, national and individual, that are to be found among the inhabitants of the whole earth. It has been supposed, and we think completely proved, by one of the best writers that we have on the philosophy of taste*, that the sublimity or beauty of forms Mr. Atterfies altogether from the associations we connect with them, or the qualities of which they are expressive to us. The qualities expressed by the male and female forms are very different; and we would by no means think the woman beautiful who should have the form of the Farnese Hercules, or admire the shapes of the hero who should be formed like the Venus de Medicis; because the proportions of such a woman would indicate strength and intrepidity, where we wish to find only gentleness and delicacy; and the delicate form of the hero would indicate softness and effeminacy, where the opposite qualities only can be esteemed. As we associate with the female form many desirable qualities, every woman is esteemed more or less beautiful as her figure and features indicate a greater or smaller number of these qualities; and the same is the case with respect to the qualities which adorn the male character, and the form and features by which they are expressed. Upon comparing a number of human beings with one another, we find, that with respect to every feature and limb, there is one central form to which nature always tends, though she be continually deviating from it on the right hand and on the left: (See Nose). This form therefore is considered as the most perfect form of the species, and most expressive of the qualities for which that species is valued; but in Africa, the central form, with respect to the proportions of the human body and the features of the human face, is very different from what it is in Europe; and therefore the ideal or perfect beauty of the human form and features cannot be the same in both countries. No doubt, if a man could examine the limbs and features of every individual of the human race, he would discover one central form belonging to the whole, and be led to esteem it the standard of beauty; but as this is obviously impossible, the common idea or central form belonging to each great class of mankind must be esteemed the standard of beauty in that class, as indicating most completely the qualities for which individuals are esteemed. Thus there is a common form in childhood and a common form in age; each of which is the more perfect as it is the more remote from peculiarities: but though age and childhood have something in common, we should not deem the child beautiful who was formed exactly like the most handsome man, nor the man handsome who was formed exactly like the most beautiful child. This doctrine is well illustrated by Sir Joshua Reynolds, who has applied it to every object esteemed beautiful in nature; and proved, that the superiority of Claude Lorrain over the landscape painters of the Dutch and Flemish...\nFlemish schools, arise chiefly from his having generalized his conceptions, and formed his pictures by compounding together the various draughts which he had previously made from various beautiful scenes and prospects. \"On the whole (says he), it seems to me that there is but one presiding principle which regulates and gives stability to every art. The works, whether of poets, painters, moralists, or historians, which are built upon general nature, live forever; while those which depend for their existence on particular customs and habits, a particular view of nature, or the fluctuation of fashion, can only be coeval with that which first raised them from obscurity. All the individual objects which are exhibited to our view by nature, upon close examination, will be found to have their blemishes and defects. The most beautiful forms have something about them like weaknesses, minuteness, or imperfection. But it is not every eye that perceives these blemishes: It must be an eye long used to the contemplation and comparison of these forms; which alone can discern what any set of objects of the same kind has in common, and what each wants in particular.\"\n\nFrom these reasonings the same great artist concludes, that the man who is ambitious of the character of possessing a correct taste, ought to acquire a \"habit of comparing and digesting his notions. He ought not to be wholly unacquainted with that part of philosophy which gives him an insight into human nature, and relates to the manners, characters, passions, and affections. He ought to know something concerning mind, as well as a great deal concerning the body, and the various external works of nature and of art; for it is only the power of distinguishing right from wrong that is properly denominated taste.\n\n\"Genius and taste, in the common acceptation, appear to be very nearly related; the difference lies only in this, that genius has superadded to it a habit or power of execution. Or we may say, that taste, when this power is added, changes its name, and is called genius. They both, in the popular opinion, pretend to an entire exemption from the restraint of rules. It is supposed that their powers are intuitive; that under the name of genius great works are produced, and under the name of taste an exact judgement is given, without our knowing why, and without being under the least obligation to reason, precept, or experience.\n\n\"One can scarce state these opinions without exposing their absurdity; yet they are constantly in the mouths of men, and particularly of illiterate and affected connoisseurs. The natural appetite, or taste of the human mind, is for truth; whether that truth results from the real agreement or equality of original ideas among themselves, from the agreement of the representation of any object with the thing represented, or from the correspondence of the several parts of any arrangement with each other. It is the very same taste which relishes a demonstration in geometry, that is pleased with the resemblance of a picture to an original, and touched with the harmony of music.\n\n\"But besides real, there is also apparent truth, or opinion, or prejudice. With regard to real truth, when it is known, the taste which conforms to it is and must be uniform. With regard to the second sort of truth, which may be called truth upon sufferance, or truth by courtesy, it is not fixed but variable. However, whilst these opinions and prejudices on which it is founded continue, they operate as truth; and the art, whose office it is to please the mind as well as instruct it, must direct itself according to opinion, or it will not attain its end. In proportion as these prejudices are known to be generally diffused or long received, the taste which conforms to them approaches nearer to certainty, and to a fort of resemblance to real science, even where opinions are found to be no better than prejudices. And since they deserve, on account of their duration and extent, to be considered as really true, they become capable of no small degree of stability and determination by their permanent and uniform nature.\n\n\"Of the judgement which we make on the works of art, and the preference that we give to one class of art over another, if a reason be demanded, the question is perhaps evaded by answering, I judge from my taste; but it does not follow that a better answer cannot be given, though for common gazers this may be sufficient. Every man is not obliged to investigate the causes of his approbation or dislike. The arts would lie open for ever to caprice and casualty, if those who are to judge of their excellencies had no settled principles by which they are to regulate their decisions, and the merit or defect of performances were to be determined by unguided fancy. And indeed we may venture to assert, that whatever speculative knowledge is necessary to the artist, is equally and indispensably necessary to the critic and the connoisseur.\n\n\"The first idea that occurs in the consideration of what is fixed in art or in taste, is that presiding principle which we have already mentioned, the general idea of nature. The beginning, the middle, and the end of every thing that is valuable in taste, is comprised in the knowledge of what is truly nature; for whatever ideas are not conformable to those of nature or universal opinion, must be considered as more or less capricious; the idea of nature comprehending not only the forms which nature produces, but also the nature and internal fabric and organization, as I may call it, of the human mind and imagination. General ideas, beauty, or nature, are but different ways of expressing the same thing, whether we apply these terms to statues, poetry, or picture. Deformity is not nature, but an accidental deviation from her accustomed practice. This general idea therefore ought to be called nature: and nothing else, correctly speaking, has a right to that name. Hence it plainly appears, that as a work is conducted under the influence of general ideas, or partial, it is principally to be considered as the effect of a good or a bad taste.\"\n\nUpon the whole, we may conclude that the real substance, as it may be called, of what goes under the name of taste, is fixed and established in the nature of things; that there are certain and regular causes by which the imagination and passions of men are affected; and that the knowledge of these causes is acquired by a laborious and diligent investigation of nature, and by the same slow progress as wisdom or knowledge of every kind, however instantaneous its operations may appear when thus acquired. A man of real taste is always a man of judgement in other respects; and those inventions which either disdain or shrink from reason, are generally more like the dreams of a distempered brain than the exalted enthusiasm of a sound and true genius. In the midst of the highest flights of fancy or imagination, reason ought\nTaste to preside from first to last; and he who shall decide on the beauties of any one of the fine arts by an imaginary innate sense or feeling, will make as ridiculous an appearance as the connoisseur mentioned by Dr Moore, who praised as a work of the divine Raphael the wretched daubing by a Swiss copyist. The reader who wishes for further instruction in the philosophy of taste, may consult Gerard's Essay on Taste, with the dissertations of Voltaire, d'Alembert, and Montesquieu; Dr Blair's Lectures on the Belles Lettres; Dr Reid's Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man; Alfon's Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste; and Sir Joshua Reynolds's Discourses delivered in the Royal Academy.\n\nTate, Nahum, an English poet, born in Ireland about the middle of the reign of Charles II., where he received his education. He was made poet-laureate to King William upon the death of Shadwell, and held that place until the reign of George I., whose first birthday ode he lived to write, and executed it with unusual spirit. He died in the Mint in 1716. He was the author of nine dramatic performances, a great number of poems, and a version of the Psalms in conjunction with Dr Brady.\n\nTatian, a writer of the primitive church in the second century. He was born in Assyria, and trained up in the heathen religion and learning. Coming over to Christianity, he became the disciple of Justin Martyr, whom he attended to Rome. While Justin lived, he continued steadily orthodox; but after Justin's death, he made a schism, and became the author of a new sect, condemning marriage, enjoining abstinence from wine and animal food, and suffering only water to be used in the holy mysteries; whence his followers were called Encratites and Hydroparaglatae. None of his works are now extant but his piece against the Gentiles; or, as it is usually entitled, his Oration to the Greeks.\n\nTatius, Achilles, a native of Alexandria, was the author of a book on the sphere, which Father Petavius translated into Latin. There is also attributed to him a Greek romance on the loves of Leucippe and Clitophon, of which Salmasius has given a beautiful edition in Greek and Latin, with notes. Suidas says, that this Achilles Tatius was a Pagan, but that he afterwards embraced the Christian religion, and became a bishop. Photius mentions him in his Bibliotheca.\n\nTattonneur. See Lemur, Mammalia Index.\n\nTattooing, or Tattowing, an operation in use among the islanders in the South Sea for marking their bodies with figures of various kinds which they consider as ornamental. It is performed by puncturing the skin, and rubbing a black colour into the wounds. The instrument used somewhat resembles a comb, the teeth of which are repeatedly struck into the skin by means of a small mallet. It is very painful; but the children are forced by their relations to submit to it.\n\nTattou, a beat of a drum at night to advertise the soldiers to retreat, or repair to their quarters in the garrison, or to their tents in a camp.\n\nTavernier, John Baptist, a French traveller, was born in 1605. In the course of 40 years he travelled six times to Turkey, Persia, and the East Indies, and visited all the countries in Europe, travelling mostly on foot. His travels have been frequently reprinted in five volumes 12mo. He died on his seventh journey to the east, at Molcow, in 1686.\n\nTavira, or Tavila, a considerable town of Portugal, and capital of the province of Algarve, with a handsome castle, and one of the best harbours in the kingdom, defended by a fort. It is seated in a fertile country, at the mouth of the river Gilao, between Cape Vincent and the strait of Gibraltar, 100 miles west by north of Cadiz. W. Long. 7° 46'. N. Lat. 37° 18'.\n\nTavistock, a town of Devonshire in England, situated on the river Tavy or Tave. W. Long. 4° 12'. N. Lat. 50° 37'. It sends two members to parliament, and gives the title of marquis to the noble family of Russell duke of Bedford.\n\nTaunton, a large, elegant, and well built town of Somersetshire, 146 miles from London. It consists principally of four streets paved and lighted; the market-place is spacious, and has a handsome market-house, with a town hall over it, which was finished in 1773. It has an extensive woollen manufacture; and in 1780 a silk manufacture was introduced. Its castle, the ruins of which remain, was in 1645 defended for the parliament by Colonel Blake against an army of 10,000 men under Lord Goring, but was dismantled by Charles II. In 1685 the duke of Monmouth made this place his head-quarters. Its church, which is large and beautiful, is a fine specimen of the florid Gothic style of architecture. The tower, which is lofty, is of excellent workmanship, crowned at the top with four stately pinnacles, 32 feet high. The whole perhaps is not equalled in the kingdom. Taunton is pleasantly seated on the river Tone, which is navigable to Bridgewater; is reckoned the best town in the county; and sends two members to parliament. W. Long. 3° 17'. N. Lat. 50° 59'.\n\nTauris, or Tebris, a town of Persia, and capital of Aderbeitzan. It was formerly the capital of Persia, and is now the most considerable next to Isfahan; for it contains 1,500 houses, besides many separate shops, and about 200,000 inhabitants. It is about five miles in circumference, and carries on a prodigious trade in cotton, cloth, silks, gold and silver brocades, fine turbans, and flaggreen leather. There are 300 caravanserais, and 250 mosques. Some travellers suppose it to be the ancient Ecbatana; but of this there is no certainty. It is seated in a delightful plain, surrounded with mountains, from whence a stream issues, which runs through the city. E. Long. 47° 50'. N. Lat. 38° 18'.\n\nTaurus, a great chain of mountains in Asia, which begin at the eastern part of Little Carmania, and extend very far into India. In different places they have different names.\n\nTaurus, in Astronomy, one of the 12 signs of the zodiac.\n\nTautology, a needless repeating of the same thing in different words.\n\nTawing, the art of dressing skins in white, so as to be fit for divers manufactures, particularly gloves, &c.\n\nAll skins may be tawed; but those chiefly used for this purpose are lamb, sheep, kid, and goat skins.\n\nThe method of tawing is this: Having cleared the\nTawing skins of wool or hair by means of lime, they are laid in a large vat of wood or stone, set on the ground, full of water, in which quicklime has been flaked; wherein they are allowed to lie a month or six weeks, according as the weather is more or less hot, or as the skins are required to be more or less soft and pliant.\n\nWhile they are in the vat, the water and lime are changed twice, and the skins are taken out and put in again every day: and when they are taken out for the last time, they are laid all night to soak in a running water, to get out the greatest part of the lime; and in the morning are laid together by fixes one upon another, upon a wooden leg, and are scraped slowly one after another, to get the flesh off from the fleshy side, with a cutting two-handled instrument called a knife; and then they cut off the legs (if they are not cut off before) and other superfluous parts about the extremes. Then they are laid in a vat or pit with a little water, where they are filled with wooden pegs for the space of a quarter of an hour; and then the vat is filled up with water, and they are rinsed in it.\n\nIn the next place, they are thrown on a clean pavement to drain, and afterwards cast into a fresh pit of water, out of which they rinse them well, and are laid again on the wooden leg, fix at a time, with the hair side outermost: after which they rub a kind of whetstone very briskly, to soften and fit them to receive four or five more preparations, given them on the leg both on the flesh side and the hair-side, with the knife, after the manner above mentioned.\n\nAfter this they are put into a pit of water and wheat bran, and stirred about in it with wooden poles, till the bran is perceived to stick to them, and then they are left: as they rise of themselves to the top of the water by a kind of fermentation, they are plunged down again to the bottom; and at the same time fire is set to the liquor, which burns as easily as if it were brandy, but goes out the moment the skins are all covered.\n\nThey repeat this operation as often as the skins rise above the water; and when they have done rising they take them out, lay them on the wooden leg, the fleshy side outwards, and pass the knife over them to scrape off the bran.\n\nHaving thus cleared them of the bran, they lay the skins in a large basket, and load them with huge stones to promote their draining: and when they have drained sufficiently, they give them their feeding; which is performed after the manner following:\n\nFor 100 of large sheep skins, and for smaller in proportion, they take eight pounds of alum and three of sea salt, and melt the whole with water in a vessel over the fire, pouring the solution out, while yet lukewarm, into a kind of trough, in which is twenty pounds of the finest wheat-flower, with the yolks of eight dozen of eggs; of all which is formed a kind of paste, a little thicker than children's pap; which, when done, is put into another vessel, to be used in the following manner.\n\nThey pour a quantity of hot water into the trough in which the paste was prepared, mixing two spoonfuls of the paste with it; to do which they use a wooden spoon, which contains just as much as is required for a dozen of skins: and when the whole is well diluted, two dozen of the skins are plunged into it; but they take care that the water be not too hot, which would spoil the paste and burn the skins.\n\nAfter they have lain some time in the trough they take them out, one after another, with the hand, and stretch them out; this they do twice: and after they have given them all their pate, they put them into tubs, and there fill them afresh with wooden pegs.\n\nThey then put them into a vat, where they are suffered to lie for five or six days, or more; then they take them out in fair weather, and hang them to dry on cords or racks; and the quicker they are dried the better; for if they be too long a drying, the salt and alum within them are apt to make them rise in a grain, which is an essential fault in this kind of dressing.\n\nWhen the skins are dry, they are made up into bundles, and just dipped in fair water, and taken out and drained: they are then thrown into an empty tub; and after having lain some time are taken out and trampled under foot.\n\nThey then draw them over a flat iron instrument, the top of which is round like a battledore, and the bottom fixed into a wooden block, to stretch and open them; and having been opened, they are hung in the air upon cords to dry; and being dry, they are opened a second time, by passing them again over the same instrument.\n\nIn the last place, they are laid on a table, pulled out, and laid smooth, and are then fit for sale.\n\n**Taxation.** Besides those expenses which are necessary to the existence, or conducive to the comfort and enjoyment of private individuals, there are others of which the benefit is directly applicable to the whole society. These benefits indeed are chiefly of a negative kind, but they are not therefore the least essential. They consist in the preservation of person and property from that violence both internal and external, to which the irregular passions of human nature continually expose them. The regular administration of justice, and defense against foreign enemies, are so essential to the well-being of a people, that they can with no propriety hesitate, when necessary, to part even with a large portion of their income in order to provide for the proper accomplishment of these objects. A certain pomp and magnificence too, in those who are to take the lead in these departments, have been deemed both ornamental to the society, and necessary for securing respect and obedience from the body of the people. If, besides these grand and indispensable advantages of foreign and internal security, public funds can be applied to any other purposes, evidently tending to promote the national well-being, yet beyond the reach of private exertions,—to canals, high roads, or public institutions of any description,—there can be no doubt surely as to the propriety of such an application.\n\nIt is evident, therefore, that the money which is necessary for the above purposes, forms a perfectly necessary and proper part of national expenditure. The government of the country, indeed may, as elsewhere observed (Political Economy), economically speaking, be considered as part of its fixed capital, essential to the advantageous employment of the rest. Without the security which the labourer thence derives, of reaping the fruits of his industry, he would have little motive to action; every thing would be the prey of the strongest, and\nTaxation and all impulse to activity ceasing, universal poverty would ensue. At the same time we may observe with regard to this as to other fixed capitals, that the expense is expedient only so far as it is necessary, and that if the same functions can be performed at a smaller cost, a decided gain arises to the public. It becomes therefore an important object to inquire, in what manner the offices of government may be adequately performed, with the least burden on the people.\n\nWe have formerly, under the head of Political Economy, slightly illustrated some leading principles respecting public revenue. But as the subject is important, we shall consider it here in somewhat greater detail.\n\nTaxes may be arranged in the following manner:\n\n1. Affected taxes, or those which the subject is required to pay directly into the hands of the sovereign or commonwealth. Under this title are comprehended all the taxes which bear the above name; all income or capitalization taxes, and every species of land taxes. These taxes are almost always intended to fall upon income.\n\n2. Taxes upon commodities, which are paid, in the first instance, not by the consumer, but by the producer, or importer. These taxes fall upon consumption; the man who does not use the articles, pays no tax. They operate thus partly as sources of revenue, and partly as compulsory laws.\n\n3. Stamp duties, or duties upon those deeds which regulate the transference of property. These duties fall chiefly upon capital.\n\n1. Affected Taxes.—Affected taxes, according to the above definition, seem to be the most simple and direct mode of raising a revenue. The money comes at once from the pockets of the people into those of the sovereign. No tax is so certain of yielding a revenue. The money is demanded, and must be paid. Where properly arranged also, they may probably be made to fall more equally than any other, upon the different classes, according to their ability. In absolute governments, therefore, and in governments little skilled in the science of finance, these taxes are commonly preferred, as those which can be levied with the least trouble. They have likewise this merit that they cost little in the collection, and consequently nearly their whole amount is brought into the treasury.\n\nAffected taxes, however, are liable to many objections. None are so heavily felt. In other cases the tax is concealed under the price of the commodity with which it confounds itself; but here the money is paid directly without anything in return. It must generally too be paid in a considerable sum at once, a circumstance which must often be productive of serious inconvenience, while the same sum, broken down into small portions, might have been paid without difficulty. For these reasons, much greater discontent is excited by these taxes than by taxes upon commodities. A double revenue perhaps, may, in the latter way, be raised with less murmuring. In popular governments, therefore, and in those where finance has been rejected to a system, the object has generally been to avoid direct afflication as much as possible. In this country, the greater part, by far, of the revenue had been raised by taxes upon commodities, till within these last twenty years, the pressure of public wants made it necessary to have recourse to every mode of raising money which promised to be effectual, and thus the affected taxes have been raised to a very great amount. The most important of these taxes may be included under land tax, capitation taxes, taxation house tax, and income tax.\n\nLand Tax.—There is no class of men who may with more propriety be burdened with an extraordinary imposition, than the proprietors of land. They enjoy commonly a liberal income, without care or trouble of their own. Their property, being of permanent value, is much preferable to any source of income which expires with its possessor. From being local and immovable, it is peculiarly dependent on the protecting influence of government, and may therefore be reasonably called upon to contribute something more than the common share to its support. In almost all countries, therefore, the landholders, besides being liable to the same burdens with the rest of the society, are subject to a peculiar tax, called land tax.\n\nIn India and other great oriental empires, the principal revenue of the sovereign is derived from land. It arises, however, not properly in the way of tax, but of rent. The sovereign, in those absolute governments, is judged to be the sole proprietor of all the land in his dominions, which are let out by him or his deputy, to the farmers. This is also the principal source of the revenue which we derive from our East Indian possessions. It is otherwise, however, in all the European countries. There, almost all the land is private property, and the contribution which government draws from it is therefore a tax.\n\nThe adherents of the economical system have proposed to substitute a land tax in the room of every other. They maintain that all taxes must finally fall upon the produce of land, since it alone affords that surplus revenue, out of which public contributions can be drawn. Were this doctrine true, much trouble and expense would be saved, exchanging the present complicated and laborious system of taxation, for one so simple and easy. But we have already endeavoured to show, under the head of Political Economy, that the principles of this fact have no solid foundation; that manufactures and commerce are sources of wealth, as well as agriculture, though in a somewhat inferior degree. It will follow, therefore, that they are equally liable to be affected by taxation. It is vain to urge that the merchant must have his profit, and the labourer his hire, and that otherwise they will not employ their capital and labour. Were a tax to be imposed upon any one branch of industry, leaving the rest untouched, there is no doubt, that wages and profit in that branch must rise, till the merchant or labourer is placed on a level with the rest of the community, otherwise he will transfer his capital and industry to some other branch. But where the imposition falls indiscriminately upon the different employments of labour and stock, there is no such refuge; the labourer and merchant must suffer a diminution of income; nor is there any process by which he can throw this diminution upon the landlord.\n\nOther persons of a much less informed character, are often heard urging, that we have only to lay the imposition upon the landlords; and that they will not be long of indemnifying themselves by raising the rent of their lands. Such arguments will make little impression upon those who have at all attended to the true principles of political economy. The value of lands, as of every other article, is determined by the demand and the\nA tax upon the rent of land would have no tendency, either to increase the one, or to diminish the other, consequently no tendency to raise the value of land. Indeed, were we to suppose, according to this hypothesis, that proprietors have an unlimited power of raising their lands, whenever they are so inclined, it is quite contrary to common sense to suppose that they should not exert that power, without waiting for the stimulus of a tax.\n\nFor these reasons, land cannot, with any propriety, be made the sole subject of taxation; but it is very fair, as above observed, that it should pay somewhat more than other sources of revenue. A difficulty, however, arises from the variations to which its value is subject, sometimes on the decreasing, but more commonly on the increasing side. The rate which, at one time, is equitable, becomes quite otherwise at another. An attempt, on the part of government, to keep up a continual survey of all the lands in the kingdom, would be attended with very heavy expense, and would, after all, be probably fruitless. Besides, such a measure would operate as a discouragement to the improvement of land, when so large a share would go out of the hands of the improver. These objections have weighed so strongly with the legislature of this country, that they have not raised this tax, since its first imposition in the reign of King William. It was then meant to be at the rate of four shillings in the pound, though in fact, it was by no means so much. It was also very unequally distributed, even at the beginning; a serious evil, which however, it might have required very great trouble to avoid. Since that time, a great and general rise has taken place in the value of land, which has made this tax much higher still, than when it was originally imposed. It has also rendered it, however, still more unequal. Although almost all the land in Great Britain has improved; yet this improvement has taken place in very different proportions, according as each district differed in natural advantages, and in the industry of the inhabitants. The land tax accordingly is, at the present moment, most exceedingly unequal; but as it fortunately happens, that there is scarcely a district in Great Britain which has not improved more or less, the general moderation of the tax has rendered its inequality less grievous.\n\nA method has been proposed of obviating this disadvantage, by keeping a register, in which the landlord and tenant shall be jointly obliged to enter the rent which the land bears, a new entry being made at every variation. A valuation may be made of the lands which the proprietor keeps in his own possession. Something of this kind, it is said, actually takes place in the Venetian territory. The discouragement to improvement indeed still remains, but even this might be obviated by an equitable, and even liberal allowance being made, for any sums which the landlord may satisfactorily prove to have been expended in this way. The chief objection to the plan seems to be the danger of collusion between the farmer and landlord, who would have a mutual interest in representing the rent as less than it really was. The agreement indeed might, by law, be made obligatory on the farmer only to the extent of the sum registered; but it may be doubtful, whether even this regulation would always be an adequate security against fraud. The valuations would necessarily depend a good deal upon the discretion of the revenue officer; which, in an arbitrary government at least, might become a serious objection. The additional expense of such a plan would be considerable; but, provided it could be made to answer the purpose, this ought not to deter from its adoption.\n\nFrederick of Prussia imposed a higher tax upon lands held by a noble, than upon those held by a base tenure. He conceived that the privileges and flattering advantages of nobility were such as to compensate for this additional charge. We are rather disposed to consider this proceeding as severe. A nobleman, with the same income, is poorer than a commoner, because he has a greater rank to support; and in the present state of Europe, a great proportion of the nobility are extremely poor. This extreme, however, is much better than that of France before the revolution, of the Austrian states, and of most of the old governments of Europe. There the nobility, possessing the chief influence in the administration, had obtained for themselves liberal exemptions, and thrown the principal weight of this, as of other taxes, upon the inferior orders. In Sardinia, and in some provinces of France, lands held by a noble tenure paid nothing whatever.\n\nSome taxes upon land are proportioned, not to its rent, but to its produce. This is the case in the Asiatic countries. In China, a tenth, and in India, a fifth of the whole produce of the land, are claimed by government. In England and Ireland, the church is supported by a tax of this kind, which is called tithe.\n\nThese taxes are liable to two very great objections. They are, in the first place, unequal. It is rent only that can be the proper subject of taxation; that part of the produce which is necessary to pay the expense of cultivation, ought to remain untouched. But this expense is far greater in poor than in rich lands. In the former, perhaps, the produce may be little more than sufficient to pay the expenses incurred; while in rich lands, not only the necessity of labour is less, but the produce greater. If, by well employed capital, and costly cultivation, the farmer succeeds in extracting tolerable crops from an ungrateful soil, it is both cruel and unjust that he should be obliged to pay as much as if he had no such obstacle to struggle with.\n\nBut if this tax be objectionable on the ground of equity, it is still more so, on that of expediency. The first excitement to labour and improvements of every kind, must undoubtedly be the prospect of enjoying their fruits. Where the rate of taxation is fixed, this prospect remains unimpaired; for whatever addition the proprietor or farmer can, by such means, make to the produce of his land, is all his own. But the case is very different, when it must be so deeply shared in by persons who have done nothing to forward this increase of produce. A sovereign prince indeed may derive, from such an arrangement, some motive to encourage agriculture, and improve the means of communication, so as to raise the value of its produce. But this advantage, which will scarcely ever counterbalance the attendant evils, disappears altogether, when this imposition is to be paid for the support of an ecclesiastical body. These, being only life-renters, and seldom possessed of much capital, cannot be expected to co-operate in\nTaxation in any measure for the improvement of the lands. The jars too, which are likely to take place between the pastor and his flock, form a moral argument against this mode of support.\n\nIt must not be concealed, however, that a permanent commutation of tithes would be a measure little favourable to the interests of the clergy. It seems both just to themselves, and advantageous to the public, that when the country is in a state of improvement, this body should not be left behind; it should be able to keep pace with the other members of the society. This it can never do, if it has merely a certain fixed sum allotted for its maintenance, without the possibility of augmentation. This evil has, in fact, been seriously felt in the church of Scotland, the income of whose members, notwithstanding all that has been done for their relief, is still very inferior to what it was thirty or forty years ago. A source of income, which rises or falls with the value of land, seems the most effectual mode of maintaining this proportion between the income of the clergy, and of the rest of the society; we need not, therefore wonder, that the clergy should be so tenacious of it.\n\nTo reconcile these contrarieties, would certainly be attended with difficulty; yet it does not seem to be absolutely impossible. The first object would be, to transfer the tax from the produce to the rent. This might be done by forming a correct estimate, on an average of a few years, of the value of the tithe; and then assigning a claim to such a proportion of the rent, as would be equal to that value. This would remove all discouragements to the exertion of the cultivator. Those which press against the exertions of the landlord would indeed remain in full force, though without any increase. In most cases, these exertions would be of very small importance, when compared with those of the former. But, besides, a scheme might probably be contrived similar to that above suggested, by which the landlord might receive an adequate allowance for any improvements he might make.\n\nThe ground-rent of houses forms part of the rent of land. In remote country situations, it is often no more than the same land would yield, if employed for the purposes of agriculture. But in the vicinity, and still more in the heart of a great town, competition, and the value attached by convenience or fashion to some particular situations, raise this rent to a very extravagant height.\n\nGround-rent seems to be a still more proper subject of taxation than that of common land. It arises commonly from circumstances entirely independent of any care or attention on the part of the proprietor. Yet ground rents have never been considered as a separate subject of taxation. This has probably been from the difficulty of distinguishing them from the building rent. In every tax upon houses, however, part must fall upon the ground rent, provided that be able to bear it. By diminishing the demand for houses, it will diminish also the demand for land to build them on.\n\nCapitation or Poll Taxer,—afford one of the easiest and most obvious modes of taxation. To lay an affixture upon every individual without exception, seems the most effectual mode of preventing all trouble, and leaving no room for evasion. In most of the absolute governments, where the sovereign does not claim the sole property of the lands, as in Turkey and Russia, poll taxes are imposed in lieu of land tax.\n\nThe rudest form of this imposition is, when it is laid equally upon every individual. An equality of this kind is the most grievous inequality. To make the poorest subject pay as much as the richest, is palpably unjust. The only case, where such a tax can be proper, is where it falls upon slaves. In this case, it is paid, not by the slave, but by the master. The number of slaves forms the most accurate test of the value of his property; and accordingly, in Russia, an estate is described, not by the number of acres, but by the number of slaves which it contains. This tax has also the good property of encouraging manumission. In all other cases, such a tax can only be rendered tolerable by its extreme moderation.\n\nNations were not long of perceiving the preposterous nature of this arrangement, and of seeking to substitute some more equitable one in its place. Fortune was evidently the most correct standard to proceed upon; but a close inquisition into private concerns was conceived to be burdensome and oppressive. If each individual were to report his own fortune, could the report be trusted? If, on the other hand, the affixture were to be regulated by the officers of government, according to what they supposed to be his wealth, a door was opened to vexatious and arbitrary proceedings. In order to avoid these opposite dangers, it has been common to regulate the contribution according to the rank of the contributor, which it is supposed will bear at least a certain proportion to his fortune. This was the case with the different poll taxes imposed in this country during the reign of King William. It was the case also in France with regard to that part of the taille which fell upon the nobility. It is extremely unequal; for many men of rank have no fortune corresponding; and where it so happens, their rank impoverishes them, by the expense which is requisite for its support. Yet, as rank affords a certain approximation to fortune, it is certainly better to fix it according to that standard, than to leave it to the arbitrary appointment of the officers of government. Inequality is a less evil than uncertainty.\n\nIn that part of the taille which fell upon the inferior orders, the latter mode was adopted. This tax was the subject perhaps of more grievous discontent, than any other which yielded an equal revenue. It cannot be supposed that the intendant should not be often swayed by motives of favouritism, private interest, or private resentment; and the very uncertainty to which the people were exposed, formed a severe hardship. They were tempted to conceal their wealth, and even to employ inadequate instruments of trade or agriculture, in order to deceive the watchful eye of the intendant.\n\nHouse Tax.—In order to avoid the defects incident to the above modes of affixture, rent of houses has been fixed upon as affording the best criterion of the amount of a man's income. It certainly affords a tolerable criterion of his expenditure; and though this may often differ considerably from his means, yet as it is rather the object of government to discourage profuse expenditure, there may be no harm in such an inequality.\n\nThe most equitable mode of taxing houses, would evidently be in the proportion of their rent. In this country, accordingly, part of the land tax is made to fall upon the rent of houses. This branch of the land tax\nTaxation tax is subject to the same inequalities, both original and acquired, as the other branches. The assessment, not upon each house, but upon each district, continues invariably the same. In general, it is still higher than upon land. The value of houses, however, has not risen so invariably as that of land; hence, in some districts where the population has decreased, the tax falls with considerable weight. Since that time another tax has been imposed upon houses which is in proportion to the rent, and varies with it. The heaviest tax upon houses, however, is now that which is regulated by the number of windows.\n\nAt the time of the original imposition of the house tax, it seems to have been considered difficult or impossible to ascertain and follow the fluctuations of the rent. Some obvious and undeniable circumstance, connected with the very form and construction of the house, was therefore selected. The most ancient is the number of hearths. Hearth money is a very ancient duty, and seems to have existed even before the Conquest. Under Charles II., a tax of two shillings on all hearths was granted to the crown for ever. This tax was grievous to the people, on account of the domiciliary visits to which it necessarily subjects them. It had besides the worst kind of inequality, pressing harder on the poor than the rich. A man of 20l. a-year may have two hearths; a man of 200l. not above four or five. A man of 1000l. will scarcely have ten. Hearth money, therefore, was abolished at the Revolution. In its stead was afterwards substituted the window tax, which could be ascertained without entering the house of the contributor. It was soon found, however, to be liable to the same inequality as hearth money. In consideration of this, the rate was greatly increased with the increase of the number of windows, and houses having less than six were entirely exempted. If, however, as would rather appear, the rent can be ascertained in a satisfactory manner, it would seem better to lay the whole of the house tax upon it directly, rather than by any circuitous and doubtful mode.\n\nThere are two parts of house rent; the ground rent, or that which is given for the use of the ground on which the house stands; and the building rent, which is paid to the builder, as a remuneration for his trouble and expense. The ground rent, as above observed, must pay a share of the tax; but the building rent cannot be affected by it. The builder must have his profit, otherwise he would turn his capital and industry in another direction. This rule, however, is somewhat modified by the very durable nature of the subject. When the tax is first imposed, it is very probable that the supply of houses may continue for some time nearly adequate to the demand; in which case the proprietor must lower his price in order to get his houses let. As the old houses decay, however, new ones are wanted, which will not be built without an adequate remuneration; and thus the general law will again operate.\n\nIncome Tax.—The object of all the different assessed taxes is to make the subject contribute an equitable proportion of his income to the expenses of the state. But those which we have above enumerated, though they may procure an approximation to this point, can never attain it with perfect precision. If therefore an income tax, established on just principles, could be collected without any farther grievances, than the always unavoidable payment of the contribution, it would certainly be the most equitable assessment of any, and might with propriety supersede all other taxes of this description. Serious, however, are the difficulties which attend it. The correctness of the estimate must always depend, in a great measure, on the honour of the contributors; but all men are not honest; and the cheating of the king, is, according to the popular code, so venial an offence, that accurate returns cannot, in all cases, be expected. If, on the other hand, the collectors, as in the French taille, take upon themselves to form this estimate, a door is opened to arbitrary and oppressive exactions. The impossibility also of escaping the tax by any species of privation makes its weight more sensibly felt, than in those which are in any degree voluntary. For all these reasons, an income tax has hitherto been among the last resources to which a nation has had recourse in its extreme necessity.\n\nMost of the capitation taxes, as formerly observed, partook more or less of the nature of the income tax. The subsidies, so frequent in our early finance, were, like the taille, composed partly according to rank, and partly according to fortune. Among the nobility, alienation of estates was yet rare, and the disproportion between rank and wealth, much greater than in subsequent times. The estimate of income seems to have been made by the collectors. Such impositions, however, were ill brooked by a free and turbulent people; the subsidies became more and more unproductive; and at last were entirely given up. The first was imposed under Richard II., in 1370; the last under Charles II., in 1673.\n\nIn some small republican states, a tax of this kind is levied, the amount of which is entirely regulated by the good faith of the contributor. At Hamburgh every citizen is laid to have placed in the public coffers a sum, which is declared upon oath to be one fourth per cent. of his whole property, which, reckoning interest at five per cent, would be one twentieth of his income. It was not supposed that this mode of collection gave occasion to any fraud. The good faith of the people and their confidence in their government, supplied the place of compulsory laws. The secrecy was considered necessary by a mercantile state; but in some of the small Swiss republics, every citizen declared publicly upon oath the amount of his income, and was assessed accordingly. Such unsuspicious good faith could only exist in these small states, where patriotism was ardent, and the confidence of the people in their government entire.\n\nSince the discontinuance of subsidies, nothing of this kind had been attempted in Britain, till the year 1795, when the accumulating weight of public debt suggested to Mr Pitt the necessity of raising a large portion of the supplies within the year. For this purpose, there appeared a necessity for having recourse to an income tax; and so strong a sense was entertained by the nation of the pressing nature of the exigency, that it was submitted to with less reluctance than might have been expected.\n\nAn attempt was at first made to connect this imposition with the former assessed taxes. These were to be tripled; but if any person was able to prove, that this charge amounted to more than a tenth of his income, he was relieved from all which exceeded that proportion. At the same time, a voluntary subscription was opened;\nTaxation opened; but the produce, though honourable to national patriotism, afforded but a slender supply to public wants. These irregular and uncertain approximations towards an income tax were soon given up, and their place supplied by the tax itself, in its own shape.\n\nTo obviate the inconveniences of disclosure or arbitrary assessment, measures have been adopted, as effectual probably as any that could be devised. The commissioners of income tax are chosen by the freeholders of the county, or by the electors in a borough, in the same manner as a member of parliament, excepting that a smaller qualification is requisite. To the office of these commissioners, public opinion attaches a certain dignity, which makes it be performed gratuitously, and by the most distinguished persons in the district. These are, by oath, bound to secrecy. The statements are given, in the first instance, by the contributor; but if the commissioners are not satisfied with his return, they can require from him satisfactory explanations. According to the sources of income, the person is assessed at the amount of one year, or at an average of three years. The result of these regulations seems to have been such as to obviate, almost entirely, the chief inconveniences attached to this mode of taxation. The simple payment of the income tax indeed, is most grievously complained of; but the accessories of disclosure, or arbitrary assessment, which were considered as presenting insurmountable obstacles to this measure, scarcely seem to be complained of at all.\n\nThe most important consideration in such a tax relates to the proportion in which it should be paid by the different members of the community. That the lowest orders, who subsist by the labour of their hands, ought to be exempted, seems universally agreed. This would produce the same effect as a tax upon the necessaries of life, the effects of which we shall discuss hereafter. But independent of this clause, an equal imposition upon the higher and middling classes of the community would be extreme inequality. The larger the income, the less of it must be spent upon necessaries or common conveniences, and the more upon objects of mere show and ostentation. These last can certainly admit more easily of retrenchment; and as the opulent have a greater stake in the country, it seems reasonable that they should contribute somewhat more in a season of public exigency. A gradation continually augmenting, such as takes place in most of the other affected taxes, seems to be strongly called for in this. The full proportion of ten per cent. was, from the first, imposed upon incomes of £200. a-year, and though this was infinitely too low, yet at a subsequent period (in 1806) it was brought down to £50. This sum, according to the present rate of expense, is the very lowest at which any family in the middling rank can possibly be supported. The whole of this clause, therefore, a clause which has so many claims to the favour of the legislature, is affected to the very same amount as the highest classes. The first conveniences of life are taxed at the same rate as its most superfluous luxuries. Certainly £1000. a-year ought to be the first income liable to the very heavy charge of 10 per cent.; and the deficiency hence arising might be very fairly supplied by an increase, gradually augmenting, upon incomes above that amount. Fifteen per cent. perhaps, ought to be the utmost that it ever rose to; but this charge might doubtless be more easily supported by an income of £10,000. a-year, than half of it by one of £200. or £300.\n\nModifications ought also to take place, according to the source from which the income is derived. That which arises from capital is undoubtedly of greater value than mere professional income. It does not expire with its possessor; it relieves him from the care and anxiety of laying up a provision for his family, and allows him to spend his whole income, when, to another person, it would be the most culpable imprudence. Of all species of capital, land seems to be the most valuable and durable. It stands also most in need of the protection of the state. It generally, too, comes to its possessor by inheritance, and is not the fruit of his own industry. With regard to money, although its value is still much superior to salaries or professional profits, yet it seems rather to be the policy of government to favour its accumulation, which a very great addition of charge might discourage. Money besides is a more moveable species of property than land, or even than professional income. If heavily taxed, the proprietor might withdraw into another country, and his capital, with the industry which it supported, be thus lost to the community.\n\nThe present tax makes no distinction between income which dies with its possessor, and income arising from land or capital. Yet such a distinction, if it appeared eligible, might easily be made under the present system of collection, which demands a statement, not only of the amount of income, but of the source from which it arises. The propriety, however, of such a charge demands some consideration. Land, it is true, is well able to bear a considerable share of the public burdens. But land, in this country, and in almost every other, is the subject of a peculiar tax, over and above what is paid by income arising from other sources. If therefore it were also to pay a greater proportion of the income tax, the pressure might become unjustly severe. The land tax in this country amounts to about two millions. Were we to suppose the share of the income paid by land to amount to £5,000,000. (a large allowance), land would then pay fourteen per cent. which seems as much as can reasonably be exacted. No such burden, at least in any sensible degree, falls upon stock; but for the reasons above stated, the propriety of taxing it heavily seems somewhat equivocal.\n\nAccording to the original bill, as proposed by Mr Pitt, very liberal exemptions were granted on account of children. To encourage marriage and the rearing of families, has been generally considered by legislators as an important object. From some recent speculations, however, it has appeared doubtful whether it be desirable to remove the obstacles to marriage which arise from the difficulty of subsistence. Whether from these views, or from the mere wish of rendering the tax more productive, this exemption has been gradually circumscribed. The last regulation made respecting it seems to be of a very capricious nature. An allowance of four per cent. is given, but only for the number of children exceeding two. This allowance besides is given, not out of the income tax itself, but out of the affected taxes. It is difficult to conceive any motive for this last regulation; and, especially in the case of the middling classes, it may sometimes render the exemption nugatory.\n\nOther Affected Taxes.—A considerable revenue is raised\nTaxation in this country by taxes on men servants, pleasure horses, carriages, dogs, &c. These are all luxuries, the use of which is confined to the most opulent classes; they form, therefore, extremely proper subjects of taxation. The income tax indeed, modified as above stated, might perhaps come instead of all such taxes; but while that tax favours the higher above the middling classes, these in question tend to remedy that inequality. One affeetment, however, is of a different nature; that upon labouring horses. It is not likely, and certainly could never be intended, that this tax should restrain the use of these indispensable instruments of agriculture. Neither can the duty fall upon the farmer, who, in all cases, must have his profits. To secure this, he must pay the less rent, in proportion as he pays the more tax; and this duty will finally operate as a land tax. It does not seem, however, to have any advantages above a direct affeetment of the same nature. It will bear hard upon the farmer who is in the middle of his lease at the time of its being imposed. If at all heavy, it may have some tendency to limit the use of such horses, and to encourage inferior substitutes. The tax was first laid at 2s. and was justified only by its extreme lightness. It was then gradually raised to 14s.; but a proposal to raise it still higher was thrown out by parliament, and has never been again revived.\n\n2. Taxes upon Commodities.—The experience of the discontent excited by direct affeetments, and of the difficulty of proportioning them equally, led to the imposition of taxes on consumable commodities. These being laid in the first instance on the commodity at the time of its production or importation, are finally paid by the consumer in the increased price of his goods. No taxes are so little felt, or excite so little discontent. The duty, mingling with the price of the goods, is confounded with it; and unless when the tax is first imposed, and a sudden rise in consequence takes place, the great mass of the people are even ignorant, how much of what they pay goes to government, and how much constitutes the mere price of the goods. The payment is also made in the most convenient manner, and may be divided into the smallest portions. The power of not paying by ceasing to consume the article taxed, goes a great way in suppressing murmurs. Thus, indeed, those whose income does not keep pace with their fortunes, pay an unequal share of the common contribution. But as the law is generally disposed to recommend economy, it will not perhaps consider this as a serious objection.\n\nFor these reasons, the modern system of finance, particularly in this country where it is so much an object to avoid discontent, has shewn a decided favour to this mode of raising a revenue. And perhaps, upon the whole, they are the best of any; yet the evils with which they are attended are by no means inconsiderable.\n\n1. These taxes take more out of the pocket of the people, in proportion to what they put in that of the public, than any other. This arises from the extensive and minute superintendence which is necessary for their proper collection. For this purpose, a number of officers must be kept, whose salaries form a serious deduction from the produce. In Smith's time, this expense amounted to above 5½ per cent. on the duties of excise, and above 10 per cent. on those of customs. The great augmentation of revenue which has taken place since that time, has been produced more by an increase of duty on articles formerly taxed, than by the introduction of new subjects of taxation. The expense of collection, however, bears still a larger proportion to the amount collected, than either in the stamps or affeeted taxes.\n\nThere is another way, in which the burden of these taxes is rendered heavier on the public. The merchant or producer advances the tax, often a considerable time before he can dispose of the article. He must therefore have not only indemnification to the amount of the duty, but also profit on the advance which he has made. It is universally observed, that when a new tax is imposed, the article rises more than in proportion to it. The public commonly murmur, and complain that the merchant has merely made the tax a pretence for this disproportionate increase in the price of his article. The truth is, however, that the merchant has a reasonable claim to receive the same profit on that part of his capital, which he has employed in advancing the tax, as upon that which he employed in the original purchase of the commodity.\n\n2. Though the collection of these taxes is less grievous to the great mass of the people, yet it falls heavier on certain classes. These are the dealers in exciseable commodities. As evasion is much easier here than in affeeted taxes, a more grinding system of superintendence becomes requisite. The tax-gatherer must have continual access to every part, not only of the workshop, but even of the private house, of the dealer in them. No time, no place, can be exempt from his visits. The power with which he is invested may also, if he be so disposed, give occasion to insolence at least, if not to oppression. Now, as the dealers in these commodities form a part, and even a pretty numerous part of the society, any hardship falling upon them must be a considerable evil. It is felt, besides, though not directly, by the rest of the society. It has already been observed, under the head of Political Economy, that every disagreeable circumstance attendant on any profession, necessarily raises the rate of wages and profit in that profession. It cannot be supposed, that the dealers in these commodities will submit to the hardships we have noticed, without claiming some indemnification in the price of their goods. Thus the first inconvenience will be augmented, and still more will be taken from the people, without any addition to the revenue of the public.\n\n3. These taxes give birth to the trade of smuggling, a trade at once injurious to the public, and ruinous to the individual. Unfortunately the lax state of public morals, in regard to this point, offers a strong temptation to grasp at the extraordinary profits which smuggling affords; and from the same cause, the produce of such traffic, when successful, is always sure of a ready sale. This trade, however, in the end, generally ruins not only the fortune, but also the morals of him by whom it is pursued. It trains to the practice of falsehood, perjury, and other vices, without which it cannot be carried on with any chance of success.\n\n4. Such taxes always alter more or less, the natural, and consequently the most advantageous direction of national industry. The tax upon wine must diminish the consumption of that article, and consequently the industry\nTaxation. Industry employed in producing it. Wine indeed is not a commodity of British production; but it must be purchased with British commodities, and if the merchant cannot import it, neither can he afford a market for these British articles which were to be given in exchange for it. Dr Smith seems to imagine, that these taxes produce an absolute defalcation in the amount of national produce; a supposition in which we are inclined to differ from him. Although there is a diminution in the demand for this particular article; yet as the sum levied is not withdrawn from the national expenditure, but is merely transferred from one class of persons to another, it must still support a demand, if not for the same, at least for some other species of commodities. Thus the public will suffer chiefly from the inconveniences attendant on the change. Other restraints, however, for which there is no such compensation, are necessarily attendant on the collection of such duties. In order to render this efficacious, regulations must often be made, as to the manner in which the trade is to be carried on; and it is always to be apprehended, that governments will be more attentive to the security of the revenue, than to the ease of the public. In arbitrary and unenlightened governments, this propensity becomes often so powerful, as to throw the most formidable obstacles in the way of that free circulation of commodities on which the prosperity of trade, and of all industry, essentially depends.\n\nThe commodities on which these duties are imposed, may be either the necessaries or the luxuries of life. Between these two divisions the line is not easily drawn. Necessaries, strictly speaking, are confined to those things, without which life cannot be supported or health preserved. Yet, though the philosopher may reason thus, the sovereign cannot confine his people within such strict limits. In regard to food indeed, which is entirely a domestic arrangement, this definition may hold; but in clothing and lodging, the arrangements of which are in the eye of the public, long custom may impose obligations of decency and propriety, which fall little short of absolute necessity. Everything, in this respect, must be considered as necessary, which a common labouring person of the lowest class cannot want, without incurring the reproach, or exciting the commiseration, of others in the same station.\n\nTaxes upon the necessaries of life have the same effect with taxes upon the wages of labour. Dr Smith, and most other writers, seem to conceive that the immediate effect of such taxes is to raise the wages of labour. But we do not see that such can be the case. Nothing can raise the wages of labour, except an augmentation of the funds destined for its support. But these funds, far from being raised by such taxes, are somewhat diminished. The employers of the poor, being themselves affected by them, will be less able to pay wages than before. It is quite a fallacy to urge, that the labourer, if he does not get sufficient wages, will refuse to work. This might be, if the tax affected only a certain class of labourers, and left the rest free. The labourer, if he could not, over and above the tax, obtain the regular standard rate, would withdraw to other employments. The consequence would be, a rise in the wages of the taxed labour, with a slight fall in those of every other, proportioned to the additional number who would thus be thrown upon it. But where the tax falls equally upon labour of every description, as taxes upon the necessaries of life must do, there is no new quarter to which the labourer can turn; there is nothing either to raise or to lower wages; the supply of and demand for labour continue the same. The effect of the tax is merely to diminish the subsistence of the labourer in proportion to its amount.\n\nThis, however, is merely the first effect; for the diminished subsistence will soon begin to act upon the population, which furnishes the supply of labour. Were wages at the time so low as to furnish merely the necessaries of life according to the first definition, that is, such necessaries as it could not subsist without, the inevitable consequence seems to be, that part of the labouring poor must perish for want. Such a calamitous effect seems actually to result, in the crowded population of some eastern empires, when a deficient crop produces a scarcity of subsistence. Happily, however, the labouring poor are seldom so wholly without resource. In general the wages are sufficient to allow them a portion of the other description of necessaries, and even of luxuries, by retrenching which, they can, in the event of such a tax, preserve themselves from absolute starvation. In the end, however, the discouragement to marriage, and difficulty of rearing children, will reduce the population. This reduction, diminishing the supply of labour, will increase wages, till they cover the amount of the tax. The same sum, divided among a smaller number will make more to each.\n\nHigh wages operate as a complete tax upon every species of manufactured produce. The manufacturer must charge upon the price of his goods the whole sum which he has paid to his workmen with a profit. In the market of the world, therefore, he must, ceteris paribus, be underbought by the manufacturer who resides in a country where labour is cheaper. When these high prices, however, are the result of national prosperity, when they improve the subsistence of the labourer, and lay a foundation for increased population, this disadvantage will weigh very light in the balance. But where they are the result of diminished population, and attended with no improvement in the condition of the labouring poor, they form one of the greatest evils with which a nation can be afflicted.\n\nFor these reasons, taxes upon the necessaries of life, though certainly productive, have always been found to be oppressive and ruinous to the prosperity of a state. Luxuries, therefore, form the proper objects of taxation. As every one, if unable to purchase his usual quantity, can either diminish it or abstain altogether, the rise of the article has no tendency to induce such a degree of want, as to check population, and thus cause a rise to the wages of labour. This power of abstinence may indeed lead to a certain inequality; but as this inequality is altogether voluntary, it can neither excite murmuring, nor be considered as a serious hardship. The greatest irregularity is in the case of absentees, by whom such taxes are evaded altogether.\n\nIt is not, however, we must observe, from the mere luxuries of show and ostentation that any important or permanent revenue is to be drawn. These are confined chiefly to persons of large fortune, who are few in number, and are always subject to the influence of fashion, so that little dependence can be placed on their regular consumption. The luxuries from which alone a great\nrevenue can be drawn are those which, among the higher and middling classes, have come to be considered almost as necessaries, and which are extensively used by such as are in easy circumstances, even among the lower orders. The only drink necessary for supporting the human constitution in perfect health, seems to be pure water. Men, however, have an universal propensity for something more, both to gratify their taste, and to exhilarate their spirits. Fermented and spirituous liquors, tea, coffee, &c., are had recourse to with this view, and are habitually used in various forms and degrees, by almost every inhabitant of this country. Such articles form therefore the grand basis of this system of taxation.\n\nOf all superfluities, tea seems to be one of the greatest. It affords neither nourishment nor strength, and is generally considered by physicians as injurious to the human constitution. Being imported besides from a remote country, the intercourse with which was, by the mercantile system, stigmatized as injurious, it was considered as every way a fair subject of taxation. Very high duties were accordingly accumulated upon it, which, in 1783 amounted to nearly 30 per cent. on the value, besides an excise of 1s. on every pound. It was found that so high a duty opened a wide door to the smuggling of a commodity of so small bulk, and which was then imported in large quantities by all the neighbouring countries. It was calculated, that though duty was paid on five or six millions of pounds, the consumption of Great Britain amounted to more than double that quantity. A plan was therefore brought forward by Mr Pitt to substitute in its room an additional tax on windows. Smuggling was no doubt checked, and the people were, on the whole, gainers; yet the new tax, being assisted, was more heavily felt by the public than its predecessor, which was only a duty on consumption. Since that time, the exigency of the times has made it again necessary to have recourse to this article; and the tax upon tea has been raised even higher than it was previous to the commutation tax. The diminution, however, of the Indian trade carried on by the other powers, joined to the stricter precautions against smuggling, has prevented its renewal to nearly the same extent as formerly. Tobacco is still more complete superfluity than tea, yet its use is very extensive. It has therefore been justly considered as one of the prettiest of all subjects of taxation, and duties have been laid upon it, amounting to five or six times the original value of the article.\n\nWine is the wholesomest of all fermented liquors, and is even pretty extensively used as a medicine. These circumstances might seem to entitle it to some favour, which, however, it has not experienced. Being entirely a foreign commodity, and being particularly cultivated by a nation long the object of our commercial jealousy, it has incurred the decided hostility of the mercantile system. Duties have been imposed, considerably exceeding the original value. A preference has also been thrown to the wines of Portugal and Spain, (though inferior in quality), which has rendered them the common drink of this country.\n\nSpirits are an article extensively consumed in this country, and on which a high duty may, with the greatest propriety, be imposed, for the purposes not only of revenue, but of moral regulation. They afford no nourishment, and are in the highest degree liable to abuse. They are affected by the general tax on malt; but pay, besides, a considerable one when manufactured. In order to obviate the smuggling which was carried to a great extent in the making of spirits, it has been found advisable to lay the duty on the still, in proportion to its contents. It is paid by the month; and the distiller, when he chooses at any time to intermit his operations for that period, may, by giving due notice to the officers of revenue, avoid being charged. When this plan was first adopted, the duty was comparatively very low. But Mr Pitt soon found himself completely deceived as to the productiveness of this rate of duty. It was raised therefore successively to 16l. its present rate. This system lays the distiller under a temptation to work very rapidly, which is supposed to be injurious to the quality of the spirits. It obliges them also to work without intermission, which they did at first without even the exception of Sunday, till that practice was prohibited by the legislature. It may be proper to notice, that this mode of imposition is confined to Scotland, and that in England it is laid upon the worst or wash.\n\nFermented liquors from malt are much more useful. They are the most nutritive perhaps of any species of drink, and are on that account well suited to those who are engaged in hard labour. Neither do they offer the same temptations to excess; yet their extensive use, and the necessity of raising a revenue, have led the legislature to consider them as a staple subject of taxation, and they are now charged with a duty of nearly 100 per cent. Dr Smith advises the transference of the whole tax on beer to the malt tax. The latter appears to be less liable to smuggling, and it obviates the present exemption enjoyed by private brewers, which is evidently unreasonable and unequal. The only objection seems to be, that, being imposed at an earlier period of the manufacture, it obliges the manufacturer to lie longer out of his advance, and consequently to demand a greater profit; though this might perhaps be obviated by allowing him a longer credit. The additional taxes, however, imposed upon this article, have been all laid upon beer or porter. In general, it would appear that considerable unnecessary trouble is occasioned by taxing successively different stages of a manufacture. By laying the whole either upon malt, or upon beer, a considerable expense of collection might be saved, without any diminution of the produce.\n\nThere are many species of food which cannot, strictly speaking, be considered as necessaries of life, since their place can be supplied by some less expensive substitute. Butcher meat can be supplied by eggs, butter, and other products of milk; wheaten bread by other bread of inferior grains. It may be observed, however, that the imposition of a tax on the superior article would produce an increased demand for the inferior; and consequently raise its price. Accordingly, both butcher meat and wheaten bread are universally numbered among the necessaries of life; nor do we recollect, in the British system of taxation, any influence of solid food liable to duty. This is not the case in other countries, particularly in Holland. Heavy taxes are there imposed upon both articles. All butcher meat pays a duty of more than 7 per cent. of its value. All cattle, besides, pay about 5s. per annum. The tax upon ground corn is also very heavy and undistinguishing. Wheat pays.\nTaxation pays 164 florins (nearly 9l.) per last. Nor are the inferior grains entirely exempted. Rye pays 42 florins (about 3l. 10s.); barley, beans, and oats, about 2l.\n\nSmith is not disposed to censure these heavy impositions, as they may have been rendered necessary by the long wars in which this people were engaged for the support of their independence; and when proper subjects of taxation are exhausted, recourse must be had to improper ones. Upon examining the list, however, of Dutch taxes, we do not find that the taxes upon articles of luxury are so very high, as to have reduced the legislators of that country to such an extremity. The excise upon the gallon of wine, equal to 40 English gallons, is only 14 florins, or about 1l. 5s. Tobacco, so far an article of taxation, and so much used in Holland, is taxed only by a flight licence, estimated at little more than a halfpenny a pound. Beer and spirits are taxed still more moderately than wine. Besides, even supposing all the articles of luxury to be exhausted, we should conceive it more advisable to have recourse to assessments upon income to the necessary extent, than to duties upon articles of necessity. Accordingly, in this country, a larger revenue in proportion to the population, is now raised than ever was raised in Holland, without having recourse to these ruinous resources.\n\nClothes and furniture are, to a certain extent, as much necessaries of life as food. The quantity of them, however, which comes under this description, is much less; by far the greater part of the expense which is laid out in this way being for the purpose of convenience at most, if not of mere show and ostentation. There seems therefore no reason for sparing any, beyond those plainest articles which decency demands from the lowest of the people. This class of commodities, however, has met with peculiar indulgence, in consequence of the favour entertained by the mercantile system for manufactures of every kind. Woollens and hardwares, the two staples of England, have been completely exempted. The same favour has been shown to linen, the staple of the sister kingdoms. Yet, provided a corresponding drawback were allowed on exportation, there does not appear any good reason why the finer sorts of all these fabrics should not be made a subject of revenue. Printed linens and cottons, which have recently been so abundantly produced both in England and Scotland, have been made to pay a considerable tax.\n\nBut though the legislature of this country has been thus laudably attentive to avoid touching on the first necessaries of life, there are still several particulars in which it has failed. One of the most important of these is coal, an article of the first utility, the universal fuel of this country, and the material of many of its most important manufactures. It is the least able to bear any duty, because from its local and bulky nature, the expense of transport is often very heavy. London is supplied with coal from Newcastle, which is 300 miles distant. If a bounty could be given in any case be advisable, it would be in such a case. The legislature, however, has judged otherwise, and has imposed upon every ton of sea-borne coal, a duty of 3s. 6d. Coals carried by land or inland navigation are duty free. Through the exertion of Lord Melville, Scotland, to the north of St Abb's Head, has been freed from this duty; a circumstance which has materially contributed to her rapid prosperity.\n\nSalt, though it may not be requisite for the support of life, has yet, by immemorial usage among civilized nations, been constituted a necessary of life. Notwithstanding this, the small quantity used by each individual, and the minute portions in which it is purchased, make a tax upon it be levied with less murmuring than most other taxes. Governments, taking advantage of this circumstance, have almost universally made it a source of revenue.\n\nIn this country the tax on this article presses with the greatest severity, as salt is essential to the fishery, one of the most important sources of national wealth. It is true, the duty is drawn back, when salt is so employed; but the facility of smuggling by means of this drawback, produces the necessity of strict regulations, which clamp extremely this branch of industry, especially when carried on in that small scale which is peculiarly suited to it.\n\nLeather, soap, and candles, are also necessaries of life taxed in this country. But though these articles are to a certain extent necessary, by far the greatest consumption of them is for purposes of luxury. Although therefore these taxes do press upon the poor, their weight is not very severe. It might seem easy enough, at least in the first and last of them, to exempt those coarser forms of the commodity, which are used by the lower classes, and thus the deficiency of revenue might be compensated by an increase on the more expensive forms.\n\nTaxes may be imposed either upon exportation or importation. The duties of customs were at first levied on both indiscriminately; but as the mercantile system gained ground, and an anxious desire prevailed to encourage exportation and check importation, in the hope of increasing the specie in the country, all the new duties were laid upon the latter, while the former was more and more exempted. Although this system may not have taken its rise from the most enlightened views, yet no reasonable exception can be taken to it. The taxes imposed by any government ought to fall upon the consumption of its own people, not upon that of others; and as this is a maxim of justice, so it is equally recommended by policy. Were a government to tax its own exported commodities, these commodities would also have to pay the taxes of the country into which they were imported. Loaded with this double burden, they could not advantageously come into competition with similar articles, either the produce of that country, or imported from another which followed a more liberal policy. It is only therefore upon goods imported or produced for home consumption, that these taxes can with propriety fall. From similar views, the materials of manufacture have been generally exempted from duty. We have already observed, that, provided these manufactures be objects of luxury, there is no good reason why they should not pay a tax. But there is an evident advantage in levying the duty after, rather than before, the manufacturing process. In the latter case, the merchant, being obliged to advance it so early, must have a profit on his advance, proportioned to the length of time which elapses till the commodity is fit for sale; and this profit must be paid by the consumer in the price of the goods.\n\nShould we suppose indeed a nation to possess a monopoly of any particular commodity, such a nation might impose\nTaxation impose a tax on its export, without danger of its merchants being supplanted in the foreign market. Still this could not but be considered as a somewhat illiberal system; and it would also bear hard upon the producer, who would still probably have a double system of duties to pay, since it cannot be supposed that the foreign country should regard these monopolized commodities with peculiar favour.\n\nWith the view of following up the principles of the mercantile system, importation duties have often been laid upon goods, so heavy as to amount to a prohibition. Such duties are not intended to produce any revenue, but to favour some home manufacture, or to injure that of some foreign nation, which is an object of commercial jealousy. In the same manner, bounties are given to forward the growth of some branch of industry, which is the object of peculiar favour. In both cases, the revenue is sacrificed, without any real advantage accruing to the public. The industry and capital of the nation are thus turned from their natural direction into one which is less advantageous, and the public is injured instead of being benefited.\n\nIt is an undoubted principle, that whether the tax be paid at the time of importation, or at manufacture, it ought to be paid only once. Some governments, profoundly ignorant of the true principles of political economy, have repeated the imposition at every successive sale of the property. This is obviously unequal. The value of property, and the frequency of its transference, are two things altogether distinct. One species of goods may thus come to pay ten or twelve times as much as another of the same value. But great as is its inequality, its impolicy is still more glaring. It forms the most powerful check to that free interchange of commodities which is the very soul of all industry. It tends to confine the consumption of every article to the place of its production, and thus to exclude all those benefits which arise from the extension of the market.\n\nOf this ruinous nature is the Spanish alcavala, which consists in an imposition, originally of 10, but now only of 6 per cent. on every sale without exception, whatever be the nature of the property, or however frequently repeated. The mere undistinguishing nature of such a tax must be a great evil; but it is rendered far more pernicious by the obstruction which it thus throws in the way of every species of commercial intercourse.\n\nIt may be established as a principle in regard to these taxes, that they ought to be as uniform as possible, and not to vary in different parts of the country. Such variations necessarily lead to restraints on the free circulation of commodities. Each province becomes as an independent kingdom, the frontier of which is guarded by customhouses and by chains of officers, through which whoever passes must submit not only to the payment of duties, but to the inconvenience and delay of having his goods searched. Such was the case both in France and in Spain, where each province having formerly been separate and independent, retained still its distinct system of taxation. The transporting of goods from one province to another was like exporting them to a foreign country; the same barriers of customhouses, duties, and revenue officers, obstructed their passage. One of the circumstances which has most contributed to the prosperity of Great Britain is the uniformity of taxation throughout, and consequently the entire freedom of commerce from one part of the island to the other. This was the principal advantage which Scotland derived from the union; and it has been such as fully to compensate for the increased burdens to which that measure subjected her.\n\nDuties upon consumption, instead of being levied upon the trader, may be levied upon the person consuming, who may be made to pay a certain sum as a licence to use the commodity. Such a mode of levy has some of the advantages of affected taxes, in regard to the facility and cheapness of collection. It is still also in some degree spontaneous; but it must obviously be, in most cases, very unequal. Of two persons, who should pay the same sum for a licence to use wine, one might consume twenty times the quantity of the other. A licence has besides the disadvantage of being paid all at once, and of being more sensibly felt than taxes which confound themselves with the price of the commodity. In general, therefore, it is a much less eligible form. There are a few instances, however, of very costly and durable goods, such as coaches, plate, &c. where it is found to be the most convenient. Wine and other liquors, when consumed in taverns, may, it is supposed, be fairly required to pay more than when consumed in private houses. An attempt, however, to proportion this addition to the quantity consumed, would be attended with unsurmountable difficulties. A licence is therefore required to be taken out by innkeepers who deal in these articles. This tax falls with equal weight upon the great and small dealers; but it may be rather considered as desirable to check the multiplication of the last.\n\n3. Stamp Duties.—Under the title of stamp duties, we would include all those which fall upon the deeds which regulate the transference of property.\n\nThe first of these duties, of which we find any mention, are those upon testamentary donations. A law of Augustus imposed the vicejima hereditatim, or twentieth penny, upon all inheritances. It was in Holland, however, which was pressed by the severest necessity of raising a revenue, and not very discriminating in the mode of doing it, that the system of stamp duties first originated, and was carried to a formidable extent. Such were the difficulties of that state, that they are said to have publicly proposed a reward to any one who should suggest a new source of revenue. This plan was proposed and approved. From Holland it was, in 1671, imported into this country, and has since become one of the great sources of public income. In other countries, deeds regarding the transference of property are required to be entered in a public register, and the tax laid on the registration. A considerable revenue was thus raised in France. Auction duties upon the sale of property, both moveable and immoveable, though somewhat different in point of form, coincide exactly with these taxes in their essence and tendency.\n\nTaxes of this nature are attended with considerable conveniences to the contributors. From the nature of the transaction, there must always be money in hand with which the tax can be paid; and the time of payment is thus the most convenient of any. In many cases, the sum to be paid at a time is small. It is only part of the society which is liable to them to any great extent, and they only occasionally; they are not felt as intrenching on daily and habitual comforts; nor do they\nTaxation they excite that general murmur, which is alone formidable to government. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if the latter should avail themselves of this passive disposition in the people for the extension of this source of supply. The truth is, however, that in all essential respects, these taxes are among the most impractical.\n\n1. They are unequal, inasmuch as the value of any property is altogether unconnected with the frequency of its transference. This inequality would subsist, even though the stamp duty were always in exact proportion to the value of the property. But this is, in general, far from being strictly the case. It may be noticed, however, that in the recent additions made to the stamp duties in this country, the principle of equality has been more attended to.\n\n2. The greater part of such taxes fall not upon the income, but upon the capital of the country; not upon that fund which may be properly and safely expended, but upon that, the expenditure of which must be ultimately ruinous. This circumstance is peculiar to these duties; for though others, when very severe, may oblige the contributor to encroach on his capital, they alone fall directly and immediately upon that fund. An objection of this nature would alone be sufficient to dissuade their adoption.\n\n3. Such taxes, when they fall upon moveable goods, have a direct tendency to check commerce, and through it every kind of industry. They are then a complete alarum, differing from that ruinous impost only by being more moderate.\n\nThus we find, that the facility of collection, and the avoiding of discontent, which have tempted modern governments to extend so much this source of revenue, are altogether fallacious advantages, and bear no proportion to the ill consequences with which such taxes are necessarily attended. It would therefore be much better that the duties upon the transference of moveable goods should be laid upon their original production. They would thus pay only once, and no impediment would be thrown in the way of their free circulation. Duties upon the sale of land and other immoveable goods, ought to be converted into affected taxes, payable on their yearly use. In the present circumstances of this country indeed, it is perhaps too much to expect that taxes, which are paid without much murmuring, should be taken off; but the considerations now stated ought certainly to deter from any farther addition to them.\n\nLegacies from any distant relation are a sort of accidental and unexpected advantage, and it is therefore to be supposed, that the person receiving will have secured a regular source of subsistence independent of them. He will not therefore, it is likely, be disposed to complain very grievously, if this extrinsic source of wealth be somewhat diminished by a duty to government. In this country, accordingly, such legacies are chargeable with a duty of 10 per cent. This tax seems one of the most unexceptionable of the kind, and only liable to the objection of falling upon capital. It is otherwise with money left by a father or other very near relation. The death of such persons commonly diminishes, instead of increasing, the wealth of the family; and the sum left forms often the sole dependance of a great part of it. Accordingly, in Great Britain, the duty on legacies to the nearest relations is very slight, and gradually increases as the consanguinity becomes more remote.\n\nReceipt stamps, though they are formally paid by the seller, fall really upon the purchaser. The merchant, who must have his profit, will calculate the expense which he is likely to be at in stamps, and will lay a corresponding augmentation on the price of his goods. Such taxes, unless very heavy, will fall upon income only, not upon capital.\n\nBills of exchange, and policies of insurance, being necessary instruments of trade, seem as improper subjects of taxation as can well be. The only thing tolerable in these taxes, as imposed in this country, is their moderation.\n\nAuction duties seem liable to every objection which can be stated against taxes of this description. They are the more severe, as they must fall often upon unfortunate persons who are reduced to the necessity of disposing, in this manner, of their property.\n\nStamps upon law proceedings tend to increase the expense of obtaining justice, which is already complained of in general as too heavy. They may indeed be supposed to be of some use in checking a litigious spirit; but this seems already to be done pretty effectually by the other expenses attendant on judicial proceedings.\n\nTaxes upon indentures, or upon the entrance to any profession, produce a monopoly to the persons exercising that profession. They thus tend at once to raise the price of their labour and of its fruits, and to diminish the necessity of qualifying themselves for its performance. The chief weight of these taxes falls upon the persons exercising the profession of the law. The public are apt to regard such persons with a degree of hostility, which has probably induced government to believe it might tax them without danger of exciting any general murmur. The truth is, however, that these taxes fall not on the practitioners themselves, but on those who complain of them, on the persons engaged in litigation; so that their effect is precisely the same with that of taxes on law proceedings. It differs from them only as a licence differs from a duty upon commodities, and is less eligible, as falling more unequally. The persons who pay the same sum at entrance, carry on their profession with very different degrees of success.\n\nSome impositions, which assume the form of stamp duties, are in reality taxes upon commodities. Such are the game duty, the duty on cards, hats, plate, &c. But most of these seem to be unexceptionable subjects.\n\n**TAXUS**, the Yew-tree, a genus of plants belonging to the class dioecia, and in the natural system ranging under the 5th order, Coniferae. See Botany Index.\n\n**TAY**, in Latin **Tavir**, or **Taur**, the largest river in Scotland, rises in Braidalbane, on the frontiers of Lorn; and having in the passage of a few miles augmented its stream by the accession of several small rills, spreads itself into the lake called Loch Dochart; out of which having run but a little space, it expands itself again. Leaving this second lake, it rolls some miles with a considerable body of water, and then diffuses itself in the spacious Loch Tay; which, reckoning from the sources of the river, is 24 miles in length, though, strictly speaking,\nspeaking, the lake is but 13: almost as soon as it issues from hence, it receives the river Lyon, coming out of Loch Lyon, and running through Glen Lyon; which, having travelled in a manner parallel to it, from its source, for a space of 25 miles, at length joins the Tay as it enters Athol, which it next traverses, and, directing its course in a manner due east, receives almost all the waters of that country. Bending then to the south, at the distance of five miles, it reaches Dunkeld; which, in the language of our ancestors, signifies \"the hill of hazels,\" was the very centre of the old Caledonia, and is at present esteemed the heart of the Highlands. The river is very broad here, insomuch that there is a ferry-boat over it at each end of the town. Declining still to the south-east, with a winding course, for above 12 miles, the Tay receives a large supply of waters from the county of Angus; and then running south-west for eight miles more, is joined in that space by several rivers, the most considerable of which is the Almond. Turning then to the south-east, at the distance of about three miles, this copious river comes with a swelling stream to Perth.\n\nThe Tay, continuing still a south-east course, receives, a few miles below Perth, the river Erne; which, issuing from a loch of the same name, traverses the county of Strathern, and passes by Abernethy, once the capital of the Pictish kingdom. Swelled by the waters of this last river, the Tay, running next directly east, enlarges itself till it becomes about three miles broad; but contracts again before the town of Dundee; soon after which it opens into the German ocean. At the entrance of the frith, there are sands both on the north and on the south side; the former styled Goa, the latter Aberlay and Drumlan; and before these, in the very mouth of the frith, those which are called the Crofs Sands. At Buttonness, which is the northern promontory, there are two light-houses. The space between the north and the south sands may be near a mile, with about three fathoms water; but being within the frith, it grows deeper, and in the road of Dundee is full six fathoms. The frith of Tay is not indeed so large or so commodious as that of Forth, but from Buttonness to Perth it is not less than 40 miles; and the whole may be, without any great impropriety, styled a harbour, which has Fife on one side, and the shires of Perth and Angus on the other, both very fertile and pleasant countries.\n\nTAYLOR, DR JEREMY, bishop of Down and Connor in Ireland, was the son of a barber at Cambridge, where he was educated. Upon entering into orders, he became divinity lecturer of St Paul's in London; and was, by the interest of Archbishop Laud, elected fellow of All souls college, Cambridge, in 1636. Two years after he became one of the chaplains of the archbishop, who bestowed on him the rectory of Uppingham in Rutlandshire. In 1642, he was chaplain to the king; and frequent preacher before him and the court at Oxford. He afterward attended in the king's army in the condition of a chaplain. Upon the declining of his majesty's cause, he retired into Wales, where he was permitted to officiate as minister, and to keep a school, in order to maintain himself and his children. In this retirement he wrote several of his works. Having spent several years there, his family was visited with sickness; and he lost three sons of great hopes within the space of two or three months. This affliction touched him so sensibly, that it made him desirous to leave the country; and, going to London, he for a time officiated in a private congregation of loyalists to his great hazard. At length meeting with Edward lord Conway, that nobleman carried him over with him into Ireland, and settled him at Portmore, where he wrote his Ductor Dubitantium. Upon the Restoration he returned to England. Soon after, he was advanced to the bishopric of Down and Connor in Ireland; and had the administration of the see of Dromore granted to him. He was likewise made privy-counsellor and vice-chancellor of the university of Dublin; which place he held till his death. He died of a fever at Liffegarry in 1667, and was interred in a chapel which he himself had built on the ruins of the old cathedral of Dromore.\n\nTAYLOR, DR BROOK, was born at Edmonton, August 18th 1685. He was the son of John Taylor, Esq., of Bifrons-house in Kent, by Olivia, daughter of Sir Nicholas Tempest, of Durham, Baronet. His grandfather, Nathaniel Taylor, was one of those puritans whom Cromwell thought fit to elect by a letter, dated June 14th 1653, to represent the county of Bedford in parliament. The character of his father partook in no small degree of the austerity that had been transmitted to him in the line of his ancestors, and by the spirit of the times in which they lived; and to this cause may be ascribed the disaffection which sometimes subsisted between the father and even such a son as is the subject of this article. The old gentleman's morose temper, however, yielded to the powers of music; and the most eminent professors of the art in that period were hopefully welcomed in his house. His son Brook was induced, by his natural genius, and by the disposition of his father, which he wished by all the means in his power to conciliate, to direct his particular attention to music; and he became in very early life a distinguished proficient in it.—\"In a large family piece, he is represented at the age of 13 sitting in the centre of his brothers and sisters; the two elder of whom, Olivia and Mary, crown him with laurel, bearing the insignia of harmony.\"\n\nTo music he added another accomplishment, in which he equally excelled. \"His drawings and paintings, of which some are still preserved, require not those allowances for error or imperfection with which we scan the performances of even the superior dilettanti;—they will bear the test of scrutiny and criticism from artists themselves, and those of the first genius and professional abilities.\" Though he was eminent in the culture and practice both of music and drawing in his early youth, his whole attention was not occupied by these fascinating arts. His classical education was conducted at home under a private tutor; and his proficiency in the ordinary branches of the languages and the mathematics was so great, that he was deemed qualified for the university at the early age of 15.\n\nIn 1701 he was entered a fellow commoner of St John's College, Cambridge. At that period mathematics engaged more particularly the attention of the university; and the examples of eminence in the learned world, derived from that branch of science, attracted the notice and roused the emulation of every youth polished of talents and of application. We may presume, that Brook Taylor, from the very hour of his admission at\nTaylor, at college, adopted the course of study which a Machin, a Keil, and, above all, a Newton, had opened to the mind of man, as leading to discoveries of the celestial system.—That he applied early to these studies, and without remission, is to be inferred from the early notice and kind attention with which he was honoured by those eminent persons, and from the extraordinary progress which he made in their favourite science.\n\nIn 1708 he wrote his treatise On the Centre of Oscillation, which was not published in the Philosophical Transactions till some years afterwards. In 1709, he took his degree of Bachelor of Laws. In 1712, he was chosen a Fellow of the Royal Society. During the interval between these two periods, he corresponded with Professor Keil on several of the most abstruse subjects of mathematical disquisition. Sir William Young informs us, that he has in his possession a letter, dated in 1712, addressed to Mr Machin, which contains at length a solution of Kepler's problem, and marking the use to be derived from that solution. In this year he presented to the Royal Society three different papers: one On the Ascend of Water between two Glass Planes; a second, On the Centre of Oscillation; and a third, On the Motion of a Stretched String. It appears from his correspondence with Keil, that in 1713 he presented a paper on his favourite subject of Music; but this is not preserved in the Transactions.\n\nHis distinguished proficiency in those branches of science, which engaged the particular attention of the Royal Society at this period, and which embroiled them in contests with foreign academies, recommended him to the notice of its most illustrious members; and in 1714 he was elected to the office of secretary. In this year he took at Cambridge his degree of Doctor of Laws: and at this time he transmitted, in a letter to Sir Hans Sloane, An Account of some curious Experiments relative to Magnetism; which, however, was not delivered to the Society till many years afterward, when it was printed in the Transactions. His application to those studies to which his genius inclined was indefatigable; for we find that in 1715 he published in Latin his Methodus Incrementorum; also a curious essay preserved in the Philosophical Transactions, entitled An Account of an Experiment for the Discovery of the Laws of Magnetic Attraction; likewise a treatise well known to mathematicians, and highly valued by the best judges, On the Principles of Linear Perspective. In the same year (such were his admirable talents, and so capable were they of being directed to various subjects), he conducted a controversial correspondence with the Count Raymond de Montmort, on the Tenets of Malebranche; which occasioned his being particularly noticed in the eulogium pronounced by the French academy on the decease of that eminent metaphysician.\n\nThe new philosophy of Newton (as it was then called) engaged the attention of mathematicians and philosophers both at home and abroad. At Paris it was in high estimation; and the men of science in that city were desirous of obtaining a personal acquaintance with the learned secretary of the Royal Society, whose reputation was so generally acknowledged, and who had particularly distinguished himself in the Leibnitzian or German controversy, as we may denominate it, of that period. In consequence of many urgent invitations, he determined to visit his friends at Paris in the year 1716. He was received with every possible token of affection and respect; and had an opportunity of displaying many traits of character, which mark the general scholar and accomplished gentleman, as well as the profound mathematician. His company was courted by all \"who had temper to enjoy, or talents to improve, the charms of social intercourse.\" Besides the mathematicians, to whom he had always free access, he was here introduced to Lord Bolingbroke, the Count de Caylus, and Bishop Bossuet.\n\nEarly in 1717 he returned to London, and composed three treatises, which were presented to the Royal Society, and published in the 30th volume of the Transactions. About this time his intense application had impaired his health to a considerable degree; and he was under the necessity of repairing, for relaxation and relief, to Aix-la-Chapelle. Having likewise a desire of directing his attention to subjects of moral and religious speculation, he resigned his office of secretary to the Royal Society in 1718.\n\nAfter his return to England in 1719, he applied to subjects of a very different kind from those that had employed the thoughts and labours of his more early life. Among his papers of this date, Sir William Young has found detached parts of A Treatise on the Jewish Sacrifices, and a dissertation of considerable length On the Lawfulness of eating Blood. He did not, however, wholly neglect his former subjects of study, but employed his leisure hours in combining science and art; with this view he revised and improved his treatise on Linear Perspective. Drawing continued to be his favourite amusement to his latest hour; and it is not improbable, that his valuable life was shortened by the sedentary habits which this amusement, succeeding his severer studies, occasioned. \"He drew figures with extraordinary precision and beauty of pencil. Landscape was yet his favourite branch of design. His original landscapes are mostly painted in water colours, but with all the richness and strength of oils. They have a force of colour, a freedom of touch, a varied disposition of planes of distance, and a learned use of aerial as well as linear perspective, which all professional men who have seen these paintings have admired.\n\nThe work of Dr Brook Taylor in linear perspective was censured by Bernoulli, in a treatise published in the Acts of Leipzig, as \"abstruse to all, and as unintelligible to artists for whom it was more especially written.\" It must be acknowledged that this excellent work, for so it deserves to be called, was not level to the apprehensions of practitioners in the art of drawing and design; but it was much esteemed by mathematicians. Three editions of it have been published; and as it is now scarce, a republication of it in its most improved and perfect state would be very acceptable. Mr Kirby, however, has made it more plain and popular, in his treatise entitled \"Brook Taylor's Perspective made easy;\" and this book, detailing and illustrating the principles of the original work, has been the vade mecum of artists. Dr Brook Taylor was incensed by the invidious attacks of Bernoulli; and he published An Apology against J. Bernoulli's Objections, which may be seen in the 30th volume of the Philosophical Transactions. Bernoulli, with his usual envy of British mathematicians, had disputed our author's right to his own work.\nwork. We have no reason to doubt Dr Taylor's claims to the undecided discovery of the method which he describes, though he is not an original inventor. This method was long before published by Guido Ubaldi, in his Perspective, printed at Pefaro in 1660; where it is delivered very clearly, and confirmed by most elegant demonstrations; and where it is actually applied to the art of delineating the scenes of a theatre.\n\nToward the end of the year 1720, Dr Brook Taylor accepted the invitation of Lord Bolinbroke to spend some time at La Source, a country-seat near Orleans, which he held in right of his wife, the widow of the Marquis de Villette, nephew of Madame de Maintenon. In the next year he returned to England, and published the last paper which appears with his name in the Philosophical Transactions, entitled, An Experiment made to ascertain the Proportion of Expansion of Liquor in the Thermometer, with regard to the degree of Heat.\n\nIn 1721, Dr Brook Taylor married Miss Bridges of Wallington in the county of Surry, a young lady of good family, but of small fortune; and this marriage occasioned a rupture with his father, whose consent he had never obtained. The death of this lady in 1725, and that of an infant son, whom the parents regarded as the prelude and pledge of reconciliation with the father, and who actually proved such, deeply affected the sensibility of Dr Taylor. However, during the two succeeding years he resided with his father at Bifrons, where \"the musical parties, so agreeable to his taste and early proficiency, and the affectionate attentions of a numerous family welcoming an amiable brother, so long estranged by paternal resentment, not only soothed his sorrows, but ultimately engaged him to a scene of country retirement, and domesticated and fixed his habits of life. He could no more recur to the delitory resources and cold solace of society, which casual visits, flight acquaintance, and distant friendships, afford the man—who hath none to make, and cheer a constant home.\"\n\nIn 1725 he formed a new connection; and with the full approbation of his father and family, married Sabetta, daughter of John Sawbridge, Esq. of Olantigh, in Kent. In 1729, on the death of his father, he succeeded to the family estate of Bifrons. In the following year he lost his wife in childbirth. The daughter whose birth occasioned this melancholy event survived, and became the mother of Sir William Young, to whom we owe these memoirs of his grandfather.\n\nIn the interval that elapsed between the years 1721 and 1730, no production by Brook Taylor appears in the Philosophical Transactions; nor did he publish in the course of that time any work. His biographer has found no traces of his learned labour, excepting a Treatise of Logarithms, which was committed to his friend Lord Pailsey (afterward Abercorn), in order to be prepared for the press; but which probably never was printed. His health was now much impaired; relaxation became necessary, and he was diverted by new connections from the habit of severe study, which had distinguished the early period of his life, and which had contributed to contract the duration of it. Happy in the social circle of domestic enjoyment, and devoting his attention to business or amusement as they occurred, his application and his literary emulation seem to have declined. He did not long survive the loss of his second wife; and his remaining days were days of increasing imbecility and sorrow.\n\n\"The essay entitled Contemplatio Philosophica, published by Sir William Young, 1793, appears to have been written about this time, and probably with a view to abstract his mind from painful recollections and regret. It was the effort of a strong mind, and is a most remarkable example of the close logic of the mathematician applied to metaphysics. But the blow was too deep at heart for study to afford more than temporary relief. The very resource was hurtful, and intense study but accelerated the decline of his health. His friends offered every comfort; in particular Lord Bolinbroke pressed his consolation, and sought to call his mind from regret of domestic endearments to social friendship at Dawley.\n\nThe attention and kindness of his friends, however, could not ward off the approaches of dissolution. Having survived his second wife little more than a year, Dr Brook Taylor died of a decline in the 46th year of his age, December the 29th 1731, and was buried in the church-yard of St Ann's, Soho. I am spared (says his descendant) the necessity of closing this biographical sketch with a prolix detail of his character: in the best acceptation of duties relative to each situation of life in which he was engaged, his own writings, and the writings of those who best knew him, prove him to have been the finished Christian, gentleman, and scholar.\"\n\nTaylor-Bird. See Motacilla, Ornithology Index.\n\nTea, the dried leaves of the tea plant.—A commodity with which we are so well acquainted, which affords a beverage so generally used and so generally agreeable, and which forms so considerable an article of commerce, must excite curiosity to know something of its history, and of the nature of the plant from which it is obtained.\n\nThe tea plant is a native of Japan, China, and Tonquin, and has not, as far as we can learn, been found growing spontaneously in any other parts of the world. Linnaeus arranged it under the class of polyandria, and order of monogynia; and Thunberg, one of the most distinguished pupils of that illustrious botanist, who resided 16 months in Batavia and Japan, has classified it in the same manner as his master. Several of the British botanists, on the other hand, refer it to the order of trigynia; deriving their authority from a plant in the duke of Northumberland's garden at Sion-house, which had three styles.\n\nLinnaeus says that there are two species of the tea plant; the bohea, the corolla of which has six petals; and the viridis or green tea, which has nine petals. Thunberg makes only one species, the bohea, consisting of two varieties; the one with broad and the other with narrow leaves.\n\nThe tea plant, which is an evergreen, grows to the height of five or six feet; Le Compte says ten or twelve. The leaves, which are the only valuable part of it, are about an inch and a half long, narrow, indented, and tapering to a point, like those of the sweet briar, and of a dark green colour. The root is like that of the peach tree, and its flowers resemble those of the white wild rose. The stem spreads into many irregular branches.\nbranches. The wood is hard, of a whitish green colour, and the bark is of a greenish colour, with a bitter, nauseous, and astringent taste. The fruit is small, and contains several round blackish seeds, about the bigness of a bean or large pea.\n\nThis plant delights in valleys, is frequent on the sloping sides of mountains and the banks of rivers, where it enjoys a southern exposure. It flourishes in the northern latitudes of Pekin as well as round Canton, but attains the greatest perfection in the mild temperate regions of Nankin. It is said only to be found between the 32nd and 45th degree of north latitude. In Japan it is planted round the borders of fields, without regard to the soil; but as it is an important article of commerce with the Chinese, whole fields are covered with it, it is by them cultivated with care. The Abbé Rochen says, it grows equally well in a poor as in a rich soil; but that there are certain places where it is of a better quality. The tea which grows in rocky ground is superior to that which grows in a light soil; and the worst kind is that which is produced in a clay soil. It is propagated by seeds; from six to twelve are put into a hole about five inches deep, at certain distances from each other. The reason why so many seeds are sown in the same hole is said to be, that only a fifth part vegetate. Being thus sown, they grow without any other care. Some, however, manure the land, and remove the weeds; for the Chinese are as fond of good tea, and take as much pains to procure it of an excellent quality, as the Europeans do to procure excellent wine.\n\nThe leaves are not fit for being plucked till the shrub be of three years growth. In seven years it rises to a man's height; but as it then bears but few leaves, it is cut down to the stem, and this produces a new crop of fresh shoots the following summer. We are informed by Komper, that there are three seasons in which the leaves are collected in the isles of Japan, from which the tea derives different degrees of perfection.\n\nThe first gathering commences at the end of February or beginning of March. The leaves are then small, tender, and unfolded, and not above three or four days old: these are called fuk-taïna, or \"tea in powder,\" because it is pulverised; it is also called imperial tea, being generally reserved for the court and people of rank; and sometimes also it is named bloom tea. It is sold in China for 20d. or 2s. per pound. The labourers employed in collecting it do not pull the leaves by handfuls, but pick them one by one, and take every precaution that they may not break them. However long and tedious this labour may appear, they gather from 4 to 10 or 15 pounds a day.\n\nThe second crop is gathered about the end of March or beginning of April. At this season part of their leaves have attained their full growth, and the rest are not above half their size. This difference does not, however, prevent them from being all gathered indiscriminately. They are afterwards picked and sorted into different parcels, according to their age and size. The youngest, which are carefully separated from the rest, are often sold for leaves of the first crop, or for imperial tea. Tea gathered at this season is called tou-taïna, or \"Chinese tea,\" because the people of Japan infuse it, and drink it after the Chinese manner.\n\nThe third crop is gathered in the end of May or in the month of June. The leaves are then very numerous and thick, and have acquired their full growth. This kind of tea, which is called ben-taïna, is the coarsest of all, and is reserved for the common people. Some of the Japanese collect their tea only at two seasons of the year, which correspond to the second and third already mentioned; others confine themselves to one general gathering of their crop, towards the month of June: however, they always form afterwards different assortments of their leaves.\n\nThe finest and most celebrated tea of Japan is that which grows near Ud-fu, a small village situated close to the sea, and not far distant from Meaco. In the district of this village is a delightful mountain, having the same name, the climate of which is said to be extremely favourable to the culture of tea; it is therefore inclosed by a hedge, and surrounded with wide ditches, which prevent all access to it. The tea shrubs that grow on this mountain are planted in regular order, and are divided by different avenues and alleys.\n\nThe care of this place is entrusted to people who are ordered to guard the leaves from dust, and to defend them from the inclemency of the weather. The labourers who are appointed to collect the tea abstain from every kind of gross food for some weeks before they begin, that their breath and perspiration may not in the least injure the leaves. They gather them with the most scrupulous nicety, and never touch them but with very fine gloves. When this choice tea has undergone the process necessary for its preparation, it is escorted by the superintendent of the mountain and a strong guard to the emperor's court, and reserved for the use of the imperial family.\n\nAs the tea shrub grows often on the rugged banks of steep mountains, access to which is dangerous, and sometimes impracticable, the Chinese, in order to come at the leaves, are said to use a singular stratagem: These steep places are generally frequented by great numbers of monkeys, which being irritated and provoked, to revenge themselves tear off the branches, and throw them down upon those who have insulted them. The Chinese immediately collect these branches, and strip them of their leaves.\n\nWhen the tea leaves have been collected, they are exposed to the steam of boiling water; after which they are put upon plates of copper, and held over the fire until they become dry and shrivelled, and appear such as we have them in Europe. According to the testimony of Komper, tea is prepared in the same manner in the isles of Japan. \"There are to be seen there (says this traveller) public buildings erected for the purpose of preparing the fresh gathered tea. Every private person who has not suitable conveniences, or who is unacquainted with the operation, may carry his leaves thither as they dry. These buildings contain a great number of small stoves raised about three feet high, each of which has a broad plate of iron fixed over its mouth. The workmen are seated round a large table covered with mats, and are employed in rolling the tea leaves which are spread out upon them. When the iron plates are heated to a certain degree by the fire, they cover them with a few pounds of fresh gathered leaves, which being green and full of sap, crackle as soon as they touch the plate. It is then the business of the workman to stir them with his naked hands as quickly as possible, until they become so warm that he cannot easily\neasily endure the heat. He then takes off the leaves with a kind of shovel, and lays them upon mats. The people who are employed in mixing them, take a small quantity at a time, roll them in their hands always in the same direction; while others keep continually stirring them, in order that they may cool sooner, and preserve their shrivelled figure the longer. This process is repeated two or three times, and even oftener, before the tea is deposited in the warehouses. These precautions are necessary to extract all the moisture from the leaves.\n\nThe people of Japan and China generally keep their tea a year before using it, because, when quite fresh and newly gathered, it possesses a narcotic quality which hurts the brain. Imperial tea is generally preserved in porcelain vases, or in leaden or tin canisters covered with fine mats made of bamboo. Common tea is kept in narrow-mouthed earthen pots; and coarse tea, the flavour of which is not so easily injured, is packed up in baskets of straw.\n\nAn infusion of tea is the common drink of the Chinese; and indeed whenever we consider one circumstance in their situation, we must acknowledge that Providence has displayed much goodness in scattering this plant with so much profusion in the empire of China. The water is said to be unwholesome and nauseous, and would therefore perhaps, without some corrective, be unfit for the purposes of life. The Chinese pour boiling water over their tea, and leave it to infuse, as we do in Europe; but they drink it without any mixture, and even without sugar. The people of Japan reduce theirs to a fine powder, which they dilute with warm water until it has acquired the consistence of thin soup. Their manner of serving tea is as follows: They place before the company the tea equipage, and the box in which this powder is contained; they fill the cups with warm water, and taking from the box as much powder as the point of a knife can contain, throw it into each of the cups, and stir it with a tooth-pick until the liquor begins to foam; it is then presented to the company, who sip it while it is warm. According to F. du Halde, this method is not peculiar to the Japanese; it is also used in some of the provinces of China.\n\nThe first European writer who mentions tea is Giovanni Botero, an eminent Italian author, who published a treatise about the year 1592, Of the Causes of the Magnificence and Greatness of Cities. He does not indeed mention its name, but describes it in such a manner that it is impossible to mistake it. \"The Chinese (says he) have an herb out of which they press a delicate juice, which serves them for drink instead of wine: it also preserves their health, and frees them from all those evils which the immoderate use of wine produces among us.\"\n\nTea was introduced into Europe in the year 1610 by the Dutch East India Company. It is generally said, that it was first imported from Holland into England, in 1666, by the lords Arlington and Offory, who brought it into fashion among people of quality. But it was used in coffee-houses before this period, as appears from an act of parliament made in 1660, in which a duty of 8d. was laid on every gallon of the infusion sold in these places. In 1666 it was sold in London for 6s. per pound, though it did not cost more than 2s. 6d. or 3s. 6d. at Batavia. It continued at this price till 1707. In 1715 green tea began to be used; and as great quantities were then imported, the price was lessened, and the practice of drinking tea descended to the lower ranks. In 1720 the French began to send it to us by a clandestine commerce. Since that period the demand has been increasing yearly, and it has become almost a necessity of life in several parts of Europe, and among the lowest as well as the highest ranks.\n\nThe following table will give an idea of the quantity of tea imported annually into Great Britain and Ireland since 1717:\n\n| Year       | Quantity     |\n|------------|--------------|\n| From 1717 to 1726 | 700,000 lbs. |\n| 1732 to 1742    | 1,200,000    |\n| 1755 near      | 4,000,000    |\n| 1766           | 6,000,000    |\n| 1785 about     | 12,000,000   |\n| 1794 from      | 16 to 20,000,000 |\n\nBesides these immense quantities imported into Britain and Ireland, much has been brought to Europe by other nations. In 1766 the whole tea imported into Europe from China amounted to 17 millions of pounds; in 1785 it was computed to be about 19 millions of pounds.\n\nSeveral researches have been made in Europe to determine whether the tea plant grows spontaneously; but Robertson's efforts have been hitherto in vain. When India Captain Cook visited Tenerife in his last voyage, Mr. Anderson his surgeon was informed by a gentleman of acknowledged veracity, that a shrub is common near Santa Cruz which agrees exactly with the description given of the tea-plant by Linnaeus. It is considered as a weed, and large quantities are rooted out of the vineyards every year: But the Spaniards who inhabit the island sometimes make use of it, and attribute to it all the qualities of the tea imported from China.\n\nMany attempts have been made to introduce this valuable plant into Europe; but from want of proper precautions most of these attempts have miscarried. The seeds, being of an oily nature, are apt to grow rancid during a long voyage, unless proper care is taken to preserve them. There are two methods of preserving these seeds: The first is, to inclose them in wax after they have been dried in the sun; the second is, to leave them in their hulls, and shut them up closely in a box made of tin: but neither of these methods has been attended with general success, whatever care has been taken to obtain fresh seeds, or to preserve them. The best method would be, to sow fresh seeds in fine light earth immediately on leaving Canton, and to cover them with wire to secure them from rats and other animals that might attack them. The boxes ought not to be too much exposed to the air, nor to that kind of dew which rises from the sea. The earth in the boxes must neither be hard nor dry, and should from time to time be gently watered with fresh or rain water; and when the shoots begin to appear, they ought to be kept in a slight moisture, and sheltered from the sun. The tea-plants to be found in England have been procured by these means only; and though several of the young rising shoots perished, the last method proposed is probably that which may be followed with greatest success.\n\nThe finest tea-plant known in England was raised in Kew.\nKew gardens; it was carried thither by Sir J. Ellis, who brought it from seed: but the first that ever flourished in Europe was one belonging to the duke of Northumberland at Sion, from a drawing of which our engraving is taken. The plants which are cultivated in the gardens near London thrive well in the greenhouse during winter, and some stand that season in the open air. Linnaeus, who obtained this shrub in its growing state, contrived to preserve it in the open air in the northern latitude of Sweden. France has also procured some plants. There can be no doubt but they would succeed in many countries of Europe, if proper care were paid to their cultivation till they became insured to the climate. It will be a great advantage if we can rear that plant, which can never suffer too much from change of soil as from growing muddy during the long voyage from China. Besides, the demand for tea is now become so great, that the Chinese find it necessary, or at least profitable, to adulterate it. Bad tea is now become an universal complaint. The abbé Grolier tells us, that there is a kind of moss which grows in the neighbourhood of the little city of Mang-ting-hien, which is sold as a delicate species of tea. If this delicious commodity is adulterated in China, can we flatter ourselves that none comes to us but what is pure and unmixed? How would our fine ladies like to be told, that instead of tea they drink nothing but the infusion of moss from the rocks of Mang-ting-hien?\n\nOf the chemical qualities and effects of tea on the constitution, many various and opposite opinions have been formed. About a century ago, Bontikoe, a Dutch physician, bestowed extravagant encomiums on the benefits of tea. With him it was good for everything; and any quantity might be drunk, even to the amount of 200 dithers in a day. Whether Bontikoe in this case acted as a physician, or, being a Dutchman, was eager to encourage the sale of an important article of his country's commerce, is not easy to say. On the other hand, the pernicious effects of tea upon the nervous system have been often repeated, and very opposite effects have been ascribed to it. Some affirm that green tea is mildly astringent; others say it is relaxing: Some say it is narcotic, and procures sleep; while others contend, that taken before bed-time it assuredly prevents it.\n\nDr Lettsom, who has written the Natural History of the Tea Tree, made several experiments to determine its chemical qualities. He found an infusion of it preserved beef fresh; it is therefore antiseptic: and from its striking a purple colour with the salt (fulphate) of iron, he justly concludes that it is astringent. He concludes also, that the essential qualities of tea reside in its fragrant and volatile parts.\n\nWe have heard much of the bad effects of tea, but we have neither felt nor observed it. If it were so pernicious as it has been represented by some, its effects must certainly be evident in China, where it is drunk by all ranks; yet so far from being thought hurtful in that country, it is in high estimation. The present emperor has composed a kind of ode on the virtues of tea. We are told by those who have written the history of China, that inflammatory disease are less frequent there than in many other countries, which is ascribed solely to the liberal use of tea. It must be observed by all, that tea is an antidote against intemperance, and that he who relishes the one seldom runs into the other. Raynal says, that tea has contributed more to the sobriety of this nation than the severest laws, the most eloquent harangues of Christian orators, or the best treatises of morality. We have no doubt but it may be hurtful to some constitutions in particular circumstances; but we suspect that the nervous disorders so often attributed to tea, are rather owing to hereditary diseases, to want of exercise, and to irregularity in food or sleep, than to tea.\n\n\"Weak tea drunk too hot (says Dr Leake) will enervate, and if very strong, may prove equally pernicious by affecting the head or stomach. But when it is drunk in moderation, and not too warm, with a large addition of milk, I believe it will seldom prove hurtful, but, on the contrary, salutary. After study or fatigue it is a most refreshing and grateful repast; it quenches thirst, and cheers the spirits, without heating the blood; and the pleasing society, in which we so often partake of it is no inconsiderable addition to its value; for whatever affords rational pleasure to the mind, will always contribute to bodily health.\n\nIn this country teas are generally divided into three kinds of green, and five of bohea: The former are, 1. Imperial or bloom tea, with a large loose leaf, light green\n\n---\n\n(f) There is very good reason to believe, that the adulteration of tea is not confined to China. It is practised, and often with too much success, among ourselves. Mr Twinning, a considerable tea dealer in London, published a pamphlet some years ago, in which he has exposed this infamous traffic. The information (he says) was obtained from a gentleman who had made very accurate inquiries into this subject.\n\nThe method for mixing with black teas is made of the leaves of the ash. When gathered, they are first dried in the sun, then baked; they are next put upon a floor, and trod upon until the leaves are small, then sifted and steeped in copperas with sheep's dung; after which, being dried on a floor, they are fit for use. There is also another mode: When the leaves are gathered, they are boiled in a copper with copperas and sheep's dung; when the liquor is strained off, they are baked and trod upon, until the leaves are small, after which they are fit for use. The quantity manufactured at a small village, and within eight or ten miles thereof, cannot be ascertained, but is supposed to be about 20 tons a year. One man acknowledges to have made 600 weight in every week for six months together. The fine is sold at 4l. 4s. per cwt. equal to 9d. per lb. The coarse is sold at 2l. 2s. per cwt. equal to 4½d. per lb. Elder buds are manufactured in some places to represent fine teas.\n\nFor the honour of human nature, we hope such a traffic as this is not very common; but if it be, those concerned in it deserve exemplary punishment. The only way (Mr Twinning says) to escape this adulterated tea, is never to purchase from those who offer their teas to sale at lower prices than genuine teas can be afforded; but to purchase them only from persons of character.\ngreen colour, and a faint delicate smell. 2. Hyson, so called from the name of the merchant who first imported it; the leaves of which are closely curled and small, of a green colour, verging to a blue: And, 3. Singlo tea, from the name of the place where it is cultivated. The boheas are, 1. Souchong, which imparts a yellow green colour by infusion. 2. Cambo, so called from the place where it is made; a fragrant tea, with a violet tinge; its infusion pale. 3. Congo, which has a larger leaf than the following, and its infusion somewhat deeper, resembling common bohea in the colour of the leaf. 4. Pekoe tea; this is known by the appearance of small white flowers mixed with it. 5. Common bohea, whose leaves are of one colour. There are other varieties, particularly a kind of green tea, done up in roundish balls, called gunpowder tea.\n\n**Tea-Tree** of New Zealand, is a species of myrtle, of which an infusion was drunk by Captain Cook's people in their voyages round the world. Its leaves were finely aromatic, astringent, and had a particular pleasant flavour at the first infusion; but this went off at the next filling up of the tea-pot, and a great degree of bitterness was then extracted; for which reason it was never suffered to be twice infused. In a fine foil in thick forests this tree grows to a considerable size; sometimes 30 or 40 feet in height, and one foot in diameter. On a hilly and dry exposure it degenerates into a shrub of five or six inches; but its usual size is about eight or ten feet high, and three inches in diameter. In that case, its form is irregular and unequal, dividing very soon into branches, which arise at acute angles, and only bear leaves and flowers at top. The flowers are white, and very ornamental to the whole plant.\n\nMr White, in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, mentions a shrub which he calls a tea-tree, merely from its being used by the convicts as a succedaneum for tea; for he had not seen the flower, nor did he know to what genus it belonged. It is a creeping kind of a vine, running to a great extent along the ground; the stalk slender; the leaf not so large as the common bay leaf; the taste sweet, exactly like the liquorice root of the shops.\n\n**Teachers**, persons employed in conducting the education of the young.\n\nWe will venture to say, that there is no class of men to whom a nation is so much indebted as to those employed in instructing the young: For if it be education that forms the only distinction between the civilized and the savage, much certainly is due to those who devote themselves to the office of instruction. It must be the duty therefore of every state to take care that proper encouragement be given to those who undertake this office. There ought to be such a salary as would render it an object of ambition to men of abilities and learning, or at least as would keep the teacher respectable. In Scotland, the office of a schoolmaster was formerly much more lucrative than at present, and most of that class had received liberal education; and this is the reason why the common people in Scotland have been famous even to a proverb, for their learning. But at present the salary of a country schoolmaster, independent of fees for scholars, is not greater than a ploughman can earn, being seldom more than £1. 6s. 8d. the consequence of which is that this, which is in fact an honourable, because an useful profession, is now sinking into Teachers' contempt. It is no longer an object to a man of learning; and we must soon be satisfied with schoolmasters that can read, write, and cast accounts, a little better than the lowest of the people, or who from some natural deformity are unable to exercise a trade. And what in this case must become of the minds of the common people? They must be totally uncultivated.\n\nWe have observed a great difference between the cultivation of the common people in one part of Scotland compared with another; and we have found, that wherever a schoolmaster is looked upon as a mean profession there is scarcely a duly qualified person to be found to undertake the office; and in those places the common people are lamentably ignorant. In other places again, where the schoolmaster is considered as one of the principal persons in the parish, there men of a liberal education, young divines, and preachers, do not think themselves disgraced by exercising this profession; and there the common people show a degree of acuteness, knowledge, and observation, and possess such polished manners, as raise them very high above those of their own rank in other parts of the country.\n\nMany and keen have been the debates about a reform of government of late years; but little attention has been paid to the formation of the minds of the common people, who constitute the greater part of the nation; of course they are ready to join the standard of every fidgetious demagogue who sounds the alarm of oppression; and should they at length be roused, their cruelty and barbarity, like the common people of France, would be exactly in proportion to their ignorance and want of principle.\n\nWe are willing to hope, then, that the government and the moneyed men of the nation, who alone have property to lose and money to bestow, will at length find it to be their interest to patronize schoolmasters.\n\n**TEAL.** See Anas, Ornithology Index.\n\n**Tears,** a lymph or aqueous humor, which is limpid, and a little salty; it is separated from the arterial blood by the lacrymal glands and small glandulous grains on the inside of the eyelids.\n\n**Teasel,** a plant cultivated in the west of England for the use of clothiers.

The anatomical structure of the teeth has already been described under Anatomy. The diseases to which they are liable, as well as the most successful remedies for removing them, are fully detailed under Medicine and Surgery.\n\nMuch attention has been paid to the beauty and preservation of the teeth among most nations. The Romans rubbed and washed them with great care; and when they lost them, supplied their place with artificial teeth made of ivory; and sometimes, when loofe, bound them with gold. Ligatures of wire have been found to hurt the natural teeth with which the artificial are connected; whereas filkent twist cannot affect them to any considerable degree for several years.\n\nGuilleman gives us the composition of a paste for making artificial teeth, which shall never grow yellow: the composition is white wax granulated, and melted with a little gum elemi, adding powder of white mastic, coral, and pearl.\n\nWhen several teeth are out in the same place, it is best to make a set, or the number wanted, out of one piece, all adhering together, which may be fastened to the two next of the sound or natural teeth. And even a whole set of artificial teeth may be made for one or both jaws, so well fitted to admit of the necessary motions, and so conveniently retained in the proper situation by means of springs, that they will answer every purpose of natural teeth, and may be taken out, cleaned, and replaced, by the patient himself with great ease.\n\nThe common trick of mountebanks and other such practitioners, is to use various washes for teeth, the sudden effects of which, in cleaning and whitening the teeth, surprise and please people; but the effects are very pernicious. All the strong acid spirits will do this. As good a mixture as anything can be, on this occasion, is the following: take plantain-water an ounce, honey of roses two drams, muriatic acid ten drops; mix the whole together, and rub the teeth with a piece of linen rag dipped in this every day till they are whitened. The mouth ought to be well washed with cold water after the use of this or any other acid liquor; and indeed the best of all teeth washes is cold water, with or without a little salt; the constant use of this will keep them clean and white, and prevent them from aching.\n\nAfter all the numerous cures which have been proposed for preventing the toothache, we will venture to recommend the keeping the teeth clean as the most efficacious, and avoiding every kind of hot food, especially hot liquids, as tea, &c.

We have no description of this plant but from Mr Bruce, who says that it is herbaceous; and that from a number of weak leaves surrounding the root proceeds a stalk of about 28 inches in length, not perfectly straight, smooth, but jointed or knotted at particular distances. This stalk is not much thicker than that of a carnation or julyflower. About eight inches from the top, a head is formed of a number of small branches, upon which it carries the fruit and flowers; the latter of which is small, of a crimson colour, and scarcely perceptible by the naked eye but from the opposition of that colour. The pistil is divided into two, seemingly attached to the germ of the fruit, and has at each end small capillaments forming a brush. The stamens are three in number; two on the lower side of the pistil, and one on the upper. These are each of them crowned with two oval stigma, at first green, but after crimson. The fruit is formed in a capsule, consisting of two conical hollow leaves, which, when closed, seems to compose a small conical pod, pointed at the top. The fruit or seed is oblong, and is not so large as the head of the smallest pin; yet it is very prolific, and produces these seeds in such quantity as to yield a very abundant crop in the quantity of meal.\n\nOur author, from the similarity of the names, conjectures it to be the tipha mentioned, but not described, by Pliny; but this conjecture, which he acknowledges to be unsupported, is of very little importance.\n\nThere are three kinds of meal made from teff; of which the best (he says) is as white as flour, exceedingly light, and easily digested; the second is of a browner colour; and the last, which is the food of soldiers and servants, is nearly black. This variety he imagines to arise entirely from the difference of soils in which the seeds are sown, and the different degrees of moisture to which the plant is exposed when growing. The manner of making the meal or flour into bread is by taking a broad earthen jar, and having made a lump of it with water, they put it into an earthen jar at some distance from the fire, where it remains till it begins to ferment or turn sour; they then bake it into cakes of a circular form, and about two feet in diameter: it is of a spongy soft quality, and not a disagreeable fourth taste. Two of these cakes a-day, and a coarse cotton cloth once a-year, are the wages of a common servant.\n\nAt their banquets of raw meat, the flesh being cut in small bits, is wrapped up in pieces of this bread, with a proportion of fossil salt and Cayenne pepper. Before the company sits down to eat, a number of these cakes of different qualities are placed one upon the other, in the same manner as our plates, and the principal people fitting first down, eat the white teff; the second or coarser sort serves the second rate people that succeed them, and the third is for the servants. Every man, when he is done, dries or wipes his fingers upon the bread which he is to leave for his successor, for they have no towels; and this is one of the most beastly customs among them.\n\nOf this teff bread the natives make a liquor, by a process which our author describes in the following words: The bread, when well toasted, is broken into small pieces, which are put into a large jar, and have warm water poured upon them. It is then set by the fire, and frequently stirred for several days, the mouth of the jar being close covered. After being allowed to settle three or four days, it acquires a fourth taste, and is what they call bouza, or the common beer of the country. The bouza in Atbara is made in the same manner, only in...\nTEFLIS, or TIFLIS, a town of Asia, in Georgia, one of the seven nations between the Black Sea and the Caspian. It is the capital of that country, the place of residence of its sovereign, and is called by the inhabitants Thilis-Cabur, \"warm town,\" from the warm baths in its neighbourhood. Though its circumference does not exceed two English miles, it contains 20,000 inhabitants, of which more than half are Armenians; the remainder are principally Georgians, with some Tartars. According to Major Rennel, it has 20 Armenian and 15 Greek churches, and three mosques. But Mr. Coxe, on the authority of Professor Guldenstaedt, states the places of worship to be one Roman Catholic, 13 Greek, and seven Armenian churches. There are some magnificent caravanserais, bazars, and palaces in the city, but no mosques; for the Georgians, though living under a Mohammedan government, have always risen up in arms as often as any attempts have been made to erect such places of Mohammedan worship. Many of the Roman missionaries live here in disguise under the denomination of physicians, surgeons, and chemists; and the great cures which they perform procure them much esteem, though they are sometimes exposed to the insults of the people when they attempt to make any proselytes to their church. All the houses are of stone, with flat roofs, which serve, according to the customs of the East, as walks for the women. They are neatly built; the rooms are wainscotted, and the floors spread with carpets. The streets seldom exceed seven feet in breadth; and some are so narrow as scarcely to allow room for a man on horseback: they are consequently very filthy.\n\nTiflis is a place of considerable trade, especially in furs, which are conveyed hence to Constantinople by the way of Erzurum. As for the silks of this country, they are bought up on the spot by the Armenians, and conveyed to Smyrna and other ports of the Mediterranean; but the greatest part is sent first to Erzurum to be manufactured, the Georgians being very ignorant and unskilful in that respect. From hence, likewise, great quantities of a root called boya is sent to Erzurum and Indoflan for the use of the linen dyers. Here is likewise a foundry, at which are cast a few cannon, mortars, and balls, all of which are very inferior to those of the Turks. The gunpowder made here is very good. The Armenians have likewise established in this town all the manufactures carried on by their countrymen in Persia; the most flourishing is that of printed linens. Tiflis is seated on the river Kur, at the foot of a mountain; and on the south side of it stands a large castle or fortress, built by the Turks in 1576, when they made themselves masters of the city and country, under the command of the famous Mustapha Pacha.

Mutton and goats' flesh are sold by the quarter without weighing; the usual price is from 32 to 40 grains of gold-dust, or four or five shillings English money. The flesh of the camel, which is much more highly valued, is commonly sold at a dearer rate, and is divided into smaller lots.

There is reason to believe that amongst the Greeks there was some sort of telegraph in use. The burning of Troy was certainly known in Greece very soon after it happened, and before any person had returned from thence. Now that was altogether so tedious a piece of business, that conjecture never could have supplied the place of information. A Greek play begins with a scene, in which a watchman descends from the top of a tower in Greece, and gives the information that Troy was taken. \"I have been looking out these ten years (says he) to see when that would happen, and this night it is done.\" Of the antiquity of a mode of conveying intelligence quickly to a great distance, this is certainly a proof.\n\nThe Chinese, when they send couriers on the great canal, or when any great man travels there, make signals by fire from one day's journey to another, to have everything prepared; and most of the barbarous nations used formerly to give the alarm of war by fires lighted on the hills or rising grounds.\n\nPolybius calls the different instruments used by the ancients for communicating information συγγραφαι, πυρσις, because the signals were always made by means of fire. At first they communicated information of events merely by torches; but this method was of little use, because it was necessary before-hand to fix the meaning of every particular signal. Now as events are exceedingly various, it was impossible to express the greater number of them by any premeditated contrivance. It was easy, for instance, to express by signals that a fleet had arrived at such a place, because this had been foreseen, and signals accordingly had been agreed upon to denote it; but an unexpected revolt, a murder, and such accidents, as happen too often, and require an immediate remedy, could not be communicated by such signals; because to foresee them was impossible.\n\nÆneas, a contemporary of Aristotle, who wrote a Polybius, treated the duties of a general, endeavoured to correct those imperfections, but by no means succeeded.\nthis cork a stick, which must be of equal size in both these vessels. This stick must be divided exactly and distinctly, by spaces of three inches each, in order that such events as generally happen in war may be written on them. For example, on one of these spaces the following words may be written: 'A body of horse are marched into the country.' On another, 'A body of infantry, heavily armed, are arrived hither.' On a third, 'Infantry lightly armed.' On a fourth, 'Horse and foot.' On another, 'Ships;' then 'Provisions;' and so on till all the events which may probably happen in the war that is carrying on are marked in these intervals.\n\nThis being done, each of the two vessels must have a little tube or cock of equal bigness, to let out the water in equal proportion. Then the two vessels must be filled with water; the pieces of cork, with their sticks thrust through them, must be laid upon them, and the cocks must be opened. Now, it is plain, that as these vessels are equal, the corks will sink, and the sticks descend lower in the vessels, in proportion as they empty themselves. But to be more certain of this exactness, it will be proper to make the experiment first, and to examine whether all things correspond and agree together, by an uniform execution on both sides. When they are well assured of this, the two vessels must be carried to the two places where the signals are to be made and observed: water is poured in, and the corks and sticks are put in the vessels. When any of the events which are written on the sticks shall happen, a torch or other light is raised, which must be held aloft till such time as another is raised by the party to whom it is directed. (This first signal is only to give notice that both parties are ready and attentive.) Then the torch or other light must be taken away, and the cocks let open. When the interval, that is that part of the stick where the event of which notice is to be given or written, shall have fallen to a level with the vessels, then the man who gives the signal lifts up his torch; and on the other side, the correspondent signal-maker immediately turns the cock of his vessel, and looks at what is written on that part of the stick which touches the mouth of the vessel: on which occasion, if every thing has been executed exactly and equally on both sides, both will read the same thing.\"\n\nThis method was defective, because it could not convey any other intelligence except what was written on the sticks, and even that not particularly enough. With regard to all unforeseen events, it was quite useless.\n\nA new method was invented by Cleoxenus (others say by Democritus), and very much improved by Polybius, as he himself informs us. He describes this method as follows: Take the letters of the (Greek) alphabet, and divide them into five parts, each of which will consist of five letters, except the last division, which will have only four. Let these be fixed on a board in five columns. The man who is to give the signals is then to begin by holding up two torches, which he is to keep aloft till the other party has also shown two. This is only to show that both sides are ready. These first torches are then withdrawn. Both parties are provided with boards, on which the letters are disposed as formerly described. The person who then gives the signal is to hold up torches on the left to point out to the other party from what column he shall take the letters as they are pointed out to him. If it is to be from the first column, he holds up one torch; if from the second, two; and so on for the others. He is then to hold up torches on the right, to denote the particular letter of the column that is to be taken. All this must have been agreed on before-hand. The man who gives the signals must have an instrument (συντελέσις), consisting of two tubes, and so placed as that, by looking through one of them, he can see only the right side, and through the other only the left, of him who is to answer. The board must be set up near this instrument; and the station on the right and left must be surrounded with a wall (παράστασις) ten feet broad, and about the height of a man, that the torches raised above it may give a clear and strong light, and that when taken down they may be completely concealed. Let us now suppose that this information is to be communicated.—A number of the auxiliaries, about a hundred, have gone over to the enemy. In the first place, words must be chosen that will convey the information in the fewest letters possible; as, A hundred Cretans have deserted, Κρητεῖς ἐξέδωσαν ἑκατόν. Having written down this sentence, it is conveyed in this manner. The first letter is a K, which is in the second column; two torches are therefore to be raised on the left hand to inform the person who receives the signals to look into that particular column. Then five torches are to be held up on the right, to mark the letter k, which is the last in the column. Then four torches are to be held up on the left to point out the r, which is in the fourth column, and two on the right to show that it is the second letter of that column. The other letters are pointed out in the same manner.—Such was the pyrfa or telegraph recommended by Polybius.\n\nBut neither this nor any other method mentioned by the ancients seems ever to have been brought into general use; nor does it appear that the moderns had thought of such a machine as a telegraph till the year 1663, when the Marquis of Worcester, in his Century of Inventions, affirmed that he had discovered \"a method by which, at a window, as far as eye can discover black from white, a man may hold discourse with his correspondent, without noise made or notice taken; being according to occasion given, or means afforded, ex re natu, and no need of provision before hand; though much better if foreseen, and course taken by mutual consent of parties.\" This could be done only by means of a telegraph, which in the next sentence is declared to have been rendered so perfect, that by means of it the correspondence could be carried on \"by night as well as by day, though as dark as pitch is black.\"\n\nAbout 40 years afterwards M. Amontons proposed a new telegraph. His method was this: Let there be people placed in several stations, at such a distance from one another, that by the help of a telescope a man in one station may see a signal made in the next before him; he must immediately make the same signal, that it may be seen by persons in the station next after him, who are to communicate it to those in the following station, and so on. These signals may be as letters of the alphabet, or as a cipher, understood only by the two persons who are in the distant places, and not by those who make the signals. The person in the second station making the signal to the person in the third the very moment he sees it in the first, the news may be carried to the greatest distance.\ndistance in as little time as is necessary to make the signals in the first station. The distance of the several stations, which must be as few as possible, is measured by the reach of a telescope. Amontons tried this method in a small tract of land before several persons of the highest rank at the court of France.\n\nIt was not, however, till the French revolution that the telegraph was applied to useful purposes. Whether M. Chappe, who is said to have invented the telegraph first used by the French about the end of 1793, knew anything of Amontons's invention or not, it is impossible to say; but his telegraph was constructed on principles nearly similar. The manner of using this telegraph was as follows: At the first station, which was on the roof of the palace of the Louvre at Paris, M. Chappe, the inventor, received in writing, from the committee of public welfare, the words to be sent to Lille, near which the French army at that time was. An upright post was erected on the Louvre, at the top of which were two transverse arms, moveable in all directions by a single piece of mechanism, and with inconceivable rapidity. He invented a number of positions for these arms, which stood as signs for the letters of the alphabet; and these, for the greater celerity and simplicity, he reduced in number as much as possible. The grammarian will easily conceive that fifteen signs may amply supply all the letters of the alphabet, since some letters may be omitted not only without detriment but with advantage. These signs, as they were arbitrary, could be changed every week; so that the sign of B for one day might be the sign of M the next; and it was only necessary that the person at the extremity should know the key. The intermediate operators were only instructed generally in these fifteen signals; which were so distinct, so marked, so different the one from the other, that they were easily remembered. The construction of the machine was such, that each signal was uniformly given in precisely the same manner at all times: It did not depend on the operator's manual skill; and the position of the arm could never, for any one signal, be a degree higher or a degree lower, its movement being regulated mechanically.\n\nM. Chappe having received at the Louvre the sentence to be conveyed, gave a known signal to the second station, which was Mont Martre, to prepare. At each station there was a watch tower, where telegraphs were fixed, and the person on watch gave the signal of preparation which he had received, and this communicated successively through all the line, which brought them all into a state of readiness. The person at Mont Martre then received, letter by letter, the sentence from the Louvre, which he repeated with his own machine; and this was again repeated from the next height, with inconceivable rapidity, to the final station at Lille.\n\nThe first description of the telegraph was brought from Paris to Frankfort on the Main by a former member of the parliament of Bordeaux, who had seen that which was erected on the mountain of Belville. As given by Dr Hutton from some of the English papers, it is as follows. AA is a beam or mast of wood placed upright on a rising ground (fig. 1), which is about 15 or 16 feet high. BB is a beam or balance moving upon the centre AA. This balance-beam may be placed vertically or horizontally, or any how inclined, by means of strong cords, which are fixed to the wheel D, on the edge of which is a double groove to receive the two cords. This balance is about 11 or 12 feet long, and nine inches broad, having at the ends two pieces of wood CC, which likewise turn upon angles by means of four other cords that pass through the axis of the main balance, otherwise the balance would derange the cords; the pieces C are each about three feet long, and may be placed either to the right or left, straight or square, with the balance-beam. By means of these three the combination or movement is very extensive, remarkably simple, and easily performed. Below is a small wooden gouge or butt, in which a person is employed to observe the movements of the machine. In the mountain nearest to this another person is to repeat these movements, and a third to write them down. The time taken up for each movement is 20 seconds; of which the motion alone is four seconds, the other 16 the machine is stationary. Two working models of this instrument were executed at Frankfort, and sent by Mr W. Playfair to the duke of York; and hence the plan and alphabet of the machine came to England.\n\nVarious experiments were in consequence tried upon telegraphs in this country; and one was soon after let up by government in a chain of stations from the admiralty-office to the sea coast. It consists of six octagon boards, each of which is poised upon an axis in a frame, in such a manner that it can be either placed vertically, so as to appear with its full size to the observer at the nearest station, as in fig. 2; or it becomes invisible to him by being placed horizontally, as in fig. 3, so that the Fig. 2 narrow edge alone is exposed, which narrow edge is from a distance invisible. Fig. 2 is a representation of this telegraph, with the parts all shut, and the machine ready to work. T, in the officer's cabin, is the telescope pointed to the next station. Fig. 3 is a representation of the machine not at work, and with the ports all open. The opening of the first port (fig. 2) expresses a, the second b, the third c, the fourth d, the fifth e, the sixth f, &c.\n\nSix boards make 36 changes, by the most plain and simple mode of working; and they will make many more if more were necessary: but as the real superiority of the telegraph over all other modes of making signals consists in its making letters, we do not think that more changes than the letters of the alphabet, and the ten arithmetical ciphers, are necessary; but, on the contrary, that those who work the telegraphs should avoid communicating by words or signs agreed upon to express sentences; for that is the sure method never to become expert at sending unexpected intelligence accurately.\n\nThis telegraph is without doubt made up of the best number of combinations possible; five boards would be insufficient, and seven would be useless. It has been objected to it, however, that its form is too clumsy to admit of its being raised to any considerable height above the building on which it stands; and that it cannot be made to change its direction, and consequently cannot be seen but from one particular point.\n\nSeveral other telegraphs have been proposed to remedy these defects, and perhaps others to which the instrument is still liable. The dial-plate of a clock would make an excellent telegraph, as it might exhibit 144 signs so as to be visible at a great distance. A telegraph on this principle, with only six divisions instead of twelve,\nA very ingenious improvement of the telegraph has been proposed in the Gentleman's Magazine. It consists of a semicircle, to be properly elevated, and fixed perpendicularly on a strong stand. The radius 12 feet; the semicircle consequently somewhat more than 36°. This to be divided into 24 parts. Each of these will therefore comprise a space of 18 inches, and an arch of 7° 30' on the circumference. These 24 divisions to be occupied by as many circular apertures of six inches diameter; which will leave a clear space of five inches on each side between the apertures. These apertures, beginning from the left, to denote the letters of the alphabet, omitting K, J consonant, V, X, and Q, as useless for this purpose. There are then 21 letters. The four other spaces are reserved for signals. The instrument to have an index moveable by a windlass on the centre of the semicircle, and having two tops, according as it is to be used in the day or night; one, a circular top of lacquered iron or copper, of equal diameter with the apertures (and which consequently will eclipse any of them against which it rests); the other, a spear or arrow-shaped top, black and highly polished, which, in standing before any of the apertures in the day-time, will be distinctly visible. In the night, the apertures to be reduced by a diaphragm fitting close to each, so as to leave an aperture of not more than two inches diameter. The diaphragm to be of well-polished tin; the inner rim lacquered black half an inch. All the apertures to be illuminated, when the instrument is used in the nighttime, by small lamps; to which, if necessary, according to circumstances, convex lenses may be added, fitted into each diaphragm, by which the light may be powerfully concentrated and increased. Over each aperture one of the five prismatic colours least likely to be mistaken (the remaining two being less distinguishable, and not wanted, are best omitted) to be painted; and, in their natural order, on a width of eighteen inches and a depth of four, red, orange, yellow, green, blue; or, still to heighten the contrast, and render immediately successive apertures more distinguishable, red, green, orange, blue, yellow. The whole inner circle beneath and between the apertures to be painted black.\n\nWhen the instrument is to be used, the index to be set to the signal apertures on the right. All the apertures to be covered or dark when it begins to be used, except that which is to give the signal. A signal gun to be fired to apprise the observer. If the index is set to the first aperture, it will denote that words are to be expressed; if to the second, that figures; if to the third, that the figures cease; and that the intelligence is carried on in words. When figures are to be expressed, the alternate apertures from the left are taken in their order, to denote from 1 to 10 inclusively; the second from the right denotes 100; the fifth 1000. This order, and these intervals, are taken to prevent any confusion in conveying.\n\nPerhaps, however, none of the telegraphs hitherto offered to the public exceeds the following, either in simplicity, cheapness, or facility in working, and it might perhaps, with a few trifling additions, be made exceedingly dainty. It is thus described in the Repertory of Arts and Manufactures: For a nocturnal telegraph, let there be four large patent reflectors, lying on the same plane, parallel to the horizon, placed on the top of an observatory. Let each of these reflectors be capable, by means of two winches, either of elevation or depression to a certain degree. By elevating or depressing one or two of the reflectors, eighteen very distinct arrangements may be produced, as the following scheme will explain (A).\n\n| A | B | C | E | F | G |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| o | o | o | o | o | o |\n| ooo | ooo | ooo | ooo | ooo | ooo |\n\n| I | K | L | M | N | O |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| o | o | o | o | o | o |\n| ooo | ooo | ooo | ooo | ooo | ooo |\n\n| P | R | S | T | U | Y |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| o | o | o | o | o | o |\n| ooo | ooo | ooo | ooo | ooo | ooo |\n\nFor the sake of example, the above arrangements are made to answer to the most necessary letters of the alphabet; but alterations may be made at will, and a greater number of changes produced, without any addition to the reflectors. In the first observatory there need only be a set of single reflectors; but in the others each reflector should be double, so as to face both the preceding and subsequent observatory; and each observatory should be furnished with two telescopes. The proper diameter of the reflectors, and their distance from each other, will be ascertained by experience.\n\nTo convert this machine into a diurnal telegraph, nothing more is necessary than to insert, in the place of the reflectors, gilt balls, or any other conspicuous bodies.\n\nWere telegraphs brought to so great a degree of perfection, that they could convey information speedily and distinctly; were they so much simplified, that they could be constructed and maintained at little expense—the advantages which would result from their use are almost inconceivable. Not to speak of the speed with which information could be communicated and orders given in time of war, by means of which misfortunes might be prevented or instantly repaired, difficulties removed, and disputes precluded, and by means of which the whole kingdom could be prepared in an instant to oppose an invading force.\n\n(A) Each reflector, after every arrangement, must be restored to its place.\nTelegraph, invading enemy; it might be used by commercial men to convey a commission cheaper and swifter than an express can travel. The capitals of distant nations might be united by chains of posts, and the settling of those disputes which at present take up months or years might then be accomplished in as many hours. An establishment of telegraphs might then be made like that of the post; and instead of being an expense, it would produce a revenue. Until telegraphs are employed to convey information that occurs very frequently, the persons who are stationed to work them will never become expert, and consequently will neither be expeditious nor accurate, though, with practice, there is no doubt but they will attain both in a degree of perfection of which we can as yet have but little conception.\n\nVarious other improvements of the telegraph might have been mentioned, but our limits do not permit us to dwell longer on the subject.\n\nTELEMACHUS, the son of Ulysses and Penelope, was still in the cradle when his father went with the rest of the Greeks to the Trojan war. At the end of this celebrated war, Telemachus, anxious to see his father, went to seek him; and as the place of his residence, and the cause of his long absence, were then unknown, he visited the court of Menelaus and Nestor to obtain information. He afterwards returned to Ithaca, where the suitors of his mother Penelope had conspired to murder him, but he avoided their snares; and by means of Minerva he discovered his father, who had arrived in the island two days before him, and was then in the house of Eumaeus. With this faithful servant and Ulysses Telemachus concerted how to deliver his mother from the importunities of her suitors, and it was effected with great success. After the death of his father, Telemachus went to the island of Æaea, where he married Circe, or, according to others, Calypso the daughter of Circe, by whom he had a son called Latinus. He some time after had the misfortune to kill his mother-in-law Circe, and fled to Italy, where he founded Clu- sium. Telemachus was accompanied in his visit to Nestor and Menelaus by the godlike of wisdom under the form of Mentor. It is said that, when a child, Telemachus fell into the sea, and that a dolphin brought him safe to shore, after he had remained some time under water. From this circumstance Ulysses had the figure of a dolphin engraved on the seal which he wore on his ring.\n\nFrom these stories, collected from Homer and the other poets of antiquity, the celebrated Fenelon, archbishop of Cambrai, took the idea of his well-known Adventures of Telemachus; which, though not composed in verse, is justly intitled to be esteemed a poem. The plan of the work (says Dr Blair) is in general well contrived; and is deficient neither in epic grandeur nor unity of object. The author has entered with much felicity into the spirit and ideas of the ancient poets, particularly into the ancient mythology, which retains more dignity, and makes a better figure in his hands than in those of any other modern poet. His descriptions are rich and beautiful; especially of the softer and calmer scenes, for which the genius of Fenelon was best suited; such as the incidents of pastoral life, the pleasures of virtue, or a country flourishing in peace. There is an imitable sweetness and tenderness in several of the pictures of this kind which he has given; and his measured prose, which is remarkably harmonious, gives the style nearly as much elevation as the French language is capable of supporting even in regular verse.\n\nAccording to the same eminent critic, \"the best executed part of the work is the first five books, in which Telemachus recounts his adventures to Calypso. The narration throughout them is lively and interesting. Afterwards, especially in the last two books, it becomes more tedious and languid; and in the warlike adventures which are attempted, there is a great defect of vigour. The chief objection against this work being clasped with epic poems, arises from the minute details of virtuous policy, into which the author in some places enters; and from the discourses and instructions of Mentor, which recur upon us too often, and too much in the strain of common-place morality. Though these were well suited to the main design of the author, which was to form the mind of a young prince, yet they seem not congruous to the nature of epic poetry; the object of which is to improve us by means of actions, characters, and sentiments, rather than by delivering professed and formal instruction.\"\n\nTELEPHIUM, True Orpine, a genus of plants belonging to the class pentandria; and in the natural system ranging under the 54th order, Miscellaneous.

A particular kind, which is thought to be much brighter than the rest, is called a night-glass.\n\nTo what has been said already with respect to the inventor of this most noble and useful instrument in the article OPTICS, we may add the two following claims.\n\nMr Leonard Digges, a gentleman of the 17th century of great and various knowledge, positively affirms in his Stratioticos, and in another work, that his father, a military gentleman, had an instrument which he used in the field, by which he could bring distant objects near, and could know a man at the distance of three miles. He says, that when his father was at home he had often looked through it, and could distinguish the waving of the trees on the opposite side of the Severn. Mr Digges resided in the neighbourhood of Bristol.\n\nFrancis Fontana, in his Celestial Observations, published at Naples in 1646, says, that he was assured by a Mr Hardy, advocate of the parliament of Paris, a person of great learning and undoubted integrity, that on the death of his father, there was found among his things an old tube, by which distant objects were distinctly seen; and that it was of a date long prior to the telescope lately invented, and had been kept by him as a secret.\n\nIt is not at all improbable, that curious people, handling spectacle glasses, of which there were by this time great varieties, both convex and concave, and amusing themselves with their magnifying power and the singular effects which they produced in the appearances of things, might sometimes chance so to place them as to produce distinct and enlarged vision. We know perfectly, from the table and scheme which Sirturus has given us of the tools or dishes in which the spectacle-\nTelecope makers fashioned their glasses, that they had convex lenses formed to spheres of 24 inches diameter, and of inferior sizes. He has given us a scheme of a set which he got leave to measure, belonging to a spectacle-maker of the name of Rogette at Coruña in Spain; and he says that this man had tools of the same sizes for concave glasses. It also appears, that it was a general practice (of which we do not know the precise purpose) to use a convex and concave glass together. If any person should chance to put together a 24-inch convex and a 12-inch concave (wrought on both sides) at the distance of six inches, he would have distinct vision, and the object would appear of double size. Concaves of six inches were not uncommon, and one such combined with the convex of 24, at the distance of nine inches, would have distinct vision, and objects would be quadrupled in diameter. When such a thing occurred, it was natural to keep it as a curiosity, although the rationale of its operation was not in the least understood. We doubt not but that this happened much oftener than in these two instances. The chief wonder is, that it was not frequent, and taken notice of by some writer. It is pretty plain that Galileo's first telescope was of this kind, made up of such spectacle-glasses as he could procure; for it magnified only three times in diameter; a thing easily procured by such glasses as he could find with every spectacle-maker. And he could not but observe, in his trials of their glasses, that the deeper concaves and flatter convexes he employed, produced the greater amplification; and then he would find himself obliged to provide a tool not used by the spectacle-makers, viz. either a much flatter tool for a convex surface, or a much smaller sphere for a concave; and, notwithstanding his telling us that it was by reflecting on the nature of refraction, and without any instruction, we are persuaded that he proceeded in this very way. His next telescope magnified but five times. Now the slightest acquaintance with the obvious laws of refraction would have directed him at once to a very small and deep concave, which would have been much easier made, and have magnified more. But he groped his way with such spectacle-glasses as he could get, till he at last made tools for very flat object-glasses and very deep eye-glasses, and produced a telescope which magnified about 25 times. Sirturus saw it, and took the measures of it. He afterwards saw a scheme of it which Galileo had sent to a German prince at Innsbruck, who had it drawn (that is, the circles for the tools) on a table in his gallery. The object-glass was a plano-convex, a portion of a sphere, of 24 inches diameter; the eye-glass was a double concave of two inches diameter; the focal distances were therefore 24 inches and one inch nearly. This must have been a very lucky operation, for Sirturus says it was the best telescope he had seen: and we know that it requires the very best work to produce this magnifying power with such small spheres. Telescopes continued to be made in this way for many years; and Galileo, though keenly engaged in the observation of Jupiter's satellites, being candidate for the prize held out by the Dutch for the discovery of the longitude, and therefore much interested in the advantage which a convex eye-glass would have given him, never made them of any other form. Kepler published his Dioptrics in 1611; in which he tells us, all that he or others had discovered of the law of refraction, viz. that in very small obliquities of incidence, the angle of refraction was nearly one-third of the angle of incidence. This was indeed enough to have pointed out, with sufficient exactness, the construction of every optical instrument that we are even now possessed of; for this proportionality of the angles of incidence and refraction is assumed in the construction of the optical figure for all of them; and the deviation from it is still considered as the refinement of the art, and was not brought to any rule till 50 years after by Huyghens, and called by him aberration. Yet even the sagacious Kepler seems not to have seen the advantage of any other construction of the telescope; he just seems to acknowledge the possibility of it: and we are surprised to see writers giving him as the author of the astronomical telescope, or even as hinting at its construction. It is true, in the last proposition he shows how a telescope may be made apparently with a convex eye-glass: but this is only a frivolous fancy; for the eye-glass is directed to be made convex externally, and a very deep concave on the inside; so that it is, in fact, a meniscus with the concavity prevalent. In the 86th proposition, he indeed shows that it is possible to place a convex glass behind another convex glass, that an eye shall see objects distinct, magnified, and inverted; and he speaks very sagaciously on the subject. After having said that an eye placed behind the point of union of the first glass will see an object inverted, he shows that a small part only will be seen; and then he shows that a convex glass, duly proportioned and properly placed, will show more of it. But in showing this, he speaks in a way which shows evidently that he had formed no distinct notions of the manner in which this effect would be produced, only saying vaguely that the convergency of the second glass would counteract the divergency beyond the focus of the first. Had he conceived the matter with any tolerable distinctness, after seeing the great advantage of taking in a field greater in almost any proportion, he would have eagerly caught at the thought, and enlarged on the immense improvement. Had he but drawn one figure of the progress of the rays through two convex glasses, the whole would have been open to his view.\n\nThis step, so easy and so important, was referred for Father Scheiner, as has been already observed in the article Optics; and the construction of this author, together with that of Janjen, are the models on which all refracting telescopes are now constructed; and in all that relates to their magnifying power, brightness, and field of vision, they may be constructed on Kepler's principle, that the angles of refraction are in a certain given proportion to the angles of incidence.\n\nBut after Huyghens had applied his elegant geometry to the discovery of Snellius, viz. the proportionality, not of the angles, but of the sines, and had ascertained the aberrations from the foci of infinitely slender pencils, the reasons were clearly pointed out why there were such narrow limits affixed by nature to the performance of optical instruments, in consequence of the indistinctness of vision which resulted from constructions where the magnifying power, the quantity of light, or the field of vision, were extended beyond certain moderate bounds. The theory of aberrations, which that most excellent geometer established, has enabled us to diminish this indistinctness arising from any of these causes; and this diminution\ndiminution is the sole aim of all the different constructions which have been contrived since the days of Galileo and Scheiner.\n\nThe description which has been already given of the various constructions of teleopes in the article Optics, is sufficient for instructing the reader in the general principles of their construction, and with moderate attention will show the manner in which the rays of light proceed, in order to ensure the different circumstances of amplification, brightness, and extent of field, and even distinctness of vision, in as far as this depends on the proper intervals between the glasses. But it is insufficient for giving us a knowledge of the improvements which are aimed at in the different departures from the original constructions of Galileo and Scheiner, the advantage of the double eye-glass of Huyghens, and the quintuple eye-glass of Dollond; still more is it insufficient for showing us why the highest degrees of amplification and most extensive field cannot be obtained by the mere proportion of the focal distances of the glasses, as Kepler had taught. In short, without the Huyghenian doctrine of aberrations, neither can the curious reader learn the limits of their performance, nor the artist learn why one telescope is better than another, or in what manner to proceed to make a telescope differing in any particular from those which he servilely copies.\n\nAlthough all the improvements in the construction of teleopes since the publication of Huyghens's Dioptrics have been the productions of this island, and although Dr Smith of Cambridge has given the most elegant and perspicuous account of this science that has yet appeared, we do not recollect a performance in the English language (except the Optics of Emeron) which will carry the reader beyond the mere schoolboy elements of the science, or enable a person of mathematical skill to understand or improve the construction of optical instruments. The last work on this subject of any extent (Dr Priestley's History of Vision) is merely a parlour book for the amusement of half-taught dilettanti, but is totally deficient in the mathematical part, although it is here that the science of optics has her chief claim to pre-eminence, and to the name of a disciplina accurata. But this would have been ultra crepidam; and the author would in all probability have made as poor a figure here as he has done in his attempts to degrade his species in his Commentaries on the Vibratunculae of Hartley; motions which neither the author nor his amplifier were able to understand or explain. We trust that our readers, jealous as we are of everything that flanks us in the scale of nature's works, will pardon this transient ejaculation of spleen, when our thoughts are called to a system which, of absolute and unavoidable necessity, makes the divine mind nothing but a quivering of that matter of which it is the author and unerring director. Sed mihi faciamus.\n\nWe think therefore that we shall do the public some service, by giving such an account of this higher branch of optical science as will at least tend to the complete understanding of this noble instrument, by which our conceptions of the extent of almighty power, and wisdom, and beneficence, are so wonderfully enlarged. In the prosecution of this we hope that many general rules will emerge, by which artists who are not mathematicians may be enabled to construct optical instruments with intelligence, and avoid the many blunders and defects which result from mere servile imitation.\n\nThe general aim in the construction of a telescope is, to form, by means of mirrors or lenses, an image of the distant object, as large, as bright, and as extensive as is possible, confitently with distinctness; and then to view the image with a magnifying glass in any convenient manner. This gives us an arrangement of our subject. We shall first show the principles of construction of the object-glass or mirror, so that it shall form an image of the distant object with these qualities; and then show how to construct the magnifying glass or eye-piece, so as to preserve them unimpaired.\n\nThis indistinctness which we wish to avoid arises from two causes; the spherical figures of the refracting and reflecting surfaces, and the different refrangibility of the differently coloured rays of light. The first may be called the Spherical and the second the Chromatic indistinctness; and the deviations from the foci, determined by an elementary theorem, given under Optics, may be called the Spherical and the Chromatic aberrations.\n\nThe limits of a Work like this will not permit us to give any more of the doctrine of aberrations than is absolutely necessary for the construction of achromatic telescopes; and we must refer the reader for a general view of the whole to Euler's Dioptries, and other works of that kind. Dr Smith has given as much as was necessary for the comparison of the merits of different glasses of similar construction, and this in a very plain and elegant manner.\n\nWe shall begin with the aberration of colour, because it is the most simple.\n\nLet white or compounded light fall perpendicularly on the flat side PQ (fig. 1.) of a plano-convex lens, PVQ, whose axis is CV and vertex V. The white ray P falling on the extremity of the lens is dispersed by refraction at the point P of the spherical surface, and the red ray goes to the point r of the axis, and the violet to the point v. In like manner the white ray Q is dispersed by refraction at Q, the red ray going to r, and the violet to v. The red ray Pr crosses the violet ray Qv in a point D, and Qr crosses Pv in a point E; and the whole light refracted and dispersed by the circumference whose diameter is DE, passes through the circular area, whose diameter is DE. Supposing that the lens is of such a form that it would collect red rays, refracted by its whole surface in the point r, and violet in the point v; then it is evident that the whole light which occupies the surface of the lens will pass through this little circle, whose diameter is DE. Therefore white light issuing from a point so distant that the rays may be considered as parallel, will not be collected in another point or focus, but will be dispersed over the surface of that little circle; which is therefore called the circle of chromatic dispersion; and the radiant point will be represented by this circle. The neighbouring points are in like manner represented by circles; and these circles encroaching on and mixing with each other, must occasion haziness or confusion, and render the picture indistinct. This indistinctness will be greater in the proportion of the number of circles which are in this manner mixed together. This will be in the proportion of the room that is for them; that is, in proportion to the area of the circle, or in the duplicate propor-\nLet \\( i \\) be \\( r \\) as the sine of incidence in glas to the sine of refraction of the red rays; and let \\( i \\) be \\( v \\) as the sine of incidence to the sine of refraction of the violet rays. Then we say, that when the aperture \\( PQ \\) is moderate, \\( v - r : v + r - 2i = DE : PQ \\), very nearly.\n\nFor let \\( DE \\), which is evidently perpendicular to \\( VR \\), meet the parallel incident rays in \\( K \\) and \\( L \\) and the radii of the spherical surface in \\( G \\) and \\( H \\). It is plain that \\( GPK \\) is equal to the angle of incidence on the posterior or spherical surface of the lens; and \\( GPv \\) and \\( GPv \\) are the angles of the refraction of the red and the violet rays; and that \\( GK \\), \\( GD \\), and \\( GE \\), are very nearly as the sines of those angles, because the angles are supposed to be small. We may therefore infer from this proportion \\( DE : KD = v - r : r - i \\); then, by doubling the consequents \\( DE : 2KD = v - r : 2r - 2i \\). Also \\( DE : 2KD + DE = v - r : 2r - 2i + v - r = v - r : r + v - 2i \\). But \\( 2KD + DE \\) is equal to \\( KL \\) or \\( PQ \\).\n\nTherefore we have \\( DE : PQ = v - r : r + v - 2i \\).\n\nQ.E.D.\n\nCor. 1. Sir Isaac Newton, by most accurate observation, found, that in common glas the sines of refraction of the red and violet rays were \\( 77 \\) and \\( 78 \\) where the sine of incidence was \\( 50 \\). Hence it follows, that \\( v - r \\) is to \\( v + r - 2i \\) as \\( 1 \\) to \\( 55 \\); and that the diameter of the smallest circle of dispersion is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) part of that of the lens.\n\n2. In like manner may be determined the circle of dispersion that will comprehend the rays of any particular colour or set of colours. Thus all the orange and yellow will pass through a circle whose diameter is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) part of that of the lens.\n\n3. In different surfaces, or plano-convex lenses, the angles of aberration \\( rPv \\) are as the breadth \\( PQ \\) directly, and as the focal distance \\( VF \\) inversely; because any angle \\( DPE \\) is as its subtense \\( DE \\) directly and radius \\( DP \\) inversely. N.B. We call \\( VF \\) the focal distance, because at this distance, or at the point \\( F \\), the light is most of all confused. If we examine the focal distance by holding the lens to the sun, we judge it to be where the light is drawn into the smallest spot.\n\nWhen we reflect that a lens of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) inches in diameter has a circle of dispersion \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)th of an inch in diameter, we are surprised that it produces any picture of an object that can be distinguished. We should not expect greater distinctions from such a lens than would be produced in a camera obscura without a lens, by simply admitting the light through a hole of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)th of an inch in diameter. This, we know, would be very hazy and confused. But when we remark the superior vivacity of the yellow and orange light in comparison with the rest, we may believe that the effect produced by the confusion of the other colours will be much less sensible. But a stronger reason is, that the light is much denser in the middle of the circle of dispersion, and is exceedingly faint towards the margin. This, however, must not be taken for granted; and we must know distinctly the manner in which the light of different colours is distributed over the circle of chromatic dispersion, before we pretend to pronounce on the immense difference between the indistinctness arising from colour and that arising from the spherical figure. We think this the telescope more necessary, because the illustrious discoverer of the chromatic aberration has made a great mistake in the comparison, because he did not consider the distribution of the light in the circle of spherical dispersion. It is therefore proper to investigate the chromatic distribution of the light with the same care that we bestowed on the spherical dispersion in Optics, and we shall then see that the superiority of the reflecting telescope is incomparably less than Newton imagined it to be.\n\nTherefore let \\( EB \\) (fig. 2.) represent a plano-convex lens, of which \\( C \\) is the centre and \\( CR \\) the axis. Let us suppose it to have no spherical aberration, but to collect rays occupying its whole surface to single points in the axis. Let a beam of white or compounded light fall perpendicularly on its plane surface. The rays will be so refracted by its curved surface, that the extreme red rays will be collected at \\( r \\), the extreme violet rays at \\( w \\), and those of intermediate refrangibility at intermediate points, \\( o, g, b, p, v \\), of the line \\( rw \\), which is nearly \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)th of \\( rC \\). The extreme red and violet rays will cross each other at \\( A \\) and \\( D \\); and \\( AD \\) will be a section or diameter of the circle of chromatic dispersion, and will be about \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)th of \\( EB \\). We may suppose \\( wr \\) to be bisected in \\( b \\), because \\( wb \\) is to \\( br \\) very nearly in the ratio of equality (for \\( rb : rc = bA : cE = bA : cB = wb : wc \\)). The line \\( rw \\) will be a kind of prismatic spectrum, red from \\( r \\) to \\( o \\), orange-coloured from \\( o \\) to \\( y \\), yellow from \\( y \\) to \\( g \\), green from \\( g \\) to \\( b \\), blue from \\( b \\) to \\( p \\), purple from \\( p \\) to \\( v \\), and violet from \\( v \\) to \\( w \\).\n\nThe light in its compound state must be supposed uniformly dense as it falls upon the lens; and the same must be said of the rays of any particular colour. Newton supposes also, that when a white ray, such as \\( eE \\), is dispersed into its component coloured rays by refraction at \\( E \\), it is uniformly spread over the angle \\( DEA \\). This supposition is indeed gratuitous; but we have no argument to the contrary, and may therefore consider it as just. The consequence is, that each point \\( w, v, p, b, \\&c. \\) of the spectrum is not only equally luminous, but also illuminates uniformly its corresponding portion of \\( AD \\); that is to say, the coating (so to term it) of any particular colour, such as purple, from the point \\( p \\), is uniformly dense in every part of \\( AD \\) on which it falls. In like manner, the colouring of yellow, intercepted by a part of \\( AD \\) in its passage to the point \\( y \\), is uniformly dense in all its parts. But the density of the different colours in \\( AD \\) is extremely different: for since the radiation in \\( w \\) is equally dense with that in \\( p \\), the density of the violet colouring, which radiates from \\( w \\), and is spread over the whole of \\( AD \\), must be much less than the density of the purple colouring, which radiates from \\( p \\), and occupies only a part of \\( AD \\) round the circle \\( b \\). These densities must be very nearly in the inverse proportion of \\( wb^2 \\) to \\( pb^2 \\).\n\nHence we see, that the central point \\( b \\) will be very intensely illuminated by the blue radiating from \\( pb \\) and the green intercepted from \\( bg \\). It will be more faintly illuminated by the purple radiating from \\( wp \\), and the yellow intercepted from \\( gy \\); and still more faintly by the violet from \\( wu \\), and the orange and red intercepted from \\( yr \\). The whole colouring will be a white, tending a little to yellowness. The accurate proportion of these\nThese colourings may be computed from our knowledge of the position of the points \\(a, y, g, \\&c.\\). But this is of little moment. It is of more consequence to be able to determine the proportion of the total intensity of the light in \\(b\\) to the intensity in any other point \\(I\\).\n\nFor this purpose draw \\(rIR, IwW\\), meeting the lens in \\(R\\) and \\(W\\). The point \\(I\\) receives none of the light which passes through the space \\(RW\\); for it is evident that \\(b : CR = bA : CE, = 1 : 55\\), and that \\(CR = CW\\); and therefore, since all the light incident on \\(EB\\) passes through \\(AB\\), all the light incident on \\(RW\\) passes through \\(I\\) (\\(b\\) being made \\(= bI\\)). Draw \\(oIO, yIY, gIG, IP, IVV\\). It is plain, that I receives red light from \\(RO\\), orange from \\(OY\\), yellow from \\(YG\\), green from \\(GE\\), a little blue from \\(BP\\), purple from \\(PV\\), and violet from \\(VW\\). It therefore wants some of the green and of the blue.\n\nThat we may judge of the intensity of these colours at \\(I\\), suppose the lens covered with paper pierced with a small hole at \\(G\\). The green light only will pass through \\(I\\); the other colours will pass between \\(I\\) and \\(b\\), or between \\(I\\) and \\(A\\), according as they are more or less refrangible than the particular green at \\(I\\). This particular colour converges to \\(g\\), and therefore will illuminate a small spot round \\(I\\), where it will be as much denser than it is at \\(G\\) as this spot is smaller than the hole at \\(G\\). The natural density at \\(G\\), therefore, will be to the increased density at \\(I\\), as \\(g^2\\) to \\(gG^2\\); or as \\(g^2\\) to \\(gC^2\\), or as \\(bI^2\\) to \\(CG^2\\). In like manner, the natural density of the purple coming to \\(I\\) through an equal hole at \\(P\\) will be to the increased density at \\(I\\) as \\(bP\\) to \\(CP^2\\). And thus it appears, that the intensity of the differently coloured illuminations of any point of the circle of dispersion, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the centre of the lens to the point of its surface through which the colouring light comes to this point of the circle of dispersion. This circumstance will give us a very easy, and, we think, an elegant solution of the question.\n\nBisect \\(CE\\) in \\(F\\), and draw \\(FL\\) perpendicular to \\(CE\\), making it equal to \\(CF\\). Through the point \\(L\\) describe the hyperbola \\(KLN\\) of the second order, that is, having the ordinates \\(EK, FL, RN, \\&c.\\) inversely proportional to the squares of the abscissae \\(CE, CF, CR, \\&c.\\); so that \\(FL : RN = \\frac{1}{CF^2} : \\frac{1}{CR^2}\\), or \\(CR^2 : CF^2, \\&c.\\). It is evident that these ordinates are proportional to the densities of the feverally coloured lights which go from them to any points whatever of the circle of dispersion.\n\nNow the total density of the light at \\(I\\) depends both on the density of each particular colour and on the number of colours which fall on it. The ordinates of this hyperbola determine the first; and the space \\(ER\\) measures the number of colours which fall on \\(I\\), because it receives light from the whole of \\(ER\\), and of its equal \\(BW\\). Therefore, if ordinates be drawn from any point of \\(ER\\), their sum will be as the whole light which goes to \\(I\\); that is, the total density of the light at \\(I\\) will be proportional to the area \\(NREK\\). Now it is known that \\(CE \\times EK\\) is equal to the infinitely extended area lying beyond \\(EK\\); and \\(CR \\times RN\\) is equal to the infinitely extended area lying beyond \\(RN\\). Therefore the area \\(NREK\\) is equal to \\(CR \\times RN - CE \\times EK\\). But \\(RN\\) and \\(EK\\) are respectively equal to \\(\\frac{CF^2}{CR^2}\\) and \\(\\frac{CF^2}{CE^2}\\). Therefore the density at \\(I\\) is proportional to \\(CF^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{CR}{CE^2}\\right)\\), \\(= CF^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{I}{CR} - \\frac{I}{CE}\\right)\\), \\(= CF^3 \\times \\frac{CE - CR}{CE \\times CR}\\), \\(= CF^3 \\times \\frac{ER}{CE \\times CR^2} = CF^3 \\times \\frac{ER}{CE \\times CR}\\). But because \\(CF\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of \\(CE\\), \\(CF^3\\) is \\(\\frac{CF^3}{2 \\cdot CF^3} = \\frac{1}{2}\\), a constant quantity. Therefore the density of the light at \\(I\\) is proportional to \\(\\frac{ER}{CR^2}\\) or \\(\\frac{AI}{bI}\\), because the points \\(R\\) and \\(I\\) are similarly situated in \\(EC\\) and \\(Ab\\).\n\nFarther, if the semiaperture \\(CE\\) of the lens be called \\(x\\), \\(\\frac{CF^3}{2}\\) is \\(\\frac{x}{8}\\), and the density at \\(I\\) is \\(\\frac{AI}{8bI}\\).\n\nHere it is proper to observe, that since the point \\(R\\) has the same situation in the diameter \\(EB\\) that the point \\(I\\) has in the diameter \\(AD\\) of the circle of dispersion, the circle described on \\(EB\\) may be conceived as the magnified representation of the circle of dispersion. The point \\(F\\), for instance, represents the point \\(f\\) in the circle of dispersion, which bisects the radius \\(bA\\); and \\(f\\) receives no light from any part of the lens which is nearer the centre than \\(F\\), being illuminated only by the light which comes through \\(EF\\) and its opposite \\(BF\\). The same may be said of every other point.\n\nIn like manner, the density of the light in \\(f\\), the middle between \\(b\\) and \\(A\\), is measured by \\(\\frac{EF}{CF}\\), which is \\(\\frac{EF}{CF}\\), or \\(1\\). This makes the density at this point a proper standard of comparison. The density there is to the density at \\(I\\) as \\(\\frac{AI}{bI}\\), or as \\(bI\\) to \\(AI\\); and this is the simplest mode of comparison. The density half way from the centre of the circle of dispersion is to the density at any point \\(I\\) as \\(bI\\) to \\(IA\\).\n\nLastly, through \\(L\\) describe the common rectangular hyperbola \\(kLn\\), meeting the ordinates of the former in \\(k, L\\), and \\(n\\); and draw \\(k\\) parallel to \\(EC\\), cutting the ordinates in \\(g, f, r, \\&c.\\). Then \\(CR : CE = Ek : Rn\\), and \\(CR : CE = Ek : Rn\\), or \\(CR : RE = Ek : rn\\), and \\(bI : IA = Ek : rn\\). And thus we have a very simple expression of the density in any point of the circle of dispersion. Let the point be anywhere, as at \\(I\\). Divide the lens in \\(R\\) as \\(AD\\) is divided in \\(I\\), and then \\(rn\\) is as the density in \\(I\\).\n\nThese two measures were given by Newton; the first in his *Treatise de Mundi Systemate*, and the last in his *Optics*; but both without demonstration.\n\nIf the hyperbola \\(kLn\\) be made to revolve round the axis \\(CQ\\), it will generate a solid spindle, which will measure the whole quantity of light which passes through different portions of the circle of dispersion. Thus the solid produced by the revolution of \\(Lkf\\) will measure all the light which occupies the outer part of the circle of dispersion lying without the middle of the radius. This space is \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\)ths of the whole circle; but the quantity of light is but \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\)th of the whole.\nA still more simple expression of the whole quantity of light passing through different portions of the circle of chromatic dispersion may now be obtained as follows:\n\nIt has been demonstrated, that the density of the light at \\( I \\) is as \\( \\frac{AI}{bI} \\), or as \\( \\frac{ER}{CR} \\). Suppose the figure to turn round the axis. If or R describe circumferences of circles; and the whole light passing through this circumference is as the circumference, or as the radius, and as the density jointly. It is therefore as \\( \\frac{ER}{CR} \\times CR \\), that is, as \\( ER \\). Draw any straight line \\( EM \\), cutting \\( RN \\) in \\( s \\), and any other ordinate \\( FL \\) in \\( x \\) or \\( y \\). The whole light which illuminates the circumference described by \\( I \\) is to the whole light which illuminates the centre \\( b \\) as \\( ER \\) to \\( EC \\), or as \\( Rs \\) to \\( Cm \\). In like manner, the whole light which illuminates the circumference described by the point \\( f \\) in the circle of dispersion is to the whole light which illuminates the centre \\( b \\), as \\( Fx \\) to \\( Cm \\). The lines \\( Cm \\), \\( RS \\), \\( Fx \\), are therefore proportional to the whole light which illuminates the corresponding circumferences in the circle of dispersion. Therefore the whole light which falls on the circle whose radius is \\( bI \\), will be represented by the trapezium in \\( CRS \\); and the whole light which falls on the ring described by \\( IA \\), will be represented by the triangle \\( ESR \\); and so of any other portions.\n\nBy considering the figure, we see that the distribution of the light is exceedingly unequal. Round the margin it has no sensible density; while its density in the very centre is incomparably greater than in any other point, being expressed by the asymptote of a hyperbola. Also the circle described with the radius \\( \\frac{Ab}{2} \\) contains \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)ths of the whole light. No wonder then that the confusion caused by the mixture of these circles of dispersion is less than one should expect; besides, it is evident that the most lively or impressive colours occupy the middle of the spectrum, and are there much denser than the rest. The margin is covered with an illumination of deep red and violet, neither of which colours are brilliant. The margin will be of a dark claret colour. The centre revives all the colours, but in a proportion of intensity greatly different from that in the common prismatic spectrum, because the radiant points \\( L, p, b, g, \\&c. \\) by which it is illuminated, are at such different distances from it. It will be white; but we apprehend not a pure white, being greatly overcharged with the middle colours.\n\nThese considerations show that the coloured fringes, which are observed to border very luminous objects seen on a dark ground through optical instruments, do not proceed from the object-glass of a telescope or microscope, but from an improper construction of the eye-glasses. The chromatic dispersion would produce fringes of a different colour, when they produce any at all, and the colours would be differently disposed. But this dispersion by the object-glass can hardly produce any fringes: its effect is a general and almost uniform mixture of circles all over the field, which produces an uniform haziness, as if the object were viewed at an improper distance, or out of its focus, as we vulgarly express it.\n\nWe may at present form a good guess at the limit which this cause puts to the performance of a telescope. A point of a very distant object is represented, in the picture formed by the object-glass, by a little circle, whose diameter is at least \\( \\frac{1}{300} \\)th of the aperture of the object-glass, making a very full allowance for the superior brilliancy and density of the central light. We look at this picture with a magnifying eye-glass. This magnifies the picture of the point. If it amplifies it to such a degree as to make it an object individually distinguishable, the confusion is then sensible. Now this can be computed. An object subtending one minute of a degree is distinguished by the dulled eye, even although it be a dark object on a bright ground. Let us therefore suppose a telescope, the object-glass of which is of six feet focal distance, and one inch aperture. The diameter of the circle of chromatic dispersion will be \\( \\frac{1}{300} \\)th of an inch, which subtends at the centre of the object-glass an angle of about \\( 9\\frac{1}{2} \\) seconds. This, when magnified six times by an eye-glass, would become a distinguishable object; and a telescope of this length would be indistinct if it magnified more than six times, if a point were thus spread out into a spot of uniform intensity. But the spot is much less intense about its margin. It is found experimentally that a piece of engraving, having fine cross hatches, is not sensibly indistinct till brought so far from the limits of perfectly distinct vision, that this indistinctness amounts to \\( 6' \\) or \\( 5' \\) in breadth.—Therefore such a telescope will be sensibly distinct when it magnifies 36 times; and this is very agreeable to experience.\n\nWe come, in the second place, to the more arduous task of ascertaining the error arising from the spherical figure of the surfaces employed in optical instruments.—Suffice it to say, before we begin, that although geometers have exhibited other forms of lenses which are totally exempt from this error, they cannot be executed by the artist; and we are therefore restricted to the employment of spherical surfaces.\n\nOf all the determinations which have been given of spherical aberration, that by Dr Smith, in his Optics, which is an improvement of the fundamental theorem of that most elegant geometer Huyghens, is the most perspicuous and palpable. Some others are more concise, and much better fitted for after use, and will therefore be employed by us in the prosecution of this article. But they do not keep in view the optical facts, giving the mind a picture of the progress of the rays, which it can contemplate and discover amidst many modifying circumstances. By ingenious substitutions of analytical symbols, the investigation is rendered expeditious, concise, and certain; but these are not immediate symbols of things, but of operations of the mind; objects sufficiently subtle of themselves, and having no need of substitutions to make us lose sight of the real subject; and thus our occupation degenerates into a process almost without ideas. We shall therefore set out with Dr Smith's fundamental Theorem.\n\n1. In Reflections.\n\nLet \\( AVB \\) (fig. 3.) be a concave spherical mirror, of which \\( C \\) is the centre, \\( V \\) the vertex, \\( CV \\) the axis, and \\( F \\) the focus of an infinitely slender pencil of parallel rays \\( Hh \\) passing...\nThe aberration will be different according as the refraction is made towards or from the perpendicular; that is, according as \\( r \\) is less or greater than \\( i \\). They are in the ratio of \\( \\frac{r^2}{d^2} \\) to \\( \\frac{i^2}{d^2} \\), or of \\( r^3 \\) to \\( i^3 \\). The aberration therefore is always much diminished when the refraction is made from a rare into a dense medium. The proportion of the fines for air and glass is nearly that of 3 to 2. When the light is refracted into the glass, the aberration is nearly \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) of PV; and when the light passes out of glass into air, it is about \\( \\frac{6}{5} \\) of PV.\n\n**Cor. 1.** \\( Ff = \\frac{r^2}{d^2} \\times \\frac{AP^2}{2CV} \\) nearly, and it is also \\( \\frac{r^2}{d^2} \\times \\frac{AP^2}{2CV} \\), because PV \\( = \\frac{AP^2}{2CV} \\) nearly, and \\( i : d = FV : CV \\).\n\n**Cor. 2.** Because \\( fP : PA = FF : FG \\) or \\( FV : AV = Ff : FG \\) nearly, we have FG, the lateral aberration, \\( = Ff \\times \\frac{AV}{FV} = \\frac{r^2}{d^2} \\times \\frac{AV^3}{2FV^3} = \\frac{r^3}{i^3} \\times \\frac{AV^3}{2CV^3} \\).\n\n**Cor. 3.** Because the angle \\( FfA \\) is proportional to \\( \\frac{FG}{FV} \\) very nearly, we have the angular aberration \\( FAf = \\frac{r^3}{d^2} \\times \\frac{AV^3}{2CV^3} \\).\n\nIn general, the longitudinal aberrations from the focus of central parallel rays are as the squares of the apertures directly, and as the focal distances inversely; and the lateral aberrations are as the cubes of the apertures directly, and the squares of the focal distances inversely; and the angular aberrations are as the cubes of the aperture directly, and the cubes of the focal distances inversely.\n\nThe reader must have observed, that to simplify the investigation, some small errors are admitted. PV and PD are not in the exact proportion that we assumed them, nor is DF equal to FV. But in the small apertures which suffice for optical instruments, these errors may be disregarded.\n\nThis spherical aberration produces an indistinctness of vision, in the same manner as the chromatic aberration does, viz. by spreading out every mathematical point of the object into a little spot in its picture; which spots, by mixing with each other, confuse the whole. We must now determine the diameter of the circle of diffusion, as we did in the case of chromatic dispersion.\n\nLet a ray \\( \\beta \\alpha \\) (fig. 6.) be refracted on the other side of the axis, into \\( \\alpha H \\phi \\), cutting \\( A'G \\) in \\( H \\), and draw the perpendicular \\( EH \\). Call \\( AVa, AVz, VF \\) (or \\( Vf, Vq \\), which in this comparison may be taken as equal) \\( = f, Ef = b, \\) and \\( fE = \\phi x \\).\n\n\\( AV : AV = Ff : Ff \\) (already demonstrated) and \\( Ff = \\frac{a^2}{b^2} b, \\) and \\( Ef - Ff, (or f) = b - \\frac{a^2}{b^2} b = \\frac{a^2 b - a^2 b}{a^2} \\),\n\n\\( = \\frac{b}{a^2} \\times a^2 - a^2 = \\frac{b}{a^2} \\times a + a \\times a - a \\). Also \\( Pf : PA = fE \\).\nWe are indebted to Father Boscovich for the elegant telescope determination of this distribution, which we have given in the article Optics. From this it appears, that the light in the margin of the circle of spherical aberration, instead of being incomparably rarer than in the spaces between it and the centre, is incomparably denser. The indistinctness therefore produced by the intersection of these luminous circumferences is vastly great, and increases the whole indistinctness exceedingly. By a gross calculation which we made, it appears to be increased at least 500 times. The proportional indistinctness therefore, instead of being $19 \\times 10^3$ to 1, is only $\\frac{19}{500}$, or nearly $\\frac{72}{20}$ to 1; a proportion still sufficiently great to warrant Newton's preference of the reflecting telescope of his invention. And we may now observe, that the reflecting telescope has even a great advantage over a refracting one of the same focal distance, with respect to its spherical aberration: For we have seen (Cor. 2.) that the lateral aberration is $\\frac{r^2}{i^2} \\cdot \\frac{AV^3}{2CV^2}$. This for a plano-convex glass is nearly $\\frac{9}{4} \\cdot \\frac{AV^3}{2CV^2}$. And the diameter of the circle of aberration is one-fourth of this, or $\\frac{9}{16} \\cdot \\frac{AV^3}{2CV^2}$. In like manner, the lateral aberration of a concave mirror is $\\frac{AV^3}{2CV^2}$; and the diameter of the circle of dispersion is $\\frac{AV^3}{8CV^2}$; and therefore if the surfaces were portions of the same sphere, the diameter of the circle of aberration of refracted rays would be to that of the circle of aberration of reflected rays as $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$, or as 9 to 4. But when the refracting and reflecting surfaces, in the position here considered, have the same focal distance, the radius of the refracting surface is four times that of the reflecting surface. The proportion of the diameters of the circles of spherical aberration is that of $9 \\times 4^2$ to 4, or of $144$ to 4, or $36$ to 1. The distinctness therefore of the reflector is $36 \\times 36$, or $1296$ times greater than that of a plano-convex lens (placed with the plane side next the distant object) of the same breadth and focal distance, and will therefore admit of a much greater magnifying power. This comparison is indeed made in circumstances most favourable to the reflector, because this is the very worst position of a plano-convex lens. But we have not as yet learned the aberration in any other position. In another position the refraction and consequent aberration of both surfaces are complicated.\n\nBefore we proceed to the consideration of this very difficult subject, we may deduce from what has been already demonstrated several general rules and maxims in the construction of telescopes, which will explain (to such readers as do not wish to enter more deeply into the subject), and justify the proportion which long practice of the best artists has sanctioned.\n\nIndistinctness proceeds from the commixture of the circles of aberration on the retina of the eye: For any one sensible point of the retina, being the centre of a circle of aberration, will at once be affected by the admixture of the rays of as many different pencils of light as there are sensible points in the area of that circle, and will convey to the mind a mixed sensation of as many visible\nvisible points of the object. This number will be as the area of the circle of aberrations, whatever be the size of a sensible point of the retina. Now in vision with telescopes, the diameter of the circle of aberration on the retina is as the apparent magnitude of the diameter of the corresponding circle in the focus of the eye-glass; that is, as the angle subtended by this diameter at the centre of the eye-glass; that is, as the diameter itself directly, and as the focal distance of the eye-glass inversely. And the area of that circle on the retina is as the area of the circle in the focus of the eye-glass directly, and as the square of the focal distance of the eye-glass inversely. And this is the measure of the apparent indistinctness.\n\nCor. In all sorts of telescopes, and also in compound microscopes, an object is seen equally distinct when the focal distances of the eye-glasses are proportional to the diameters of the circles of aberration in the focus of the object-glass.\n\nHere we do not consider the trifling alteration which well constructed eye-glasses may add to the indistinctness of the first image.\n\nIn refracting telescopes, the apparent indistinctness is as the area of the object-glass directly, and as the square of the focal distance of the eye-glass inversely. For it has been shown, that the area of the circle of dispersion is as the area of the object-glass, and that the spherical aberration is insignificant when compared with this.\n\nTherefore, to make reflecting telescopes equally distinct, the diameter of the object-glass must be proportional to the focal distance of the eye-glass.\n\nBut in reflecting telescopes, the indistinctness is as the sixth power of the aperture of the object-glass directly, and as the fourth power of the focal distance of the object-glass and square of the focal distance of the eye-glass inversely. This is evident from the dimensions of the circle of aberration, which was found proportional to \\(\\frac{AV^3}{CV^2}\\).\n\nTherefore, to have them equally distinct, the cubes of the apertures must be proportional to the squares of the focal distance multiplied by the focal distance of the eye-glass.\n\nBy these rules, and a standard telescope of approved goodness, an artist can always proportion the parts of any instrument he wishes to construct. Mr Huyghens made one, of which the object-glass had 30 feet focal distance and three inches diameter. The eye-glass had 3.3 inches focal distance. And its performance was found superior to any which he had seen; nor did this appear owing to any chance goodness of the object-glass, because he found others equally good which were constructed on similar proportions. This has therefore been adopted as a standard.\n\nIt does not at first appear how there can be any difficulty in this matter, because we can always diminish the aperture of the object-glass or speculum till the circle of aberration is as small as we please. But by diminishing this aperture, we diminish the light in the duplicate ratio of the aperture. Whatever be the aperture, the brightness is diminished by the magnifying power, which spreads the light over a greater surface in the bottom of the eye. The apparent brightness must be as the square of the aperture of the telescope directly, and the square of the amplification of the diameter of an object inversely. Objects therefore will be seen equally bright if the apertures of the telescopes be as the focal distances of the object-glasses directly, and the focal distances of the single eye-glass (or eye-glass equivalent to the eye-piece) inversely. Therefore, to have telescopes equally distinct and equally bright, we must combine these proportions with the former. It is needless to go farther into this subject, because the construction of refracting telescopes has been so materially changed by the correction of the chromatic aberration, that there can hardly be given any proportion between the object-glass and eye-glasses. Everything now depends on the degree in which we can correct the aberrations of the object-glass. We have been able so far to diminish the chromatic aberration, that we can give very great apertures without its becoming sensible. But this is attended with so great an increase of the aberration of figure, that this last becomes a sensible quality. A lens which has 30° for its semi-aperture, has a circle of aberration equal to its chromatic aberration. Fortunately we can derive from the very method of contrary refractions, which we employ for removing the chromatic aberration, a correction of the other. We are indebted for this contrivance also to the illustrious Newton.\n\nWe call this Newton's contrivance, because he was the first who proposed a construction of an object-glass in which the aberration was corrected by the contrary aberrations of glass and water.\n\nHuyghens had indeed supposed, that our all-wise Creator had employed in the eyes of animals many refractions in place of one, in order to make the vision more distinct; and the invidious detractors from Newton's fame have catched at this vague conjecture as an indication of his knowledge of the possibility of destroying the aberration of figure by contrary refractions. But this is very ill-founded. Huyghens has acquired sufficient reputation by his theory of aberrations. The scope of his writing in the passage alluded to, is to show that, by dividing any intended refraction into parts, and producing a certain convergence to or divergence from the axis of an optical instrument by means of two or three lenses instead of one, we diminish the aberrations four or nine times. This conjecture about the eye was therefore in the natural train of his thoughts. But he did not think of destroying the aberration altogether by opposite refractions. Newton, in 1669, says, that opticians need not trouble themselves about giving figures to their glasses other than spherical. If this figure were all the obstacle to the improvement of telescopes, he could show them a construction of an object-glass having spherical surfaces where the aberration is destroyed; and accordingly gives the construction of one composed of glass and water, in which this is done completely by means of contrary refractions.\n\nThe general principle is this: When the radiant point R (fig. 7), or focus of incident rays, and its conjugate focus F of refracted central rays, are on opposite sides of the refracting surface or lens V, the conjugate focus f of marginal rays is nearer to R than F is. But when the focus of incident rays R' lies on the same side with its conjugate focus F' for central rays, R'/f' is greater than R'F'.\n\nNow fig. 8 represents the contrivance for destroying the colour produced at F, the principal focus of the convex\nconvex lens V, of crown glass, by means of the contrary refraction of the concave lens v of flint glass. The incident parallel rays are made to converge to F by the first lens. This convergence is diminished, but not entirely destroyed, by the concave lens v, and the focus is formed in F'. F' and F therefore are conjugate foci of the concave lens. If F be the focus of V for central rays, the marginal rays will be collected at some point f nearer to the lens. If F be now considered as the focus of light incident on the centre of v, and F' be the conjugate focus, the marginal ray pF would be refracted to some point f' lying beyond F'. Therefore the marginal ray pf may be refracted to F', if the aberration of the concave be properly adjusted to that of the convex.\n\nThis brings us to the most difficult part of our subject, the compounded aberrations of different surfaces. Our limits will not give us room for treating this in the same elementary and perspicuous manner that we employed for a single surface. We must try to do it in a compendious way, which will admit at once the different surfaces and the different refractive powers of different substances. This must naturally render the process more complicated; but we hope to treat the subject in a way easily comprehended by any person moderately acquainted with common algebra; and we trust that our attempt will be favourably received by an indulgent public, as it is (as far as we know) the only difference in our language on the construction of achromatic instruments. We cannot but express our surprise at this indifference about an invention which has done so much honour to our country, and which now constitutes a very lucrative branch of its manufacture. Our artists infinitely surpass all the performances of foreigners in this branch, and supply the markets of Europe without any competition; yet it is from the writings on the continent that they derive their scientific instruction, and particularly from the dissertations of Clairaut, who has wonderfully simplified the analysis of optical propositions. We shall freely borrow from him, and from the writings of Abbé Bofcovich, who has considerably improved the first views of Clairaut. We recommend the originals to the curious reader. Clairaut's dissertations are to be found in the Memoirs of the Academy of Paris, 1756, &c., those of Bofcovich in the Memoirs of the Academy of Bologna, and in his five volumes of Opulenta, published at Bologna in 1785. To these may be added D'Alembert and Euler. The only thing in our language is the translation of a very imperfect work by Scheffer.\n\n**Lemma 1.** In the right-angled triangle MXS (fig. 9.), of which one side MX is very small in comparison of either of the others; the excess of the hypotenuse MS above the side XS, is very nearly equal to \\(\\frac{MX^2}{2XS}\\) or to \\(\\frac{MX^2}{2XS}\\). For if about the centre S, with the radius SM, we describe the semicircle AMO, we have AX = XO = MX. Now AX = MS - SX, and XO, is nearly equal to 2MS or 2XS; on the other hand, MS is nearly equal to XS + \\(\\frac{MX^2}{2XS}\\); and in like manner MG is nearly equal to \\(\\frac{MX^2}{2XS} + XG\\), and MH is nearly equal to \\(\\frac{MX^2}{2XS} + XH\\).\n\n**Prop. I.** Let the ray m M, incident on the spherical surface AM, converge to G; that is, let G be the focus of incident rays. It is required to find the focus F of refracted rays.\n\nLet m express the ratio of the fine of incidence and refraction; that is, let m be to r as the fine of incidence to the fine of refraction in the substance of the sphere.\n\nThen \\(MG : GS = \\text{fin. } MSH : \\text{fin. } SMG\\), and \\(m : r = \\text{fin. } SMG : \\text{fin. } SMH\\); therefore \\(m \\times MG : GS = \\text{fin. } MSH : \\text{fin. } SMH\\).\n\nNow S, MSH : S, SMH = MH : HS. Therefore, finally, \\(m \\times MG : GS = MH : HS\\).\n\nNow let MS, the radius of the refracting surface, be called a. Let AG, the distance of the focus of incident rays from the surface, be called r. And let AH, the focal distance of refracted rays, be called x. Lastly, let the fine MX of the semi-aperture be called e. Observe, too, that a, r, x, are to be considered as positive quantities, when AS, AG, AH, lie from the surface in the direction in which the light is supposed to move. If therefore the refracting surface be concave, that is, having the centre on that side from which the light comes; or if the incident rays are divergent, or the refracted rays are divergent; then a, r, x, are negative quantities.\n\nIt is plain that \\(HS = x - a; GS = r - a\\); also \\(AX = \\frac{e^2}{2a}\\) nearly. \\(HX = a - \\frac{e^2}{2a}; GX = r - \\frac{e^2}{2a}\\). Now add to HX and to GX their differences from MH and MG, which (by the Lemma) are \\(\\frac{e^2}{2x}\\) and \\(\\frac{e^2}{2r}\\). We get MH \\(= x - \\frac{e^2}{2a} + \\frac{e^2}{2x}\\), and MG \\(= r - \\frac{e^2}{2a} + \\frac{e^2}{2r}\\). In order to shorten our notation, make \\(k = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{r}\\). This will make \\(MG = r - \\frac{ke^2}{2}\\).\n\nNow substitute these values in the final analogy at the top of this column, viz. MH : HS = m.MG : GS; it becomes \\(x - \\frac{e^2}{2a} + \\frac{e^2}{2x} : x - a = m r - \\frac{mk e^2}{2} : r - a\\) (or \\(a r k\\)), because \\(k = \\frac{r - a}{a r}\\), and \\(a r k = r - a\\). Now multiply the extreme and mean terms of this analogy. It is evident that it must give us an equation which will give us a value of x or AH, the quantity sought.\n\nBut this equation is quadratic. We may avoid the solution by an approximation which is sufficiently accurate, by substituting for x in the fraction \\(\\frac{e^2}{2x}\\) (which is very small in all cases of optical instruments), an approximate very easily obtained, and very near the truth. This is the focal distance of an infinitely slender pencil of rays converging to G. This we know by the common optical theorem to be \\(\\frac{amr}{m - 1 r - a}\\). Let this be called...\ncalled $\\phi$; if we substitute $k$ in place of $\\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{r}$, this value of $\\phi$ becomes $\\frac{am}{m-a^2k}$.\n\nThis gives us, by the by, an easily remembered expression (and beautifully simple) of the refracted focus of an infinitely slender pencil, corresponding to any distance $r$ of the radiant point. For since $\\phi = \\frac{am}{m-a^2k}$,\n\n$\\frac{1}{\\phi}$ must be $\\frac{m-a^2k}{am} = \\frac{m}{am} - \\frac{a^2k}{am}$. We may even express it more simply, by expanding $k$, and it becomes $\\frac{1}{\\phi} = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{ma} - \\frac{1}{mr}$.\n\nNow put this value of $\\frac{1}{\\phi}$ in place of the $\\frac{1}{\\phi}$ in the analogy employed above. The first term of the analogy becomes $\\frac{e^2}{2a} + \\frac{k^2}{2m}$, or $\\frac{e^2}{2m}$. The analogy now becomes $\\frac{e^2}{2m} \\cdot \\frac{am}{m} = \\frac{mk^2}{2m} \\cdot ark$.\n\nHence we obtain the linear equation $mr \\cdot \\frac{mk^2}{2m} = \\frac{mk^2}{2m} \\cdot ark$; from which we finally deduce\n\n$$mr \\cdot \\frac{mk^2}{2m} = \\frac{mk^2}{2m} \\cdot ark$$\n\nWe may simplify this greatly by attending to the elementary theorem in fluxions, that the fraction $\\frac{x+y}{y+y}$ differs from the fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$ by the quantity $\\frac{xy-xy}{y^2}$; this being the fluxion of $\\frac{x}{y}$. Therefore $\\frac{x+y}{y+y} = \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{xy-xy}{y^2}$. Now the preceding formula is nearly in this situation. It may be written thus;\n\n$$mr \\cdot \\frac{mk^2}{2m} = \\frac{mk^2}{2m} \\cdot ark$$\n\nwhen the last terms of the numerator and denominator are very small in comparison with the first, and may be considered as the $x$ and $y$, while $mr$ is the $x$, and $mr - ark$ is the $y$.\n\nTreating it in this way, it may be stated thus:\n\n$$x = \\frac{mr}{mr - ark} + \\frac{(mr)^2}{(mr - ark)^2} \\left( \\frac{mk^2}{2m} + \\frac{ark^2}{2m} \\right)$$\n\nor $x = \\frac{mr}{r(m-a^2k)} + \\frac{(mr)^2}{(mr - ark)(mk^2 + ark^2)} \\times \\frac{1}{2} e^2$.\n\nThe first term $\\frac{mr}{r(m-a^2k)}$ or $\\frac{mr}{m-a^2k}$ is evidently $\\phi$, the focal distance of an infinitely slender pencil.\n\nTherefore the aberration is expressed by the second term, which we must endeavour to simplify.\n\nIf we now perform the multiplication indicated by $(mr - ark) \\times (mk^2 - ark^2)$, it is plain that $mr \\times mk^2$ destroys the first term $mr \\times mk^2$ of the numerator of our small fraction, and there remains of this numerator $(mk^2 - ark^2) \\times \\frac{1}{2} e^2$, which is equal to $mk^2 \\left( \\frac{r^2}{m} - \\frac{r^2}{m^2} + \\frac{r^2}{m^3} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} e^2$.\n\nThe denominator was $r^2(m-a^2k)^2$, and the fraction now becomes $\\frac{mk^2}{(mr - ark)^2} \\left( \\frac{r^2}{m} - \\frac{r^2}{m^2} + \\frac{r^2}{m^3} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} e^2$, which is evidently $\\phi \\left( \\frac{r^2}{m} - \\frac{r^2}{m^2} + \\frac{r^2}{m^3} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} e^2$. Now recollect that $k = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{r}$. Therefore $\\frac{r^2}{m} = \\frac{r^2}{m^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{r} \\right) = \\frac{r^2}{m^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{r} \\right)$. Therefore, instead of $\\frac{r^2}{m^2}$, write $\\frac{r^2}{m^2}$, and we get the fraction $\\phi \\left( \\frac{r^2}{m^2} - \\frac{r^2}{m^3} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} e^2$, which is equal to $\\phi \\left( \\frac{r^2}{m^2} - \\frac{r^2}{m^3} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} e^2$, and finally to $\\phi \\left( \\frac{r^2}{m^2} - \\frac{r^2}{m^3} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} e^2$.\n\nTherefore the focal distance of refracted rays is $\\phi = \\phi \\left( \\frac{r^2}{m^2} - \\frac{r^2}{m^3} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} e^2$.\n\nThis consists of two parts. The first $\\phi$ is the focal distance of an infinitely slender pencil of central rays, and the other $\\phi \\left( \\frac{r^2}{m^2} - \\frac{r^2}{m^3} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} e^2$ is the aberration arising from the spherical figure of the refracting surface.\n\nOur formula has thus at last put on a very simple form, and is vastly preferable to Dr Smith's for practice.\n\nThis aberration is evidently proportional to the square of the semi-aperture, and to the square of the distance $\\phi$; but in order to obtain this simplicity, several quantities were neglected. The assumption of the equality of $AX$ to $\\frac{e^2}{2a}$ is the first source of error. A much more accurate value of it would have been $\\frac{2ae^2}{4a^2 + e^2}$, for it is really $\\frac{e^2}{2a - AX}$. If for $AX$ we substitute its approximated value $\\frac{e^2}{2a}$, we should have $AX = \\frac{e^2}{2a - \\frac{e^2}{2a}} = \\frac{2ae^2}{4a^2 - e^2}$. To have used this value would not have much complicated the calculus; but it did not occur to us till we had finished the investigation, and it would have required the whole to be changed. The operation in page 246, col. 1, par. 3, is another source of error. But these errors are very inconsiderable when the aperture...\nThey increase for the most part with an increase of aperture, but not in the proportion of any regular function of it; so that we cannot improve the formula by any manageable process, and must be contented with it. The errors are precisely the same with those of Dr Smith's theorem, and indeed with those of any that we have seen, which are not vastly more complicated.\n\nAs this is to be frequently combined with subsequent operations, we shorten the expression by putting \\( \\theta \\) for\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m-1}{m^3} \\left( \\frac{k^2}{r} - \\frac{m k^2}{r} \\right)^{\\frac{e^2}{2}}.\n\\]\n\nThen \\( \\phi^2 \\theta \\) will express the aberration of the first refraction from the focal distance of an infinitely slender pencil; and now the focal distance of refracted rays is \\( f = \\phi - \\phi^2 \\theta \\).\n\nIf the incident rays are parallel, \\( r \\) becomes infinite, and\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{m-1}{m^3} k^2 \\frac{e^2}{2}.\n\\]\n\nBut in this case \\( k \\) becomes \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\), and\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\phi} = \\frac{m-1}{m a}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\phi = \\frac{m a}{m-1},\n\\]\n\nand \\( \\phi^2 \\theta \\) becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m^2 a^2}{(m-1)^2} \\times \\frac{1}{a^3} \\times \\frac{e^2}{2} = \\frac{e^2}{2(m-1)a}.\n\\]\n\nThis is the aberration of extreme parallel rays.\n\nWe must now add the refraction of another surface.\n\nLemma 2. If the focal distance \\( AG \\) be changed by a small quantity \\( G'g \\), the focal distance \\( AH \\) will also be changed by a small quantity \\( H'h \\), and we shall have\n\n\\[\nm : AG^2 : AH^2 = G'g : H'h.\n\\]\n\nDraw \\( MG \\), \\( MH \\), and the perpendiculars \\( Gi \\), \\( Hi \\). Then, because the sines of the angles of incidence are in a constant ratio to the sines of the angles of refraction, and the increments of these small angles are proportional to the increments of the sines, these increments of the angles are in the same constant ratio. Therefore,\n\nWe have the angle \\( CMg \\) to \\( HM \\) as \\( m \\) to \\( 1 \\).\n\nNow\n\n\\[\nGg : Gi = AG : AM,\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nGi : hi = m : AG : HA,\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nhi : HA = MA : AH;\n\\]\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[\nGg : Hi = m : AG^2 : AH^2.\n\\]\n\nThe easiest and most perspicuous method for obtaining the aberration of rays twice refracted, will be to consider the first refraction as not having any aberration, and determine the aberration of the second refraction. Then conceive the focus of the first refraction as shifted by the aberration. This will produce a change in the focal distance of the second refraction, which may be determined by this Lemma.\n\nProof II. Let \\( AM \\), \\( BN \\) (fig. 10.) be two spherical surfaces, including a refracting substance, and having their centres \\( C \\) and \\( c \\) in the line \\( AG \\). Let the ray \\( aA \\) pass through the centres, which it will do without refraction. Let another ray \\( mM \\), tending to \\( G \\), be refracted by the first surface into \\( MH \\), cutting the second surface in \\( N \\), where it is farther refracted into \\( NH \\). It is required to determine the focal distance \\( BI \\).\n\nIt is plain that the sine of incidence on the second surface is to the sine of refraction into the surrounding air as \\( 1 \\) to \\( m \\). Also \\( BI \\) may be determined in relation to \\( BH \\), by means of \\( BH \\), \\( Nx \\), \\( Be \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{m} \\), in the same way that \\( AH \\) was determined in relation to \\( AG \\), by means of \\( AG \\), \\( MX \\), \\( AC \\), and \\( m \\).\n\nLet the radius of the second surface be \\( b \\), and let \\( e \\) still express the semi-aperture, because it hardly differs from \\( Nx \\). Also let \\( u \\) be the thickness of the lens. Then observe, that the focal distance of the rays refracted by the first surface, (neglecting the thickness of the lens and the aberration of the first surface), is the distance of the radiant point for the second refraction, or is the focal distance of rays incident on the second surface. In place of \\( r \\) therefore we must take \\( \\phi \\); and as we made \\( k = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{r} \\), in order to abbreviate the calculus, let us now make \\( l = \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{1}{\\phi} \\); and make \\( \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{b} - m l \\), as we made \\( \\frac{1}{\\phi} = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{m} \\). Lastly, in place of \\( \\theta \\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m-1}{m^3} \\left( \\frac{k^2}{r} - \\frac{m k^2}{r} \\right)^{\\frac{e^2}{2}},\n\\]\n\nmake \\( \\theta = \\left( \\frac{1}{m} - 1 \\right)^{\\frac{e^2}{2}} \\).\n\nThus we have got an expression similar to the other, and the focal distance \\( BI \\), after two refractions, becomes\n\n\\[\nBI = f - f^2 \\theta.\n\\]\n\nBut this is on the supposition that \\( BH \\) is equal to \\( \\phi \\); whereas it is really \\( \\phi - \\phi^2 \\theta - u \\). This must occasion a change in the value just now obtained of \\( BI \\). The source of the change is twofold. 1st, Because in the value \\( \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{1}{\\phi} \\), we must put \\( \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{1}{\\phi} - \\phi^2 \\theta - u \\), and because we must do the same in the fraction \\( \\frac{m^2}{\\phi} \\). In the second place, when the value of \\( BH \\) is diminished by the quantity \\( \\phi^2 \\theta + u \\), \\( BI \\) will suffer a change in the proportion determined by the 2d Lemma. The first difference may safely be neglected, because the value of \\( \\theta \\) is very small, by reason of the coefficient \\( \\frac{e^2}{2} \\) being very small, and also because the variation bears a very small ratio to the quantity itself, when the true value of \\( \\phi \\) differs but little from that of the quantity for which it is employed. The chief change in \\( BI \\) is that which is determined by the Lemma. Therefore take from \\( BI \\) the variation of \\( BH \\), multiplied by \\( \\frac{m}{BH^2} \\), which is very nearly \\( \\frac{mf^2}{\\phi^2} \\). The product of this multiplication is\n\n\\[\nmf^2 \\theta + \\frac{mf^2 u}{\\phi^2}.\n\\]\n\nThis being taken from \\( f \\), leaves us for the value of \\( BI \\)\n\n\\[\nf^2 \\frac{ma}{\\phi^2} - f^2 (m \\theta + \\theta').\n\\]\n\nIn this value \\( f \\) is the focal distance of an infinitely slender pencil of rays twice refracted by a lens having no thickness, \\( \\frac{mf^2}{\\phi^2} \\) is the shortening occasioned by the thickness, and \\( f^2 (m \\theta + \\theta') \\) is the effect of the two aberrations arising from the aperture.\n\nIt will be convenient, for several collateral purposes, to exterminate from these formulæ the quantities \\( b \\), \\( l \\), and \\( \\phi \\). For this purpose make \\( \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{b} \\). We have already \\( k = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{r} \\); and \\( \\frac{1}{\\phi} = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{mr} \\); and \\( l = \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{1}{\\phi} = \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{ma} - \\frac{1}{mr} \\). Now for \\( \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{1}{a} \\) write \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) and\nand we get \\( l = \\frac{1}{ma} - \\frac{1}{mr} - \\frac{1}{n} \\). Therefore \\( \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{m}{a} + \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{m}{n} \\) (by construction, page 347. Prop. II.) becomes \\( \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{m}{a} + \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{m}{n} \\).\n\nThis last value of \\( \\frac{1}{f} \\) (the reciprocal of the focus of a slender pencil twice refracted), viz. \\( \\frac{m-1}{n} + \\frac{1}{r} \\), is the simplest that can be imagined, and makes \\( n \\) as a substitute for \\( \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{b} \\); a most useful symbol, as we shall frequently find in the sequel. It also gives a very simple expression of the focal distance of parallel rays, which we may call the principal focal distance of the lens, and distinguish it in future by the symbol \\( p \\); for the expression \\( \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{m-1}{n} + \\frac{1}{r} \\), becomes \\( \\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{m-1}{n} \\) when the incident light is parallel. And this gives us another very simple and useful measure of \\( f \\); for \\( \\frac{1}{f} \\) becomes \\( \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{r} \\). These equations \\( \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{m-1}{n} + \\frac{1}{r} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{m-1}{n} \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{r} \\), deserve therefore to be made very familiar to the mind.\n\nWe may also take notice of another property of \\( n \\). It is half the radius of an isosceles lens, which is equivalent to the lens whose radii are \\( a \\) and \\( b \\): for suppose the lens to be isosceles, that is \\( a = b \\); then \\( n = \\frac{1}{a} \\).\n\nNow the second \\( a \\) is negative if the first be positive, or positive if the first be negative. Therefore \\( \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{a+b}{a^2} = \\frac{a+a}{a^2} = \\frac{2}{a} \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{2}{a} \\), and \\( n = \\frac{a}{2} \\). Now the focal distance of this lens is \\( \\frac{m-1}{n} \\), and so is that of the other, and they are equivalent.\n\nBut, to proceed with our investigation, recollect that we had \\( \\theta = \\frac{m-1}{m^2} \\left( k^3 - \\frac{k^2}{r} \\right) \\frac{e^2}{2} \\). Therefore \\( m \\theta = \\frac{m-1}{m} \\left( k^3 - \\frac{k^2}{r} \\right) \\frac{e^2}{2} \\). And \\( \\theta' \\) was \\( \\frac{m-1}{m} \\left( -k^3 + \\frac{k^2}{r} \\right) \\frac{e^2}{2} \\). Therefore \\( m \\theta + \\theta' \\), the aberration (neglecting the thickness of the lens is \\( f^2 \\frac{m-1}{m} \\left( k^3 - \\frac{k^2}{r} \\right) \\frac{e^2}{2} \\)).\n\nIf we now write for \\( k, l, \\) and \\( \\phi \\), their values as determined above, performing all the necessary multiplications, and arrange the terms in such a manner as to collect in one sum the coefficients of \\( a, n, \\) and \\( r \\), we shall find 4 terms for the value of \\( m \\theta \\), and 10 for the value of \\( \\theta' \\). The 4 are destroyed by as many with contrary signs in the value of \\( \\theta' \\), and there remain 6 terms to express the value of \\( m \\theta + \\theta' \\), which we shall express by one symbol \\( g \\); and the equation stands thus:\n\n\\[ q = \\frac{m-1}{m} \\left( \\frac{m^2}{a^2} + \\frac{m+2}{a^2} + \\frac{3m^2}{r^2} \\right) \\frac{e^2}{2}. \\]\n\nThe focal distance therefore of rays twice refracted, reckoned from the last surface, or BI, corrected for aberration, and for the thickness of the lens, is \\( f = \\frac{m}{\\phi^2} - f^2 q \\), consisting of three parts, viz. \\( f \\), the focal distance of central rays; \\( f^2 \\frac{m}{\\phi^2} \\), the correction for the thickness of the lens; and \\( f^2 q \\), the aberration.\n\nThe formula at the top of this column appears very complex, but is of very easy management, requiring only the preparation of the simple numbers which form the numerators of the fractions included in the parenthesis. When the incident rays are parallel, the terms vanish which have \\( r \\) in the denominator, so that only the three first terms are used.\n\nWe might here point out the cases which reduce the aberration expressed in the formula last referred to, to nothing; but as they can scarcely occur in the object-glas of a telescope, we omit it for the present, and proceed to the combination of two or more lenses.\n\nLemma 3. If AG be changed by a small quantity \\( Gg \\), BI suffers a change \\( Ii \\), and \\( Gg : Ii = AG : BI \\). For it is well known that the small angles GM and INI are equal; and therefore their subtenses \\( Gk \\) and \\( In \\) are proportional to MG, NI, or to AG, AI nearly, when the aperture is moderate. Therefore we have (nearly)\n\n\\[ Gk : In : AG : BI \\]\n\\[ In : Ii = AM : BI \\]\n\\[ Gg : Gk = AG : AM \\]\n\nTherefore \\( Gg : Ii = AG : BI \\).\n\nProp. III. To determine the focal distance of rays refracted by two lenses placed near to each other on a common axis.\n\nLet AM, BN (fig. 11.) be the surfaces of the first lens, and CO, DP be the surfaces of the second, and let \\( b \\) be the thickness of the second lens, and \\( d \\) the interval between them. Let the radius of the anterior surface of the second lens be \\( a' \\), and the radius of its posterior surface be \\( b' \\). Let \\( m' \\) be to \\( i \\) as the fine of incidence to the fine of refraction in the substance of the second lens. Lastly, let \\( p' \\) be the principal focal distance of the second lens. Let the extreme or marginal ray meet the axis in L after passing through both lenses, so that DL is the ultimate focal distance, reckoned from the last surface.\n\nIt is plain that DL may be determined by means of \\( a', b', m', p' \\), and CI, in the same manner that BI was determined by means of \\( a, b, m, p, \\) and AG.\n\nThe value of BI is \\( f = \\frac{m}{\\phi^2} - f^2 q \\). Take from this the interval \\( d \\), and we have \\( CI = f - \\frac{m}{\\phi^2} - d - f^2 q \\). Let the small part \\( - \\frac{m}{\\phi^2} - d - f^2 q \\) be neglected for the present, and let CI be supposed \\( = f \\). As we formed \\( \\phi, f, \\) and \\( q, \\) by means of \\( a, b, m, n, \\) and \\( r, \\)\nLet us now form \\( \\phi' \\) and \\( \\phi'' \\), for the second lens, by means of \\( a', b', m', n' \\), \\( \\left( = \\frac{1}{a'} - \\frac{1}{b'} \\right) \\), and \\( r' \\). \\( \\phi' \\) will be the focal distance of a slender pencil refracted by the first surface, \\( f' \\) will be the focal distance of this pencil after two refractions, and \\( q' \\) will be the coefficient of the aberration, neglecting the thicknesses and interval of the lenses.\n\nProceeding in this way, \\( DL \\) will be \\( = f' - m \\beta \\frac{f'^2}{\\phi'} - f'^2 q' \\). But because \\( CI \\) is really less than \\( f' \\), by the quantity \\( m \\alpha \\frac{f'^2}{\\phi'^2} + \\delta + f'^2 q' \\), we must (by Lemma 3.) subtract the product of this quantity, multiplied by \\( \\frac{DL}{BI^2} \\), which is nearly \\( \\frac{f'^2}{\\phi'^2} \\), from \\( f' - m \\beta \\frac{f'^2}{\\phi'^2} f'^2 q' \\).\n\nBy this process we shall have\n\n\\[\nDL = f' - f'^2 \\left( \\frac{m \\alpha}{\\phi'^2} + \\delta + \\frac{m \\beta}{\\phi'^2} \\right) - f'^2 (q + q'),\n\\]\n\nThe first term \\( f' \\) of this value of \\( DI \\) is the focal distance of a slender pencil of central rays refracted by both lenses, neglecting their thicknesses and distance; the second term, \\( -f'^2 \\left( \\frac{m \\alpha}{\\phi'^2} + \\delta + \\frac{m \\beta}{\\phi'^2} \\right) \\) is the correction necessary for these circumstances; and the third term, \\( -f'^2 (q + q') \\), is the correction for the aperture \\( 2e \\).\n\nAnd it is evident that \\( q' \\) is a formula precisely similar to \\( q \\), containing the same number of terms, and differing only by the \\( m', a', n' \\), and \\( r' \\), employed in place of \\( m, a, n, \\) and \\( r \\).\n\nIt is also evident, that if there be a third lens, we shall obtain its focal distance by a process precisely similar to that by which we obtained \\( DL \\); and so on for any number of lenses.\n\nThus have we obtained formulae by which the foci of rays are determined in the most general terms; and in such a manner as shall point out the connection of the curvatures, thicknesses and distances of the lenses, with their spherical aberrations, and with the final aberration of the compound lens, and give the aberrations in separate symbols, so that we can treat them by themselves, and subject them to any conditions which may enable us to correct one of them by another.\n\nWe also feel in general, that the corrections for the thickness and distance of the lenses are exhibited in terms which involve only the focal distances of central rays, and have very little influence on the aberrations, and still less on the ratio of the aberrations of the different lenses. This is a most convenient circumstance; for we may neglect them while we are determining \\( q \\) and \\( q' \\), and in determining the ratio of the focal distances of the several lenses, on which the correction of the chromatic aberration chiefly depends. Therefore, in the construction of a compound lens for uniting the different colours, we may neglect this correction for the thickness and distance till the end of the process. When we apply it, we shall find that it chiefly affects the final focal distance, making it somewhat longer, but has hardly any influence either on the chromatic or spherical aberration. We do not hesitate to say, that the final formulae here given are abundantly accurate, while they are vastly more manageable than those employed by Euler or D'Alembert. We have calculated trigonometrically the progress of the rays through one of the glasses, which will be given as an example, giving it a very extravagant aperture, that the errors of the formulae might be very remarkable. We found the real aberration exceed the aberration assigned by the formula by no more than \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) part, a difference which is quite insignificant. The process here given derives its simplicity from the frequent occurrence of harmonic proportions in all optical theorems. This enabled Mr Clairaut to employ the reciprocals of the radii and distances with so much simplicity and generality.\n\nWe consider it as another advantage of Mr Clairaut's method, that it gives, by the way, formulae for the more ordinary questions in optics, which are of wonderful simplicity, and most easily remembered. The chief problems in the elementary construction of optical instruments relate to the focal distances of central rays. This determines the focal distances and arrangement of the glasses. All the rest may be called the refinement of optics; teaching us how to avoid or correct the indistinctness, the colours, and the distortions, which are produced in the images formed by these simple constructions. We shall mention a few of these formulae which occur in our process, and tend greatly to abbreviate it when managed by an experienced analyst.\n\nLet \\( m \\) be to \\( 1 \\) as the sine of incidence to the sine of refraction; let \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) be the radii of the anterior and posterior surfaces of a lens; let \\( r \\) be the distance of the radiant point, or the focus of incident central rays, and \\( f \\) the distance of the conjugate focus; and let \\( p \\) be the principal focal distance of the lens, or the focal distance of parallel rays. Make \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) equal to \\( \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{b} \\); let the same letters \\( a', b', r', \\) &c., express the same things for a second lens; and \\( a'', b'', r'', \\) &c., express them for a third; and so on. Then we have \\( \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{m-1}{n} + \\frac{1}{r} \\); \\( \\frac{1}{f'} = \\frac{m'-1}{n'} + \\frac{1}{r'} \\); \\( \\frac{1}{f''} = \\frac{m''-1}{n''} + \\frac{1}{r''} \\), &c.\n\nTherefore when the incident light is parallel, and \\( r \\) infinite, we have \\( \\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{m-1}{n} \\); \\( \\frac{1}{p'} = \\frac{m'-1}{n'} \\); \\( \\frac{1}{p''} = \\frac{m''-1}{n''} \\), &c.\n\nAnd when several lenses are contiguous, so that their intervals may be neglected, and therefore \\( \\frac{1}{f} \\), belonging to the first lens, becomes \\( \\frac{1}{r} \\), belonging to the second, we have\n\n1. \\( \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{f'} = \\frac{m-1}{n} + \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{r} \\).\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{f''} = \\frac{m'-1}{n'} + \\frac{m-1}{n} + \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{1}{p'} + \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{r} \\).\n3. \\( \\frac{1}{f'''} = \\frac{m''-1}{n''} + \\frac{m'-1}{n'} + \\frac{m-1}{n} + \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{1}{p''} + \\frac{1}{p'} + \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{r} \\).\n\nNothing can be more easily remembered than these formulae, however numerous so ever the glasses may be.\n\nHaving thus obtained the necessary analysis and formulae,\nmula, it now remains to apply them to the construction of achromatic lenses; in which it fortunately happens, that the employment of several surfaces, in order to produce the union of the differently refrangible rays, enables us at the same time to employ them for correcting each other's spherical aberration.\n\nIn the article Optics we gave a general notion of the principle on which we may proceed in our endeavours to unite the differently refrangible rays. A white or compounded ray is separated by refraction into its component coloured rays, and they are diffused over a small angular space. Thus it appears, that the glass used by Sir Isaac Newton in his experiments diffused a white ray, which was incident on its posterior surface in an angle of $30^\\circ$, in such a manner that the extreme red ray emerged into air, making an angle of $50^\\circ$ $21\\frac{1}{2}$ with the perpendicular; the extreme violet ray emerged in an angle of $51^\\circ$ $1\\frac{1}{2}$; and the ray which was in the confines of green and blue, emerged in an angle of $50^\\circ$ $48\\frac{1}{2}$. If the fine of the angle $30^\\circ$ of incidence be called $0.5$, which it really is, the fine of the emergence of the red ray will be $0.77$; that of the violet ray will be $0.78$; and that of the intermediate ray will be $0.77\\frac{1}{2}$, an exact mean between the two extremes. This ray may therefore be called the mean refrangible ray, and the ratio of $77\\frac{1}{2}$ to $50$, or of $1.55$ to $1$, will very properly express the mean refraction of this glass; and we have for this glass $m=1.55$. The fine of refraction, being measured on a scale, of which the fine of incidence occupies $100$ parts, will be $154$ for the red ray, $155$ for the mean ray, and $156$ for the violet ray. This number, or its ratio to unity, is commonly taken to represent the refractive power of the glass. There is some impropriety in this, unless we consider ratios as measured by their logarithms: for if $m$ be $1$, the substance does not refract at all. The refractive power can be properly measured only by the refraction which it produces; that is, by the change which it makes in the direction of the light, or the angle contained between the incident and refracted rays. If two substances produce such deviations always in one proportion, we should then say that their refractive powers are in that proportion. This is not true in any substances; but the fines of the angles, contained between the refracted ray and the perpendicular, are always in one proportion when the angle of incidence in both substances is the same. This being a cognizable function of the real refraction, has therefore been assumed as the only convenient measure of the refractive powers. Although it is not strictly just, it answers extremely well in the most usual cases in optical instruments: the refractions are moderate; and the fines are very nearly as the angles contained between the rays and the perpendicular; and the real angles of refraction, or deflections of the rays, are almost exactly proportional to $m-1$. The most natural and obvious measure of the refractive powers would therefore be $m-1$. But this would embarrass some very frequent calculations; and we therefore find it best, on the whole, to take $m$ itself for the measure of the refractive power.\n\nThe separation of the red, violet, and intervening rays, has been called dispersion; and although this arises merely from a difference of the refractive power in respect of the different rays, it is convenient to distinguish this particular modification of the refractive power by a name, and we call it the Dispersive Power of the re. Teleope.\n\nIt is susceptible of degrees; for a piece of flint-glass will refract the light, so that when the fine of refraction of the red ray is $77$, the fine of the refraction of the violet ray is nearly $78\\frac{1}{2}$; or if the fine of refraction of the red ray, measured on a particular scale, is $1.54$, the fine of refraction of the violet ray is $1.57$. The dispersion of this substance, being measured by the difference of the extreme fines of refraction, is greater than the dispersion of the other glasses, in the proportion of $3$ to $2$.\n\nBut this alone is not a sufficient measure of the absolute dispersive power of a substance. Although the ratio of $1.54$ to $1.56$ remains constant, whatever the real magnitude of the refractions of common glasses may be, and though we therefore say that its dispersive power is constant, we know, that by increasing the incidence and the refraction, the absolute dispersion is also increased. Another substance shows the same properties, and in a particular case may produce the same dispersion; yet it has not for this sole reason the same dispersive power. If indeed the incidence and the refraction of the mean ray be also the same, the dispersive power cannot be said to differ; but if the incidence and the refraction of the mean ray be less, the dispersive power must be considered as greater, though the actual dispersion be the same; because if we increase the incidence till it becomes equal to that in the common glasses, the dispersion will now be increased. The proper way of conceiving the dispersion therefore is, to consider it as a portion of the whole refraction; and if we find a substance making the same dispersion with half the general refraction, we must say that the dispersive quality is double; because by making the refraction equal, the dispersion will really be double.\n\nIf therefore we take $\\frac{m}{m-1}$ as a symbol of the separation of the extreme rays from the middle ray, $\\frac{m}{m-1}$ is the natural measure of the dispersive power. We shall express this in the Leibnitzian notation, thus $\\frac{dm}{m-1}$, that we may avoid the indistinctness which the Newtonian notation would occasion when $m$ is changed for $m'$ or $m''$.\n\nIt is not unusual for optical writers to take the whole separation of the red and violet rays for the measure of the dispersive power, and to compare this with the refracting power with respect to one of the extreme rays. But it is surely better to consider the mean refraction as the measure of the refracting power: and the deviation of either of the extremes from this mean is a proper enough measure of the dispersion, being always half of it. It is attended with this convenience, that being introduced into our computations as a quantity infinitely small, and treated as such for the ease of computation, while it is really a quantity of sensible magnitude; the errors arising from this supposition are diminished greatly, by taking one half of the deviation and comparing it with the mean refraction. This method has, however, this inconvenience, that it does not exhibit at once the refractive power in all substances respecting any particular colour of light; for it is not the ray of any particular colour that suffers the mean refraction. In common glasses it is the ray which is in the confines of the yellow and blue; in flint-glasses it is nearly the middle.\nThe first purpose will be answered if \\( \\frac{dm}{n} \\) be equal to \\( \\frac{dm'}{n'} \\). For, in order that the different coloured rays may be collected into one point by two lenses, it is only necessary that \\( \\frac{1}{f'} \\), the reciprocal of the focal distance of rays refracted by both, may be the same for the extreme and mean rays, that is, that \\( \\frac{m + dm - 1}{n} + \\frac{m' + dm' - 1}{n'} + \\frac{1}{r} \\) be of the same value with \\( \\frac{m - 1}{n} + \\frac{m' - 1}{n'} + \\frac{1}{r} \\), which must happen if \\( \\frac{dm}{n} + \\frac{dm'}{n'} = 0 \\), or \\( \\frac{dm}{n} = -\\frac{dm'}{n'} \\). This may be seen in another way, more comprehensible by such as are not versant in these difficulties. In order that the extreme colours which are separated by the first lens may be rendered parallel by the second; we have shown already that \\( n \\) and \\( n' \\) are proportional to the radii of the equivalent isosceles lenses, being the halves of these radii. They are therefore (in these small refractions) inversely proportional to the angles formed by the surfaces at the edges of the lenses. \\( n' \\) may therefore be taken for the angle of the first lens, and \\( n \\) for that of the second. Now the small refraction by a prism, whose angle (also small) is \\( n' \\), is \\( m - 1 \\times n \\). The dispersive power being now substituted for the refractive power, we have for this refraction of the prism \\( dm \\times n' \\). This must be destroyed by the opposite refraction of the other prism \\( dm' \\times n \\). Therefore \\( dm \\times n' = dm' \\times n \\), or \\( \\frac{dm}{n} = -\\frac{dm'}{n'} \\). In like manner, this effect will be produced by three lenses if \\( \\frac{dm}{n} + \\frac{dm'}{n'} + \\frac{dm''}{n''} = 0 \\), &c.\n\nLastly, the errors arising from the spherical figure, which we expressed by \\( -R^2(q + q') \\) will be corrected if \\( q + q' = 0 \\). We are therefore to discover the adjustments of the quantities employed in the preceding formulae, which will insure these conditions. It will render the process more perspicuous if we collect into one view the significations of our various symbols, and the principal equations which we are to employ.\n\n1. The ratios to unity of the fines of mean incidence in the different media are \\( m, m', m'' \\).\n2. The ratio of the differences of the fines of the extremes \\( \\frac{dm}{dm'} = u \\).\n3. The ratio \\( \\frac{m - 1}{m' - 1} = c \\).\n\n4. The radius of the surfaces \\( a, b, a', b'; a'', b'' \\).\n5. The principal focal distances, or the focal distances of parallel central rays \\( p, p', p'' \\).\n6. The focal distance of the compound lens \\( P \\).\n7. The distance of the radiant point, or of the focus of incident rays on each lens \\( r, r', r'' \\).\n8. The focal distance of the rays refracted by each lens \\( f, f', f'' \\).\n9. The focal distance of rays refracted by the compound lens \\( F \\).\n10. The half breadth of the lens \\( e \\).\n\nAlso the following subsidiary values:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{b} \\); \\( \\frac{1}{n'} = \\frac{1}{a'} - \\frac{1}{b'} \\); \\( \\frac{1}{n''} = \\frac{1}{a''} - \\frac{1}{b''} \\).\n2. \\( q = \\frac{m - 1}{m} \\left( \\frac{m^3}{n^3} - \\frac{2m^2 + m}{an^2} + \\frac{m + 2}{an^2} + \\frac{3m^2 + m}{rn^2} - \\frac{4(m + 1)}{arn} + \\frac{3m + 2}{r^2n} \\right) \\epsilon^2 \\). And \\( q' \\) and \\( q'' \\) must be formed in the same manner from \\( m', a', n', r' \\); and from \\( m'', a'', n'', r'' \\), as \\( q \\) is formed from \\( m, a, n, r \\).\n3. Also, because in the case of an object-glass, \\( r \\) is infinitely great, the last term \\( \\frac{1}{r} \\) in all the values of \\( \\frac{1}{f'}, \\frac{1}{f''}, \\frac{1}{r'}, \\frac{1}{r''} \\), will vanish, and we shall also have \\( F = P \\).\n\nTherefore in a double object-glass \\( \\frac{1}{P} = \\frac{m' - 1}{n'} + \\frac{m - 1}{n} \\).\n\nAnd in a triple object-glass \\( \\frac{1}{P} = \\frac{m'' - 1}{n''} + \\frac{m' - 1}{n'} + \\frac{m - 1}{n} \\).\n\nAlso, in a double object-glass, the correction of spherical aberration requires \\( q + q' = 0 \\).\n\nAnd a triple object-glass requires \\( q + q' + q'' = 0 \\).\n\nFor the whole error is multiplied by \\( F^2 \\), and by \\( \\epsilon^2 \\); and therefore the equation which corrects this error may be divided by \\( F^2 \\times \\epsilon^2 \\).\n\nThis equation in the fourteenth line from the top of the column, giving the value of \\( q, q', q'' \\), may be much simplified as follows: In the first place, they may be divided by \\( m, m', m'' \\), by applying them properly to the terms within the parenthesis, and expunging them from the denominator of the general factors \\( \\frac{m - 1}{m}, \\frac{m' - 1}{m'}, \\frac{m'' - 1}{m''} \\). This does not alter the values of \\( q, q', q'' \\).\n\nIn the second place the whole equations may be afterwards divided by \\( m' - 1 \\). This will give the values of \\( \\frac{q}{m' - 1}, \\frac{q'}{m' - 1}, \\frac{q''}{m' - 1} \\), which will still be equal to nothing if \\( q + q' + q'' \\) be equal to nothing.\n\nThis division reduces the general factor \\( \\frac{m' - 1}{m'} \\) of \\( q' \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{m'} \\). And in the equation for \\( q \\) we obtain, in place of the general factor \\( \\frac{m - 1}{m} \\), the factor \\( \\frac{m' - 1}{m' - 1} \\), or \\( c \\). This will also be the factor of the value of \\( q'' \\) when the third lens is of the same substance with the first, as is generally\nAnd, in the third place, since the rays incident on the first lens are parallel, all the terms vanish from the value of \\( q \\) in which \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) is found, and there remain only the three first, viz. \\( \\frac{m^3}{n^3} - \\frac{2m^2 + m}{an^2} + \\frac{m + 2}{a^2 n} \\).\n\nPerforming these operations, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{q}{m' - 1} &= c \\left( \\frac{m^3}{n^3} - \\frac{2m + 1}{an^2} + \\frac{m + 2}{a^2 n} \\right) e^2 \\\\\n\\frac{q'}{m' - 1} &= \\left( \\frac{m^3}{n^3} - \\frac{2m + 1}{an^2} + \\frac{m + 2}{a^2 n} \\right) \\frac{e^2}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{q''}{m' - 1} &= c \\left( \\frac{m^3}{n^3} - \\frac{2m + 1}{an^2} + \\frac{m + 2}{a^2 n} \\right) \\frac{e^2}{2} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nLet us now apply this investigation to the construction of an object-glass; and we shall begin with a double lens.\n\n**Construction of a Double Achromatic Object-glass.**\n\nHere we have to determine four radii \\( a, b, a', \\) and \\( b' \\). Make \\( n = 1 \\). This greatly simplifies the calculus, by exterminating it from all the denominators. This gives for the equation \\( \\frac{dm}{n} + \\frac{dm'}{n'} = 0 \\), the equation \\( dm + \\frac{dm'}{n'} = 0 \\), or \\( dm = - \\frac{dm'}{n'} \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{n} = - \\frac{dm}{dm'} = -u \\). Also we have \\( r' \\), the focal distance of the light incident on the second lens, the same with the principal focal distance \\( p \\) of the first lens, (neglecting the interval, if any). Now \\( \\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{n - 1}{n} \\), which in the present case is \\( = m - 1 \\). Also \\( \\frac{1}{p'} = -(u)m' - 1 \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{p'} = m - 1 - u(m' - 1) = u' \\).\n\nMake these substitutions in the values of \\( \\frac{q}{m' - 1} \\) and \\( \\frac{q'}{m' - 1} \\), and we obtain the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nc \\left( \\frac{m^3}{n^3} - \\frac{2m + 1}{an^2} + \\frac{m + 2}{a^2 n} \\right) - \\frac{u^2(2m' + 1)}{a'} \\\\\n- \\frac{u(m' + 2)}{m' a^2} + u^2(3m' + 1)(m - 1) + \\frac{4u(m' + 1)(m - 1)}{m' a'} \\\\\n+ \\frac{u(3m' + 2)(m - 1)^2}{m'} = 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nArrange these terms in order, according as they are factors of \\( \\frac{1}{a^2}, \\frac{1}{a}, \\frac{1}{a'^2}, \\frac{1}{a'}, \\) or independent quantities. It puts on this form:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left( \\frac{c(m + 2)}{m} \\times \\frac{1}{a^2} - c(2m + 1) \\times \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{u(m' + 2)}{m'} \\times \\frac{1}{a'^2} - \\frac{u^2(2m' + 1)}{a'} \\\\\n- \\frac{u(m' + 2)}{m' a^2} + u^2(3m' + 1)(m - 1) + \\frac{4u(m' + 1)(m - 1)}{m' a'} \\\\\n+ \\frac{u(3m' + 2)(m - 1)^2}{m'} = 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nLet \\( A \\) be the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\), \\( B \\) that of \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\), \\( C \\) that of \\( \\frac{1}{a'^2} \\), \\( D \\) that of \\( \\frac{1}{a'} \\), and \\( E \\) the sum of the independent quantity; that is, let \\( A = \\frac{c(m + 2)}{m} \\), \\( B = c(2m + 1) \\), \\( C = \\frac{u(m' + 2)}{m'} \\), \\( D = u^2(2m' + 1) \\), \\( E = c(m^3 + u^2(3m' + 1)(m - 1) - u^3 m' - \\frac{u(3m' + 2)(m - 1)^2}{m'} \\).\n\nOur final equation becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A}{a^2} - \\frac{B}{a} - \\frac{C}{a'^2} - \\frac{D}{a'} + E = 0.\n\\]\n\nThe coefficients of this equation and the independent quantity are all known, from our knowledge of \\( m, m'dm, dm' \\); and we are to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( a' \\), and from them and \\( n = 1 \\) to find the values of \\( b \\) and \\( b' \\).\n\nBut it is evidently an indeterminate equation, because there are two unknown quantities; so that there may be an infinity of solutions. It must be rendered determinate by means of some other conditions to which it may be subjected. These conditions must depend on some other circumstances which may direct our choice.\n\nOne circumstance occurs to us which we think of very great consequence. In the passage of light from one substance to another, there is always a considerable portion reflected from the posterior surface of the first and from the anterior surface of the last; and this reflection is more copious in proportion to the refraction. This loss of light will therefore be diminished by making the internal surfaces of the lenses to coincide; that is, by making \\( b = a' \\). This will be attended with another advantage. If we put between the glasses a substance of nearly the same refracting power, we shall not only completely prevent this loss of light, but we shall greatly diminish the errors which arise from an imperfect polish of the surfaces. We have tried this, and find the effect very surprising. The lens being polished immediately after the figure has been given it, and while it was almost impervious to light by reason of its roughness, which was still sensible to the naked eye, performed as well as when finished in the finest manner.\n\nN. B. This condition, by taking away one refraction, obliges us to increase those which remain, and therefore increases the spherical aberrations. And since our formulae do not fully remove those (by reason of the small quantities neglected in the process), it is uncertain whether this condition be the most eligible. We have, however, no direct argument to the contrary.\n\nLet us see what determination this gives us.\n\nIn this case \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} = \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{a} - 1 \\). For because \\( \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{b} \\) and \\( n = 1 \\), we have \\( 1 + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{a} \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{a} - 1 \\).\n\nTherefore \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} = \\frac{1}{a^2} - \\frac{2}{a} + 1 \\). Therefore, in our final equation, put \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} = \\frac{2}{a} + 1 \\) in place of \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{a} = 1 \\) in place.\nplace of $\\frac{1}{a}$, and it becomes\n\n$$\\frac{A-C}{a^2} = \\frac{B+D-2C}{a} + E + D - C = 0.$$  \n\nThus have we arrived at a common affected quadratic equation, where $\\frac{1}{a}$ is the unknown quantity. It has the common form $px^2 + qx + r = 0$, where $p = A - C$, $q$ is equal to $2C - B - D$, $r$ is equal to $E + D - C$, and $x$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{a}$.\n\nDivide the equation by $p$, and we have $x^2 + \\frac{q}{p} x + \\frac{r}{p} = 0$. Make $s = \\frac{q}{p}$ and $t = \\frac{r}{p}$, and we have $x^2 + sx + t = 0$. This gives us finally $\\frac{1}{a}$, or $x = \\frac{-s \\pm \\sqrt{s^2 - 4t}}{2}$.\n\nThis value of $\\frac{1}{a}$ is taken from a scale of which the unit is half the radius of the isosceles lens which is equivalent to the first lens, or has the same focal distance with it. We must then find (on the same scale) the value of $b$, viz. $\\frac{1}{a'} - 1$, which is also the value of $a'$.\n\nHaving obtained $a'$, we must find $b'$ by means of the equation $\\frac{1}{n'} = \\frac{1}{a'} - \\frac{1}{b'}$, and therefore $\\frac{1}{b'} = \\frac{1}{a'} - \\frac{1}{n'}$.\n\nBut $\\frac{1}{n'} = u$. Therefore $\\frac{1}{b'} = \\frac{1}{a'} + u$, $\\frac{1}{a'} + u - 1$.\n\nThus is our object-glass constructed; and we must determine its focal distance, or its reciprocal $\\frac{1}{P}$. This is $= m - 1 - u (m' - 1)$.\n\nAll these radii and distances are measured on a scale of which $n$ is the unit. But it is more convenient to measure everything by the focal distance of the compound object-glass. This gives us the proportion which all the distances bear to it. Therefore, calling $P$ unity, in order to obtain $\\frac{1}{a}$ on this scale, we have only to state the analogy $m - 1 - u (m' - 1) : 1 = \\frac{1}{a} : \\frac{1}{A}$, and $A$ is the radius of our first surface measured on a scale of which $P$ is the unit.\n\nIf, in the formula which expresses the final equation for $\\frac{1}{a}$, the value of $t$ should be positive, and greater than $\\frac{3}{4} s^2$, the equation has imaginary roots; and it is not possible with the glasses employed, and the conditions assumed, to correct both the chromatic and spherical aberrations.\n\nIf $t$ is negative and equal to $\\frac{3}{4} s^2$, the radical part of the value is $= 0$, and $\\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1}{s}$. But if it be negative or positive, but less than $\\frac{3}{4} s^2$, the equation has two real roots, which will give two constructions. That is to be preferred which gives the smallest curvature of the surfaces; because, since in our formulae which determine the spherical aberration some quantities are neglected, these quantities are always greater when a large arch (that is, an arch of many degrees) is employed.\n\nNo radius should be admitted which is much less than $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the focal distance.\n\nAll this process will be made plain and easy by an example.\n\nVery careful experiments have shown, that in common crown-glass the fine of incidence is to the fine of refraction as $1.526$ is to $1$, and that in the generality of flint-glasses it is as $1.604$ to $1$. Also that $\\frac{d}{dm} = 0.6054 = u$. Therefore $m - 1 = 0.526$; $m' - 1 = 0.604$; $e = \\frac{m - 1}{m' - 1} = 0.87086$. By these numbers we can compute the coefficients of our final equation. We shall find them as follows:\n\n| A | B | C | D | E |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 2.012 | 3.529 | 1.365 | -0.526 | 1.8659 |\n\nThe general equation (p. 252 col. 2 lin. 8.), when subjected to the assumed coincidence of the internal surfaces, is\n\n$$\\frac{A-C}{a^2} = \\frac{B+D-2C}{a} + E + D - C = 0.$$  \n\n$A - C$ is $= 0.652$; $B + D - 2C$ is $= 0.283$; and $E + D - C$ is $= 0.020$; and the equation with numerical coefficients is\n\n$$\\frac{0.652}{a^2} - \\frac{0.283}{a} - 0.020 = 0,$$\n\nwhich corresponds to the equation $px^2 + qx + r = 0$. We must now make $s = \\frac{q}{p}$, $t = \\frac{r}{p}$, $= 0.434$, and $u = \\frac{1}{a'} - 1 = 0.307$.\n\nThis gives us the final quadratic equation $\\frac{1}{a^2} - \\frac{1}{a} = 0.434 - 0.307 = 0$. To solve this, we have $\\frac{1}{a} = 0.217$, and $\\frac{1}{a} = 0.471$. From this take $A$, which is $= 0.307$ (that is, to $0.471$ add $0.307$), and we obtain $0.778$, the square root of which is $= 0.2789$. Therefore, finally, $\\frac{1}{a} = 0.217 = 0.2789$, which is either $0.4959$ or $-0.619$. It is plain that the first must be preferred, because the second gives a negative radius, or makes the first surface of the crown-glass concave. Now as the convergence of the rays is to be produced by the crown-glass, the other surface must become very convex, and occasion great errors in the computed aberration. We therefore retain $0.4959$ for the value of $\\frac{1}{a}$, and $a$ is $= \\frac{1}{0.4959} = 2.0166$.\n\nTo obtain $b$, use the equation $\\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{a} - 1$, which gives $\\frac{1}{b} = -0.5041$, and therefore a convex surface. $b$ is therefore $= \\frac{1}{0.5041} = 1.9837$.\n\n$a'$ is the same with $b$, and $\\frac{1}{a'} = -0.5041$.\n\nTo obtain $b'$, use the equation $\\frac{1}{b'} = \\frac{1}{a'} + u$. Now $u = 0.6054$, and $\\frac{1}{a'} = -0.5041$. The sum of these is\nand since it is positive, the surface is concave.\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{1}{1.013} = 9.872. \\]\n\nLastly, \\( \\frac{1}{P} = m - 1 - u(m' - 1) = 0.1603, \\) and \\( P = \\frac{1}{0.1603} = 0.2383. \\)\n\nNow to obtain all the measures in terms of the focal distance \\( P, \\) we have only to divide the measures already found by 6.2383, and the quotients are the measures wanted.\n\nTherefore \\( a = \\frac{2.0166}{6.2383} = 0.32325 \\)\n\\( b = \\frac{1.9837}{6.2383} = 0.31798 \\)\n\\( d = \\frac{9.872}{6.2383} = 1.5825 \\)\n\\( P = 1. \\)\n\nIf it be intended that the focal distance of the object-glass shall be any number \\( n \\) of inches or feet, we have only to multiply each of the above radii by \\( n, \\) and we have their lengths in inches or feet.\n\nThus we have completed the investigation of the construction of a double object-glass. Although this was intricate, the final result is abundantly simple for practice, especially with the assistance of logarithms. The only troublesome thing is the preparation of the numerical coefficients \\( A, B, C, D, E \\) of the final equation. Strict attention must also be paid to the positive and negative signs of the quantities employed.\n\nWe might propose other conditions. Thus it is natural to prefer for the first or crown-glass lens such a form as shall give it the smallest possible aberration. This will require a small aberration of the flint-glass to correct it. But a little reflection will convince us that this form will not be good. The focal distance of the crown-glass must not exceed one-third of that of the compound glass; these two being nearly in the proportion of \\( dm' : dm \\) to \\( dm'. \\) Therefore if this form be adopted, and \\( a \\) be made about \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)th of \\( b, \\) it will not exceed \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)th of \\( P. \\) Therefore, although we may produce a most accurate union of the central and marginal rays by opposite aberrations, there will be a considerable aberration of some rays which are between the centre and the margin.\n\nIt is absolutely impossible to collect into one point the whole rays (though the very remotest rays are united with the central rays), except in a very particular case, which cannot obtain in an object-glass; and the small quantities which are neglected in the formula which we have given for the spherical aberration, produce errors which do not follow any proportion of the aperture which can be expressed by an equation of a manageable form. When the aperture is very large, it is better not to correct the aberration for the whole aperture, but for about \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)th of it. When the rays corresponding to this distance are made to coincide with the central rays by means of opposite aberrations, the rays which are beyond this distance will be united with some of those which are nearer to the centre, and the whole diffusion will be considerably diminished. Dr Smith has illustrated this in a very perspicuous manner in his theory of his Catoptric Microscope.\n\nBut although we cannot adopt this form of an object-glass, there may be other considerations which may lead us to prefer some particular form of the crown-glass, or of the flint-glass. We shall therefore adapt our general equation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A}{a^2} + \\frac{B}{a} + \\frac{C}{a^3} + \\frac{D}{a^4} + E = 0\n\\]\n\nto this condition.\n\nTherefore let \\( h \\) express this selected ratio of the two radii of the crown-glass, making \\( \\frac{a}{b} = h \\) (remembering always that \\( a \\) is positive and \\( b \\) negative in the case of a double convex, and \\( h \\) is a negative number).\n\nWith this condition we have \\( \\frac{I}{b} = \\frac{h}{a}. \\) But when we make \\( n \\) the unit of our formula of aberration, \\( \\frac{I}{a} = \\frac{1}{a} - 1. \\)\n\nTherefore \\( \\frac{I}{a} = \\frac{h}{a}, \\) and \\( \\frac{I}{a} = \\frac{1}{1-h}. \\) Now substitute this for \\( \\frac{I}{a} \\) in the general equation, and change all the signs (which still preserves it \\( = 0 \\)), and we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{a^2} + \\frac{D}{a^3} - \\frac{E}{(1-h)^2} + \\frac{B}{1-h} = 0.\n\\]\n\nBy this equation we are to find \\( \\frac{I}{a} \\) or the radius of the anterior surface of the flint-glass. The equation is of this form \\( p^2 + qx + r = 0, \\) and we must again make \\( s = \\frac{q}{p} \\) and \\( t = \\frac{r}{p}. \\) Therefore \\( s = \\frac{D}{C}, \\) and \\( t = \\frac{1}{C} \\times \\left( \\frac{B}{1-h} - \\frac{A}{(1-h)^2} - E \\right). \\) Then, finally,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{I}{a} = \\frac{1}{s} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{s^2} - t}.\n\\]\n\nIt may be worth while to take a particular case of this condition. Suppose the crown-glass to be of equal convexities on both sides. This has some advantages: We can tell with precision whether the curvatures are precisely equal, by measuring the focal distance of rays reflected back from its posterior surface. These distances will be precisely equal. Now it is of the utmost importance in the construction of an object-glass which is to correct the spherical aberration, that the forms be precisely such as are required by our formulae.\n\nIn this case of a lens equally convex on both sides \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) is \\( = \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{2}. \\) Substitute this value for \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) in the general equation \\( \\frac{A}{a^2} - \\frac{B}{a} - \\frac{C}{a^3} - \\frac{D}{a^4} + E = 0, \\) and then \\( \\frac{A}{a^2} = \\frac{A}{4}; \\) \\( \\frac{B}{a} \\) becomes \\( \\frac{B}{2}. \\) Now change all the signs, and we have \\( \\frac{C}{a^2} + \\frac{D}{a^3} - \\frac{E}{A} + \\frac{B}{2} = 0, \\) by which we are to find \\( a'. \\) This in numbers is \\( \\frac{1.360}{a'^2} = \\frac{0.526}{a'} \\).\nThen \\( s = \\frac{-0.526}{1.360} = -0.3867 \\), and \\( t = \\frac{-0.6044}{1.360} = -0.4444 \\). Then \\( \\frac{t}{s} = 0.1933; \\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{x^2} = 0.374; \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sqrt{\\frac{x^2}{x^2}} = 0.6941; \\quad \\text{so that} \\quad \\frac{1}{a'} = 0.1933 = 0.6941. \\]\n\nThis gives two real roots, viz. 0.8874, and -0.5008. If we take the first, we shall have a convex anterior surface for the flint-glass, and consequently a very deep concave for the posterior surface. We therefore take the second or negative root -0.5008.\n\nWe find \\( \\frac{1}{b'} \\) as before, by the equation \\( \\frac{1}{b'} = \\frac{1}{a'} + u = 0.1046 \\), which will give a large value of \\( b' \\).\n\nWe had \\( \\frac{1}{a'} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nand \\( \\frac{1}{b'} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nand \\( \\frac{1}{P} \\) is the same as in the former case, viz. 0.1603.\n\nHaving all these reciprocals, we may find \\( a, b, a', b' \\), and \\( P \\); and then dividing them by \\( P \\), we obtain finally\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 0.3206 \\\\\nb &= -0.3206 \\\\\na' &= -0.3201 \\\\\nb' &= 1.533 \\\\\nP &= 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nBy comparing this object-glass with the former, we may remark, that diminishing \\( a \\) a little increases \\( b \\), and in this respect improves the lens. It indeed has diminished \\( b' \\), but this being already considerable, no inconvenience attends this diminution. But we learn, at the same time, that the advantage must be very small; for we cannot diminish \\( a \\) much more, without making it as small as the smallest radius of the object-glass. This proportion is therefore very near the maximum, or best possible; and we know that in such cases, even considerable changes in the radii will make but small changes in the result: for these reasons we are disposed to give a strong preference to the first construction, on account of the other advantages which we showed to attend it.\n\nAs another example, we may take a case which is very nearly the general practice of the London artists. The radius of curvature for the anterior surface of the convex crown-glass is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)ths of the radius of the posterior surface, so that \\( k = \\frac{3}{4} \\). This being introduced into the determinate equation, gives\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 0.2938 \\\\\na' &= -0.3443 \\\\\nb &= -0.3526 \\\\\nb' &= 1.1474.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAs another condition, we may suppose that the second or flint-glass is of a determined form.\n\nThis case is solved much in the same manner as the former. Taking \\( h \\) to represent the ratio of \\( a' \\) and \\( b' \\), we have \\( \\frac{1}{a'} = \\frac{1}{1-h} \\). This value being substituted in the general equation \\( \\frac{A}{a^2} - \\frac{B}{a} - \\frac{C}{a'^2} - \\frac{D}{a} + E = 0 \\), gives us\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A}{a^2} - \\frac{B}{a} + E - \\frac{C}{(1-h)^2} - \\frac{D}{1-h} = 0. \\]\n\nThis gives for the final equation \\( x^2 + sx + t = 0 \\), \\( s = \\frac{B}{A} \\), and \\( t = \\frac{1}{A} \\times \\left( \\frac{E}{(1-h)^2} - \\frac{D}{1-h} \\right) \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{a} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3} s^2 - t}} \\).\n\nWe might here take the particular case of the flint-glass being equally concave on both sides. Then because \\( \\frac{1}{n} = -u \\), and in the case of equal concavities \\( \\frac{2}{a'} = \\frac{1}{n} = -u \\), it is sufficient to put \\( -\\frac{1}{2} u \\) for \\( \\frac{1}{a'} \\).\n\nThis being done, the equation becomes \\( \\frac{A}{a} - \\frac{B}{a} - \\frac{C}{a'^2} + \\frac{D}{a} + E = 0 \\). This gives \\( s = \\frac{B}{A} \\), and \\( t = \\frac{1}{A} \\times \\left( \\frac{4Du - 2Cu^2}{8} + E \\right) \\).\n\nWe imagine that these cases are sufficient for showing the management of the general equation; and the example of the numerical solution of the first case affords instances of the only niceties which occur in the process, viz. the proper employment of the positive and negative quantities.\n\nWe have oftener than once observed, that the formula is not perfectly accurate, and that in very large apertures errors will remain. It is proper therefore, when we have obtained the form of a compound object-glass, to calculate trigonometrically the progress of the light through it; and if we find a considerable aberration, either chromatic or spherical, remaining, we must make such changes in the curvatures as will correct them. We have done this for the first example; and we find, that if the focal distance of the compound object-glass be 100 inches, there remains of the spherical aberration nearly \\( \\frac{1}{80} \\)th of an inch, and the aberration of colour is over corrected above \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of an inch. The first aberration has been diminished about 6 times, and the other about 30 times. Both of the remaining errors will be diminished by increasing the radius of the inner surfaces. This will diminish the aberration of the crown-glass, and will diminish the dispersion of the flint more than that of the crown. But indeed the remaining error is hardly worth our notice.\n\nIt is evident to any person conversant with optical difficulties, that we shall improve the correction of the spherical aberration by diminishing the refractions. If we employ two lenses for producing the convergency of the rays to a real focus, we shall reduce the aberration to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th. Therefore a better achromatic glass will be formed of three lenses, two of which are convex and of crown-glass. The refraction being thus divided between them, the aberrations are lessened. There is no occasion to employ two concave lenses of flint-glass; there is even an advantage in using one. The aberration being considerable, let it serve for correcting the aberration of the crown-glass, and therefore such a form may be selected as has little aberration. Some light is indeed lost by these two additional surfaces; but this is much more than compensated by the greater apertures which we can venture to give when the curvature of the surface is so much diminished. We proceed therefore to\n\nThe Construction of a Triple Achromatic Object-glass.\n\nIt is plain that there are more conditions to be assumed\nLet the first and second glasses be of equal curvatures on both sides; the first being a double convex of crown-glass, and the second a double concave of flint-glass.\n\nStill making \\( n \\) the unit of our calculus, we have in the first place \\( a = -b, = -a', = b' \\). Therefore \\( \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{b'} = \\left( \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{b} \\right) \\), or \\( \\frac{1}{n'} = \\frac{1}{n} - 1 \\). Therefore the equation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{n} + \\frac{d}{n'} + \\frac{d}{n''} = 0\n\\]\n\nbecomes \\( u - 1 + \\frac{u}{n''} = 0 \\), or \\( \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{u} - 1 \\). Let us call this value \\( u' \\).\n\nWe have \\( \\frac{1}{p} = m - 1; \\frac{1}{p'} = -(m' - 1); \\frac{1}{p''} = u' (m - 1); \\frac{1}{p'''} = p' + \\frac{1}{p''} = m - m' + u' (m - 1) \\).\n\nAnd if we make \\( m' = m = C \\), we shall have \\( \\frac{1}{P} = -C, + u' (m - 1) \\). Also \\( \\frac{1}{r'} = m - 1; \\frac{1}{r''} = m - 1 - (m' - 1), = m - m', = C' \\).\n\nThe equality of the two curvatures of each lens gives \\( \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1}{2n} \\). Therefore \\( \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1}{b'}, = \\frac{1}{a'}, = \\frac{1}{b}; = \\frac{1}{2} \\); and \\( \\frac{1}{b''} = \\frac{1}{a''}, = \\frac{1}{a'''}, = \\frac{1}{a'''} - u' \\).\n\nSubstituting these values in the equation (p. 252 col. 2 par. 1.), we obtain the three formulae:\n\n1. \\( c m^3 - \\frac{c}{2} c (2m + 1) + \\frac{c (m + 2)}{4m} \\)\n\n2. \\( m' + \\frac{1}{2} (2m' + 1) - \\frac{m' + 2}{4m'} + (3m' + 1)(m - 1) \\)\n\n3. \\( c u' 3 m^3 - \\frac{c u'^2 (2m + 1)}{a''} + \\frac{c u' (m + 2)}{ma''} - c e' u'^2 (3m + 1) + \\frac{4c e' u' (m + 1)}{ma''} + \\frac{c e'^2 u'^2 (3m + 2)}{m} = 0 \\).\n\nNow arrange these quantities according as they are coefficients of \\( \\frac{1}{a''} \\) and of \\( \\frac{1}{a'''} \\), or independent quantities. Let the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{a''} \\) be \\( A \\), that of \\( \\frac{1}{a'''} \\) be \\( B \\), and the independent quantity be \\( C \\), we have\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{c u' (m + 2)}{m}; B = c u'^2 (2m + 1) - \\frac{4c e' u' (m + 1)}{m}\n\\]\n\nand \\( C = c m^3 + \\frac{c (m + 2)}{4m} + \\frac{1}{2} (2m' + 1) + (3m' + 1) \\).\n\nOur equation now becomes \\( \\frac{A}{a''} - \\frac{B}{a'''} + C = 0 \\).\n\nThis reduced to numbers, by computing the values of the coefficients, is \\( \\frac{1.312}{a''} - \\frac{1.207}{a'''} - 0.3257 = 0 \\).\n\nThis, divided by 1.312, gives \\( c = -0.92 \\); and \\( d = -0.2482; \\frac{1}{s} = 0.46; \\frac{1}{s'} = 0.2116; \\text{ and } \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{s''}} = 0.6781 \\).\n\nAnd, finally, \\( \\frac{1}{a''} = 0.46 = 0.6781 \\).\n\nThis has two roots, viz. 0.2181 and -1.1381. The last would give a small radius, and is therefore rejected.\n\nNow, proceeding with this value of \\( \\frac{1}{a''} \\) and the \\( \\frac{1}{a'''} \\), we get the other radius \\( b'' \\), and then, by means of \\( u' \\), we get the other radius which is common to the four surfaces.\n\nThen, by \\( \\frac{1}{P} = \\frac{1}{P''} - e' \\), we get the value of \\( P \\).\n\nThe radii being all on the scale of which \\( u \\) is the unit, they must be divided by \\( P \\) to obtain their value on the scale which has \\( P \\) for its unit. This will give us\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na &= -b, = -a'; = b', = 0.530 \\\\\na'' &= 1.215 \\\\\nb'' &= -0.3046 \\\\\nP &= 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThis is not a very good form, because the last surface has too great curvature.\n\nWe thought it worth while to compute the curvatures for a case where the internal surfaces of the lenses coincide, in order to obtain the advantages mentioned on a former occasion. The form is as follows:\n\nThe middle lens is a double concave of flint-glass; the last lens is of crown-glass, and has equal curvatures on both sides. The following table contains the dimensions of the glasses for a variety of focal distances. The first column contains the focal distances in inches; the second contains the radii of the first surface in inches; the third contains the radii of the posterior surface of the first lens and anterior surface of the second; and the fourth column has the radii of the three remaining surfaces.\n\n| P | a | b, a' | b', a'', b'' |\n|---|---|-------|-------------|\n| 12 | 9.25 | 6.17 | 12.75 |\n| 24 | 18.33 | 12.25 | 25.5 |\n| 36 | 27.33 | 18.25 | 38.17 |\n| 48 | 36.42 | 24.33 | 50.92 |\n| 60 | 45.42 | 30.33 | 63.58 |\n| 72 | 54.5 | 36.42 | 76.33 |\n| 84 | 63.5 | 42.5 | 89. |\n| 96 | 72.6 | 48.5 | 101.75 |\n| 108 | 81.7 | 54.58 | 114.42 |\n| 120 | 90.7 | 60.58 | 127.17 |\n\nWe have had an opportunity of trying glasses of this construction, and found them equal to any of the same length, although executed by an artist by no means excellent in his profession as a glass-grinder. This very circumstance\nTelescope circumstance gave us the opportunity of seeing the good effects of interposing a transparent substance between the glases. We put some clear turpentine varnish between them, which completely prevented all reflection from the internal surfaces. Accordingly these teleopes were surprisingly bright; and although the roughness left by the first grinding was very perceptible by the naked eye before the glases were put together, yet when joined in this manner it entirely disappeared, even when the glases were viewed with a deep magnifier.\n\nThe aperture of an object-glass of this construction of 3 inches focal distance was 3/4th inches, which is considerably more than any of Mr Dollond's that we have seen.\n\nIf we should think it of advantage to make all the three lenses isosceles, that is, equally curved on both surfaces, the general equation will give the following radii:\n\n\\[ a = +0.639 \\quad a' = -0.5285 \\quad a'' = +0.6413 \\]\n\\[ b = -0.639 \\quad b' = +0.5285 \\quad b'' = -0.6413 \\]\n\nThis seems a good form, having large radii.\n\nShould we choose to have the two crown-glass lenses isosceles and equal, we must make\n\n\\[ a = +0.6412 \\quad a' = -0.5227 \\quad a'' = +0.6412 \\]\n\\[ b = -0.6412 \\quad b' = +0.5367 \\quad b'' = -0.6412 \\]\n\nThis form hardly differs from the last.\n\nOur readers will recollect that all these forms proceed on certain measures of the refractive and dispersive powers of the substances employed, which are expressed by \\( m, m', d, m, \\) and \\( d/m \\); and we may be assured that the formulae are sufficiently exact, by the comparison (which we have made in one of the cases) of the result of the formula and the trigonometrical calculation of the progress of the rays. The error was but 1/5th of the whole, ten times less than another error, which unavoidably remains, and will be considered presently. These measures of refraction and dispersion were carefully taken; but there is great diversity, particularly in the flint-glass. We are well informed that the manufacture of this article has considerably changed of late years, and that it is in general less refractive and less dispersive than formerly. This must evidently make a change in the forms of achromatic glasses. The proportion of the focal distance of the crown-glasses to that of the flint must be increased; and this will occasion a change in the curvatures, which shall correct the spherical aberration.\n\nWe examined with great care a parcel of flint-glasses which an artist of this city got lately for the purpose of making achromatic object-glasses, and also some very white crown glasses made in Leith; and we obtained the following measures:\n\n\\[ m = 1.529 \\quad d/m = \\frac{142}{219} = 0.64841 \\]\n\\[ m' = 1.578 \\]\n\nWe computed some forms for triple object glasses made of these glasses, which we shall subjoin as a specimen of the variations which this change of data will occasion.\n\nIf all the three lenses are made isosceles, we have\n\n\\[ a = +0.796 \\quad a' = -0.474 \\quad a'' = +0.502 \\]\n\\[ b = -0.796 \\quad b' = +0.474 \\quad b'' = -0.502 \\]\n\nOr\n\n\\[ a = +0.504 \\quad a' = -0.475 \\quad a'' = +0.793 \\]\n\\[ b = -0.504 \\quad b' = +0.475 \\quad b'' = -0.793 \\]\n\nIf the middle lens be isosceles, the two crown-glass lenses may be made of the same form and focal distance, telescope and placed the same way. This will give us\n\n\\[ a = +0.705 \\quad a' = -0.475 \\quad a'' = +0.705 \\]\n\\[ b = -0.547 \\quad b' = +0.475 \\quad b'' = -0.547 \\]\n\nN.B. This construction allows a much better form, if the measures of refraction and dispersion are the same that we used formerly. For we shall have\n\n\\[ a = +0.628 \\quad a' = -0.579 \\quad a'' = +0.628 \\]\n\\[ b = -0.749 \\quad b' = +0.579 \\quad b'' = -0.749 \\]\n\nAnd this is pretty near the practice of the London opticians.\n\nWe may here observe, upon the whole, that an amateur has little chance of succeeding in these attempts. The diversity of glasses, and the uncertainty of the workman's producing the very curvatures which he intends, is so great, that the object-glass turns out different from our expectation. The artist who makes great numbers acquires a pretty certain guess at the remaining error; and having many lenses, intended to be of one form, but unavoidably differing a little from it, he tries several of them with the other two, and finding one better than the rest, he makes use of it to complete the set.\n\nThe great difficulty in the construction is to find the exact proportion of the dispersive powers of the crown and flint-glass. The crown is pretty constant; but there are hardly two pots of flint-glass which have the same dispersive power. Even if constant, it is difficult to measure it accurately; and an error in this greatly affects the instrument, because the focal distances of the lenses must be nearly as their dispersive powers. The method of examining this circumstance, which we found most accurate, was as follows:\n\nThe sun's light, or that of a brilliant lamp, passed through a small hole in a board, and fell on another board pierced also with a small hole. Behind this was placed a fine prism A (fig. 14.), which formed a spectrum ROV on a screen pierced with a small hole. Behind this was placed a prism B of the substance under examination. The ray which was refracted by it fell on the wall at D, and the distance of its illumination from that point to C, on which an unrefracted ray would have fallen, was carefully measured. This showed the refraction of that colour. Then, in order that we might be certain that we always compared the refraction of the same precise colour by the different prisms placed at B, we marked the precise position of the prism A when the ray of a particular colour fell on the prism B. This was done by an index AG attached to A, and turning with it, when we caused the different colours of the spectrum formed by A to fall on B. Having examined one prism B with respect to all the colours in the spectrum formed by A, we put another B in its place. Then bringing A to all its former positions successively, by means of a graduated arch HGK, we were certain that when the index was at the same division of the arch it was the very ray which had been made to pass through the first prism B in a former experiment. We did not solicitously endeavour to find the very extreme red and violet rays; because, although we did not learn the whole dispersions of the two prisms, we learned their proportions, which is the circumstance wanted in the construction of achromatic glasses. It is in vain to attempt this by measuring the spectrums themselves; for we cannot be certain of\nThe intelligent reader will readily observe, that we have hitherto proceeded on the supposition, that when, by means of contrary refractions, we have united the extreme red and violet rays, we have also united all the others. But this is quite gratuitous. Sir Isaac Newton would, however, have made the same supposition; for he imagined that the different colours divided the spectrum formed by all substances in the proportions of a musical canon. This is a mistake. When a spectrum is formed by a prism of crown glass, and another of precisely the same length is formed by the side of it by a prism of flint-glass, the centre between the green and blue will be found precisely in the middle of the first spectrum, but in the second it will be considerably nearer to the red extremity. In short, different substances do not disperse the colours in the same proportion.\n\nThe effect of this irrationality (to call it) of dispersion, will appear plainly, we hope, in the following manner: Let A (fig. 12.) represent a spot of white solar light falling perpendicularly on a wall. Suppose a prism of common glass placed behind the hole through which the light is admitted, with its refracting angle facing the right hand. It will refract the beam of light to the right, and will at the same time disperse this heterogeneous light into its component rays, carrying the extreme red ray from A to R, the extreme orange from A to O, the extreme yellow from A to Y, &c., and will form the usual prismatic spectrum ROYGBPV. If the whole length RC be divided into 1000 parts, we shall have (when the whole refraction AR is small) RO very nearly 125, RY = 202, RG = 333, RB = 500, RP = 667, RV = 778, and RC = 1000; this being the proportion observed in the differences of the fines of refraction by Sir Isaac Newton.\n\nPerhaps a refracting medium may be found such, that a prism made of it would refract the white light from A', in the upper line of this figure, in such a manner that a spectrum R'O'Y'G'B'P'V'C' shall be formed at the same distance from A', and of the same length, but divided in a different proportion. We do not know that such a medium has been found; but we know that a prism of flint-glass has its refractive and dispersive powers so constituted, that if A'H' be taken about one-third of AR, a spot of white light, formed by rays falling perpendicularly at H', will be so refracted and dispersed, that the extreme red ray will be carried from H' to R', and the extreme violet from H' to C', and the intermediate colours to intermediate points, forming a spectrum resembling the other, but having the colours more constricted towards R', and more dilated towards C'; so that the ray which the common glass carried to the middle point B of the spectrum RC is now in a point B' of the spectrum R'C', considerably nearer to R'.\n\nDr Blair has found, on the other hand, that certain fluids, particularly such as contain the muriatic acid, when formed into a prism, will refract the light from H'' (in the lower line) so as to form a spectrum R''C'' equal to RC, and as far removed from A'' as RC is from A, but having the colours more dilated toward R'', and more constricted toward C', than is observed in RC; so that the ray which was carried by the prism of common glass to the middle point B is carried to a point B'', considerably nearer to C''.\n\nLet us now suppose that, instead of a white spot at A, we have a prismatic spectrum AB (fig. 13.), and that the prism of common glass is applied as before, immediately behind the prism which forms the spectrum AB. We know that this will be refracted sidewise, and will make a spectrum ROYGBPVC, inclined to the plane of refraction in an angle of 45°; so that drawing the perpendicular RC, we have RC = C'C.\n\nWe also know that the prism of flint-glass would refract the spectrum formed by the first prism on EHF, in such a manner that the red ray will go to R, the violet to C, and the intermediate rays to points o, y, g, b, p, v, situated that O'o is = R'O' of the other figure; Y y is = R'Y' of that figure, G g = R'G', &c. These points must therefore lie in a curve Roygbpvc, which is convex toward the axis R'C'.\n\nIn like manner we may be assured that Dr Blair's fluid will form a spectrum R'o'y'g'b'p'v'C', concave toward R'C'.\n\nLet it be observed by the way, that this is a very good method for discovering whether a medium disperses the light in the same proportion with the prism which is employed for forming the first spectrum AB or EF. It disperses in the same or in a different proportion, according as the oblique spectrum is straight or crooked; and the exact proportion corresponding to each colour is had by measuring the ordinates of the curves R'b'C or R'b'C'.\n\nHaving formed the oblique spectrum RBC by a prism of common glass, we know that an equal prism of the same glass, placed in a contrary position, will bring back all the rays from the spectrum RBC to the spectrum AB, laying each colour on its former place.\n\nIn like manner, having formed the oblique spectrum R'b'C by a prism of flint-glass, placed in the opposite direction, will bring all the rays back to the spectrum EHF.\n\nBut having formed the oblique spectrum RBC by a prism of common glass, if we place the flint-glass prism in the contrary position, it will bring the colour R back to E, and the colour C to F; but it will not bring the colour B to H, but to a point h, such that B h is equal to b H, and b B to h H. In like manner, the other colours will not be brought back to the straight line EHF, but to a curve E'h'F, forming a crooked spectrum.\n\nIn like manner, the fluids discovered by Dr Blair, when employed to bring back the oblique spectrum RBC formed by common glass, will bring its extremes back to E and F, and form the crooked spectrum E'h'F lying beyond EHF.\n\nThis experiment evidently gives us another method for examining the proportionality of the dispersion of different substances.\n\nHaving, by common glass, brought back the oblique spectrum formed by common glass to its natural place AB, suppose the original spectrum at AB to contract gradually (as Newton has made it do by means of a lens), it is plain that the oblique spectrum will also contract, and so will the second spectrum at AB; and it will at last coalesce into a white spot. The effect will be equivalent to a gradual compression of the whole figure.\nTelecope figure, by which the parallel lines AR and BC gradually approach, and at last unite.\n\nIn like manner, when the oblique spectrum formed by flint-glas is brought back to EH by a flint-glas prism, and the figure comprised in the same gradual manner, all the colours will coalesce into a white spot.\n\nBut when flint-glas is employed to bring back the oblique spectrum formed by common glas, it forms the crooked spectrum E & F. Now let the figure be comprised. The curve E & F will be doubled down on the line H h, and there will be formed a compound spectrum H h, quite unlike the common spectrum, being purple or claret coloured at H by the mixture of the extreme red and violet, and green edged with blue at h by the mixture of the green and blue. The fluid prisms would in like manner form a spectrum of the same kind on the other side of H.\n\nThis is precisely what is observed in achromatic object-glasses made of crown-glas and flint: for the refraction from A to R corresponds to the refraction of the convex crown-glas; and the contrary refraction from R to E corresponds to the contrary refraction of the concave flint-glas, which still leaves a part of the first refraction, producing a convergence to the axis of the telescope. It is found to give a purple or wine-coloured focus, and within this a green one, and between these an imperfect white. Dr Blair found, that when the eye-glas was drawn out beyond its proper distance, a star was surrounded by a green fringe, by the green end of the spectrum, which crossed each other within the focus; and when the eye-glas was too near the object-glas, the star had a wine-coloured fringe. The green rays were ultimately most refracted. N.B. We should expect the fringe to be of a blue colour rather than a green. But this is easily explained: The extreme violet rays are very faint, so as hardly to be sensible; therefore when a compound glas is made as achromatic as possible to our senses, in all probability (nay certainly) these almost insensible violet rays are left out, and perhaps the extreme colours which are united are the red and the middle violet rays. This makes the green to be the mean ray, and therefore the most outstanding when the dispersions are not proportional.\n\nDr Blair very properly calls these spectrums, H h and H' h', secondary spectrums, and seems to think that he is the first who has taken notice of them. But Mr Clairault was too accurate a mathematician, and too careful an observer, not to be aware of a circumstance which was of primary consequence to the whole inquiry. He could not but observe that the success relied on this very particular, and that the proportionality of dispersion was indispensably necessary.\n\nThis subject was therefore touched on by Clairault; and fully discussed by Bolcovich, first in his Dissertations published at Vienna in 1759; then in the Comment. Bononiensis; and, lastly, in his Opuscula, published in 1783. Dr Blair, in his ingenious Dissertation on Achromatic Glasses, read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1793, seems not to have known of the labours of these writers; speaks of it as a new discovery; and exhibits some of the consequences of this principle in a singular point of view, as something very paradoxical and inconsistent with the usually received notions on these subjects. But they are by no means so. We are, however, much indebted to his ingenious researches, and his successful endeavours to find some remedy for this imperfection of telescope, achromatic glasses. Some of his contrivances are exceedingly ingenious; but had the Doctor consulted these writers, he would have saved himself a good deal of trouble.\n\nBolcovich shows how to unite the two extremes with the most outstanding colour of the secondary spectrum, by means of a third substance. When we have done this, the aberration occasioned by the secondary spectrums must be prodigiously diminished; for it is evidently equivalent to the union of the points H and h of our figure. Whatever cause produces this must diminish the curvature of the arches E h and h F; but even if these curvatures were not diminished, their greatest ordinates cannot exceed one-fourth of H h; and we may say, without hesitation, that by uniting the mean or most outstanding ray with the two extremes, the remaining dispersion will be as much less than the uncorrected colour of Dollond's achromatic glas, as this is less than four times the dispersion of a common object-glas. It must therefore be altogether infensible.\n\nBolcovich affirms, that it is not possible to unite more than two colours by the opposite refraction of two substances, which do not disperse the light in the same proportions. Dr Blair makes light of this assertion, as he finds it made in general terms in the vague and paltry extract made by Priestley from Bolcovich in his Essay on the History of Optics; but had he read this author in his own dissertations, he would have seen that he was perfectly right. Dr Blair, however, has hit on a very ingenious and effectual method of producing this union of three colours. In the same way as we correct the dispersion of a concave lens of crown-glas by the opposite dispersion of a concave lens of flint-glas, we may correct the secondary dispersion of an achromatic convex lens by the opposite secondary dispersion of an achromatic concave lens. But the intelligent reader will observe, that this union does not contradict the assertion of Bolcovich, because it is necessarily produced by means of three refracting substances.\n\nThe most essential service which the public has received at the hands of Dr Blair is the discovery of fluid mediums of a proper dispersive power. By composing the lenses of such substances, we are at once freed from the irregularities in the refraction and dispersion of flint-glas, which the chemists have not been able to free it from. In whatever way this glas is made, it consists of parts which differ both in refractive and dispersive power; and when taken up from the pot, these parts mix in threads, which may be disseminated through the mass in any degree of fineness. But they still retain their properties; and when a piece of flint-glas has been formed into a lens, the eye, placed in its focus, sees the whole surface occupied by glintening threads or broader veins running across it. Great rewards have been offered for removing this defect, but hitherto to no purpose. We beg leave to propose the following method: Let the glas be reduced to powder, and then melted with a great proportion of alkaline salt, so as to make a liquor filicum. When precipitated from this by an acid, it must be in a state of very uniform composition. If again melted into glas, we should hope that it would be free from this defect; if not, the case seems to be desperate.\n\nBut by using a fluid medium, Dr Blair was freed from all this embarrassment; and he acquired another\nimmense advantage, that of adjusting at pleasure both the refractive and dispersive powers of his lenses. In solid lenses, we do not know whether we have taken the curvatures suited to the refractions till our glass is finished; and if we have mistaken the proportions, all our labour is lost. But when fluids are used, it is enough that we know nearly the refractions. We fit our focal distances to these, and then select our curvatures, so as to remove the aberration of figure, preserving the focal distances. Thus, by properly tempering the fluid mediums, we bring the lens to agree precisely with the theory, perfectly achromatic, and the aberration of figure as much corrected as is possible.\n\nDr Blair examined the refractive and dispersive powers of a great variety of substances, and found great varieties in their actions on the different colours. This is indeed what every well-informed naturalist would expect. There is no doubt now among naturalists about the mechanical connection of the phenomena of nature; and all are agreed that the chemical-actions of the particles of matter are perfectly like in kind to the action of gravitating bodies; that all these phenomena are the effects of forces like those which we call attractions and repulsions, and which we observe in magnets and electrified bodies; that light is refracted by forces of the same kind, but differing chiefly in the small extent of their sphere of activity. One who views things in this way will expect, that as the actions of the same acid for the different alkalies are different in degree, and as the different acids have also different actions on the same alkali, in like manner different substances differ in their general refractive powers, and also in the proportion of their action on the different colours. Nothing is more unlikely therefore than the proportional dispersion of the different colours by different substances; and it is surprising that this inquiry has been so long delayed. It is hoped that Dr Blair will oblige the public with an account of the experiments which he has made. This will enable others to co-operate in the improvement of achromatic glasses. We cannot derive much knowledge from what he has already published, because it was chiefly with the intention of giving a popular, though not an accurate, view of the subject. The constructions which are there mentioned are not those which he found most effectual, but those which would be most easily understood, or demonstrated by the slight theory which is contained in the dissertation; besides, the manner of expressing the difference of refrangibility, perhaps chosen for its paradoxical appearance, does not give us a clear notion of the characteristic differences of the substances examined. Those rays which are ultimately most deflected from their direction, are said to have become the most refrangible by the combination of different substances, although, in all the particular refractions by which this effect is produced, they are less refracted than the violet light. We can just gather this much, that common glass disperses the rays in such a manner, that the ray which is in the centre of the green and blue occupies the middle of the prismatic spectrum; but in glasses, and many other substances, which are more dispersive, this ray is nearer to the ruddy extremity of the spectrum. While therefore the straight line RC' (fig. 13.) terminates the ordinates O', Y', G', &c., which represent the dispersion of common glass, the ordinates which express the dispersions of these substances are terminated by a curve passing through R and C', but telescope lying below the line RC'. When therefore parallel heterogeneous light is made to converge to the axis of a convex lens of common glass, as happens at F in fig. 6, C, the light is dispersed, and the violet rays have a shorter focal distance. If we now apply a concave lens of greater dispersive power, the red and violet rays are brought to one focus F; but the green rays, not being so much refracted away from F, are left behind at Q, and have now a shorter focal distance. But Dr Blair afterwards found that this was not the case with the muriatic acid, and some solutions in it. He found that the ray which common glass caused to occupy the middle of the spectrum was much nearer to the blue extremity when refracted by these fluids. Therefore a concave lens formed of such fluids which united the red and violet rays in F', refracted the green rays to F'.\n\nHaving observed this, it was an obvious conjecture, that a mixture of some of these fluids might produce a medium, whose action on the intermediate rays should have the same proportion that is observed on common glass; or that two of them might be found which formed spectra similarly divided, and yet differing sufficiently in dispersive power to enable us to destroy the dispersion by contrary refractions, without destroying the whole refraction. Dr Blair accordingly found a mixture of solutions of ammoniacal and mercurial salts, and also some other substances, which produced dispersions proportional to that of glass, with respect to the different colours.\n\nAnd thus has the result of this intricate and laborious investigation corresponded to his utmost wishes. He has produced achromatic telescopes which seem as perfect as the thing will admit of; for he has been able to give them such apertures, that the incurvible aberration arising from the spherical surfaces becomes a sensible quantity, and precludes farther amplification by the eye-glasses. We have examined one of his telescopes: The focal distance of the object-glass did not exceed 17 inches, and the aperture was fully 3½ inches. We viewed some single and double stars and some common objects with this telescope; and found, that in magnifying power, brightness, and distinctness, it was manifestly superior to one of Mr Dollond's of 42 inches focal length. It also gave us an opportunity of admiring the dexterity of the London artists, who could work the glasses with such accuracy. We had most distinct vision of a star when using an erecting eye-piece, which made this telescope magnify more than a hundred times; and we found the field of vision as uniformly distinct as with Dollond's 42 inch telescope magnifying 46 times. The intelligent reader must admire the nice figuring and centering of the very deep eye-glasses which are necessary for this amplification.\n\nIt is to be hoped that Dr Blair will extend his views to glasses of different compositions, and thus give us object-glasses which are solid; for those composed of fluids have inconveniences which will hinder them from coming into general use, and will confine them to the museums of philosophers. We imagine that antimonial glasses bid fair to answer this purpose, if they could be made free of colour, so as to transmit enough of light. We recommend this dissertation to the careful perusal of our readers. Those who have not made themselves much acquainted with the delicate and abstruse theory of aberrations, will find it exhibited in such a popular form.\nThe simple astronomical telescope is represented in fig. 16. The beam of parallel rays, inclined to the axis, is made to converge to a point G, where it forms an image of the lowest point of a very distant object. These rays decussating from G fall on the eye-glass; the ray from the lowest point B of the object-glass falls on the eye-glass at b; and the ray from A falls on a; and the ray from the centre O falls on o. These rays are rendered parallel, or nearly so, by refraction through the eye-glass, and take the direction b', o I, a'. If the eye be placed so that this pencil of parallel rays may enter it, they converge to a point of the retina, and give distinct vision of the lowest point of the object. It appears inverted, because the rays by which we see its lowest point come in the direction which in simple vision is connected with the upper point of an object. They come from above, and therefore are thought to proceed from above. We see the point as if situated in the direction I o. In like manner the eye placed at I, sees the upper point of the object in the direction IP, and its middle in the direction IE. The proper place for the eye is I; if brought much nearer the glass, or removed much farther from it, none, or the whole, of this extreme pencil of rays will not enter the pupil. It is therefore of importance to determine this point. Because the eye requires parallel rays for distinct vision, it is plain that F must be the principal focus of the eye-glass. Therefore, by the common focal theorem, OF : OE = OE : OI, or OF : FE = OE : EI.\n\nThe magnifying power being measured by the magnitude of the visual angle, compared with the magnitude of the visual angle with the naked eye, we have \\( \\frac{OI}{OF} \\) or \\( \\frac{OF}{EI} \\), for the measure of the magnifying power. This is very nearly \\( \\frac{OE}{EI} \\), or \\( \\frac{OF}{FI} \\).\n\nAs the line OE, joining the centres of the lenses, and perpendicular to their surfaces, is called the axis of the telescope, so the ray OG is called the axis of the oblique pencil, being really the axis of the cone of light which has the object-glass for its base. This ray is through its whole course the axis of the oblique pencil; and when its course is determined, the amplification, the field of vision, the apertures of the glasses, are all determined. For this purpose we have only to consider the centre of the object-glass as a radical point, and trace the course of a ray from this point through the other glasses; this will be the axis of some oblique pencil.\n\nIt is evident, therefore, that the field of vision depends on the breadth of the eye-glass. Should we increase this, the extreme pencil will pass through I, because O and I are still the conjugate foci of the eye-glass.\n\n(a) While we thus repeatedly speak of the theory of spherical aberration as coming from Mr Huyghens, we must not omit giving a due share of the honour of it to Dr Barrow and Mr James Gregory. The first of these authors, in his Optical Lectures delivered at Cambridge, has given every proposition which is employed by Huyghens, and has even prosecuted the matter much further. In particular, his theory of oblique slender pencils is of immense consequence to the perfection of telescopes, by showing the methods for making the image of an extended surface as flat as possible. Gregory, too, has given all the fundamental propositions in his Optica Promota. But Huyghens, by taking the subject together, and treating it in a system, has greatly simplified it: and his manner of viewing the principal parts of it is incomparably more perspicuous than the performances of Barrow and Gregory.\nOn the other hand, the angle resolved on for the extent or field of vision gives the breadth of the eye-glass.\n\nWe may here observe, by the way, that for all optical instruments there must be two optical figures considered. The first shows the progress of a pencil of rays coming from one point of the object. The various focuses of this pencil show the places of the different images, real or virtual. Such a figure is formed by the three rays AG a i, OG o I, BG b i.\n\nThe second shows the progress of the axes of the different pencils proceeding through the centre of the object-glass. The focuses of this pencil of axes show the places where an image of the object-glass is formed; and this pencil determines the field of vision, the apertures of the lenses, and the amplification or magnifying power. The three rays OG o I, OFEI, OHPI, form this figure.\n\nSee also fig. 24, where the progress of both sets of pencils is more diversified.\n\nThe perfection of a telescope is to represent an object in its proper shape, distinctly magnified, with a great field of vision, and sufficiently bright. But there are limits to all these qualities; and an increase of one of them, for the most part, diminishes the rest. The brightness depends on the aperture of the object-glass, and will increase in the same proportion (because it will always be to AB in the proportion of EF to FO), till the diameter of the emergent pencil is equal to that of the pupil of the eye. Increasing the object-glass any more, can send no more light into the eye. But we cannot make the emergent pencil nearly so large as this when the telescope magnifies much; for the great aperture of the object-glass produces an indistinct image at GF, and its indistinctness is magnified by the eye-glass.\n\nA great field of vision is incompatible with the true shape of the object; for it is not strictly true that all rays flowing from O are refracted to I. Those rays which go to the margin of the eye-glass cross the axis between E and I; and therefore they cross it at a greater angle than if they passed through I. Now had they really passed through I, the object would have been represented in its due proportions. Therefore since the angles of the marginal parts are enlarged by the aberration of the eye-glass, the marginal parts themselves will appear enlarged, or the object appear distorted. Thus a chess-board viewed through a reading glass appears drawn out at the corners, and the straight lines are all changed into curves, as is represented in fig. 18.\n\nThe circumstance which most perceptibly limits the extent of field is the necessary distinctness. If the vision be indistinct, it is useless, and no other quality can compensate this defect. The distortion is very inconceivable in much larger angles of vision than we can admit, and is unworthy of the attention paid to it by optical writers. They have been induced to take notice of it, because the means of correcting it in a considerable degree are attainable, and afford an opportunity of exhibiting their knowledge; whereas the indistinctness which accompanies a large field is a subject of most difficult discussion, and has hitherto baffled all their efforts to express by any intelligible or manageable formulae.\n\nThis subject must, however, be considered. The image at GF of a very remote object is not a plain surface perpendicular to the axis of the telescope, but is nearly spherical, having O for its centre. If a number of pencils of parallel rays crossing each other in I fall on the eye-glass, they will form a picture on the opposite side, in the focus F. But this picture will by no means be flat, nor nearly so, but very concave towards E. Its exact form is of most difficult investigation. The elements of it are given by Dr Barrow; and we have given the chief of them in the article Optics, when considering the foci of infinitely slender pencils of oblique rays. Therefore it is impossible that the picture formed by the object-glass can be seen distinctly in all its parts by the eye-glass. Even if it were flat, the points G and H (fig. 16) are too far from the eye-glass when the middle F is at the proper distance for distinct vision. When, therefore, the telescope is so adjusted that we have distinct vision of the middle of the field, in order to see the margin distinctly we must push in the eye-glass; and having so done, the middle of the field becomes indistinct. When the field of vision exceeds 12 or 15 degrees, it is not possible by any contrivance to make it tolerably distinct all over; and we must turn the telescope successively to the different parts of the field that we may see them agreeably.\n\nThe cause of this indistinctness is, as we have already said, the shortness of the lateral foci of lateral and oblique pencils refracted by the eye-glass. The oblique pencil b G a, by which an eye placed at I sees the point G of the image, is a cone of light, having a circular base on the eye-glass; of which circle a b is one of the diameters. There is a diameter perpendicular to this, which, in this figure, is represented by the point o. Fig. 17 represents the base of the cone as seen by an eye placed in the axis of the telescope, with the object-glass as appearing behind it. The point b is formed by a ray which comes from the lowest point B of the object-glass, and the point a is illuminated by a ray from A. The point c at the right hand of the circular base of this cone of light came from the point C on the left side of the object-glass; and the light comes to d from D. Now the laws of optics demonstrate, that the rays which come through the points c and d are more convergent after refraction than the rays which come through a and b. The analogies, therefore, which ascertain the foci of rays lying in planes passing through the axis do not determine the foci of the others. Of this we may be sensible by looking through a lens to a figure on which are drawn concentric circles crossed by radii. When the telescope is so adjusted that we see distinctly the extremity of one of the radii, we shall not see distinctly the circumference which crosses the extremity with equal distinctness, and vice versa. This difference, however, between the foci of the rays which come through a and b, and those which come through c and d, is not considerate in the fields of vision, which are otherwise admissible. But the same difference of foci obtains also with respect to the dispersion of light, and is more remarkable. Both d'Alembert and Euler have attempted to introduce it into their formulæ.\nTelecope, make; but they have made them useless for any practical purpose by their inextricable complication.\n\nThis must serve as a general indication of the difficulties which occur in the construction of telescopes, even although the object-glas were perfect, forming an image without the smallest confusion or distortion.\n\nThere is yet another difficulty or imperfection. The rays of the pencil \\(aGb\\), when refracted through the eye-glas, are also separated into their component colours. The edge of the lens must evidently perform the office of a prism, and the white ray \\(Gb\\) will be so dispersed that if \\(i\\) be the path of its red ray, the violet ray, which makes another part of it, will take such a course \\(bn\\) that the angle \\(ibn\\) will be nearly \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)th of \\(G'ib'\\). The ray \\(Gb\\) passing through a part of the lens whose surfaces are less inclined to each other, will be less refracted, and will be less dispersed in the same proportion very nearly. Therefore the two violet rays will be very nearly parallel when the two red rays are rendered parallel.\n\nHence it must happen, that the object will appear bordered with coloured fringes. A black line seen near the margin on a white ground, will have a ruddy and orange border on the outside and a blue border within; and this confusion is altogether independent on the object-glas, and is so much the greater as the visual angle \\(bIE\\) is greater.\n\nSuch are the difficulties: They would be unmountable were it not that some of them are so connected that, to a certain extent, the diminution of one is accompanied by a diminution of the other. What are called the caustic curves are the geometrical loci of the foci of infinitely slender pencils. Consequently the point \\(G\\) is very nearly in the caustic formed by a beam of light consisting of rays parallel to \\(Ia\\), and occupying the whole surface of the eye-glas, because the pencil of rays which are collected at \\(G\\) is very small. Anything therefore that diminishes the mutual inclination of the adjoining rays, puts their concourse farther off. Now this is precisely what we want: for the point \\(G\\) of the image formed by the object-glas is already beyond the focus of the oblique slender pencil of parallel rays \\(ia\\) and \\(ib\\); and therefore, if we could make this focus go a little farther from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we shall bring it nearer to \\(G\\), and obtain more distinct vision of this point of the object. Now let it be recollected, that in moderate refractions through prisms, two rays which are inclined to each other in a small angle are, after refraction, inclined to each other in the same angle. Therefore, if we can diminish the aberration of the ray \\(ai\\), or \\(oI\\), or \\(bi\\), we diminish their mutual inclination; and consequently the mutual inclination of the rays \\(Ga\\), \\(Go\\), \\(Gb\\), and therefore lengthen the focus, and get more distinct vision of the point \\(G\\). Therefore we at once correct the distortion and the indistinctness; and this is the aim of Mr Huyghens's great principle of dividing the refractions.\n\nThe general method is as follows: Let \\(o\\) be the object-glas (fig. 19.) and \\(E\\) the eye-glas of a telescope, and \\(F\\) their common focus, and \\(FG\\) the image formed by the object-glas. The proportion of their focal distances is supposed to be such as gives as great a magnifying power as the perfection of the object-glas will admit. Let \\(BI\\) be the axis of the emergent pencil. It is known by the focal theorem that \\(GE\\) is parallel to \\(BI\\); therefore \\(BGE\\) is the whole refraction or deflection of the ray \\(OHB\\) from its former direction. Let it be proposed to diminish the aberrations by dividing this into two parts by means of two glasses \\(D\\) and \\(e\\), so as to make the ultimate angle of vision \\(bi'e\\) equal to \\(BIE\\), and thus retain the same magnifying power and visible field. Let it be proposed to divide it into the parts \\(BGC\\) and \\(CGE\\).\n\nFrom \\(G\\) draw any line \\(GD\\) to the axis towards \\(O\\); and draw the perpendicular \\(DH\\), cutting \\(OG\\) in \\(H\\); draw \\(HC\\) parallel to \\(GC\\), cutting \\(GD\\) in \\(g\\); draw \\(gf\\) perpendicular to the axis, and \\(ge\\) parallel to \\(GE\\); draw \\(eb\\) perpendicular to the axis; draw \\(Dd\\) parallel to \\(GC\\), and \\(bd\\) perpendicular to the axis.\n\nThen if there be placed at \\(D\\) a lens whose focal distance is \\(Dd\\), and another at \\(e\\) whose focal distance is \\(ef\\), the thing is done. The ray \\(OH\\) will be refracted into \\(Hb\\), and this into \\(bi\\) parallel to \\(BI\\).\n\nThe demonstration of this construction is so evident by means of the common focal theorem, that we need not repeat it, nor the reasons for its advantages. We have the same magnifying power, and the same field of vision; we have less aberration, and therefore less distortion and indistinctness; and this is brought about by a lens \\(HD\\) of a smaller aperture and a greater focal distance than \\(BE\\). Consequently, if we are contented with the distinctness of the margin of the field with a single eye-glas, we may greatly increase the field of vision; for if we increase \\(DH\\) to the size of \\(EB\\) we shall have a greater field, and much greater distinctness in the margin; because \\(HD\\) is of a longer focal distance, and will bear a greater aperture, preserving the same distinctness at the edge. On this account the glass \\(HD\\) is commonly called the Field-glas.\n\nIt must be observed here, however, that although the distortion of the object is lessened, there is a real distortion produced in the image \\(fg\\). But this, when magnified by the glass \\(e\\), is smaller than the distortion produced by the glass \\(E\\), of greater aperture and shorter focus, on the undistorted image \\(GF\\). But because there is a distortion in the second image \\(fg\\), this construction cannot be used for the telescopes of astronomical quadrants, and other graduated instruments; because then equal divisions of the micrometer would not correspond to equal angles.\n\nBut the same construction will answer in this case, by taking the point \\(D\\) on that side of \\(F\\) which is remote from \\(O\\) (fig. 20.). This is the form now employed in the telescopes of all graduated instruments.\n\nThe exact proportion in which the distortion and the indistinctness at the edges of the field are diminished by this construction, depends on the proportion in which the angle \\(BGE\\) is divided by \\(GC\\); and is of pretty difficult investigation. But it never deviates far (never \\(1/8\\)th in optical instruments) from the proportion of the squares of the angles. We may, without any sensible error, suppose it in this proportion. This gives us a practical rule of easy recollection, and of most extensive use. When we would diminish an aberration by dividing the whole refraction into two parts, we shall do it most effectually by making them equal. In like manner, if we divide it into three parts by means of two additional...\nThis useful problem, even when limited, as we have done, to equal refractions, is as yet indeterminate; that is, susceptible of an infinity of solutions; for the point D, where the field-glass is placed, was taken at pleasure; yet there must be situations more proper than others. The aberrations which produce distortion, and those which produce indistinctness, do not follow the same proportions. To correct the indistinctness, we should not select such positions of the lens HD as will give a small focal distance to be; that is, we should not remove it very far from F. Huygens recommends the proportion of 3 to 1 for that of the focal distances of the lens HD and e b, and says that the distance D e should be = 2 F e. This will make e = ½ e F, and will divide the whole refraction into two equal parts, as any one will readily see by constructing the common optical figure. Mr Short, the celebrated improver of reflecting teleopes, generally employed this proportion; and we shall presently see that it is a very good one.\n\nIt has been already observed that the great refractions which take place on the eye-glasses occasion very considerable dispersions, and disturb the vision by fringing everything with colours. To remedy this, achromatic eye-glasses may be employed, constructed by the rules already delivered. This construction, however, is incomparably more intricate than that of object-glasses: for the equations must involve the distance of the radiant point, and be more complicated; and this complication is immensely increased on account of the great obliquity of the pencils.\n\nFortunately the Huyghenian construction of an eye-piece enables us to correct this dispersion to a great degree of exactness. A heterogenous ray is dispersed at H, and the red ray belonging to it falls on the lens b e at a greater distance from the centre than the violet ray coming from H. It will therefore be less refracted (ceteris paribus) by the lens b e; and it is possible that the difference may be such that the red and violet rays dispersed at H may be rendered parallel at h, or even a little divergent, so as to unite accurately with the red ray at the bottom of the eye. How this may be affected, by a proper selection of the places and figures of the lenses, will appear by the following proposition, which we imagine is new, and not inelegant.\n\nLet the compound ray OP (fig. 21.) be dispersed by the lens PC; and let PV, PR be its violet and red rays, cutting the axis in G and g. It is required to place another lens RD in their way, so that the emergent rays R r, V v, shall be parallel.\n\nProduce the incident ray OP to Z. The angles ZPR, ZPV, are given, (and RPV is nearly = \\(\\frac{ZPR}{27}\\)) and the intersections G and g with the axis. Let F be the focus of parallel red light coming through the lens RD in the opposite direction. Then (by the common optical theorem), the perpendicular F g will cut PR in such a point g, that g F will be parallel to the emergent ray R r, and to V v. Therefore if g D cut PV in u, and u f be drawn perpendicular to the axis, we shall have (also by the common theorem) the point f for the focus of violet rays, and DF : D f = D g : D u = 28 : 27 nearly, or in a given ratio.\n\nThe problem is therefore reduced to this, \"To draw from a point D in the line CG a line Dg, which shall be cut by the lines PR and PV in the given ratio.\"\n\nThe following construction naturally offers itself: Make GM : gM in the given ratio, and draw MK parallel to Pg. Through any point D of CG draw the straight line PDK, cutting MK in K. Join GK, and draw Dg parallel to KG. This will solve the problem; and, drawing g F perpendicular to the axis, we shall have F for the focus of the lens RD for parallel red rays.\n\nThe demonstration is evident: for MK being parallel to Pg, we have GM : gM = GK : HK, = gD : uD = FD : fD, in the ratio required.\n\nThis problem admits of an infinity of solutions; because the point D may be taken anywhere in the line CG. It may therefore be subjected to such conditions as may produce other advantages.\n\n1. It may be restricted by the magnifying power, or by the division which we choose to make of the whole refraction which produces this magnifying power. Thus, if we have resolved to diminish the aberrations by making the two refractions equal, we have determined the angle R r D. Therefore draw GK, making the angle MGK equal to that which the emergent pencil must make with the axis, in order to produce this magnifying power. Then draw MK parallel to Pg, meeting GK in K. Then draw PK, cutting the axis in D, and Dg parallel to GK, and g F perpendicular to the axis. D is the place, and DF the focal distance of the eye-glass.\n\n2. Particular circumstances may cause us to fix on a particular place D, and we only want the focal distance. In this case the first construction suffices.\n\n3. We may have determined on a certain focal distance DF, and the place must be determined. In this case let\n\n\\[ GF : Fg = 1 : \\tan G \\]\n\\[ Fg : fu = 1 : m, \\text{m being } \\frac{27}{28} \\]\n\\[ fu : fg = \\tan g : 1 \\]\n\nthen \\( GF : fg = \\tan g : m \\tan G \\)\n\nthen \\( GF : fg : Gf = \\tan g : m \\tan G : \\tan g \\)\n\nor \\( Gg + Ff : Gf = \\tan g : m \\tan G : \\tan g \\)\n\nand \\( GF = Gg + Ff - \\tan g : m \\tan G : \\tan g \\), and is therefore given, and the place of F is determined; and since FD is given by supposition, D is determined.\n\nThe application of this problem to our purpose is difficult, if we take it in the most general terms; but the nature of the thing makes such limitations that it becomes very easy. In the case of the dispersion of light, the angle GP g is so small that MK may be drawn parallel to PG without any sensible error. If the ray OP were parallel to CG, then G would be the focus of the lens PC, and the point M would fall on C; because the focal distance of red rays is to that of violet rays in the same proportion for every lens, and therefore CG : Cg = DF : Df. Now, in a telescope which magnifies considerably, the angle at the object-glass is very small, and CG hardly exceeds the focal distance; and CG is to Cg very nearly in the same proportion of 28 to 27. We may therefore draw through C (fig. 22.) a line CK parallel...\nparallel to PG; then draw GK' perpendicular to the axis of the lens, and join PK'; draw K'BE parallel to CG, cutting PK in B; draw BHI parallel to GK, cutting GK' in H: Join HD and PK. It is evident that CG is bisected in F', and that K'B = 2 FD: also K'H : HG = K'B : BE, = CD : DG. Therefore DH is parallel to CK', or to PG. But because PF = FK', PD is DB, and IH = HB. Therefore D = HB, and FD = K'B, = 2 FD; and FD is bisected in F'.\n\nTherefore \\( CD = \\frac{CG + FD}{2} \\).\n\nThat is, in order that the eye-glass RD may correct the dispersion of the field-glass PC, the distance between them must be equal to the half sum of their focal distances very nearly. More exactly, the distance between them must be equal to the half sum of the focal distance of the eye-glass, and the distance at which the field-glass would form an image of the object-glass. For the point G is the focus to which a ray coming from the centre of the object-glass is refracted by the field-glass.\n\nThis is a very simple solution of this important problem. Huygens's eye-piece corresponds with it exactly. If indeed the dispersion at P is not entirely produced by the refraction, but perhaps combined with some previous dispersion, the point M (fig. 21.) will not coincide with C, (fig. 22.), and we shall have GC to GM, as the natural dispersion at P to the dispersion which really obtains there. This may destroy the equation \\( CD = \\frac{CG + FD}{2} \\).\n\nThus, in a manner rather unexpected, have we freed the eye-glasses from the greatest part of the effect of dispersion. We may do it entirely by pushing the eye-glass a little nearer to the field-glass. This will render the violet rays a little divergent from the red, so as to produce a perfect picture at the bottom of the eye. But by doing so we have hurt the distinctness of the whole picture, because F is not in the focus of RD. We remedy this by drawing both glasses out a little, and the telescope is made perfect.\n\nThis improvement cannot be applied to the construction of quadrant telescopes, such as fig. 20. Mr Ramsden has attempted it, however, in a very ingenious way, which merits a place here, and is also instructive in another way. The field-glass HD is a plano-convex, with its plane side next the image GF. It is placed very near this image. The consequence of this disposition is, that the image GF produces a vertical image gf, which is much less convex towards the glass. He then places a lens on the point C, where the red ray would cross the axis. The violet ray will pass on the other side of it. If the focal distance of this glass be fc, the vision will be distinct and free from colour. It has, however, the inconvenience of obliging the eye to be close to the glass, which is very troublesome.\n\nThis would be a good construction for a magic-lantern, or for the object-glass of a solar microscope, or indeed of any compound microscope.\n\nWe may presume that the reader is now pretty familiar with the different circumstances which must be considered in the construction of an eye-piece, and proceed to consider those which must be employed to erect the telescope object.\n\nThis may be done by placing the lens which receives the light from the object-glass in such a manner, that a second image (inverted with respect to the first) may be formed beyond it, and this may be viewed by an eye-glass. Such a construction is represented in fig. 23. But, besides many other defects, it tinges the object progressively with colour. The ray od is dispersed at d into the red ray dr, and the violet dv, v being farther from the centre than r, the refracted ray v' crofs rr' both by reason of spherical aberration and its greater refrangibility.\n\nBut the common day telescope, invented by F. Rheiita, has, in this respect, greatly the advantage of the one now described. The rays of compound light are dispersed at two points. The violet ray in its course falls without the red ray, but is accurately collected with it at a common focus, as we shall demonstrate by and by. Since they cross each other in the focus, the violet ray must fall within the red ray, and be less refracted than if it had fallen on the same point with the red ray. Had it fallen there it would have separated from it; but by a proper diminution of its refraction, it is kept parallel to it, or nearly so. And this is one excellence of this telescope: when constructed with three eye-glasses perfectly equal, the colour is sensibly diminished, and by using an eye-glass somewhat smaller, it may be removed entirely.—We say no more of it at present, because we shall find its construction included in another, which is still more perfect.\n\nIt is evident at first sight that this telescope may be improved, by substituting for the eye-glass the Huyghenian double eye-glass, or field-glass and eye-glass represented in fig. 19. and 20.; and that the first of these may be improved and rendered achromatic. This will require the two glasses ef and gh to be increased from their present dimensions to the size of a field-glass, suited to the magnifying power of the telescope, supposing it an astronomical telescope. Thus we shall have a telescope of four eye-glasses. The three first will be of a considerable focal distance, and two of them will have a common focus at b. But this is considerably different from the eye-piece of four glasses which are now used, and are far better. We are indebted for them to Mr Dollond, who was a mathematician as well as an artist, and in the course of his research discovered resources which had not been thought of. He had not then discovered the achromatic object-glass, and was busy in improving the eye-glasses by diminishing their spherical aberration. His first thought was to make the Huyghenian addition at both the images of the day telescope. This suggested to him the following eye-piece of five glasses.\n\nFig. 24. represents this eye-piece, but there is not room for the object-glass at its proper distance. A pencil of rays coming from the upper point of the object is made to converge (by the object-glass) to G, where it would form a picture of that part of the object. But it is intercepted by the lens A a, and its axis is bent towards the axis of the telescope in the direction ab. At the same time, the rays which converged to G converge to g, and there is formed an inverted picture of the object at gf. The axis of the pencil is again refracted at L 1.\nThe rays of this pencil, diverging from \\( g \\), are made less diverging, and proceed as if they came from \\( g' \\), in the line \\( Bg \\). The lens \\( c \\) causes them to converge to \\( g' \\), in the line \\( G''Cg' \\). The lens \\( dD \\) makes them converge still more to \\( G'' \\), and there they form an erect picture \\( G''F'' \\); diverging from \\( G'' \\), they are rendered parallel by the refraction at \\( e \\).\n\nAt \\( H \\) the rays are nearly parallel. Had the glass \\( Bb \\) been a little farther from \\( A \\), they would have been accurately so, and the object-glass, with the glasses \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), would have formed an astronomical telescope with the Huyghenian eye-piece. The glasses \\( C, D, \\) and \\( E \\), are intended merely for bending the rays back again till they again cross the axis in \\( I \\). The glass \\( C \\) tends chiefly to diminish the great angle \\( BHb \\); and then the two glasses \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) are another Huyghenian eye-piece.\n\nThe art in this construction lies in the proper adjustment of the glasses, so as to divide the whole bending of the pencil pretty equally among them, and to form the last image in the focus of the eye-glass, and at a proper distance from the other glass. Bringing \\( B \\) nearer to \\( A \\) would bend the pencil more to the axis. Placing \\( C \\) farther from \\( B \\) would do the same thing; but this would be accompanied with more aberration, because the rays would fall at a greater distance from the centres of the lenses. The greatest bending is made at the field-glass \\( D \\); and we imagine that the telescope would be improved, and made more distinct at the edges of the field, by employing another glass of great focal distance between \\( C \\) and \\( D \\).\n\nThere is an image formed at \\( H \\) of the object-glasses, and the whole light passes through a small circle in this place. It is usual to put a plate here pierced with a hole which has the diameter of this image. A second image of the object-glass is formed at \\( I \\), and indeed wherever the pencils cross the axis. A lens placed at \\( H \\) makes no change in any of the angles, nor in the magnifying power, and affects only the place where the images are formed. And, on the other hand, a lens placed at \\( f \\), or \\( F'' \\), where a real image is formed, makes no change in the places of the images, but affects the mutual inclination of the pencils. This affords a resource to the artist, by which he may combine properties which seem incompatible.\n\nThe aperture of \\( A \\) determines the visible field and all the other apertures.\n\nWe must avoid forming a real image, such as \\( fg \\), or \\( F''G'' \\), on or very near any glass. For we cannot see this image without seeing along with it every particle of dust and every scratch on the glass. We see them as making part of the object when the image is exactly on the glass, and we see them confusedly, and so as to confuse the object, when the image is near it. For when the image is on or very near any glass, the pencil of light occupies a very small part of its surface, and a particle of dust intercepts a great proportion of it.\n\nIt is plain that this construction will not do for the telescope of graduated instruments, because the micrometer cannot be applied to the second image \\( fg \\), account of its being a little distorted, as has been observed of the Huyghenian eye-piece.\n\nAlso the interposition of the glass \\( C \\) makes it difficult to correct the dispersion.\n\nBy proper reasoning from the correction in the Huyghenian eye-piece, we are led to the best construction of one with three glasses; which we shall now consider, taking it in a particular form, which shall make the discussion easy, and make us fully masters of the principles which lead to a better form. Therefore let \\( PA \\) (fig. 25.) be the glass which first receives the light proceeding from the image formed by the object-glass, and let \\( OP \\) be the axis of the extreme pencil. This is refracted into \\( PR \\), which is again refracted into \\( Rr \\) by the next lens \\( Br \\). Let \\( b \\) be the focus of parallel rays of the second lens. Draw \\( PB_r \\). We know that \\( Ab : bB = PB : Br \\), and that rays of one kind diverging from \\( P \\) will be collected at \\( r \\). But if \\( PR, PV \\) be a red and a violet ray, the violet ray will be more refracted at \\( V \\), and will cross the red ray in some intermediate point \\( g \\) of the line \\( Rr \\). If therefore the first image had been formed precisely on the lens \\( PA \\), we should have a second image at \\( fg \\) free from all coloured fringes.\n\nIf the refractions at \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are equal (as in the common day telescope), the dispersion at \\( V \\) must be equal to that at \\( P \\), or the angle \\( vVr = VPR \\). But we have ultimately \\( RPV : RrV = BC : AB \\), (\\( = BB : Ab \\) by the focal theorem). Therefore \\( gVr : grV \\), or \\( gr : gV \\), or \\( Cf : f'B \\) \\( = BB : Ab \\), and \\( AB : Aa = Rr : Rg \\).\n\nThis shows by the way the advantage of the common day telescope. In this \\( AE = 2Ab \\), and therefore \\( f \\) is the place of the last image which is free from coloured fringes. But this image will not be seen free from coloured fringes through the eye-glass \\( Cr \\), if \\( f \\) be its focus: For had \\( gr, gv \\) been both red rays, they would have been parallel after refraction; but \\( gv \\) being a violet ray, will be more refracted. It will not indeed be so much deflected from parallelism as the violet ray, which naturally accompanies the red ray to \\( r \\), because it falls nearer the centre. By computation its dispersion is diminished about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nIn order that \\( gv \\) may be made parallel to \\( gr \\) after refraction, the refraction at \\( r \\) must be such that the dispersion corresponding to it may be of a proper magnitude. How to determine this is the question. Let the dispersion at \\( g \\) be to the dispersion produced by the refraction at \\( r \\) (which is required for producing the intended magnifying power) as \\( 1 \\) to \\( g \\). Make \\( g : 1 = ff' : f'C \\), \\( f'C : CD \\), and draw the perpendicular \\( Dr \\) meeting the refracted ray \\( rr' \\) in \\( r' \\). Then we know by the common focal theorem, that if \\( f' \\) be the focus of the lens \\( Cr \\), red rays diverging from \\( g \\) will be united in \\( r' \\). But the violet ray \\( gv \\) will be refracted into \\( uv \\) parallel to \\( rr' \\). For the angle \\( vr'r : vgr = (ultimately) f'C : CD, = g : 1 \\). Therefore the angle \\( vr'r \\) is equal to the dispersion produced at \\( r \\), and therefore equal to \\( rr'v' \\), and \\( vv' \\) is parallel to \\( rr' \\).\n\nBut by this we have destroyed the distinct vision of the image formed at \\( fg \\), because it is no longer at the focus of the eye-glass. But distinct vision will be restored by pushing the glasses nearer to the object-glass. This makes the rays of each particular pencil more divergent after refraction through \\( A \\), but scarcely makes any change in the directions of the pencils themselves. Thus the image comes to the focus \\( f' \\), and makes no sensible change in the dispersions.\nIn the common day telescope, the first image is formed in the anterior focus of the first eye-glass, and the second image is at the anterior focus of the last eye-glass. If we change this last for one of half the focal distance, and put in the eye-piece till the image formed by the object-glass is half way between the first eye-glass and its focus, the last image will be formed at the focus of the new eye-glass, and the eye-piece will be achromatic. This is easily seen by making the usual computations by the focal theorem. But the visible field is diminished, because we cannot give the same aperture as before to the new eye-glass; but we can substitute for it two eye glasses like the former, placed close together. This will have the same focal distance with the new one, and will allow the same aperture that we had before.\n\nOn these principles may be demonstrated the correction of colour in eye pieces with three glasses of the following construction.\n\nLet the glasses A and B be placed so that the posterior focus of the first nearly coincides with the anterior focus of the second, or rather so that the anterior focus of B may be at the place where the image of the object-glass is formed; by which situation the aperture necessary for transmitting the whole light will be the smallest possible. Place the third C at a distance from the second, which exceeds the sum of their focal distances by a space which is a third proportional to the distance of the first and second, and the focal distance of the second. The distance of the first eye-glass from the object-glass must be equal to the product of the focal distance of the first and second divided by their sum.\n\nLet O, A, B, C, c, the focal distances of the glasses, be O, a, b, c. Then make \\( \\frac{AB}{a+b} = \\frac{BC}{b+c} \\); \\( \\frac{OA}{b+c} = \\frac{b+c}{b+c} \\). The amplification or magnifying power will be \\( \\frac{ab}{ac} \\); the equivalent eye-glass \\( \\frac{ac}{b} \\); and the field of vision \\( = 3438' \\times \\).\n\nThese eye-pieces will admit the use of a micrometer at the place of the final image, because it has no distortion.\n\nMr Dollond was anxious to combine this achromatism of the eye-pieces with the advantages which he had found in the eye-pieces with five glasses. This eye piece of three glasses necessarily has a very great refraction at the glass B, where the pencil which has come from the other side of the axis must be rendered again convergent, or at least parallel to it. This occasions considerable aberrations. This may be avoided by giving part of this refraction to a glass put between the first and second, in the same way as he has done by the glass B put between A and C in his five glass eye-piece. But this deranges the whole process. His ingenuity, however, surmounted this difficulty, and he made eye-pieces of four glasses, which seem as perfect as can be desired. He has not published his ingenious investigation; and we observe the London artists work very much at random, probably copying the proportions of some of his best glasses, without understanding the principle, and therefore frequently mistaking. We see many eye-pieces which are far from being achromatic. We imagine therefore that it will be an acceptable thing to the artists to have precise instructions how to proceed, nothing of this kind having appeared in our language, and the investigations of Euler, d'Alembert, and even Bosevich, being so abstruse as to be inaccessible to all but experienced analysts. We hope to render it extremely simple.\n\nIt is evident, that if we make the rays of different colours unite on the surface of the last eye-glass but one, commonly called the field-glass, the thing will be done, because the dispersion from this point of union will then unite with the dispersion produced by this glass alone; and this increased dispersion may be corrected by the last eye-glass in the way already shown.\n\nTherefore let A, B (fig. 26.) be the stations which we have fixed on for the first and second eye-glasses, in order to give a proper portion of the whole refraction to the second glass. Let b be the anterior focus of B. Draw PB r through the centre of B. Make A b : b B = AB : BK. Draw the perpendicular Kr, meeting the refracted ray in r. We know by the focal theorem, that red rays diverging from P will converge to r; but the violet ray PV, being more refracted, will cross R r in some point g. Drawing the perpendicular f g, we get f for the proper place of the field-glass. Let the refracted ray R r, produced backward, meet the ray OP coming from the centre of the object-glass in O. Let the angle of dispersion RPV be called p, and the angle of dispersion at V, that is, r V v, be v, and the angle V r R be r.\n\nIt is evident that OR : OP = p : v, because the dispersions are proportional to the sines of the refractions, which, in this case, are very nearly as the refractions themselves.\n\nLet \\( \\frac{OP}{Oit} \\) (or \\( \\frac{op}{pB} \\) or \\( \\frac{pB}{bB} \\)) be made = m. Then \\( v = mp \\); also \\( p : r = BK : AB = bB : Ab \\), and \\( r = p \\).\n\n\\( \\frac{Ab}{bB} \\) or making \\( \\frac{Ab}{bB} = n, r = np \\); therefore \\( v = rm = n \\).\n\n\\( \\frac{pB}{bB} \\cdot \\frac{Ab}{bB} = pB : Ab \\).\n\nThe angle Rg V = g V r + gr V = \\( \\frac{p}{m+n} \\); and Rg V : Rr v = Rr : Rg, or \\( m+n : nr = Rr : Rg \\), and Rg = Rr \\( \\frac{n}{m+n} \\). But R r is ultimately \\( \\frac{BK}{AB} = \\frac{bB}{Ab} \\).\n\nTherefore \\( Rg = \\frac{AB}{n} \\times \\frac{n}{m+n} = \\frac{n}{m+n} \\), and \\( Bf = \\frac{AB}{m+n} \\).\n\nThis value of Bf is evidently \\( = bB \\times \\frac{AB}{pB+Ab} \\).\n\nNow bB being a constant quantity while the glass B is the same, the place of union varies with \\( \\frac{AB}{pB+Ab} \\). If we remove B a little farther from A, we increase AB, and pB, and Ab, each by the same quantity. This evidently diminishes Bf. On the other hand, bringing B nearer to A increases Bf. If we keep the distance between the glasses the same, but increase the focal distance bB, we augment Bf, because this change aug-\nments the numerator and diminishes the denominator of the fraction \\( \\frac{bB \\times AB}{pB + A} \\).\n\nIn this manner we can unite the colours at what distance we please, and consequently can unite them in the place of the intended field-glass, from which they will diverge with an increased dispersion, viz. with the dispersion competent to the refraction produced there, and the dispersion \\( p \\times m + n \\) conjoined.\n\nIt only remains to determine the proper focal distances of the field-glass and eye-glass, and the place of the eye-glass, so that this dispersion may be finally corrected.\n\nThis is an indeterminate problem, admitting of an infinity of solutions. We shall limit it by an equal division of the two remaining refractions, which are necessary in order to produce the intended magnifying power. This construction has the advantage of diminishing the aberration. Thus we know the two refractions, and the dispersion competent to each; it being nearly \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of the refraction. Call this \\( q \\). The whole dispersion at the field-glass consists of \\( q \\), and of the angle \\( KGV \\) of fig. 19, which we also know to be \\( = p \\times m + n \\). Call their sum \\( s \\).\n\nLet fig. 27 represent this addition to the eye-piece. \\( CG \\) is the field-glass coming in the place of \\( f'g \\) of fig. 26, and \\( Rgw \\) is the red ray coming from the glass \\( BR \\). Draw \\( g's \\) parallel to the intended emergent pencil from the eye-glass; that is, making the angle \\( Csg \\) with the axis corresponding to the intended magnifying power. Bisect this angle by the line \\( gK \\). Make \\( sg : gq = s : q \\), and draw \\( qK \\), cutting \\( CG \\) in \\( r \\). Draw \\( dD \\), cutting \\( gk \\) in \\( k \\), and the axis in \\( D \\). Draw \\( dD \\) and \\( dr \\) perpendicular to the axis. Then a lens placed in \\( D \\), having the focal distance \\( Dd \\), will destroy the dispersion at the lens \\( gc \\), which refracts the ray \\( gw \\) into \\( gr \\).\n\nLet \\( gv \\) be the violet ray, making the angle \\( vgr = s \\). It is plain, by the common optical theorem, that \\( gr \\) will be refracted into \\( rr' \\) parallel to \\( dD \\). Draw \\( dD \\) meeting \\( rr' \\), and join \\( vr' \\). By the focal theorem two red rays \\( g'rvv \\) will be united in \\( r' \\). But the violet ray \\( gv \\) will be more refracted, and will take the path \\( vvr' \\), making the angle of dispersion \\( rr'v = q \\), very nearly, because the dispersion at \\( v \\) does not sensibly differ from that at \\( r \\). Now, in the small angles of refraction which obtain in optical instruments, the angles \\( rr'v, r'rv \\) are very nearly as \\( rr' \\) and \\( rr' \\), or as \\( gD \\) and \\( Dr' \\), or as \\( CD \\) and \\( DT \\); which, by the focal theorem, are as \\( cd \\) and \\( dD \\); that is, \\( Dd : dc = rr'v : rr'v \\). But \\( Dd : dc = Dd : dD = sg : gq = s : q \\). But \\( rgv = s \\); therefore \\( rr'v = q \\), \\( rr'v = q \\), and \\( vv' \\) is parallel to \\( rr' \\), and the whole dispersion at \\( g \\) is corrected by the lens \\( Dr \\). The focal distance \\( CC \\) of \\( CG \\) is had by drawing \\( Cx \\) parallel to \\( Kg \\), meeting \\( Rg \\) in \\( x \\), and drawing \\( xc \\) perpendicular to the axis.\n\nIt is easy to see that this (not inelegant) construction is not limited to the equality of the refractions \\( wgr, Krr' \\). In whatever proportion the whole refraction \\( wgs \\) is divided, we always can tell the proportion of the dispersions which the two refractions occasion at \\( g \\) and \\( r \\), and can therefore find the values of \\( s \\) and \\( q \\). Indeed this solution includes the problem in p. 266, col. 2, par. ult.; but it had not occurred to us till the present occasion.\n\nOur readers will not be displeased with this variety of telescope resource.\n\nThe intelligent reader will see, that in this solution some quantities and ratios are assumed as equal which are not strictly so, in the same manner as in all the elementary optical theorems. The parallelism, however, of \\( uv \\) and \\( rr' \\) may be made accurate, by pushing the lens \\( Dr \\) nearer to \\( Cg \\), or retiring it from it. We may also, by pushing it still nearer, induce a small divergency of the violet ray, so as to produce accurate vision in the eye, and may thus make the vision through a telescope more perfect than with the naked eye, where dispersion is by no means avoided. It would therefore be an improvement to have the eye-glass in a sliding tube for adjustment. Bring the telescope to distinct vision; and if any colour be visible about the edges of the field, shift the eye-glass till this colour is removed. The vision may now become indistinct; but this is corrected by shifting the place of the whole eye-piece.\n\nWe have examined trigonometrically the progress of a red and a violet ray through many eye-pieces of Dollond’s and Ramsden’s best telescopes; and we have found in all of them that the colours are united on or very near the field-glass; so that we presume that a theory somewhat analogous to ours has directed the ingenious inventors. We meet with many made by other artists, and even some of theirs, where a considerable degree of colour remains, sometimes in the natural order and often in the contrary order. This must happen in the hands of mere imitators, ignorant of principle. We presume that we have now made this principle sufficiently plain.\n\nFig. 28 represents the eye-piece of a very fine spyglass by Mr Ramsden; the focal length of its object-glass is \\( \\frac{8}{15} \\) inches, with \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\)th of aperture, \\( 20 \\)° of visible field, and \\( 13.4 \\) magnifying power. The distances and focal lengths are of their proper dimensions, but the apertures are \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) larger, that the progress of a lateral pencil might be more distinctly drawn. The dimensions are as follows:\n\nFocal lengths:\n- \\( Aa = 0.775 \\)\n- \\( Bb = 1.025 \\)\n- \\( Ce = 1.01 \\)\n- \\( Dd = 0.79 \\)\n\nDistances:\n- \\( AB = 1.18 \\)\n- \\( BC = 1.83 \\)\n- \\( CD = 1.105 \\)\n\nIt is perfectly achromatic, and the colours are united, not precisely at the lens \\( Cg \\), but about \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\)th of an inch nearer the eye-glass.\n\nIt is obvious that this combination of glasses may be used as a microscope; for if, instead of the image formed by the object-glass at \\( FG \\), we substitute a small object, illuminated from behind, as in compound microscopes; and if we draw the eye-piece a very small way from this object, the pencils of parallel rays emergent from the eye-glass \\( D \\) will become convergent to very distant points, and will there form an inverted and enlarged picture of the object, which may be viewed by a Huyghenian eye-piece; and we may thus get high magnifying powers without using very deep glasses. We tried the eye-piece of which we have given the dimensions in this way, and found that it might be made to magnify 180 times with very great distinctness. When used as the magnifier of a solar microscope, it infinitely surpasses everything we have ever seen. The picture formed by a solar microscope is generally so indistinct, that it is fit only for amusing ladies; but with this magnifier it seems\nWe therefore recommend this to the artists as a valuable article of their trade.\n\nThe only thing which remains to be considered in the theory of refracting telescopes is the forms of the different lenses. Hitherto we have had no occasion to consider anything but their focal distances; but their aberrations depend greatly on the adjustment of their forms to their situations. When the conjugate focii of a lens are determined by the service which it is to perform, there is a certain form or proportion between the curvatures of their anterior and posterior surfaces, which will make their aberrations the smallest possible.\n\nIt is evident that this proportion is to be obtained by making the fluxion of the quantity within the parenthesis in the formula at the top of col. 2, p. 248, equal to nothing. When this is done, we obtain this formula for \\(a\\), the radius of curvature for the anterior surface of a lens:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{2m^2 + m}{2m + 4} + \\frac{4m + 4}{2(m + 4)r}, \\quad \\text{where } m \\text{ is the ratio of the fine of incidence to the fine of refraction, and } r \\text{ is the distance of the focus of incident rays, positive or negative, according as they converge or diverge, all measured on a scale of which the unit is } n, \\text{ half of the radius of the equivalent isofocal lens.}\n\\]\n\nIt will be sufficiently exact for our purpose to suppose \\(m = \\frac{3}{2}\\) though it is more nearly \\(\\frac{31}{20}\\). In this case\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{b}{7} + \\frac{42r + 70}{7r}, \\quad \\text{Therefore } a = \\frac{49r}{42r + 70}. \\quad \\text{And } \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1 - a}{a}.\n\\]\n\nAs an example, let it be required to give the radii of curvature in inches for the eye-glass \\(b\\) of page 262, cal. 1, par. 4, which we shall suppose of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches focal distance, and that \\(ec (= r)\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inches.\n\nThe radius of curvature for the equivalent isofocal lens is 1.5, and its half is 0.75. Therefore \\(r = \\frac{3}{0.75} = 5\\); and our formula is \\(a = \\frac{49 \\times 5}{42 \\times 5 + 70} = \\frac{245}{280} = 0.875\\); and \\(\\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1 - a}{a} = \\frac{0.125}{0.875} = \\frac{0.875}{0.125} = 7\\).\n\nThese values are parts of a scale, of which the unit is 0.75 inches. Therefore\n\n\\[\na, \\text{ in inches, } = 0.875 \\times 0.75 = 0.65525 \\\\\nb, \\text{ in inches, } = 7 \\times 0.75 = 5.25.\n\\]\n\nAnd here we must observe that the posterior surface is concave: for \\(b\\) is a positive quantity, because \\(1 - a\\) is a positive quantity as well as \\(a\\); therefore the centre of sphericity of both surfaces lies beyond the lens.\n\nAnd this determination is not very different from the usual practice, which commonly makes this lens a plane convex with its flat side next the eye: and there will not be much difference in the performance of these two lenses; for in all cases of maxima and minima, even a pretty considerable change of the best dimensions does not make a sensible change in the result.\n\nThe same consideration leads to a rule which is very simple, and sufficiently exact for ordinary situations. This is to make the curvatures such, that the incident and emergent pencils may be nearly equally inclined to the surfaces of the lens. Thus in the eye-piece with five glasses, A and B should be most convex on their anterior sides; C should be most convex on the posterior side; D should be nearly isofocal; and E nearly plano-convex.\n\nBut this is not so easy a matter as appears at first sight. The lenses of an eye-piece have not only to bend the several pencils of light to and from the axis of the telescope; they have also to form images on the axes of these pencils. These offices frequently require opposite forms, as mentioned in par. 3, col. 2, p. 261. Thus the glass A fig. 28, should be most convex on the side next the object, that it may produce little distortion of the pencils. But it should be most convex next the eye, that it may produce distinct vision of the image FG, which is very near it. This image should have its concavity turned towards A, whereas it is towards the object-glass. We must therefore endeavour to make the vertical image FG flatter, or even convex. This requires a glass very flat before and convex behind. For similar reasons the object-glass of a microscope and the simple eye-glass of an astronomical telescope should be formed the same way.\n\nThis is a subject of most difficult discussion, and requires a theory which few of our readers would relish; nor does our limits afford room for it. The artists are obliged to grope their way. The proper method of experiment would be, to make eye-pieces of large dimensions, with extravagant apertures to increase the aberrations, and to provide for each station A, B, C, and D, a number of lenses of the same focal distance, but of different forms: and we would advise making the trial in the way of a solar microscope, and to have two eye-pieces on trial at once. Their pictures can be formed on the same screen, and accurately compared; whereas it is difficult to keep in remembrance the performance of one eye-piece, and compare it with another.\n\nWe have now treated the theory of refracting telescopes with considerable minuteness, and have perhaps exceeded the limits which some readers may think reasonable. But we have long regretted that there is not any theory on this subject from which a curious person can learn the improvements which have been made since the time of Dr Smith, or an artist learn how to proceed with intelligence in his profession. If we have accomplished either of these ends, we trust that the public will receive our labours with satisfaction.\n\nWe cannot add anything to what Dr Smith has delivered on the theory of reflecting telescopes. There appears to be the same possibility of correcting the aberration of the great speculum by the contrary aberration of a convex small speculum, that we have practised in the compound object-glass of an achromatic refracting telescope. But this cannot be, unless we make the radius of the convex speculum exceedingly large, which destroys the magnifying power and the brightness. This therefore must be given up. Indeed their performance, when well executed, does already surpass all imagination. Dr Herschel has found great advantages in what he calls the front view, not using a plane mirror to throw the pencils to one side. But this cannot\nNothing remains but to describe the mechanism of some of the most convenient forms.\n\nTo describe all the varieties of shape and accommodation which may be given to a telescope, would be a task as trifling as prolix. The artists of London and of Paris have racked their inventions to please every fancy, and to suit every purpose. We shall content ourselves with a few general maxims, deduced from the scientific consideration of a telescope, as an instrument by which the visual angle subtended by a distant object is greatly magnified.\n\nThe chief consideration is to have a steady view of the distant object. This is unattainable, unless the axis of the instrument be kept constantly directed to the same point of it: for when the telescope is gently shifted from its position, the object seems to move in the same or in the opposite direction, according as the telescope inverts the object or shows it erect. This is owing to the magnifying power, because the apparent angular motion is greater than what we naturally connect with the motion of the telescope. This does not happen when we look through a tube without glasses.\n\nAll thinking of the instrument therefore makes the object dance before the eye; and this is disagreeable, and hinders us from seeing it distinctly. But a tremulous motion, however small, is infinitely more prejudicial to the performance of a telescope, by making the object quiver before us. A person walking in the room prevents us from seeing distinctly; nay, the very pulsation in the body of the observer, agitates the floor enough to produce this effect, when the telescope has a great magnifying power: For the visible motion of the object is then an imperceptible tremor, like that of an harpsichord wire, which produces an effect precisely similar to optical indistinctness; and every point of the object is diffused over the whole space of the angular tremor, and appears coexistent in every part of this space, just as a harpsichord wire does while it is sounding. The more rapid this motion is, the indistinctness is the more complete. Therefore the more firm and elastic and well bound together the frame-work and apertures of our telescope is, the more hurtful will this consequence be. A mounting of lead, were it practicable, would be preferable to wood, iron, or brass. This is one great cause of the indistinctness of the very finest reflecting telescopes of the usual constructions, and can never be totally removed. In the Gregorian form, it is hardly possible to damp the elastic tremor of the small speculum, carried by an arm supported at one end only, even though the tube were motionless. We were witnesses of a great improvement made on a four-feet reflecting telescope, by supporting the small speculum by a strong plate of lead placed across the tube, and led by an adjusting screw at each end. But even the great mirror may vibrate enough to produce indistinctness. Refracting telescopes are free from this inconvenience, because a small angular motion of the object-glass round one of its own diameters has no sensible effect on the image in its focus. They are affected only by an angular motion of the axis of the telescope or of the eye-glasses.\n\nThis single consideration gives us great help towards judging of the merits of any particular apparatus. We should study it in this particular, and see whether its form makes the tube readily susceptible of such tremulous motions. If it does, the firmer it is and the more elastic it is, the worse. All forms therefore where the tube is supported only near the middle, or where the whole immediately or remotely depend on one narrow joint, are defective.\n\nReasoning in this way, we say with confidence, that of all the forms of a telescope apparatus, the old-fashioned simple stand represented in fig. 29, is by far the best, Fig. 29, and that others are superior according as the disposition of the points of support of the tube approaches to this. Let the pivots A, B, be fixed in the lintel and sole of a window. Let the four braces terminate very near to these pivots. Let the telescope lie on the pin F', resting on the shoulder round the eye-piece, while the far end of it rests on one of the pins 1, 2, 3, &c.; and let the distance of these pins from F' very little exceed the length of the telescope. The trembling of the axis, even when considerable, cannot affect the position of the tube, because the braces terminate almost at the pivots. The tremor of the brace CD does as little harm, because it is nearly perpendicular to the tube. And if the object-glass were close at the upper supporting pin, and the focus at the lower pin F', even the bending and trembling of the tube will have no effect on its optical axis. The instrument is only subject to horizontal tremors. These may be almost annihilated by having a slender rod coming from a hook's joint in the side of the window, and passing through such another joint close by the pin F'. We have seen an instrument of this form, having AB parallel to the earth's axis. The whole apparatus did not cost 50 threepence, and we find it not in the least sensible manner affected by a storm of wind. It was by observations with this instrument that the tables of the motions of the Georgium Sidus, published in the Edinburgh Transactions, were constructed, and they are as accurate as any that have yet appeared. This is an excellent equatorial.\n\nBut this apparatus is not portable, and it is sadly deficient in elegance. The following is the best method we have seen of combining these circumstances with the indispensable requisites of a good telescope.\n\nThe pillar VX (fig. 30.) rises from a firm stand, and Fig. 30. has a horizontal motion round a cone which completely fills it. This motion is regulated by a rack-work in the box at V. The screw of this rack-work is turned by means of the handle P, of a convenient length, and the screw may be disengaged by the click or detent V, when we would turn the instrument a great way at once. The telescope has a vertical motion round the joint Q placed near the middle of the tube. The lower end of the tube is supported by the stay OT. This consists of a tube RT, fastened to the pillar by a joint T, which allows the stay to move in a vertical plane. Within this tube slides another, with a stiff motion. This tube is connected with the telescope by another joint O, also admitting motion in a vertical plane. The side M of this inner tube is formed into a rack, in which works a pinion fixed to the top of the tube RT, and turned by the flat finger-piece R. The reader will readily see the advantages and the remaining defects of this apparatus. It is very portable, because the telescope is easily disengaged from it, and the legs and stay fold up. If the joint\nTelescope joint Q were immediately under A, it would be much freer from all tremor in the vertical plane. But nothing can hinder other tremors arising from the long pillar and the three springy legs. These communicate all external agitations with great vigour. The instrument should be set on a stone pedestal, or, what is better, a caulk filled with wet sand. This pedestal, which necessity perhaps suggested to our scientific navigators, is the best that can be imagined.\n\nFig. 31. is the stand usually given to reflecting telescopes. The vertical tube FBG is fastened to the tube by finger screws, which pass through the slits at F and G. This arch turns round a joint in the head of the divided pillar, and has its edge cut into an oblique rack, which is acted on by the horizontal screw, furnished with the finger-piece A. This screw turns in a horizontal square frame. This frame turns round a horizontal joint in the off-side, which cannot be seen in this view. In the side of this frame next the eye there is a finger-screw a, which passes through the frame, and presses on the round horizontal plate D. By forewing down this finger-screw, the frame is brought up, and presses the horizontal screw to the rack. Thus the elevation of the telescope is fixed, and may be nicely changed by the finger applied to A and turning this screw. The horizontal round plate D moves stiffly round another plate of nearly equal diameter. This under plate has a deep conical hollow socket, which is nicely fitted by grinding to a solid cone formed on the top of the great upright pillar, and they may be firmly fixed in any position by the finger-screw E. To the under plate is fastened a box e, containing a horizontal screw C, which always works in a rack cut in the edge of the upper plate, and cannot be disengaged from it. When a great vertical or horizontal motion is wanted, the screws a and E are slackened, and by tightening them the telescope may be fixed in any position, and then any small movements may be given it by the finger plates A and C.\n\nThis stand is very subject to brisk tremor, either from external agitation of the pedestal, or from the immediate action of the wind; and we have seldom been distinctly through telescopes mounted in this manner, till one end of the tube was pressed against something that was very fleety and unelastic. It is quite astonishing what a change this produces. We took a very fine telescope made by James Short, and laid the tube on a great lump of soft clay, pressing it firmly down into it. Several persons, ignorant of our purpose, looked through it, and read a table of logarithms at the distance of 310 yards. We then put the telescope on its stand, and pointed it at the same object; none of the company could read at a greater distance than 235 yards, although they could perceive no tremor. They thought the vision as sharp as before; but the incontrovertible proof of the contrary was, that they could not read at such a distance.\n\nIf the round plates were of much greater dimensions; and if the lower one, instead of being fixed to the pillar, were supported on four stout pillars standing on another plate; and if the vertical arch had a horizontal axis turning on two upright frames firmly fixed to the upper plate—the instrument would be much freer from tremor. Such stands were made formerly; but being much more bulky and inconvenient for package, they have gone into disuse.\n\nThe high magnifying powers of Dr Herschel's telescopes made all the usual apparatus for their support extremely imperfect. But his judgement, and his ingenuity and fertility in resource, are as eminent as his philosophical ardour. He has contrived for his reflecting telescopes stands which have every property that can be desired. The tubes are all supported at the two ends. The motions, both vertical and horizontal, are contrived with the utmost simplicity and firmness. We cannot more properly conclude this article than with a description of his 40 feet telescope, the noblest monument of philosophical zeal and of princely munificence that the world can boast of.\n\nFig. 32. represents a view of this instrument in a meridional situation, as it appears when seen from a convenient distance by a person placed to the south-west of it. The foundation in the ground consists of two concentric circular brick walls, the outermost of which is 42 feet in diameter, and the inside one 21 feet. They are two feet six inches deep under ground; two feet three inches broad at the bottom, and one foot two inches at the top; and are capped with paving stones about three inches thick, and twelve and three quarters broad. The bottom frame of the whole apparatus rests upon these two walls by twenty concentric rollers III, and is moveable upon a pivot, which gives a horizontal motion to the whole apparatus, as well as to the telescope.\n\nThe tube of the telescope, A, though very simple in its form, which is cylindrical, was attended with great difficulties in the construction. This is not to be wondered at; when its size, and the materials of which it is made, are considered. Its length is 39 feet four inches; it measures four feet ten inches in diameter; and every part of it is of iron. Upon a moderate computation, the weight of a wooden tube must have exceeded an iron one at least 3000 pounds; and its durability would have been far inferior to that of iron. It is made of rolled or sheet iron, which has been joined together without rivets, by a kind of framing well known to those who make iron funnels for stoves.\n\nVery great mechanical skill is used in the contrivance of the apparatus by which the telescope is supported and directed. In order to command every altitude, the point of support is moveable; and its motion is effected by mechanism, so that the telescope may be moved from its most backward point of support to the most forward, and, by means of the pulleys GG suspended from the great beam H, be set to any altitude, up to the very zenith. The tube is also made to rest with the point of support in a pivot, which permits it to be turned sidewise.\n\nThe concave face of the great mirror is 48 inches of polished surface in diameter. The thickness, which is equal in every part of it, remains now about three inches and a half; and its weight, when it came from the cast was 2118 pounds, of which it must have lost a small quantity in polishing. To put this speculum into the tube, it is suspended vertically by a crane in the laboratory, and placed on a small narrow carriage, which is drawn out, rolling upon planks, till it comes near the back of the tube; here it is again suspended.\nsuspended and placed in the tube by a peculiar apparatus.\n\nThe method of observing by this telescope is by what Dr Herchel calls the front view; the observer being placed in a seat C, suspended at the end of it, with his back towards the object he views. There is no small speculum, but the magnifiers are applied immediately to the first local image.\n\nFrom the opening of the telescope, near the place of the eye-glass, a speaking pipe runs down to the bottom of the tube, where it goes into a turning joint; and after several other inflections, it at length divides into two branches, one going into the observatory D, and the other into the work-room E. By means of the speaking pipe the communications of the observer are conveyed to the assistant in the observatory, and the workman is directed to perform the required motions.\n\nIn the observatory is placed a valuable fidele time-piece, made by Mr Shelton. Close to it, and of the same height, is a polar distance-piece, which has a dial-plate of the same dimensions with the time-piece: this piece may be made to show polar distance, zenith distance, declination or altitude, by setting it differently. The time and polar distance pieces are placed so that the assistants sit before them at a table, with the speaking-pipe rising between them; and in this manner observations may be written down very conveniently.\n\nThis noble instrument, with proper eye-glasses, magnifies above 6000 times, and is the largest that has ever been made. Such of our readers as wish for a fuller account of the machinery attached to it, viz. the stairs, ladders, and platform B, may have recourse to the second part of the Transactions of the Royal Society for 1795; in which, by means of 18 plates and 63 pages of letter-prefs, an ample detail is given of every circumstance relating to joiner's work, carpenter's work, and smith's work, which attended the formation and erection of this telescope. It was completed on August the 28th 1789, and on the same day was the fifth satellite of Saturn discovered.\n\nTELL, WILLIAM, an illustrious Swiss patriot, chief instrument of the revolution which delivered the Swiss cantons from the German yoke in 1307. Griller, the governor of these provinces for the emperor Albert, having ordered him, under pain of death, to throw at an apple placed on the head of one of his children; he had the dexterity, though the distance was very considerable, to strike it off without hitting the child. The tyrant, perceiving he had another arrow concealed under his cloak, asked him for what purpose? To which he boldly replied, \"To have shot you through the heart, if I had had the misfortune to kill my son.\" The enraged governor now ordered him to be hanged; but his fellow-citizens, animated by his fortitude and patriotism, flew to arms; attacked and vanquished Griller, who was shot to death by Tell; and the association for the independence took place that instant.\n\nTELL-Tale, a name sometimes given to the Perpetual Log. See that article.\n\nTELLER, an officer of the exchequer, in ancient records called tallier. There are four of these officers, whose duty is to receive all sums due to the king, and to give the clerk of the polls a bill to charge him therewith. They likewise pay all money due from the king, by warrant from the auditor of the receipt; and make weekly and yearly books both of their receipts and payments, which they deliver to the lord treasurer.\n\nTELLINA, a genus of shell-fish. See Conchology Index.\n\nTEMISSA, a large town in Africa, about 120 miles north-east of Mourzouk, the capital of Fezzan. Here the caravan of pilgrims from Bornou and Nigritia, which takes its departure from Mourzouk, and travels by the way of Cairo to Mecca, usually provides the stores of corn and dates, and dried meat, that are requisite for its dreary passage.\n\nTEMPE, in Ancient Geography, a most pleasant place or valley of Thebaly. That it was there, appears from the epithets Thesalica (Livy), Thesalia (Ovid); but in what particular district is the question. From the Phthiotica of Catullus, it should seem to be of Phthioti; but the Peneus, which ran through Tempe, was at too great a distance, being separated from it by Mount Othrys and others. First, however, we shall define Tempe, previous to the determining the particular district in which it lay. The Peneus, according to Pliny, running down between Offa to the south and Olympus to the north for 500 stadia, is for half that space navigable: in the direction of this course lies what is called Tempe, extending in length for five miles, in breadth for about an acre and a half, with gentle convexities rising on the right and left hand. Within glides the pure stream of the Peneus, charming in the grass on its banks, and harmoniously vocal with the music of birds. In this description Strabo and Ælian agree; the last adding, that it has an agreeable variety of places of retreat; and that it is not the work of man's hand, but the spontaneous production of nature; and Strabo says, that formerly the Peneus formed a lake in this spot, being checked in its course by the higher grounds about the sea; but that an opening being made by an earthquake, and Mount Offa torn from Olympus, the Peneus gained a free course between them. But Livy, who calls Tempe a grove, remarks a degree of horror rather than amenity, with which the Roman army was struck on marching over the narrow pass; for, besides the defile, difficult to go over, which runs on for five miles, there are steep rocks on each hand, down which the prospect is apt to cause a dizzying, heightened by the noise and depth of the interfluent Peneus. Hence it appears that Tempe was in the Pelagiotis, whose extremity was formerly the Peneus, but afterwards, as is probable, allotted to Magnesia; and thus Pliny places the mouth of the Peneus not in Thebaly itself, but in the Magnesia of Thebaly.\n\nTEMPER, in a mechanical sense. See Tempering.\n\nTemper, in a moral sense, the disposition of mind, whether natural or acquired. The word is seldom used by good writers without an epithet, as a good or bad temper; though one of the most beautiful poems in the language is entitled The Triumphs of Temper.\n\nIt is well observed by an elegant author, that more constant uneasiness arises from ill temper than from ill fortune; as a bad temper embitters every sweet, and converts a paradise into a place of torment. For subduing the heart to softness, and preserving a due balance of the passions, a proper culture of the understanding and of the taste is the best method. He who employs his\nhis time in the studies of elegant literature, or the fine arts, has almost always a good temper; whilst the man who is absorbed in the pursuits of profound science is apt to acquire a severity of disposition, little less disagreeable, though generally much less pernicious, than the capriciousness of the idler. Music, painting, and poetry, teach the mind to select the agreeable parts of those objects which surround us, and by habituating it to a pure and permanent delight, gradually superinduce an habitual good humour. It is of infinite importance to happiness to accustom the mind, from infancy, to turn from deformed and painful scenes, and to contemplate whatever can be found of moral and natural beauty.\n\nSo much of the happiness of private life depends on the government of the temper, that the temper ought to be a principal object of regard in a well-conducted education. The suffering of children to tyrannize without control over servants and inferiors, is the ruin of many an amiable disposition. The virtues of humanity, benevolence, humility, cannot be too early enforced; at the same time, care should be taken that an infant of two or three years old should never be beaten or spoken to harshly for any offence which it can possibly commit.\n\nTEMPERAMENT, among physicians, the same with constitution, or a certain disposition of the solids and fluids of the human body, by which it may be properly denominated strong, weak, lax, &c.\n\nIn every person there are appearances of a temperament peculiar to himself, though the ancients only took notice of four, and some have imagined these were deduced from the theories of the four humours or four cardinal qualities; but it is more probable that they were first founded on observation, and afterwards adapted to those theories, since we find that they have a real existence, and are capable of receiving an explanation. The two that are most distinctly marked are the sanguineous and melancholic, viz. the temperaments of youth and age.\n\n1. Sanguineous. Here there is laxity of solids, discoverable by the softness of hair and succulence; large system of arteries, redundancy of fluids, florid complexion; sensibility of the nervous power, especially to pleasing objects; irritability from the plethora; mobility and levity from lax solids. These characters are distinctly marked, and are proved by the diseases incident to this age, as haemorrhages, fevers, &c. but these, as they proceed from a lax system, are more easily cured.\n\n2. Melancholic Habit. Here greater rigidity of solids occurs, discoverable by the hardness and crispature of the hair; small proportion of the fluids, hence dryness and leanliness; small arteries, hence pale colour; venous plethora, hence turgescency of these, and liveliness; sensibility, frequently exquisite; moderate irritability, with remarkable tenacity of impressions; readiness in action and slowness of motion, with great strength; for excess of this constitution in mania gives the most extraordinary instance of human strength we know. This temperament is most distinctly marked in old age, and in males. The sanguineous temperament of youth makes us not differing with the melancholic till the decline of life, when it is very evident, from diseases of the veins, hemorrhoids, apoplexy, cachexy, obstructions of the viscera, particularly of the liver, dropsies, affections of the alimentary canal, chiefly from weaker influence of the nervous power. So much for the sanguineous and melancholic temperaments; the other two are not so easily explained. The choleric temperament takes place between youth and manhood.\n\n3. Choleric, the distribution of the fluids is more exactly balanced; there is less sensibility, and less obesity, with more irritability, proceeding from greater tension, less mobility and levity, and more steadiness in the strength of the nervous power. As to the\n\n4. Phlegmatic. This temperament cannot be distinguished by any characters of age or sex. It agrees with the sanguineous in laxity and succulence. It differs from that temperament, and the melancholic, by the more exact distribution of the fluids. Again, it differs from the sanguineous, by having less sensibility, irritability, mobility, and perhaps strength, though sometimes indeed this last is found to be great.\n\nThese are the ancient temperaments. The temperaments, indeed, are much more various; and very far from being easily marked and reduced to their genera and species, from the great variety which is observable in the constitutions of different men.\n\nTEMPERAMENT of the Musical Scale, is that modification of the sounds of a musical instrument, by which these sounds may be made to serve for different degrees of different scales. See MUSIC, Chap. VII.\n\nTemperament, though intimately connected with music, is not, properly speaking, a part of that science. The objects of music, as a science, are, to ascertain the laws of musical sound, as depending on the powers of the human voice. The purpose of temperament is, to regulate, in a way least adverse to these laws, a certain departure from them, rendered necessary by the imperfections of instruments.\n\nAlthough the temperament of the scale of instruments be practically familiar, the true principles on which it depends have been much disputed. Various opinions have been hazarded, and systems proposed. We offer an abridged view of that which appears to us to merit a preference (A).\n\nBefore consideration of the tempered scale, a short review of the nature of the true scale is necessary.\n\nFrom the conformation of the vocal organs, all nations, in fingering, make use of the same inflections of voice. These inflections, called notes, are said to be their pitch, grave or acute, in proportion to the degree of hoarseness or shrillness with which they are sung. The state of voice with respect to gravity or acuteness with which any one note is sung, is termed its pitch.\n\nTwo notes having the same pitch are termed unisons, Unions and or are said to be in unison to one another. The difference of pitch between any note and another is denominated an interval.\n\n(a) Amongst the very numerous authors on the subject of temperament, we have selected, for our chief guides, the late Dr Robert Smith of Cambridge, and Professor John Robison of Edinburgh.\nIn all attempts to sing, the ear, either unconsciously, or from the direction of recently hearing it, selects a particular note, from the previous impression of which the voice naturally forms other notes, at certain though unequal intervals. The note, thus selected, is termed the key note or fundamental. When chosen, it instantly assumes a particular and predominant character. The ear involuntarily refers to it the intonation of all other notes, readily recurrs to it during performance, and is dissatisfied unless the voice close upon it.\n\nWhere the finger has assumed a key note, and, after fingering that note, sings the note nearest in acuteness to it without forcing the voice, and so on, the series of notes, thus naturally formed, constitutes what is called the natural scale. The notes of it are termed its degrees; thus the key note is the first degree of the scale; the natural note next in acuteness to it, is named the second degree, or second of the scale, and so on.\n\nTwo untaught men, attempting to sing the same scale together, always sing in unison. But a man and a woman, making the same attempt, sing naturally in such a difference of pitch, although they proceed by the same intervals, that the eighth note only of the male voice ascending, is in unison with the key note of the female voice. Were the male voice to ascend to a ninth note, it would be in unison with the second of the female voice; the tenth note of the former would be in unison with the third of the latter, and so on.\n\nWe have thus two scales in succession, perfectly similar in the relation of the degrees of each to their respective key notes; but differing in pitch by the interval between these key notes.\n\nThis interval, comprehending seven smaller intervals and eight degrees, is, from this last circumstance, called an octave: and this term is also applied, somewhat inaccurately, to the series of the eight degrees. Thus we say, that the octave formed by the female voice is an octave acuter than that which is produced by the male voice; meaning, that the eight degrees sung by the\n\n| Graveft Male Octave. | Ordinary Male Octave. |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|\n| C * D * EF * G * A * BC * D * EF * G * A | B'c * d * e f * g * a * b * c * d * e f * g * a * b * c |\n\nIn this exhibition, the juxtaposition of the thirds and fourths, and of the sevenths and eightths or replicates of the first degree, indicates the semitonic intervals; and the asterisks represent the tonic intervals of the natural scale, or the artificial intercalary sounds, which, as we shall presently see, it becomes necessary to substitute in those intervals.\n\nWere all voices of the same compass, and were musical feelings satisfied with the natural scale, we might rest here. Being furnished with a key note adapted to all voices, and with instruments accurately tuned to that key note, it would be unnecessary to examine whether any other note of the natural scale could be assumed as the key note of a different scale, and if it could, whether any agreeable effect resulted from the discovery.\n\nBut the use of different scales, the key notes of which are derived from the different degrees of the natural scales, has been found not only to be one of the chief sources of the pleasure imparted by musical performances, but to be indispensably necessary, from the physical inequality of voices.\n\nThe central 'c' of the scale, called in music the tenor C, can be produced by every species of voice. The graveft male voices, termed bass, can form this note, but very few notes above it. The treble, or acuter female voice also produces it, but seldom descends farther. The acuter male voices, called tenor, have this 'c' scarcely above the middle of their compass, and it is not much below the middle of that of the counter-tenor or graveft female voices. Now it is obvious that an air in the natural scale, which should rise above 'c', and fall below it in the same proportions, might be sung by the tenor or counter-tenor voice, but would be too acute for the bass voice, and too grave for the treble. Either of these voices, in order to execute the same air, must assume a different key note from 'c'; and as all the\nthe degrees of the scale are regulated by the key note, the air must of course be executed in a scale different from that of 'c'.\n\nAgain, suppose a finger who can sing a given air only in the scale of B, to be accompanied by an instrument tuned in the scale of 'c'. Should the lyrist begin on his own key note, he is a semitone above the key note of the finger; and should he begin on the note which is in unison with the finger's key note, the next degree is wrong, being but a semitonic interval by the instrument, and a tonic interval by the voice. In short, all the degrees but one will be found wrong. This is an evident consequence of the inequality of the semitonic to the tonic intervals; and if the tonic intervals, which we presume to be equal, be not exactly so, the discordance will be still greater.\n\nThe remedy for this is apparently obvious. If the semitonic intervals are each equal to half of any of the tonic intervals, we need only to interpose other sounds between each two of the degrees which form the tonic intervals; and then, in place of eight degrees and seven unequal intervals, we shall have twelve degrees and twelve equal intervals, each of them equal to a semitone. An instrument thus furnished, appears to be adapted to any voice, and to resemble the modern harpsichord or organ, which have twelve seemingly equal intervals in the octave. Such were the practical resources of the Greek musicians, sanctioned by the approbation of Aristothenes, and of all those who were satisfied with the decision of the ear alone.\n\nBut philosophers and mathematicians ascertained the existence of a certain connexion between musical intervals and mathematical proportions, and gradually opened the way to the discovery that the relations of the musical scale, as naturally formed by the human voice, depend on principles equally plain and certain with the simplest geometrical propositions.\n\nPythagoras is said to have discovered, that if two musical chords be in equal tension, and if one of them be half the length of the other, the short one will sound an octave above the long one; if one third shorter, it will produce the fifth; if one fourth shorter, it will give the fourth. Thus the relation of the key to its octave was discovered to correspond to the ratio of 2 : 1; that of the key to its fifth to be in the ratio of 3 : 2; and that of the key to its fourth to be in the ratio of 4 : 3.\n\nFor instance, if a chord of a given size and tension, and 12 inches long, produce 'c', another of the same size and tension, but only six inches long, will give the octave 'c'; one eight inches long will sound the fifth 'g'; and one nine inches long will produce the fourth 'f'.\n\nNow as the string of eight inches giving the fifth, and that of six inches producing the octave, are in the ratio of 4 : 3, which is that of the fourth; it follows, that the interval between the fifth and octave is a fourth; and as the chord of nine inches producing the fourth, and the octave of six inches, are in the ratio of 3 : 2, the interval between the fourth and octave must be a fifth. Thus the octave 'c' is divided into a fifth 'c g', and a fourth 'g c', or into a fourth 'c f', and a fifth 'f c', both in succession. The two fourths 'c f', and 'g c', leave an interval 'f g', corresponding, as we have seen, to the ratio of 9 : 8.\n\nWe have thus the ratios of the octave, of the fifth, and of the fourth; and it does not appear that the ancient theorists proceeded farther. They seem to have preferred the harmony of fourths and fifths to that of thirds and sixths, so essential in modern harmony. By pursuing the system of the mathematical ratios, we find that 5 : 4 gives the major third 'c e'. And the fifth 'g' being already determined by the ratio 3 : 2, we ascertain the ratio of the minor third 'e g' to be 6 : 5, which is the difference between 3 : 2 and 5 : 4. In the same way, the ratio of the third 'e' being 5 : 4, and that of the fourth 'f' being 4 : 3, we ascertain the ratio of the semitone 'e f' to be 16 : 15, or 4 : 3 = 5 : 4.\n\nA note in the ratio of 5 : 4, or that of a major third to 'f', gives 'a', the major sixth of the natural scale; and a note in the same ratio of 5 : 4 to 'g' produces 'b', the major seventh of that scale. The ratios of 'g a' will then be 1 : 9, and that of 'a b' 9 : 8, the same with that of 'f g'; and that of 'b c' will thus be 16 : 15 like 'e f'.\n\nWe have in this way the mathematical ratios of all the degrees of the natural scale except that of the second 'd'. Considering however, the second to be a perfect fourth graver than the fifth, and having ascertained the fifth 'g' to be a perfect fourth below 'c', as 2 : 1 is to 3 : 2, to 3 : 2 gives 9 : 8, which we take for the ratio of the second.\n\nThus have been formed two distinct systems of interpretation of the natural scale; that of mean tones and semitones, founded on the rules of Aristoxenus, and the practice of ancient artists, and that of the ratios, deduced from the discoveries of Pythagoras, and the calculations of mathematicians.\n\nThe difference between the Aristoxenean system of mean tones and semitones, and the Pythagorean system of mathematical ratios, will best appear from the following construction. Let the circumference of a circle (fig. 1.) be divided by dotted lines (according to the principles of Aristoxenus) into five larger and equal intervals, and two smaller intervals also equal. Let it also be divided by full lines into portions determined by means of the musical ratios. Thus let the arches CD, FG, and AB be proportional to the logarithm of 9 : 8, GA and DE to those of 10 : 9, and EF and BC to those of 16 : 15 (B). Let us divide another circle in the same manner; but instead of having its points of division marked C, D, &c., let them be marked 'key' 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th. This circle, which may be described on a piece of card, is to be placed on the other, and is to move round their common centre.\n\nIn whatever point of the outer circle the point 'key' of the inner one be placed, it is obvious that the other natural points of the outer circle will show what degrees of it, by corresponding with the other points 2d, 3d, &c., of composition of the inner circle, will serve for degrees of the scale determined by the point 'key.' By this we see clearly the insufficiency of the degrees of the natural scale, for the performance of compositions in different scales, and M.m 2\n\n(B) We may make CD = 61°, 72°; CE = 155°, 9°; CE = 149°, 42°; CG = 210°, 58°; CA = 265°, 3°; and CB = 326°, 48°.\nBut although the errors of the Aristoxeneans were demonstrated by the certainty of the ratios, and although the dependence of musical intervals on the latter be said to have been known since the days of Pythagoras, the nature of that relation remained unknown for ages. Galileo discovered that the ratios express the frequency of the aerial undulation, by which the several sounds are generated. He demonstrated that the vibrations of two chords, of the same matter and thickness, and of equal tension, will be in the ratio of their lengths, and that the number of oscillations made in a given time will be inversely as their lengths. The frequency of the sonorous undulations of the air is therefore inversely as the length of the string. Thus \\(2:1\\) being the ratio of the octave, the undulations which produce the acuter sound are twice as frequent as those which generate the graver. The ratio of the fifth, \\(3:2\\), indicates that in the same time that the ear receives three undulations from the upper sound, it receives only two from the lower. This is not peculiar to sounds produced by the vibration of strings; those produced from the vibration of bells, and from the undulation of the air in pipes, are regulated by the same law.\n\nThus, it is demonstrated that the pitch of musical sound is determined by the undulations of the air; and that a certain frequency of undulations produces a certain and unalterable musical note. It has been found that any noise whatever, if repeated 240 times in a second, at equal intervals, produces the tenor 'c'; if 360 times, the 'g', or fifth above. It had been imagined that musical sound was only to be produced by those regular undulations, which are occasioned by the vibrations of elastic bodies. We are assured that the same effect will be produced by any noise, if repeated not less than 30 or 40 times in a second; and that the experiment has been tried with a quill snapping against the teeth of a wheel.\n\nBy Galileo's discovery, the principles on which the just intonation of the natural scale depends, are shown to be certain and plain. To proceed in our search of an exact measure of temperament of this perfect intonation, we must consider the nature and effects of consonant and dissonant chords.\n\nA chord is a combination of two or more simultaneous musical sounds. If the coincidence be so complete that the compound sounds cannot be distinguished, the chord is said to be consonant; if the separate sounds are distinctly heard, the chord is termed dissonant.\n\nAll consonances are pleasing, although some are more so than others. All dissonances are unsatisfactory, and some are very harsh.\n\nIn consonances, no inequality of sound is perceptible. In dissonances, the ear is sensible of an alternate increase and diminution of the strength of the sound, without variation of pitch. This is occasioned by the alternate coincidence and biflection of the vibrations of the component sounds. For example, suppose two perfect unisons produced from two pipes each 24 inches long. Each sound has 240 vibrations in a second, either exactly coincident, or exactly alternate. In either case, the vibrations are so frequent and uniform as not to be distinguishable, and the whole appears one sound. But let one of the pipes be only 23 inches and seven-tenths long, it will give 243 vibrations in a second. Therefore the 1st, the 8th, the 16th, and the 24th vibration of the longer pipe, will coincide with the 1st, the 8th, the 16th, and the 24th of the shorter. In the instant of coincidence, the aerial agitation produced by the one vibration is reinforced by that produced by the other. The deviations from coincidence gradually increase till the 40th vibration of the longer pipe, which will commence in the middle of the 41st vibration of the shorter one. The vibrations here biflecting each other, the aerial agitations of both will be weakened. The compounded sound will consequently be stronger at the coincidences and weaker at the biflections of the vibrations. The increase of strength, which is termed the beat, will recur thrice in every second. Thus the vibrations are in the ratio of 80:81, or of a comma; and the compounded sound now supposed is an unison imperfect by a comma.\n\nIf a third pipe, tuned a perfect fifth to the longer of the two former, be founded at the same time with the shorter, the dissonance will beat nine times in a second; and is thus shown to be a fifth imperfect by a comma.\n\nThe perfection or imperfection of any consonance may thus be ascertained with equal facility and precision: and by this method, any perfect consonance may be altered to any acquired state of temperament.\n\nThe theory of beats is therefore valuable, as giving us the management of a phenomenon intimately connected with perfect harmony, as affording us precise and practicable measures of all deviations from it, and as sure of thus forming the basis of the most accurate system of temperament.\n\nFor the preparatory process of determining the exact degrees of the scale, let us attend to the following ingenious and amusing experiment.\n\nLet two harpsichord wires be exactly tuned in unison fundamental at the pitch of the tenor 'c,' to be acted on simultaneously experimentally by a wheel rubbed with rosin, like that of a violoncello. Let a scale of 240 equal parts be described under one of the strings, equal in length to the sounding part of it, and numbered from the end at which the wheel is applied. Let a moveable bridge be placed under this string, but so as not to alter the tension of it in the least.\n\nThe two open strings being in perfect unison, without any beating whatever, let the moveable bridge be advanced slowly from the nut, while the wheel is applied to both strings. All kinds of chords, consonant and dissonant, will of course be successively heard. Between the consonances there will be a beating, which will increase as we approach the consonance, cease on our reaching it, appear again as we leave it, diminish as we recede from it, and again increase as we approach to the succeeding consonance.\n\nAfter this general view, let us more particularly examine the several degrees of the scale.\n\nOn placing the moveable bridge at 120, we shall hear a perfect octave, without any beating. If the division of the violin be not quite exact, there will be a little beating; but by shifting the bridge very gently to either side, the increase or diminution of the beating will guide us to the true place, where it will entirely cease.\n\nOn placing the bridge at 160, the perfect concord of the perfect fifth.\nthe key and fifth will be heard. Any alteration of the bridge to either side will produce a disagreeable beating.\n\nA rapid flutter in the vicinity of 180 will cease at that point, and give place to the consonance of the key and fourth.\n\nOn approaching 192, an angry walsfish beating is succeeded at that point by the animating concord of the key and major third.\n\nAs we leave 192, the beating assumes a melancholy character, and ceases at 200, the place of the plaintive consonance of the key and minor third.\n\nBetween that point and the nut, we have only a succession of discords. As we were at a loss to ascertain the mathematical ratio of the second of the scale (art. 19), so we have some difficulty in determining its just place by the theory of beats, and the experiment under consideration. We are uncertain whether we shall fix it at a minor tone, or at a major tone above the key. Both form a harsh dissonance with the key. The major tone, however, is thought less disagreeable: it admits of five more concords in the octave than the minor; and the ratio of it \\(9:8\\) is that suggested by the similarity of its interval with the fifth, to the interval of the fifth and octave (art. 19). On these accounts we prefer it; and its place in the division under our precise consideration is \\(2^{13}\\).\n\nLet the bridge now be placed near, and slowly moved to 150: the beating subsides into a consonance, slightly pleasing, that of the key and minor sixth.\n\nAt 144, we have the agreeable concord of the key and major sixth. From 144 to 120 we hear nothing but discord.\n\nIn this interval, however, we have to find the place of the sensible note or major seventh. The ear informs us, that the interval between the major seventh and the octave, must be similar to that between the major third and the fourth. Applying to the former interval the ratio of the latter, that of \\(16:15\\), we place the moveable bridge at 128; for as 15 is to 16, so 120 gives 128. We also feel, that the interval between the fifth and major seventh is exactly similar to that between the key and major third, of which the ratio is \\(5:4\\). Now, applying the same ratio to 160, the place of the fifth,\n\nwe find \\(5:4::160:128\\). We thus determine 128 to be the place of the major seventh of the scale.\n\nThe interval or difference between the minor tone \\(10:9\\), and the major tone \\(9:8\\), is \\(81:80\\), termed Ratios of comma. This interval is not employed in practical music, but must be distinctly understood by theorists, and tervals, particularly in treating of temperament.\n\nThere are therefore four descriptions of simple intervals; that is, intervals which do not include more than a major tone. These are, comma, of which the ratio is \\(81:80\\); hemitone, or \\(16:15\\); minor tone, or \\(10:9\\); and major tone, or \\(9:8\\) (c).\n\nWe have now to consider how far the perfect intonation of the natural scale must be departed from in keyed instruments, such as the organ and harpsichord; so that the same sound may serve for different degrees of different instruments.\n\nThese instruments have twelve sounds in every octave; that is, they have the eight natural degrees and four intercalary sounds, viz. between C and D, D and E, F and G, G and A, and A and B.\n\nThe purpose of these intercalary sounds is, that an air may be performed in any pitch; that is, that any sound may be taken for a key note, and that other sounds may be found to form the scale of that key note, at intervals corresponding to those of the natural scale.\n\nThus, instead of C, the key note of the natural scale, we take B for the key note required; A, which is the seventh to B, will by no means answer for the seventh of the affumed scale; for the interval between A and B is a major tone, of which the ratio is \\(9:8\\), whereas the interval between the seventh of the scale and the octave, can only be a hemitone, the ratio of which is \\(16:15\\). We must therefore employ the intercalary found between A and B, which in this employment we call A\\#, or A sharp. But we shall presently see that we cannot tune even this found in the ratio of \\(16:15\\) with B. For, let us take F for the key note of another scale, we find that B will not serve for the fourth of that scale, being a major tone above A the third; whereas the fourth of the scale is only a hemitone above the third. We must therefore have recourse to our intercalary found between A and B, which\n\n(c) The logarithmic measures of these intervals, and of the compound intervals determined in the way which we have described, are\n\n| Interval       | Logarithmic Measure |\n|----------------|---------------------|\n| Comma          | -                   |\n| Hemitone       | -                   |\n| Minor tone     | -                   |\n| Major tone     | -                   |\n| Minor third    | -                   |\n| Major third    | -                   |\n| Fourth         | -                   |\n| Fifth          | -                   |\n| Minor sixth    | -                   |\n| Major sixth    | -                   |\n| Seventh        | -                   |\n| Octave         | -                   |\n\nThe octave being thus divided into 3010 equal parts, a circle of which the circumference is divided into 301 degrees, and a concentric moveable circle having a nonius subdividing each into ten parts, will form a convenient instrument for examining all temperaments of the scale.\nTemperament which we must here call Bb, or B flat, and which ought in this state to be tuned a hemitone above A, or in the ratio of 16 : 15 with that note. Now, this intercalary sound cannot be both in the ratio of 16 : 15 with A, and in the same ratio of 16 : 15 with B. This would extend the whole interval between A and B, to the ratio of about 8 : 7; whereas it should only be in that of 9 : 8. We must therefore tune the intercalary sound in such a diminished relation to A and to B, that it may serve either for A ♯ or B ♭.\n\nBut, even independent of these intercalary notes, some temperament of the natural scale is necessary.\n\nLet the four fifths, 'c g', 'g' d', 'd' a', and 'a e', be tuned all perfect. Then tune the two perfect octaves from 'e' downwards, 'c e', 'e' e': The major third 'c e', resulting from this process, will be too sharp by a comma, or 81 : 80, and will beat 15 times in a second. The minor third 'e g', and the major fifth 'c a', will be still more discordant.\n\nIt is therefore impossible to have perfect fifths, and at the same time perfect thirds and sixths. Now, although a perfect fifth, occasionally employed, be pleasing, yet the ear does not relish a succession of perfect fifths; such a succession not only renders the harmony languid, but creates a doubt as to the key, which is unsatisfactory. On the other hand, an alternate succession of major and minor thirds and sixths constitutes the chief and most brilliant part of our harmonies. We therefore find it necessary to sacrifice somewhat of the perfect harmony of the fifths to that of the third and sixths.\n\nIt is this accommodation which is properly called Temperament; and to this system of it, by which the fifths are diminished, and the thirds and sixths preserved perfect, we give the preference.\n\nWe have just seen that four consecutive perfect fifths compose an interval, greater, by a comma, than two octaves and a major third. But in the tuning of our instruments requiring temperament, these intervals must be rendered equal. Because, as we have seven hemitonic intervals in the fifth, twelve in the octave, and four in the major third; so the interval of four-fifths contains twenty-eight hemitonic intervals, and that of two octaves and major third contain also twenty-eight, being twenty-four for the two octaves, and four for the major third. The real difference being, however, a comma, it is plain, that if we keep the major thirds perfect, we must diminish or flatten each of the four-fifths one-fourth of a comma.\n\nIt is not easy to ascertain with perfect exactness the quarter comma by which the first fifth 'c g' is to be diminished. We shall, however, be sufficiently accurate for practical purposes if we flatten 'g' till a beating of 9 beats in four seconds is produced (p).\n\nHaving in this manner tuned 'g', we diminish the next fifth 'g' d', one-fourth of a comma, by flattening d till 'g' d' beat half as fast again as 'c g', or 13½ beats in four seconds (E).\n\nThe next fifth, d a, must be diminished in the same proportion by flattening a till 'd a' beat 15 times in six seconds.\n\nInstead of tuning upward the fifth a e, tune downward (x) the octave a a', and then tune upward the fifth a e, and flatten it till it beat 15 times in eight seconds.\n\nIf we take 15 seconds for the common period of all these beats, we shall find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{The beats of } 'c g' &= 34 \\\\\nG' d' &= 25 \\\\\n'd a' &= 37 \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n'a e' &= 28\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nOn tuning downwards the octave e e' we have the major third 'c e' perfect without any beating; and we proceed, tuning upwards a fifth flattened by one-fourth of a comma, and when the beating becomes too quick, tuning downward an octave. We may do this till we reach 'b' ♯, which should be the same with c, a perfect octave above 'c'.\n\nIt will be better, however, to flop at 'g' ♯, and then to tune fifths downward from 'c' and octaves upwards, when we get too low. Thus we have 'c' F, F 'f', 'f' B ♭,\n\n(d) If any concord, whose perfect ratio is \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) (m being the greatest term of the smallest integers expressing that ratio), be tempered sharp by the fraction \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\) of a comma, and if M and N be the pulses made by the acute and grave notes of the concord during any number of seconds, the number b of beats made in the same time by this concord will be \\( \\frac{2 q m N}{161 p + q} \\), or \\( \\frac{2 q n M}{161 p + q} \\); and if it be tempered flat, then, \\( b = \\frac{2 q m N}{161 p - q} \\), or \\( \\frac{2 q n M}{161 p - q} \\). (Smith's Harm. 2d edit. p. 82, &c.)\n\nNow, let \\( \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{3}{2} \\), the ratio of the fifth; \\( q = 1, p = 4 \\); therefore, \\( \\frac{p}{q} = \\) one-fourth of a comma, and N = 'c' or 240 pulses in a second. Therefore, \\( \\frac{2 q m N}{161 p + q} = \\frac{2 \\times 3 \\times 240}{161 \\times 4 + 5} = \\frac{1440}{645} = 2.25 \\) beats in four seconds very nearly.\n\n(e) Because fifths, being in the ratio to each other of 3 : 2, N in this fifth = 360.\n\n(f) The grave octaves of the upper terms of each of these tempered fifths may be determined with perfect accuracy, by making the grave octave beat with the lower term of the tempered fifth as often as the upper term does with it; for instance, by making G 'c' beat as often as 'c g', &c. For, it has been demonstrated by Dr Smith, that the upper term of a minor concord beats equally with the lower term, and with the acuter octave of that term; but that the upper term of a major concord beats twice as fast with the acuter octave of the lower term, as it does with the lower term itself. Therefore, as 'g' beats twice as fast with 'c' as with 'c g', and is with its grave octave G in the ratio of 2 : 1, G 'c' beats precisely as often as 'c g'.\nThe process of temperament thus recommended, will be greatly facilitated by employing a pendulum made of a ball of about two ounces weight, sliding on a light deal rod, having at one end a small ring. Let this pendulum be hung by the ring on a peg, and the ball adjusted so as to make 20 vibrations in 15 seconds. This done, mark the rod at the upper edge of the ball, and adjust it in the same manner for 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48 vibrations. Then having calculated the beats of the different fifths, set the ball at the corresponding mark, and temper the sound till the beats keep pace exactly with the pendulum.\n\nIn order to discover, should it be necessary, the number of pulses made in a second by the tuning fork, by which we tune the tenor 'c' of our instrument, let a wire be stretched by a weight till it be unison or octave below the fork; let \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\)th then be added to the weight. Being thus tempered by a comma, the contemporaneous founding of the fork and wire will produce a beating; and on multiplying the beats by 80, the product gives the number of pulses of the fork, and consequently of the 'c' of the instrument tuned from it. But the common 'c' tuning forks are so nearly consonant to 240 pulses, that this process is scarcely necessary.\n\nOn the system of temperament now proposed, Dr Smith makes the following useful observation and deduction.\n\nThe octave consisting of five mean tones and two limmas, it is obvious that by enlarging the tones we diminish the limmas, and that the increment of the tone is two-fifths of the contemporaneous diminution of the limma. Let \\( v \\) represent any minute variation of this temperament; the increment of a mean tone is \\( 2v \\), and the contemporaneous diminution of the limma \\( -5v \\). Again, if the tone be diminished by \\( -2v \\), the limma will increase by \\( -5v \\).\n\nLet us observe the variations of the intervals in the latter case.\n\nThe perfect fifth consisting of three tones and a limma, its variation will be \\( -6v + 5v \\), or \\( -v \\). That is, the fifth is flattened by the quantity \\( v \\). Consequently the fourth is sharpened by that quantity.\n\nThe second, being a tone above the key note, and being therefore flattened by \\( -2v \\), the minor seventh is increased by \\( 2v \\).\n\nThe minor third consisting of a tone and a limma, its variation is \\( -2v + 5v \\) or \\( 3v \\). Accordingly, that of the major sixth is \\( -3v \\).\n\nThe major third, or two tones, is therefore diminished by \\( -4v \\). Consequently the minor sixth is increased by \\( 4v \\).\n\nThe major seventh, being the inversion of the limma is therefore varied by \\( -5v \\).\n\nThe tritone being diminished \\( -6v \\), the false fifth is accordingly \\( 6v \\).\n\nOn this observation, Dr Smith has founded the following geometrical construction: Divide the straight line CE (fig. 2.) into five equal parts Cg, g'd', d'a, aE, E'b, b't, and intersect the points of division with the six parallel lines gG, d'D, &c., representing the intervals arranged according to the system of mean tones and limmas.\n\nLet any length gG, on the first line to the right of the line CE, represent a quarter of a comma, G will thus mark the place of the perfect fifth, and g that of the tempered fifth, flattened by a comma.\n\nTake dD, double of gG, on the second parallel also on the right hand; D will mark the place of the perfect second, and d that of the tempered second, flattened by the half comma dD.\n\nBy setting off aA on the third parallel to the left, equal to gG, we have A' the perfect major fifth, and a the transferred major fifth, sharpened by the quarter comma Aa.\n\nThe major third being in the system of mean tones kept perfect, the place of that degree will be e.\n\nBy taking bB on the fifth line, on the right, equal to gG, we find B to be the place of the perfect major seventh, and b to be that of the tempered major seventh flattened by the quarter comma bB.\n\nAnd by making tT on the sixth line, to the right, equal to dD, we have the contemporaneous temperament of the tritone flattened by the half comma tT, and of the false fifth, sharpened by that quantity.\n\nAny other straight line Cc drawn from C, across these parallels, will represent, by the intervals g'G, d'D, &c., the temperaments of another system of mean tones and limmas. Since it is plain that the simultaneous variations g'g', d'd', &c., from the former temperament, are in the just proportions to each other. The straight line thus employed, (Cc', or Cc''), has therefore been termed the temperer.\n\nAs the arrangement of the sounds of keyed instruments having only twelve keys for an octave, and meant to be used in different scales, must approach nearly to a system of mean tones, or rather mean limmas, this construction of Dr Smith's is very useful. The temperer points out, not only all the temperaments of the notes with the key note, but also the temperaments of the harmonic concords. Thus it will be seen, that the temperament of the minor third forming the interval between the major third and fifth, is in all cases the same with that of the major sixth and octave, and that the temperament of the major third, forming the interval between the fourth and major sixth, is equal to that of the key and major third of the scale.\n\nIt has been proposed, in order to render Dr Smith's construction still more useful, that it should be drawn of such a size as to admit of the following supplementary scales.\n\n1. A scale of gG divided into thirteen parts and a half, expressing the logarithmic measures of the temperaments mentioned in the note (c), a comma being \\( = \\frac{54}{3} \\).\n\n2. A scale of gG divided into thirty parts, giving the beats made in 16 seconds by the notes c, g, when tempered by any quantity Gg'.\nthe alterations between the fifths and major thirds, flattening the fifths and sharpening the major thirds, and making both beat equally fast along with the key; and since enlarging the fifth increases the tone, and consequently diminishes the limina, the intercalary sounds become thus better suited for their double service of the sharp of the note below, and the flat of the note above. Much, however, is lost in the brilliancy of the major thirds, which are the most effective concords. The fifths are not much improved, and the sixths are evidently hurt by this temperament (H).\n\nThese methods of tuning by beats are incomparably more exact than by the ear. We cannot mistake above one beat, that is, in the fifth third, and in the major third, of a comma.\n\nWe have offered a short view of what appears to us to be the preferable system of temperament. It has been deduced from the observations of the most able theorists, and will greatly assist a tuner; but to him there are farther necessary, as to a musical performer, a correct ear, patient attention, and long practice.\n\nTEMPERANCE, that virtue which a man is said to possess who moderates and restrains his sensual appetites. It is often, however, used in a much more general sense, as synonymous with moderation, and is then applied indiscriminately to all the passions.\n\nTemperance (says Mr Nelson) is the virtue that bridles our irregular desires; it is nearly allied to prudence, and has a close connection with justice; it calms revenge, and quenches the fire of unjust resentment; it checks the epicure, and stops the riotous hand of the Bacchanalian; it extinguishes or abates the flames of lust, and banishes every lawless action; it silences the flippant detracting tongue, and gives in its stead a pleasing moderation of speech; it thus the door against avarice, and proves experimentally, that happiness does not consist in the eager pursuit or acquisition of riches, but in a contented mind; it curbs the strongest of all other passions, gaming, and distinguishes justly the absurdity and folly of making that a dangerous trade, which was only designed as a relaxation and an amusement: temperance, in a word, is the parent of many virtues; the parent of peace, prosperity, health, and joy.\n\nNothing can be more strange to all observation than the practice of forsaking temperance; since every day's experience proves to us, that intemperance produces the opposite to what we seek. Suppose, when a child is born, we ask the parents what it is they wish in that child; they will answer, life. But as life alone, that is, mere existence, may, by infirmity or other accidents, be very wretched, they will naturally wish for health and happiness. Well then, life, health, and happiness, are the general wishes of parents for their children. Now let us see how their wishes are likely to succeed. Their first step is usually a shameful neglect of the food of nature, the breast; the next, a blind gratification of their will; the third, an almost total neglect of their manners; and a fourth, the cherishing them in every irregular affection. Where then is the wonder that parents are disappointed? Life and health depend on proper food and other judicious management on one part; and if sick, an obedience to remedies on the other part; and happiness essentially depends in the first place on health; in the next, on the due government of our senses, affections, and passions. See here how much mankind deviate from themselves; how far they depart from their own\n\n3. A scale of g G divided into 60 parts, for the beats of the major third C e.\n4.

But what is the remedy? Nothing more obvious. Let parents exercise their reason in all the steps they take for their children's welfare; let them examine right and wrong; let them not only avoid passion, but labour to correct their own errors of judgment, that they may be the better enabled to prevent them in their children; but, particularly, let them fix in them the knowledge, love, and habit, of temperance.\n\nTEMPERING, in the mechanic arts, the preparing of steel and iron, so as to render them more compact, hard, and firm; or even more soft and pliant, according to their respective occasions.\n\nTEMPLARS, Templars, or Knights of the Temple, a religious order instituted at Jerusalem in the beginning of the 12th century, for the defence of the holy sepulchre and the protection of Christian pilgrims. They were first called The poor of the Holy City, and afterwards assumed the appellation of Templars, because their house was near the temple. The order was founded by Baldwin II., then king of Jerusalem, with the concurrence of the pope; and the principal articles of their rule were: That they should hear the holy office throughout every day; or that, when their military duties should prevent this, they should supply it by a certain number of pater noster; that they should abstain from flesh four days in the week, and on Fridays from eggs and milk-meats: that each knight might have three horses, and one esquire: and that they should neither hunt nor fowl. After the ruin of the kingdom of Jerusalem about 1186, they spread themselves through Germany and other countries of Europe, to which they were invited by the liberality of the Christians. In the year 1228, this order acquired stability, by being confirmed in the council of Troyes, and subjected to a rule of discipline drawn up by St Bernard. In every nation they had a particular governor, called master of the Temple, or of the militia of the Temple. Their grand-master had his residence at Paris.\n\nThe order of Templars flourished for some time, and acquired, by the valour of its knights, immense riches and an eminent degree of military renown: but as their prosperity increased, their vices were multiplied, and their arrogance, luxury, and cruelty rose at last to such a monstrous height, that their privileges were revoked, and their order suppressed with the most terrible circumstances of infamy and severity. Their accusers were two of their own body, and their chief prosecutor Philip the Fair of France, who addressed his complaints to Clement V. The pope, though at first unwilling to proceed against them, was under a necessity of complying with the king's desire; so that, in the year 1307, upon an appointed day, and for some time afterwards, all the knights, who were dispersed throughout Europe, were seized and imprisoned, and many of them, after trials for capital crimes, were convicted and put to death. In 1312 the whole order was suppressed by the council of Vienne. A part of the rich revenues they possessed was bestowed upon other orders, especially on the knights of St John, now of Malta, and the rest confiscated to the respective treasuries of the sovereign princes in whose dominions their possessions lay.—The knights Templars, in order to justify the severity with which they were treated, were charged with apostasy to the Saracens, and holding correspondence with them, with insulting the majesty of God, turning into derision the gospel of Templars, Christ, and trampling upon the obligation of all laws human and divine. Candidates, it is said, upon admission to this order, were commanded to spit, in token of contempt, upon an image of Christ, and after admission to worship either a cat or a wooden head crowned with gold. It is farther affirmed, that, among them, the odious and unnatural act of sodomy was a matter of obligation; and they are charged with other crimes too horrible to be mentioned, or even imagined. However, though there be reason to believe, that in this order, as well as others of the same period, there were shocking examples of impiety and profligacy; yet that the whole order was thus enormously corrupt, there is no reason to believe. The pope indeed, though he acted with severity, acted with justice. He sent two cardinals to Paris, who, publishing his bull against the order, condemned those Templars who had made the voluntary confession to be burnt by a slow fire. The criminals recanted their former confessions, but acknowledged themselves worthy of death, because they had unjustly accused the order of crimes of which they were innocent. Several authors of those times wrote in defence of the order; and Boccace alleges, that its extirpation was owing to the avarice of the king of France, who coveted the rich possessions the Templars then enjoyed in France.\n\nThe king of Arragon was much pressed to treat the Templars in his kingdom as they had been treated in France; but his constant answer was, \"We must be first convinced of their guilt, and it will be then time enough to talk of their punishment.\" The people, however, were in general so provoked against them, that they were compelled to shut themselves up in the fortresses belonging to their order, to prevent their being torn in pieces; which precaution was represented to the king of Arragon as an act of rebellion. He marched, therefore, with a corps of troops against one of these fortresses. The knight who commanded surrendered immediately, and told the king the truth, affirring him that they desired nothing but a fair trial; with which declaration the king was extremely moved, took the whole order into his protection, and forbade any to abuse or insult them under the heaviest penalties. At the same time he declared he was ready to receive any informations against them that were supported by proofs; but if the informers failed therein, he would punish them as they deserved.\n\nThese facts plead strongly for the innocence of the Templars, or at least they prove that their guilt must have been exaggerated; and if we add, that many of the accusations advanced against them flatly contradict each other, and that many members of this unfortunate order solemnly avowed their innocence while languishing under the severest tortures, and even with their dying breath—it would seem probable, that King Phillip set on foot this bloody tragedy, with a view to gratify his avarice, and glut his resentment against the Templars, and especially against their grand-master, who had highly offended him. The principal cause of his invincible hatred against them was, that in his quarrel with Boniface VIII., the knights espoused the cause of the pope, and furnished him with money to carry on the war. They originally wore a white habit, with red crosses sewed upon their cloaks as a mark of distinction.\n\nTEMPLE, Sir William, was born in London in\nthe year 1628. The family from which he sprung was ancient, and is said to have assumed the surname of Temple from the manor of Temple, in the hundred of Sparke-Hall, in Leicestershire. He was first sent to school at Penshurst, in Kent, under the care of his uncle, the celebrated Dr Hammond, then minister of that parish; but at the age of ten he was removed thence to a school at Bishop-Stortford, in Hertfordshire. When he had acquired a sufficient knowledge of the Greek and Latin, he returned home at the age of fifteen; and, two years after, he went to Cambridge, where he was placed under the tuition of the learned Dr Cudworth, then fellow of Emmanuel college. His father, Sir John Temple, being a statesman, seems to have designed him for the same way of life; and on this account, after residing at Cambridge two years, which were principally spent in acquiring a competency of French and Spanish, both languages exceedingly useful for his intended pursuits, he was sent abroad to finish his education.\n\nMr Temple began his travels by visiting France in 1648. As he chanced to pass through the Isle of Wight, where his majesty was detained a prisoner, he there accidentally met with the second daughter of Sir Peter Oliphant of Chickland, in Bedfordshire, then governor of Guernsey for the king; and his lady being on a journey with her brother to St Maloës, where their father then was, our young traveller joined their party. This gave rise to an honourable attachment, which at the end of seven years, concluded in a happy marriage. Having resided two years in France, and learned the French language perfectly, Mr Temple made a tour through Holland, Flanders, and Germany, during which he became completely master of the Spanish. In 1654 he returned from the continent, and, marrying Miss Oliphant, passed his time in retirement with his father, his two brothers, and a sister, then in Ireland, happy in that perfect harmony which has been so often remarked in their family.\n\nAs he rejected all offers made him of employment under Cromwell, the five years which he lived in Ireland were spent chiefly in improving himself in history and philosophy; but at the Restoration, in 1660, being chosen a member of the convention there, while others were trying to make their court to the king, Mr Temple opposed the poll-bill with so much spirit, that his conduct soon attracted the attention of the public, and brought him into notice. In the succeeding parliament, in 1661, he was elected with his father for the county of Carlow; and in the year following, he was chosen one of the commissioners to be sent from that parliament to the king, which gave him an opportunity of waiting on the duke of Ormond, the new lord-lieutenant, then at London. Soon after he went back to Ireland, but with a resolution of quitting that kingdom, and of removing with his family to England.\n\nOn his return he met with a very favourable reception from the duke of Ormond; and soon acquired such a considerable share in his esteem, that the duke complained of him as the only man in Ireland that had never asked anything from him. When he mentioned his design of carrying his family to England, his grace said, that he hoped he would at least give him leave to write in his favour to the two great ministers, Clarendon then lord chancellor, and the earl of Arlington, who was secretary of state. This the duke did in such strong terms, as procured him the friendship of these two noblemen, as well as the good opinion of the king. Mr Temple, however, made no other use of this advantage than to tell Lord Arlington, that if his majesty had any employment abroad, which he was fit for, he should be happy to undertake it; but, at the same time, he requested that he might not be sent into any of the northern climates, to which he had a very great aversion. Lord Arlington replied, he was very sorry he had made such an objection, as there was no other employment then undisturbed except that of going envoy to Sweden. However, in 1665, about the beginning of the first Dutch war, Lord Arlington sent a messenger to acquaint him that he must immediately come to his house; which he did, and found that his lordship's business was to tell him, that the king had occasion to send some person abroad upon an affair of the utmost importance, and that he had resolved to make him the first offer; but that he must know, without delay, and without telling him what it was, whether he would accept of it, and that he must be ready to set out in two or three days, without mentioning it to any of his friends. After a little consideration, Mr Temple told his lordship, that, as he took him to be his friend, and as he had advised him not to refuse, as it would be an entrance into his majesty's service, he should consult no farther. This business was to carry a secret commission to the bishop of Munster; which he set out with on the second of August, and executed it to much to the satisfaction of Charles II., that, on his return to Brussels, his majesty appointed him resident there, and created him a baronet. As Brussels was a place which he had long wished to reside at, in April 1666 he sent for his family; but, before their arrival, he had been again obliged to depart upon business to the prelate's court; for the bishop having listened to terms of accommodation with France, Sir William wrote two letters to dissuade him from that alliance; and these not having the desired effect, he went in disguise to Munster, where, though he arrived too late to secure the prince in his first engagement, yet he prevailed on him to permit five or six thousand of his best troops to enter into the Spanish service. In this journey he called for a Spanish envoy, having twenty Spanish guards to attend him. In this manner he first went to Duffeldorp, where the duke of Newburgh, though in the French interest, gave him a guard to Dortmund; but when he reached that place, finding the gates shut, he was forced to proceed to a village, at the distance of a league, which being full of Brandenburg troops, he was under the necessity of lodging in a barn, upon a straw bed, with his page for a pillow. Next day he was entertained at a castle belonging to the bishop of Munster, by one Gorges a Scotch lieutenant-general in that prelate's service, with what he calls a very episcopal way of drinking. The general coming to the large hall, in which stood a great many flagons ready charged, he called for wine to drink the king's health. A silver bell, that might hold about two quarts, was upon this brought him; and, as soon as he received it, he pulled out the clapper, and giving it to Sir William, to whom he intended to drink, ordered the bell to be filled. When he was done, he drank off the contents to his majesty's health; and asked Sir William for the clapper, put it on, and turning down the bell, rang it, to show that he had drunk fair,\nTemple, and left nothing in it. He then took out the clapper, \ndesired Sir William to give it to whomsoever he pleased; and, ordering the bell to be filled again, presented it to Sir William: but as the latter seldom used to drink, he had generally some gentleman with him to supply his place in this respect whenever it might be necessary. Having finished his business at Munster, he returned to Brufels, where he passed a year with great pleasure and satisfaction.\n\nTwo months after the conclusion of the peace with the Dutch at Breda, Sir William's sister, who resided with him at Brufels, being very desirous of seeing Holland, he went thither incognito to gratify her desire; but while he was at the Hague, he paid a private visit to Mr De Witt, in which he laid the foundation of that close intimacy which afterwards subsisted between them.\n\nIn the spring of 1667, a new war breaking out between France and Spain, which exposed Brufels to the danger of falling into the hands of the former, Sir William sent his lady and family to England; but himself remained there with his sister till the Christmas following, when he was ordered by the king to come over privately to London. Taking the Hague in his way, he paid another visit to De Witt, and, pursuant to his instructions, proposed those overtures to him which produced the triple alliance. Soon after his arrival at the British court, he returned, on the 16th of January 1668, with the character of envoy extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Holland; where a conference being opened, he brought that treaty to a perfect conclusion in the short space of five days. The ratifications of this alliance being exchanged on the 15th of February, he repaired to Brufels; and a treaty being set on foot between France and Spain at Aix-la-Chapelle, he fell out for that place on the 24th of April in quality of his majesty's ambassador extraordinary and mediator. Here he arrived on the 27th: and it was chiefly owing to his assiduity that the Spaniards were brought to sign the articles of that peace on the second of May. This service being completed, he returned to Brufels, with a view of remaining there in his former station of resident; but he received letters from the earl of Arlington, with the king's order to continue as ambassador, and to serve his country in that quality in Holland, as on account of the late alliances, his majesty was resolved to renew a character which the crown of England had discontinued there since the time of King James. Sir William being now left at liberty to return to England, embraced the opportunity; and, upon his arrival at London, he was received with every possible demonstration of favour both by the king and the court.\n\nSetting out again for Holland, with his new character of the king's ambassador, he arrived at the Hague in the end of August 1668. Here he enjoyed the confidence of that great minister De Witt, and lived in great intimacy with the prince of Orange, who was then only eighteen years of age; but, in September 1669, he was hurried back to England by Lord Arlington, who ordered him to put his foot in the stirrup as soon as he should receive his letter. When Sir William waited on the earl, he found that he had not one word to say to him; for, after making him attend a long time, he only asked a few indifferent questions respecting his journey. Next day he was received as coolly by the king; but the secret soon came out, and he pressed Temple to return to the Hague, and pave the way for a war with Holland. This, however, he excused himself from having any hand in; which so much provoked the lord-treasurer Clifford, that he refused to him an arrear of two thousand pounds due from his embassy. Disgusted with Arlington's behaviour, which was so unlike the friendship he had formerly professed, Sir William now retired to his house at Sheen near Richmond, in Surrey; and in this retreat, when free from the hurry of business, he wrote his Observations on the United Provinces, and one part of his Miscellanies, in the time of the second Dutch war. About the end of summer, however, 1673, the king wishing to put an end to the war, sent for Sir William, and desired him to go to Holland to negotiate a peace; but powers having been sent from thence at this time to the Marquis de Fresno, the Spanish ambassador at London, Sir William was ordered to confer with him; and a treaty was accordingly concluded in three days, and the point carried respecting the superiority of the British flag, which had been so long contested. In June 1674 he was again sent ambassador to Holland to offer the king's mediation between France and the confederates, then at war, which was accepted not long after; Lord Berkeley, Sir William Temple, and Sir Leoline Jenkins, being declared ambassadors and mediators; and Nimeguen, which Sir William had propounded, was at length agreed upon by all parties to be the place of treaty. During his stay at the Hague, the prince of Orange, who was fond of the English language, and of the plain English way of eating, constantly dined and supped once or twice a week at his house; and by this familiarity he so much gained the prince's confidence and esteem, that he had a considerable hand in his marriage with the Princess Mary, daughter of James II.\n\nIn July 1676 he removed his family to Nimeguen, where he spent the remainder of that year without making any progress in the treaty; and the year following his son was sent over with letters from the lord-treasurer, ordering him to return, and succeed Mr Coventry as secretary of state. In consequence of this order, Sir William came over to England in the spring of 1677; and though the affair of the secretary's place was dropped at his desire, he did not return to Nimeguen that year. About this time, the prince having the king's leave to come over, he soon after married the Princess Mary; and this gave occasion for a new coldness between Lord Arlington and Sir William, as he and the lord-treasurer Osborne, who was related to Sir William's lady, were only privy to that affair. After the prince and princess were gone to Holland, as the court always seemed inclined to favour France, the king wished to engage Sir William in some negotiations with that crown: but he was so ill satisfied with this proposal, that he offered to give up all pretensions to the office of secretary; and desiring the lord-treasurer to acquaint his majesty with his intentions, retired to Sheen, in hopes of being taken at his word. Upon a discovery, however, of the French designs not to evacuate the Spanish towns agreed by the treaty to be delivered up, the king commanded him to go upon a third embassy to the states; with whom he concluded a treaty: by which England engaged, in case France refused to evacuate the towns in forty days, to declare war immedi-\nTemple ately against that nation; but before half that time was clapped, one Du Crots was sent from the English court to Holland upon a business which damped all the good humour excited by the treaty there, and which produced such sudden and astonishing changes in this country, as gave Sir William a dilatate for all public employments.\n\nIn 1679 he went back to Nimeguen, where the French delayed to sign the treaty till the last hour; but having concluded it, he returned to the Hague, whence he was soon after sent for to enter upon the secretary's office, which Mr Coventry at length resolved to resign. He accordingly came over, and went to court, as all his friends hoped, with a full intention of assuming his office; but he started some difficulty, because he had not a seat in the house of commons, thinking that, by his not being a member, the public business would suffer at such a critical time, when the councils between the two parties ran so high that the king thought fit to send the duke of York into Flanders, and the parliament to put the lord-treasurer Danby into the Tower. After this his majesty still pressed Sir William to be secretary of state; using as an argument for his compliance, that he had nobody to consult with at a time when he had the greatest need of the best advice. Notwithstanding all this, Sir William declined the king's offer, advising him to choose a council in whom he could confide, and upon whose abilities he could depend. This advice the king followed; and the choice of the persons being concerted between his majesty and Sir William, the old council was dissolved four days after, and the new one established, of which the latter was a member.\n\nIn 1680 the councils began again to be changed, on the king's illness, at the end of summer, and the duke of York's return privately to court. In this juncture Sir William, endeavouring to bring to the king's favour and business some persons to whom his majesty had taken a dislike, if not an aversion, he met with such treatment from them as gave him a fresh dilatate to the court, at which he seldom made his appearance; so that he resided principally at Sheen. Soon after this the king sent for him again; and having promised that he should go as ambassador into Spain, Sir William consented; but when his equipage was almost ready, and part of the money paid down for it, the king changed his mind, and told him that he would have him defer his journey till the end of the session of parliament, in which he was chosen a member for the university of Cambridge. In this session the spirit of party ran so high that it was impossible to bring the house to any kind of temper. The duke was sent into Scotland; but this would not satisfy them, nor anything but a bill of exclusion; which Sir William strenuously opposed, saying, that \"His endeavour ever should be to unite the royal family, and that he would never enter into any councils to divide them.\" Not long after this period, the parliament being dissolved by his majesty, without the advice of his privy council, and contrary to what he had promised, Sir William made a bold speech against it; for which he was very ill used by some of those friends who had been most earnest in promoting the last change in the ministry. Upon this he grew quite tired of public business, declined the offer he had of again serving for the university in the next parliament, that was soon after called, and met at Oxford; and seeing his majesty resolved to govern without his parliament, and to supply his treasury through another channel, he retired to Sheen a few days after, whence he sent word by his son, that \"he would pass the rest of his days like a good subject, but would never more meddle with public affairs.\" From that time Sir William lived at this place till the end of that reign and for some time in the next; when having purchased a small seat, called Moor Park, near Farnham in Surrey, which he conceived a great fondness for, on account of its solitude and retirement, and its healthy and pleasant situation, and being much afflicted with the gout, and broken with age and infirmities, he resolved to spend the remainder of his life in this agreeable retreat. In his way thither, therefore, he waited on King James, who was then at Windsor, and begged his favour and protection to one \"that would always live as a good subject, but, whatever might happen, never again enter upon any public employment;\" deeming his majesty to give no credit to any thing he might hear to the contrary. The king, who used to say that Sir William Temple's character was always to be believed, promised him whatever he desired, gently reproached him for not entering into his service, which, he said, was his own fault; and kept his word as faithfully to Sir William as Sir William did to his majesty, during the surprising turn of affairs that soon after followed by the arrival of the prince of Orange. At the time of this happy revolution, in 1688, Moor-Park becoming unsafe, as it lay in the way of both armies, he went back to the house at Sheen, which he had given up to his son; to whom he refused leave, though importunately begged, to go and meet the prince of Orange at his landing; but after King James's abdication, when the prince reached Windsor, he went thither to wait upon his highness, and carried his son along with him. The prince pressed him to enter into his service, and to be secretary of state; but his age and infirmities confirming him in the resolution he had made not to meddle any more with public affairs, he was satisfied that his son alone should enjoy his majesty's favour. Mr John Temple was upon this appointed secretary at war; but he had hardly been a week in that office, when he resolved to put an end to his own existence; which he did on the 14th of April 1689, by throwing himself out of a boat, hired for that purpose, in shooting London-bridge; having first put stones into his pocket to make him sink speedily.\n\nIn 1694 Sir William had the misfortune to lose his lady, who was a very extraordinary woman, as well as an affectionate wife. He was then considerably turned of sixty; at which age he practised what he had so often declared to be his opinion, that \"an old man ought then to consider himself of no farther use in the world except to himself and his friends.\" After this he lived four years very much afflicted with the gout; and his strength and spirits being worn out by the infirmities of age, he expired in the month of January 1698. He died at Moor-Park, where his heart was buried in a silver box under the sun dial in his garden, opposite to a window from which he used to contemplate and admire the works of nature, with his sister, the ingenious Lady Gifford. This was according to his will; in pursuance of which his body was privately interred in Westminster Abbey, and a marble monument erected in 1722, after the\nTemple, the death of Lady Gifford, who resembled him in genius as well as in person, and left behind her the character of one of the best and most constant friends in the world.\n\nSir William Temple's principal works are, 1. Memoirs from 1672 to 1692: They are very useful for those who wish to be acquainted with the affairs of that period. 2. Remarks upon the State of the United Provinces. 3. An Introduction to the History of England: This is a Sketch of a General History. 4. Letters written during his last embassies. And, 5. Miscellanies, which contain a great many curious pieces that display considerable depth of thought. He was an accomplished gentleman, a sound politician, a patriot, and a great scholar. And if this great idea should perchance be shaded by some touches of vanity and spleen, the reader will be so candid as to consider, that the greatest, wisest, and the best of men, have felt some failings and imperfections which are inseparable from human nature.\n\nTemple, Templum, a public building, erected in honour of some deity, either true or false; and wherein the people meet to pay religious worship to the same. The word is formed from the Latin templum, which some derive from the Greek τείχος, signifying the same thing; and others from τείχος, αλέγω, \"I cut off, I separate,\" in regard a temple is a place separated from common uses; others with more probability derive it from the old Latin word templare, \"to contemplate.\" It is certain the ancient augurs gave the name templum to those parts of the heavens which were marked out for the observation of the flight of birds. Their formula was this: Templum tequa sunt. Temples were originally all open, and hence received their name. See Phil. Trans. No. 471, sect. 5, where we have an account of an ancient temple in Ireland of the same fort as our famous Stonehenge. The word templum, in its primary sense among the old Romans, signified nothing more than a place set apart and consecrated by the augurs, whether inclosed or open, in the city or in the fields.\n\nClemens Alexandrinus and Eusebius refer the origin of temples to the sepulchres built for the dead. This notion has been lately illustrated and confirmed by a variety of testimonies by Mr Farmer in his Treatise on the Worship of Human Spirits, p. 373, &c. Herodotus and Strabo will have the Egyptians to have been the first who built temples to the gods. The first erected in Greece is ascribed to Deucalion, by Apollonius, Argonauta, lib. iii. In antiquity we meet with many people who would not build any temples to their gods for fear of confining them to too narrow bounds. They performed their sacrifices in all places indifferently, from a persuasion that the whole world is the temple of God, and that he required no other. This was the doctrine of the magi, followed by the Persians, the Scythians, the Numidians, and many other nations mentioned by Herodotus, lib. i. Strabo, lib xv. and Cicero in his second oration against Verres.\n\nThe Persians, who worshipped the sun, believed it would wrong his power to inclose him in the walls of a temple, who had the whole world for his habitation; and hence, when Xerxes ravaged Greece, the magi exhorted him to destroy all the temples he met with.\n\nThe Sicyonians would build no temple to their goddes Coronis; nor the Athenians, for the like reason, erect any statue to Clemency, who, they said, was to live in the hearts of men, not within itsone walls.\n\nThe Bithynians had no temples but the mountains to worship on; nor had the ancient Germans any other but the woods.\n\nEven some philosophers have blamed the use and building of temples, particularly Diogenes, Zeno, and his followers the Stoics. But it may be said, that if God hath no need of temples, men have need of places to meet in for the public offices of religion: accordingly temples may be traced back even into the remotest antiquity. See Hofnianum de Origine Templorum.\n\nThe Romans had several kinds of temples; whereof those built by the kings, &c., consecrated by the augurs, and wherein the exercise of religion was regularly performed, were called, by way of eminence, templum, \"temples.\" Those that were not consecrated, were called aedes. The little temples, that were covered or roofed, they called articulae. Those open, facellae. Some other edifices, consecrated to particular mysteries of religion, they called fana and delubra.\n\nAll these kinds of temples, Vitruvius tells us, had other particular denominations, according to the form and manner of their construction, as will be hereafter specified.\n\nIndeed the Romans outdid all nations with regard to temples; they not only built temples to their gods, to their virtues, to their diseases, &c., but also to their emperors, and that in their life time; instances whereof we meet with in medals, inscriptions, and other monuments. Horace compliments Augustus hereupon, and sets him above Hercules and all the heroes of fable; because those were admitted into temples only after their death, whereas Augustus had his temples and altars while living.\n\nPrefecti tibi maturos largimur honores;\nJurandoque tuum per nomen ponimus aras.\nEpift. ad. Aug.\n\nSuetonius, on this occasion, gives an instance of the modesty of that emperor, who would allow of no temples being erected to him in the city; and even in the provinces, where he knew it was usual to raise temples to the very proconsuls, refused any but those erected in the name of Rome as well as his own.\n\nThe most celebrated temples among the Romans were the Capitol and Pantheon. They had also the temple of Saturn, which served for the public treasury; and the temple of Janus.\n\nThe temple at Jerusalem was similar in its plan to the Tabernacle. The first temple was begun by Solomon about the year of the world 2992, and before Christ 1012 according to some chronologers, and finished in eight years. Great mistakes have been committed respecting the dimensions of this temple, by confounding the emblematical description of Ezekiel with the plain account of it in the books of Kings and Chronicles. It consisted of the holy of holies, the sanctuary, and a portico. The holy of holies was a square room of 20 cubits; the sanctuary, or holy place, was 40 cubits long and 20 broad, consequently the length of both these together was 60 cubits. The portico, which stood before the sanctuary, was 20 cubits long and 10 cubits broad. Whether the portico was separated by a wall\nTemple from the rest of the temple or not, is not mentioned in scripture. If it was, the whole length of the temple, computing the cubit at 22 inches, did not exceed 110 feet in length and 36 feet 8 inches in breadth. In the portico stood the two brazen pillars called Jachin and Boaz, which, upon comparing and reconciling the seemingly different accounts in different places, appear to have been 40 cubits high and about 4 cubits diameter. The court probably at first extended all round the temple. Now we are told, that the court about the tabernacle was 100 cubits long and 50 broad; and as Solomon made every part of the temple about twice as large as the corresponding part in the tabernacle, we have reason to conclude, that the court around the temple was 200 cubits long and 100 broad. According to this description, which is taken from the scripture history, the temple of Solomon was by no means so large as it is commonly represented. Still, however, it was very magnificent in size and splendid in ornament. It was plundered of its treasures in the reign of Rehoboam, and repaired by Joah; it was again spoiled in the time of Ahaz and of Hezekiah; and after being restored by Joah, was demolished by Nebuchadnezzar in the year of the world 3416, after it had stood 476 years according to Josephus, and according to Uther 428 years.\n\nThe second temple was built by the Jews, after their return from the Babylonian captivity, under the direction and influence of Zerubbabel their governor, and of Joshua the high-priest, with the leave and encouragement of Cyrus the Persian emperor, to whom Judea was now become a tributary kingdom. According to the Jews, this temple was destitute of five remarkable appendages, which were the chief glory of the first temple; viz. the ark and mercy-seat, the Shechinah, the holy fire on the altar, which had been first kindled from heaven, the urim and thummim, and the spirit of prophecy. This temple was plundered and profaned by Antiochus Epiphanes, who also caused the public worship in it to cease; and afterwards purified by Judas Maccabeus, who restored the divine worship; and after having stood 500 years, rebuilt by Herod, with a magnificence approaching to that of Solomon's. Tacitus calls it immensa opulentiae templum; and Josephus says, it was the most astonishing structure he had ever seen, as well on account of its architecture as its magnitude, and likewise the richness and magnificence of its various parts and the reputation of its sacred appurtenances. This temple, which Herod began to build about 16 years before the birth of Christ, and so far completed in nine years and a half as to be fit for divine service, was at length destroyed by the Romans on the same month and day of the month on which Solomon's temple was destroyed by the Babylonians.\n\nThe Indian temples, or pagodas, are sometimes of a prodigious size. They are commonly erected near the banks of the Ganges, Kailna, or other sacred rivers, for the benefit of ablution in the purifying stream. Where no river flows near the foot of the pagoda, there is invariably in the front of it a large tank or reservoir of water. These are, for the most part, of a quadrangular form, are lined with freestone or marble, have steps regularly descending from the margin to the bottom, and Mr Crawford observed many between three and four hundred feet in breadth. At the entrance of all the more considerable pagodas there is a portico, supported by rows of lofty columns, and ascended by a handsome flight of stone steps; sometimes, as in the instance of Tripetti*, to the number of more than a hundred. Under this portico, and in the courts that generally inclose the whole building, an innumerable multitude assemble at the rising of the sun; and, having bathed in the stream below, and, in conformity to an immemorial custom over all the East, having left their sandals on the border of the tank, impatiently await the unfolding of the gates by the ministering brahmin. The gate of the pagoda universally fronts the east, to admit the ray of the solar orb; and, opening, presents to the view an edifice partitioned out, according to Mr Thevenot in his account of Chitanagar, in the manner of the ancient cave-temples of Elora, having a central nave or body; a gallery ranging on each side; and, at the farther end, a sanctuary, or chapel of the deity adored, surrounded by a stone balustrade to keep off the populace. Those who wish to peruse a more particular account of the Indian temples may consult Maurice's Indian Antiquities. See also PAGODA and SERINGHAM.\n\nTEMPLE, in Architecture. The ancient temples were distinguished, with regard to their construction, into various kinds; as, Temple in antis, Edes in antis. These, according to Vitruvius, were the most simple of all temples, having only angular pilasters, called antae or paraplastae, at the corners, and two Tuscan columns on each side of the doors. Temple tetrastyle, or simple tetrastyle, was a temple that had four columns in front, and as many behind. Such was the temple of Fortuna Virilis at Rome. Temple prostyle, that which had only columns in its front or foreside; as that of Ceres at Eleusis in Greece. Temple amphiprostyle, or double prostyle, that which had columns both before and behind, and which was also tetrastyle. Temple periptere, that which had four rows of inflated columns around, and was hexastylo, i.e. had six columns in front; as the temple of Honour at Rome. Temple diptere, that which had two wings and two rows of columns around, and was also octostyle, or had eight columns in front; as that of Diana at Ephesus.\n\nTEMPLES, among us, denote two inns of court in London, thus called, because anciently the dwelling-house of the knight's templars. At the suppression of that order, they were purchased by the professors of the common law, and converted into hospita or inns. They are called the inner and middle temple, in relation to Essex-house; which was also a part of the house of the templars, and called the outer temple, because situated without Temple-Bar. In the middle temple, during the time of the templars, the king's treasure was kept; as was also that of the kings of France in the house of the templars at Paris. The chief officer was the master of the temple, who was summoned to parliament in 47 Hen. III. and from him the chief minister of the temple-church is still called master of the temple.\n\nTEMPLES, in Anatomy, a double part of the head, reaching from the forehead and eyes to the two ears. The temples are chiefly formed of two bones called os temporis. These parts, according to physicians, were called tempora, from their showing the age or time of a man by the colour of the hair, which turns white in this part before any other; which Homer seems to have been aware of, by his calling men policrocephali, g.d., \"grey-templed.\"\nTEMPORAL, a term generally used for secular, as a distinction from ecclesiastical. Thus we say temporal lords, and spiritual or ecclesiastical lords.\n\nTEMPORALITIES of BISHOPS, are the revenues, lands, tenements, and lay-fees, belonging to bishops, as they are barons and lords of parliament.\n\nThe custody of the temporalities of bishops forms a branch of the king's ordinary revenues (see Revenue). These, upon the vacancy of the bishopric, are immediately the right of the king, as a consequence of his prerogative in church matters; whereby he is considered as the founder of all archbishoprics and bishoprics, to whom, during the vacancy, they revert. And for the same reason, before the dissolution of abbeys, the king had the custody of the temporalities of all such abbeys and priories as were of royal foundation (but not of those founded by subjects), on the death of the abbot or prior. Another reason may also be given why the policy of the law hath vested this custody in the king; because, as the successor is not known, the lands and possessions of the see would be liable to spoil and devastation if no one had a property therein. Therefore the law has given the king, not the temporalities themselves, but the custody of the temporalities, till such time as a successor is appointed; with power of taking to himself all the intermediate profits, without giving any account to the successor; and with the right of presenting (which the crown very frequently exercises) to such benefices and other preferments as fall within the time of vacation. This revenue is of so high a nature, that it could not be granted out to a subject, before or even after it accrued: but now, by the statute 1 Edw. III. stat. 4. cap. 4 and 5, the king may, after the vacancy, lease the temporalities to the dean and chapter; saving to himself all advowsons, ecclesiastics, and the like. Our ancient kings, and particularly William Rufus, were not only remarkable for keeping the bishoprics a long time vacant, for the sake of enjoying the temporalities, but also committed horrible wastes on the woods and other parts of the estate; and to crown all, would never, when the see was filled up, restore to the bishop his temporalities again, unless he purchased them at an exorbitant price. To remedy which, King Henry I. granted a charter at the beginning of his reign, promising neither to sell, nor let to farm, or take any thing from, the domains of the church, till the successor was installed. And it was made one of the articles of the great charter, that no waste should be committed in the temporalities of bishoprics, neither should the custody of them be sold. The same is ordained by the statute of Westminster the first; and the statute 1 Edw. III. stat. 4. cap. 4. (which permits a lease to the dean and chapter) is still more explicit in prohibiting the other exactions. It was also a frequent abuse, that the king would, for trifling or no cause, seize the temporalities of bishops, even during their lives, into his own hands: but this is guarded against by statute 1 Edw. III. stat. 2. cap. 2.\n\nThis revenue of the king, which was formerly very considerable, is now by a customary indulgence almost reduced to nothing: for, at present, as soon as the new bishop is consecrated and confirmed, he usually receives the restitution of his temporalities quite entire and untouched from the king; and then, and not sooner, he has a fee-simple in his bishopric, and may maintain an action Tenacity for the profits.\n\nTENACITY, in Natural Philosophy, that quality of bodies by which they sustain a considerable pressure or force of any kind without breaking.

See ENTOMOLOGY Index.\n\nTENEDOS, in Ancient Geography, an island on the coast of Troas, at the distance of 40 stadia from the continent, and 80 in compass; with a cognominal Aeolian town, and a temple of Apollo Sintheus. Its origin is derived from Tennes or Tenes, who being exposed in a cleft or bog by his father Cygnus the Thracian, at the instigation of the mother-in-law, was by fate carried to this island, made king of it, and at length worshipped as a god on account of his virtues. The island was famous for its earthen ware, for which purpose it had an excellent red clay; and hence Bochart would derive the appellation from tinculum, a \"red clay.\" Tenedia securis, is a proverbial saying to denote severity; from a law there passed, that persons found in the act of adultery should be put to death; a severity executed on the king's son; and therefore, in the coins of Tenedos, on one side are two heads in memorial of the king and his son, and on the reverse an axe, (Aristotle.) This island still retains its ancient name; and is one of the smallest islands of the Archipelago, situated near the coast of Letter Asia, west of the ruins of Troy. It is chiefly rocky, but fertile, being remarkable for producing the best Muscadine wine in the Levant; and its position, thus near the mouth of the Hellespont, has given it importance in all ages; vessels bound toward Constantinople finding shelter in its port, or safe anchorage in the road, during the Etesian or contrary winds, and in foul weather. The emperor Justinian erected a magazine to receive the cargoes of the corn ships from Alexandria, when detained there. This was a lofty building, 280 feet long and 90 broad. The voyage from Egypt was rendered less precarious, and the grain preserved until it could be transported to the capital. Afterwards, during the troubles of the Greek empire, Tenedos experienced a variety of fortune. The pirates, who infested these seas, made it for many years their place of rendezvous; and Othman seized it in 1302, procured vessels, and thence subdued the other islands of the Archipelago.\nTeneriff contains about 96,000 persons, supposed to be equal to the number of inhabitants of all the rest of the seven islands put together. The peasants in general are wretchedly clothed; when they do appear better, they are habited in the Spanish fashion. The men, in a genteeler line, dress very gayly, and are seldom seen without long swords. It is remarked, that few of White's them walk with dignity and ease; which may be attributed to the long cloaks they usually wear. The women wear veils; those worn by the lower ranks are of black stuff, those of the higher of black silk; and such among the latter as have any claim to beauty are far from being over careful in concealing their faces by them. The young ladies wear their fine long black hair plaited, and fastened with a comb or a ribbon on the top of the head.\n\nThe common people, and in this they resemble the inhabitants of most of the islands in the Pacific ocean lately discovered, have in them a strong tendency to thieving; they are besides lazy, and the most impudent beggars in the world. \"I observed likewise (says Mr White) that the itch was so common among them, and had attained such a degree of virulence, that one would almost be led to believe it was epidemic there. Some of the women are so abandoned and shameless, that it would be doing an injustice to the prostitutes met with in the streets of London to say they are like them. The females of every degree are said to be of an amorous constitution, and addicted to intrigue; for which no houses could be better adapted than those in Teneriff.\n\n\"The manufactures carried on here are very few, and the product of them little more than sufficient for their own consumption. They consist of taffetas, gauze, coarse linens, blankets, a little silk, and curious garters. The principal dependence of the inhabitants is on their wine (their staple commodity), oil, corn, and every kind of stock for shipping. With these the island abounds; and, in their season, produces not only the tropical fruits, but the vegetable productions of the European gardens, in the greatest plenty. Teneriff enjoys an agreeable and healthful mediocrity of climate. Indeed none seems better adapted for the restoration of a valetudinarian; as, by going into the mountains, he may graduate the air, and choose that state of it which best suits his complaint. But although the inhabitants are thus healthy, and have so little occasion for medical aid, they loudly complain of the want of knowledge in the professional gentlemen of the island.\"\n\nThe height of the peak of Teneriff has been so variously estimated and calculated by different travellers and geographers, that we can only take the mean between the two extremes of their decisions. Dr Halley allows but two miles and a quarter from the level of the sea to the summit of the sugar-loaf, whilst the Spanish account of the Canary islands, translated by Mr Glas in 1763, makes it no less than five miles; and others have assigned a height different from both these. That it is an extinguished volcano is universally known.\n\n\"The crater of the peak of Teneriff (says Mongez) is a true sulphur-pit, similar to those of Italy. It is about 50 fathoms long and 40 broad, rising abruptly from...\"\nfrom east to west. At the edges of the crater, particularly on the under side, are many spiracles, or natural chimneys, from which there exhale aqueous vapours and fulphurous acids, which are so hot as to make the thermometer rise from $9^\\circ$ to $34^\\circ$ of Reaumur. The inside of the crater is covered with yellow, red, or white, argillaceous earth, and blocks of lava partly decomposed. Under these blocks are found superb crystals of sulphur; these are eight-sided rhombohedral crystals, sometimes an inch in length, and, I suppose, they are the finest crystals of volcanic sulphur that have ever been found. The water that exhales from the spiracles is perfectly pure, and not in the least acid, as I was convinced by several experiments. \"The elevation of the peak above the level of the sea is near 1900 toises.\"\n\nW.

See MEDICINE, No. 111.\n\nTENIERS, DAVID, the Elder, a Flemish painter, born at Antwerp in 1582. He received the first rudiments of his art from the famous Rubens, who highly esteemed him for his promising genius, and with great satisfaction examined and commended his designs. From the school of that celebrated painter Teniers went to finish his studies at Rome. He attached himself to Adam Elsheimer for five years; and from the instructions of two such incomparable masters, he formed to himself a peculiar style, which his son cultivated so happily afterward as to bring it to the utmost perfection. His pictures were small; and his subjects usually shops, laboratories, humorous conversations, and rural festivities. The demand for his pieces was universal; and even his master Rubens thought them an ornament to his cabinet. He died at Antwerp in 1640.\n\nTENIERS, David, the Younger, also an admirable painter, was the son of the former, and was born at Antwerp in 1610. He obtained the name of Ape of Painting, from his imitating the manner of different painters with such exactness as to deceive even the nicest judges. He improved greatly under his father, and obtained such reputation as introduced him to the favour of the great. The archduke Leopold William made him gentleman of his bedchamber; and all the pictures of his gallery were copied by Teniers, and engraved by his direction. The king of Spain and Don Juan of Austria set so high a value on his pictures, that they built a gallery on purpose for them. William prince of Orange honoured him with his friendship; and Rubens not only esteemed his works, but assisted him with his advice. His principal talent lay in landscapes, adorned with small figures. He also painted men drinking and smoking, chemists laboratories, country fairs, and the like. His small figures are superior to his large ones. He died in 1664.\n\nThe works of the father and son are thus distinguished: The latter discover a finer touch and fresher pencil, greater variety of attitudes, and a better disposition of the figures. The father retained something of the tone of Italy in his colouring, which was stronger than the son's; besides, the son used to put at the bottom of his pictures, David Teniers, junior.\n\nAbraham, another son of David the Elder, was equal, if not superior, to his father and brother in the expression of his characters, and his understanding the\n\nTenison, Dr Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury, was born at Cottenham in Cambridgeshire in 1636; and studied at Corpus Christi college in Cambridge. In his youth, while the fanatical government lasted, he applied himself to physic; but afterward went into orders, and was some time minister of St Andrew's church, Cambridge; where he attended the sick during the plague in 1665, which his parishioners acknowledged by the present of a piece of plate. He showed himself very active against the growth of Popery by his writings both in King Charles and in King James's reigns: in 1680 he was presented to the vicarage of St Martin's in the Fields, London, to which parish he made several donations; and among others, endowed a free school, and built a handsome library, which he furnished with useful books. King William and Queen Mary, in 1689, presented him to the archdeaconry of London; in 1691, he was nominated to the see of Lincoln, and in 1694 he succeeded Dr Tillotson as archbishop of Canterbury. He performed all the duties of a good primate for 20 years, and died in 1715.\n\nTENNIS, a play at which a ball is driven by a racket.\n\nAs many persons would become players at tennis, provided they could easily understand the rudiments of the game, so as to form some judgement of the players, or at least to know who wins and who loses, we have here attempted to give a plain description of it, that no one can be at a loss, if ever he should bett or play. As to the executive part, it requires great practice to make a good player, so that nothing can be done without it; all we presume to do is to give an insight into the game, whereby a person may not seem a total stranger to it when he happens to be in a tennis court.\n\nThe game of tennis is played in most capital cities in Europe, particularly in France, from whence we may venture to derive its origin. It is esteemed with many to be one of the most ancient games in Christendom, and long before King Charles I.'s time it was played in England.\n\nThis game is as intricate as any game whatever; a person who is totally ignorant of it may look for a month together, without being able to make out how the game is decided. Therefore, we shall begin by describing the court in which it is played.\n\nThe size of a tennis court is generally about 96 or 97 feet by 33 or 34; there being no exact dimension assigned to its proportion, a foot more or less in length or width being of no consequence. A line or net hangs exactly across the middle, over which the ball must be struck, either with a racket or board to make the stroke good. Upon the entrance of a tennis-court, there is a long gallery which goes to the dedans, that is, a kind of front gallery, where spectators usually stand, into which, whenever a ball is struck, it falls for a certain stroke. This long gallery is divided into different compartments or galleries, each of which has its particular name, as follows; from the line towards the dedans are the first gallery, door, second gallery, and the last gallery, which is called the service side. From the dedans to the last gallery are the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, at a yard distance each, by which the places are marked, and is one of the most essential parts of the game, as will appear in the following description.\nOn the other side of the line are also the first gallery, second gallery, and last gallery; which is called the hazard-side. Every ball struck into the last gallery on this side reckons for a certain stroke the same as the dedans. Between the second and this last gallery are the figures 1, 2, to mark the chaces on the hazard-side. Over this long gallery, or these compartments, is a covering, called the pent-house, on which they play the ball from the service-side, in order to begin a set of tennis, from which it is called a service. When they miss putting the ball (so as to rebound from the pent-house) over a certain line on the service-side, it is deemed a fault, two of which are reckoned for a stroke. If the ball rolls round the pent-house, on the opposite side of the court, so as to fall beyond a certain line described for that purpose, it is called passe, reckons for nothing on either side, and the player must serve again.\n\nOn the right-hand-side of the court from the dedans is what they call the tambour, a part of the wall which projects, and is so contrived in order to make a variety in the stroke, and render it more difficult to be returned by the adversary; for when a ball strikes the tambour, it varies its direction, and requires some extraordinary judgement to return it over the line. The last thing on the right hand side is called the grill, wherein if the ball is struck, it is also 15, or a certain stroke.\n\nThe game of tennis is played by what they call sets; a set of tennis consists of six games: but if they play what is called an advantage-set, two above five games must be won on one side or the other successively, in order to decide; or, if it comes to fix games all, two games must still be won on one side to conclude the set; so that an advantage-set may last a considerable time; for which kind of sets the court is paid more than for any other.\n\nWe must now describe the use of the chaces, and by what means these chaces decide or interfere too much in the game. When the player gives his service at the beginning of a set, his adversary is supposed to return the ball; and wherever it falls after the first rebound untouched, the chace is called accordingly; for example, if the ball falls at the figure 1, the chace is called at a yard, that is to say, at a yard from the dedans: this chace remains till a second service is given; and if the player on the service-side lets the ball go after his adversary returns it, and if the ball falls on or between any of these figures or chaces, they must change sides, there being two chaces; and he who then will be on the hazard-side, must play to win the first chace; which if he wins by striking the ball so as to fall, after its first rebound, nearer to the dedans than the figure 1, without his adversary's being able to return it from its first hop, he wins a stroke, and then proceeds in like manner to win the second chace, wherever it should happen to be. If a ball falls on the line with the first gallery door, second gallery, or last gallery, the chace is likewise called at such or such a place, naming the gallery, door, &c. When it is just put over the line, it is called a chace at the line. If the player on the service-side returns a ball with such force as to strike the wall on the hazard-side so as to rebound, after the first hop over the line, it is also called a chace at the line.\n\nThe chaces on the hazard-side proceed from the ball being returned either too hard or not quite hard enough; so that the ball after its first rebound falls on this side of the blue line, or line which describes the hazard-side chaces; in which case it is a chace at 1, 2, &c., provided there is no chace depending. When they change sides, the player, in order to win this chace, must put the ball over the line anywhere, so that his adversary does not return it. When there is no chace on the hazard-side, all balls put over the line from the service-side, without being returned, reckon for a stroke.\n\nAs the game depends chiefly upon the marking, it will be necessary to explain it, and to recommend those who play at tennis to have a good and unbiased marker, for on him the whole set may depend: he can mark in favour of the one and against the other in such a manner, as will render it two to one at starting, though even players. Instead of which the marker should be very attentive to the chaces, and not be anyway partial to either of the players.\n\nThis game is marked in a very singular manner, which makes it at first somewhat difficult to understand. The first stroke is called 13, the second 30, the third 40, and the fourth game, unless the players get four strokes each; in that case, instead of calling it 40 all, it is called deuce; after which, as soon as any stroke is got, it is called advantage; and in case the strokes become equal again, deuce again, till one or the other gets two strokes following, which win the game; and as the games are won, so they are marked and called; as one game love, two games to one, &c. towards the set, of which so many of these games it consists.\n\nAlthough but one ball at a time is played with, a number of balls are made use of at this game to avoid trouble, and are handed to the players in baskets for that purpose: by which means they can play as long as they please, without ever having occasion to stoop for a ball.\n\nAs to the odds at tennis, they are by no means fixed, but are generally laid as follow:\n\nUpon the first stroke being won between even players, that is, fifteen love, the odds are of the\n\n| Single game | - | - | 7 to 4 |\n| Thirty love | - | - | 4 1 |\n| Forty love | - | - | 8 1 |\n| Thirty fifteen | - | - | 2 1 |\n| Forty fifteen | - | - | 5 1 |\n| Forty thirty | - | - | 3 1 |\n\nThe odds of a four game set when the first game is won, are\n\n| When two games love | - | - | 7 4 |\n| Three games love | - | - | 4 1 |\n| When two games to one | - | - | 8 1 |\n| Three games to one | - | - | 2 1 |\n| The odds of a six game set when the first game is won, are |\n\n| When two games love | - | - | 3 2 |\n| Three games love | - | - | 4 1 |\n| Four games love | - | - | 10 1 |\n| Five games love | - | - | 21 1 |\n| When two games to one | - | - | 8 5 |\n| Three games to one | - | - | 5 2 |\n| Four games to one | - | - | 5 1 |\n| Five games to one | - | - | 15 1 |\n| When three games to two | - | - | 7 4 |\n| Four games to two | - | - | 4 1 |\n| Five games to two | - | - | 10 1 |\n| When four games to three | - | - | 2 1 |\n\nFive\nTennis.\n\nFive games to three - 5 1\nThe odds of an advantage fet when the first game is won, are - 5 4\nWhen two games love - 7 4\nThree games love - 3 1\nFour games love - 5 1\nFive games love - 15 1\nWhen two games to one - 4 3\nThree games to one - 2 1\nFour games to one - 7 2\nFive games to one - 10 1\nWhen three games to two - 3 2\nFour games to two - 3 1\nFive games to two - 8 1\nWhen four games to three - 8 5\nFive games to three - 3 1\nWhen five games to four - 2 1\nWhen six games to five - 5 2\n\nThe foregoing odds, as beforesaid, are generally laid, but the chaces interfering makes the odds very precarious; for example, when there is a chance at half a yard, and a fet is five games all, and in every other respect equal, the odds are a good five to four; and if it were six games to five, and forty thirty with the same chance, the odds then would be a guinea to a shilling; so that it is plain that the odds at this game differ from those of any other: for one stroke will reduce a fet, supposing the players to be five games all, from an even wager to three to two, and so on in proportion to the stage of the fet.\n\nThere are various methods of giving odds at tennis, in order to make a match equal; and that they may be understood, we shall give the following list of them, with their meanings, so that any person may form a judgment of the advantage received or given.\n\nThe lowest odds that can be given, excepting the choice of the fides, is what they call a bisque, that is, a stroke to be taken or scored whenever the player, who receives the advantage, thinks proper: for instance, suppose a critical game of the fet to be forty thirty, by taking the bisque, he who is forty becomes game, and so in respect of two bisques, &c.\n\nThe next greater odds are fifteen, that is, a certain stroke given at the beginning of each game.\n\nAfter these, half-thirty, that is, fifteen one game, and thirty the next. Then follow the whole thirty, forty, &c.\n\nThere are also the following kind of odds which are given, viz.\n\nRound services; those are services given round the pent-house, so as to render it easy for the striker-out (the player who is on the hazard side) to return the ball.\n\nHalf-court, that is, being obliged or confined to play into the adversary's half-court; sometimes it is played straightforward, and at other times across; both which are great advantages given by him so confined, but the strict half-court is the greatest.\n\nTouch-no-wall, that is, being obliged to play within the compass of the walls, or sides of the court. This is a considerable advantage to him who receives it; as all the balls must be played gently, and consequently they are much easier to take than those which are played hard, or according to the usual method of play.\n\nBarring the hazards, that is, barring the dedans, tambour, grill, or the last gallery on the hazard-side, or any particular one or more of them.\n\nThese are the common kind of odds or advantages given; but there are many others, which are according to what is agreed by the players: such as playing with board against racket, cricket-bat against racket, &c.\n\nThe game of tennis is also played by four persons, two partners on each side. In this case, they are generally confined to their particular quarters, and one of each side appointed to serve and strike out; in every other respect, the game is played in the same manner as when two only play.\n\nAny thing more to be said upon this subject would be needless, as nothing can be recommended after reading this short account of tennis, but practice and attention, without which no one can become a proficient at the game.\n\nTenor, or Tenour, the purport or content of a writing or instrument in law, &c.\n\nTenor, in Music, the first mean, or middle part, or that which is the ordinary pitch of the voice, when neither raised to a treble nor lowered to a bass.\n\nTense, in Grammar, an inflection of verbs, whereby they are made to signify or distinguish the circumstance of time in what they affirm. See Grammar.\n\nTent, in War, a pavilion or portable house. Tents are made of canvas, for officers and soldiers to lie under when in the field. The size of the officers' tents is not fixed; some regiments have them of one size and some of another; a captain's tent and marquee is generally 10 feet broad, 14 deep, and 8 high: the subalterns are a foot less; the major's and lieutenant-colonel's a foot larger; and the colonel's two feet larger. The subalterns of foot lie two in a tent, and those of hussars but one. The tents of private men are 6½ feet square, and 5 feet high, and hold five soldiers each. The tents for horse are 7 feet broad and 9 feet deep: they hold likewise five men and their horse accoutrements.—The word is formed from the Latin tentorium, of tendo \"I stretch,\" because tents are usually made of canvas stretched out, and sustained by poles, with cords and pegs.\n\nTent, in Surgery, a roll of lint made into the shape of a nail with a broad flat head, chiefly used in deep wounds and ulcers. They are of service, not only in conveying medicines to the most intimate recesses and sinuses of the wound, but to prevent the lips of the wound from uniting before it is healed from the bottom; and by their assistance grumous blood, sores, &c., are readily evacuated.\n\nTenter, Trier, or Prover, a machine used in the cloth manufacture, to stretch out the pieces of cloth, stuff, &c., or only to make them even and set them square.\n\nIt is usually about 4½ feet high, and for length exceeds that of the longest piece of cloth. It consists of several long square pieces of wood, placed like those which form the barriers of a manege; so, however, as that the lower cross pieces of wood may be raised or lowered as is found requisite, to be fixed at any height by means of pins. Along the cross pieces, both the upper and the under one, are hooked nails, called tenter-hooks, driven in from space to space.\n\nTo put a piece of Cloth on the Tenter. While the piece is yet quite wet, one end is fastened to one of the ends\nends of the tenter; then it is pulled by force of arms towards the other end, to bring it to the length required: that other end being fastened, the upper lift is hooked on to the upper cross-piece, and the lower lift to the lower cross-piece, which is afterwards lowered by force, till the piece have its desired breadth. Being thus well stretched, both as to length and breadth, they brush it with a stiff hair brush, and thus let it dry. Then they take it off; and, till they wet it again, it will retain the length and breadth the tenter gave it.\n\nTENTHREDO, the SAW-FLY; a genus of insects belonging to the order of hymenoptera. See ENTOMOLOGY Index.\n\nTENTHS, and FIRST FRUITS of Spiritual Preferments, a branch of the king's revenue. See REVENUE.\n\nThese were originally a part of the Papal usurpations over the clergy of this kingdom; first introduced by Pandulph the pope's legate, during the reigns of King John and Henry III. in the see of Norwich; and afterwards attempted to be made universal by the popes Clement V. and John XXII. about the beginning of the 14th century. The first fruits, primitive or annates, were the first year's whole profits of the spiritual preferment, according to a rate or valor made under the direction of Pope Innocent IV. by Walter bishop of Norwich in 38 Hen. III. and afterwards advanced in value by commission from Pope Nicholas III. A.D. 1292, 20 Edw. I.; which valuation of Pop Nicholas is still preserved in the exchequer. The tenths, or decimes, were the tenth part of the annual profit of each living by the same valuation; which was also claimed by the holy see, under no better pretence than a strange misapplication of that precept of the Levitical law, which directs, that the Levites \"should offer the tenth part of their tithes as a heave offering to the Lord, and give it to Aaron the highpriest.\" But this claim of the pope met with vigorous resistance from the English parliament; and a variety of acts were passed to prevent and restrain it, particularly the statute 6 Hen. IV. c. 1. which calls it a horrible mischief and damnable custom. But the Popish clergy, blindly devoted to the will of a foreign master, still kept it on foot; sometimes more secretly, sometimes more openly and avowedly: so that in the reign of Henry VIII. it was computed, that in the compass of 50 years 800,000 ducats had been sent to Rome for first fruits only. And as the clergy expressed this willingness to contribute so much of their income to the head of the church, it was thought proper (when in the same reign the papal power was abolished) and the king was declared the head of the church of England) to annex this revenue to the crown; which was done by statute 26 Hen. VIII. c. 3. (confirmed by statute 1 Eliz. c. 4.) and a new valor beneficiorum was then made, by which the clergy are at present rated.\n\nBy these last mentioned statutes all vicarages under ten pounds a year, and all rectories under ten marks, are discharged from the payment of first fruits: and if, in such livings as continue chargeable with this payment, the incumbent lives but half a year, he shall pay only one quarter of his first fruits; if but one whole year, then half of them; if a year and a half, three quarters; and if two years, then the whole, and not otherwise. Likewise by the statute 27 Hen. VIII. c. 8. no tenths are to be paid for the first year, for then the first fruits are due: and by other statutes of Queen Anne, in the fifth and sixth years of her reign, if a benefice be under 50l. per annum clear yearly value, it shall be discharged of the payment of first fruits and tenths.\n\nThus the richer clergy being, by the criminal bigotry of their Popish predecessors, subjected at first to a foreign exaction, were afterwards, when that yoke was shaken off, liable to a like misapplication of their revenues through the rapacious dilapidation of the then reigning monarch; till at length the piety of Queen Anne restored to the church what had been thus indirectly taken from it. This she did, not by remitting the tenths and first fruits entirely; but, in a spirit of the truest equity, by applying these superfluities of the larger benefices to make up the deficiencies of the smaller. And to this end she granted her royal charter, which was confirmed by the statute 2 Ann. c. 11. whereby all the revenue of first fruits and tenths is veiled in trustees for ever, to form a perpetual fund for the augmentation of poor livings. This is usually called Queen Anne's bounty; which has been still farther regulated by subsequent statutes.\n\nTENURE, in Law, signifies the manner whereby lands or tenements are held, or the service that the tenant owes to his lord.\n\nOf this kingdom almost all the real property is by the policy of our laws supposed to be granted by, dependent upon, and holden of, some superior lord, by and in consideration of certain services to be rendered to the lord by the tenant or possessor of this property. The thing holden is therefore styled a tenement, the possessors thereof tenants, and the manner of their possession a tenure. Thus all the lands in the kingdom are supposed to be holden, immediately or immediately, of the king; who is styled the lord paramount, or above all. Such tenants as held under the king immediately, when they granted out portions of the lands to inferior persons, became also lords with respect to those inferior persons, as they were still tenants with respect to the king; and, thus partaking of a middle nature, were called mesne or middle lords. So that if the king granted a manor to A., and he granted a portion of the land to B., now B was laid to hold of A., and A of the king; or, in other words, B held his lands immediately of A., but immediately of the king. The king therefore was styled lord paramount: A was both tenant and lord, or was a mesne lord; and B was called tenant paravall or the lowest tenant, being he who was supposed to make avail or profit of the land. In this manner are all the lands of the kingdom holden which are in the hands of subjects: for, according to Sir Edward Coke, in the law of England we have not properly allodium, which is the name by which the feudists abroad distinguish such estates of the subject as are not holden of any superior. So that at the first glance we may observe, that our lands are either plainly feuds, or partake very strongly of the feudal nature.\n\nAll tenures being thus derived, or supposed to be derived, from the king, those that held immediately under him, in right of his crown and dignity, were called his tenants in capite, or in chief; which was the most honourable species of tenure, but at the same time subjected the tenants to greater and more burdensome services than inferior tenures did. And this distinction ran through all the different sorts of tenure.\n\nThere seem to have subsisted among our ancestors four principal species of lay-tenures, to which all other may be reduced: the grand criteria of which were the natures of the\nthe several services or renders that were due to the lords from their tenants. The services, in respect of their quality, were either free or base services; in respect of their quantity and the time of exacting them were either certain or uncertain. Free services were such as were not unbecoming the character of a soldier or a freeman to perform; as to serve under his lord in the wars, to pay a sum of money, and the like. Base services were such as were fit only for peasants or persons of a servile rank; as to plough the lord's land, to make his hedges, to carry out his dung, or other mean employments. The certain services, whether free or base, were such as were stinted in quantity, and could not be exceeded on any pretence; as, to pay a stated annual-rent, or to plough such a field for three days. The uncertain depended upon unknown contingencies; as, to do military service in person, or pay an assessment in lieu of it when called upon; or to wind a horn upon the appearance of invaders: which are free services; or to do whatever the lord should command; which is a base or villein service.\n\nFrom the various combinations of these services have arisen the four kinds of lay-tenure which subsisted in England till the middle of the last century; and three of which subsist to this day. Of these Bracton (who wrote under Henry III.) seems to give the clearest and most compendious account of any author ancient or modern; of which the following is the outline or abstract:\n\n\"Tenements are of two kinds, frank-tenement, and villenage. And of frank-tenements, some are held freely in consideration of homage and knight-service; others in free-focage, with the service of fealty only. And again, of villenages, some are pure, and others privileged.\" He that holds in pure villenage (hall do whatsoever is commanded him, and always be bound to an uncertain service. The other kind of villenage is called villein-focage; and these villein-foemen do villein services, but such as are certain and determined.\" Of which the service seems to be as follows; first, where the service was free, but uncertain, as military service with homage, that tenure was called the tenure in chivalry, per servitium militare, or by knight-service. Secondly, where the service was not only free, but also certain, as by fealty only, by rent and fealty, &c., that tenure was called liberum focagium, or free focage. These were the only free holdings or tenements; the others were villeinous or servile: as, thirdly, where the service was base in its nature, and uncertain as to time and quantity, the tenure was purum villenagium, absolute or pure villenage. Lastly, where the service was base in its nature, but reduced to a certainty, this was still villenage, but distinguished from the other by the name of privileged villenage, villenagium privilegiatum; or it might be still called focage (from the certainty of its services), but degraded by their baseness into the inferior title of villanum focagium, villein-focage.\n\n1. The military tenure, or that by knight-service, was done away by stat. 12 Car. II. For an account of this species of tenure see Feodal System, and Knight-Service; and for its incidents, see Relief, Primer-Seisin, Wardship, Marriage, Fines, and Escheat.\n\n2. The second species of tenure or free-focage, not only subsists to this day, but has in a manner absorbed and swallowed up (since the statute of Charles the Second) almost every other species of tenure. See So-Cage.\n\nThe other grand division of tenure, mentioned by Bracton, is that of villenage, as contradistinguished from liberum tenementum, or frank-tenure. And this (we may remember) he subdivides into two classes, pure and privileged villenage: from whence have arisen two other species of our modern tenures.\n\n3. From the tenure of pure villenage have sprung our present copyhold-tenures, or tenure by copy of court-roll at the will of the lord; in order to obtain a clear idea of which, it will be previously necessary to consult the articles Manor and Villenage.\n\nAs a farther consequence of what has been there explained, we may collect these two main principles, which are held to be the supporters of a copyhold-tenure, and without which it cannot exist: 1. That the lands be parcel of and situate within that manor under which it is held. 2. That they have been demised, or demisable, by copy of court roll immemorially. For immemorial custom is the life of all tenures by copy; so that no new copyhold can, strictly speaking, be granted at this day.\n\nIn some manors, where the custom hath been to permit the heir to succeed the ancestor in his tenure, the estates are styled copyholds of inheritance; in others, where the lords have been more vigilant to maintain their rights, they remain copyholds for life only; for the custom of the manor has in both cases so far supereded the will of the lord, that, provided the services be performed or stipulated for by fealty, he cannot in the first instance refuse to admit the heir of his tenant upon his death; nor, in the second, can he remove his present tenant so long as he lives, though he holds nominally by the precarious tenure of his lord's will.\n\nThe fruits and appendages of a copyhold-tenure, that it hath in common with free tenures, are fealty, services (as well in rents as otherwise), reliefs, and escheats. The two latter belong only to copyholds of inheritance; the former to those for life also. But, besides these, copyholds have also heriots, wardship, and fines. Heriots, which are agreed to be a Danish custom, are a render of the best beast or other good (as the custom may be) to the lord on the death of the tenant. This is plainly a relic of villein tenure; there being originally less hardship in it, when all the goods and chattels belonged to the lord, and he might have seized them even in the villein's lifetime. These are incident to both species of copyhold; but wardship and fines to those of inheritance only. Wardship, in copyhold-estates, partakes both of that in chivalry and that in focage. Like that in chivalry, the lord is the legal guardian, who usually affigts some relation of the infant tenant to act in his stead: and he, like guardian in focage, is accountable to his ward for the profits. Of fines, some are in the nature of primer-seisins, due on the death of each tenant; others are mere fines for alienations of the lands; in some manors, only one of those forts can be demanded, in some both, and in others neither. They are sometimes arbitrary and at the will of the lord, sometimes fixed by custom; but, even when arbitrary, the courts of law, in favour of the liberty of copyholders, have tied them down to be reasonable in their extent; otherwise they might amount to difference.\nTenure of the estate. No fine therefore is allowed to be taken upon descents and alienations (unless in particular circumstances) of more than two years improved values of the estate. From this instance we may judge of the favourable disposition that the law of England (which is a law of liberty) hath always shown to this species of tenants, by removing, as far as possible, every real badge of slavery from them, however some nominal ones may continue. It suffered custom very early to get the better of the express terms upon which they held their lands; by declaring, that the will of the lord was to be interpreted by the custom of the manor; and, where no custom has been suffered to grow up to the prejudice of the lord, as in this case of arbitrary fines, the law itself interpolates in an equitable method, and will not suffer the lord to extend his power so far as to disfranchise the tenant.\n\n4. There is yet a fourth species of tenure, described by Bracton, under the name sometimes of privileged villenage, and sometimes of villein-fecage. See Privileged Villenage.\n\nHaving in the present article and those referred to, taken a compendious view of the principal and fundamental points of the doctrine of tenures, both ancient and modern, we cannot but remark the mutual connection and dependence that all of them have upon each other. And upon the whole it appears, that whatever changes and alterations these tenures have in process of time undergone, from the Saxon era to the 12 Car. II., all lay-tenures are now in effect reduced to two species; free tenure in common fecage, and bail tenure by copy of court-roll. But there is still behind one other species of tenure, referred by the statute of Charles II., which is of a spiritual nature, and called the tenure in Frank-Almoign; see that article.\n\nA particular account of the ancient tenures would to many persons be highly amusing. We can only select a few of the most singular, referring the curious reader for more information to Anderson's Origin of Commerce, Henry's History of Britain, and Blount's Fragmenta Antiquitates.\n\nIn the 19th of Henry III. Walter Gately 'held' the manor of Westcourt, in Bedington in Surrey, yielding yearly to the king one cross-bow, balilam, value twelve pence.\n\nAnno tertio Edw. I. Olofert de Lonchamp, knight, held his lands of Ovenhelle in Kent, for personally guarding the king forty days into Wales at his own expense, with one horse of five shillings value, one fack worth sixpence, and one broch for that fack. N.B. All personal services, or attendances on our kings in those times, were limited to forty days, at their own expense.\n\nThe like the same year of Laurence de Broke, who for his hamlet of Renham in Middlesex, found the king one soldier, a horse worth five shillings, a fack worth sixpence, and a broch worth twopence (this broch was a kind of cup, jug, pot, or basin), for forty days, at his own expense, wherever his army shall be within the four seas. This was settled (says Mr Blount) at the Stone Cross, which stood near the May-pole in the Strand, London, where the judges-itinerant used in old times to sit.\n\nRobert Maunfel's tenure of lands in Peverel paid the same service, and the horse, fack, and broch, of the same prices.\n\n13mo Edw. I. Henry de Averning's tenure of the manor of Morton in Essex, was to find a man, a horse worth ten shillings, four horse-shoes, a leather fack, and an iron broch.\n\nThe year following, three persons held thirty acres of land in Carleton in Norfolk, by the service of bringing the king, whenever he shall be in England, twenty-four pails of fresh herrings, at their first coming in.\n\nAnother held his manor in Norfolk of that king, by annually supplying him at his exchequer with two vessels, called maces, of wine made of pear-mains. \"Here (says our author) it is worth observing, that in King Edward the First's time pearmain cider was called wine.\" This therefore seems to account for the mention of vineyards in old times in Kent, Sussex, and other parts of England, which has so often puzzled many people to elucidate.\n\nAnother person, in the 21st of the said king, held thirty acres of land, valued at ten shillings yearly in the exchequer, or fourpence per acre, in Cambridge-shire, for furnishing a truss of hay for the king's necessary-house or privy, whenever he shall come into that county.\n\nAnother, in the 34th of that king, held a manor in Kent for providing a man to lead three greyhounds when the king shall go into Gacony, so long as a pair of shoes of fourpence should last.\n\nAnd that we may not again recur to these old tenures, we shall further add, from the same author, that in the fifth year of King Edward II. Peter Spileman made fine to the king for his lands by serjeanty, to find one to serve as a folder for forty days in England, with a coat of mail; also to find straw for the king's bed, and hay for his horse.\n\nThis article of straw for the king's bed we did not so much wonder at, when we found it in an article in William the Conqueror's time; but it is somewhat more remarkable so late as the days of King Edward II.\n\nSeveral others, we find, held their lands of the crown in those times by very different tenures. One, by paying two white capons annually; another, by carrying the king's standard whenever he happens to be in the county of Sussex; another, by carrying a rod or baton before the king on certain occasions; another, by serving the office of chamberlain of the exchequer, a very good place at present; another, by building and upholding a bridge; another, by being marshal (mene-tricum), i.e. as Mr Blount translates it, of the laundresses in the king's army; another, by acting as a serjeant-at-arms for the king's army whilst in England; one supplies a servant for the king's larder; another, for his wardrobe; others, to find servants for this or that forest; another, a hawk; one presents the king a pair of flecked hote annually; others are bound to supply folderies with armour for certain days, for the keeping this or that castle; one, viz. for the manor of Elton in Nottinghamshire, pays yearly rent of one pound weight of cummin seed, two pair of gloves, and a steel needle; another, is to repair the iron-work of the king's ploughs; Ela countess of Warwick, in the 13th year of King Edward I. held the manor of Hokenorton in Oxfordshire, in the barony of D'Oylly, by the serjeanty of\nof carving at the king's table on his birthday, and the knife then used at table.\n\nTEOS, one of the twelve Ionian cities, was situated on the south side of the Ionian peninsula, and distinguished by being the place where the poet Anacreon and the historian Hecataeus were born.\n\nTERAPHIM, or THERAPHIM, a word in the Hebrew language, which has exercised much the ingenuity of the critics. It occurs 13 or 14 times in the Old Testament, and is commonly interpreted idols. We will not trouble our readers with the numerous conjectures which have been formed respecting the meaning of this word. The only way to determine it, if it be at all possible, would be to examine and compare all the passages in which it occurs, and to consult the ancient translations. Conjectures are useless; every man may make a new one, which will have just as good a title to belief as those which have been already proposed.\n\nTERCERY, or TERCEIRA, one of the largest islands of the Azores, or Western islands, lying in the Atlantic ocean. It is about 40 miles in circumference; and surrounded with craggy rocks, which render it almost inaccessible. The soil is fertile, abounding in corn, wine, and fruits; and they have plenty of cattle to supply the ships which call there. Their principal trade is wood. The inhabitants are lively, addicted to gallantry, and are said to be extremely revengeful. It is subject to Portugal; and Angra is the capital town. W. Long, 27. 1. N.

See CONCHOLOGY Index.\n\nTERENCE, or PUBlius TERENTIUS AFER, a celebrated comic poet of ancient Rome, was born at Carthage in Africa. He was slave to Terentius Lucanus the senator; who gave him his liberty on account of his wit, his good manners, and great abilities. Terence, on his becoming a freed man, applied himself to the writing of comedies; in the execution of which he imitated Menander and the other celebrated comic poets of Greece. Cicero gives him the most pompous eulogiums, both for the purity of his language and the perspicuity and beauty of his compositions, which he considers as the rule and standard of the Latin tongue; and observes, that they were esteemed to be fine and elegant, that they were thought to have been written by Scipio and Lelius, who were then the greatest performers and the most eloquent of the Roman people. Terence died while on a voyage into Greece, about the 15th year before the Christian era. There are six of his comedies extant, of which the best editions are the Elzevir one 1635, 12mo; that cum integris notis Donati, et felici variorum, 1686, 8vo; Westervogel's, in two vols 4to, 1726; and that of Bentley the same year, 4to. Madame Dacier has given a beautiful French version of this author; and a very good English translation was published in 4to, 1768, by Mr Colman.\n\nTERM, in Law, is generally taken for a limitation of time or estate; as, a lease for term of life or years. Term, however, is more particularly used for that time wherein our courts of justice are open; in opposition to which, the rest of the year is called vacation.\n\nTerm, in Grammar, denotes some word or expression in a language.\n\nThe word term, terminus, is borrowed metaphorically, by the grammarians and philosophers, from the measurers or surveyors of lands: as a field is defined and distinguished by its termini, or limits, so is a thing or matter spoken of by the word or term it is denoted by.\n\nTERM in the Arts, or TERM of Art, is a word which, besides the literal and popular meaning which it has or may have in common language, bears a further and peculiar meaning in some art or science.\n\nTerms, the several times or seasons of the year, wherein the tribunals, or courts of judicature, are open to all who think fit to complain of wrong, or to seek their rights by due course of law, or action; and during which the courts in Westminster-hall sit and give judgment. But the high court of parliament, the chancery, and inferior courts, do not observe the terms; only the courts of king's-bench, common-pleas, and exchequer, which are the highest courts at common law. In contradiction to these, the rest of the year is called vacation.\n\nOf these terms there are four in every year, during which time matters of justice are dispatched. Hilary-term, which, at London, begins the 23rd day of January, or if that be Sunday, the next day after; and ends the 12th of February following. Easter-term, which begins the Wednesday fortnight after Easter-day, and ends the Monday next after Ascension-day. Trinity-term, beginning the Friday next after Trinity-Sunday, and ending the Wednesday fortnight after. Michaelmas-term, which begins the sixth day of November, and ends the 28th of November following. Each of these terms have also their returns. These terms are supposed by Mr Selden to have been instituted by William the Conqueror; but Sir H. Spelman hath shown, that they were gradually formed from the canonical constitutions of the church; being no other than those leisure seasons of the year which were not occupied by the great festivals or fasts, or which were not liable to the general avocations of rural business. Throughout all Christendom, in very early times, the whole year was one continual term for hearing and deciding causes. For the Christian magistrates, in order to distinguish themselves from the heathens, who were very superstitious in the observation of their dies falsi and nefasti, administered justice upon all days alike; till at length the church interposed, and exempted certain holy seasons from being profaned by the tumult of forensic litigations; as, particularly, the time of Advent and Christmas, which gave rise to the winter vacation; the time of Lent and Easter, which created that in the spring; the time of Pentecost, which produced the third; and the long vacation, between midsummer and Michaelmas, which was allowed for the hay-time and harvest. All Sundays also, and some peculiar festivals, as the days of the purification, ascension, &c. were included in the same prohibition, which was established by a canon of the church, A.D. 517, and fortified by an imperial constitution of the younger Theodosius, comprized in the Theodosian code. Afterwards, when our own legal constitution was established, the commencement and duration of our law terms\nterms were appointed, with a view to these canonical prohibitions; and it was ordered by the laws of King Edward the Confessor, that from Advent to the octave of Epiphany, from Septuagesima to the octave of Easter, from the Ascension to the octave of Pentecost, and from three in the afternoon of all Saturdays till Monday morning, the peace of God and holy church shall be kept throughout the whole kingdom.\n\nAnd so extravagant was afterwards the regard paid to these holy times, that though the author of the Mirror mentions only one vacation of considerable length, containing the months of August and September, yet Britton says, that in the reign of King Edward I. no secular plea could he held, nor any man sworn on the Evangelists, in the time of Advent, Lent, Pentecost, harvest, and vintage, the days of the great litanies, and all solemn festivals. He adds, that the bishops and prelates granted dispensations for taking affizes and juries in some of these holy feasts, upon reasonable occasions; and soon after a general dispensation was established in parliament by stat. Welf. 3 Edw. I. cap. 51, that affizes of novel disseisin, mort d'Ancestor, and darrein presentment, should be taken in Advent, Septuagesima, and Lent, as well as inquests at the special request of the king to the bishops. The portions of time that were not included within these prohibited feasts fell naturally into a fourfold division; and from some festival, or saint's day, that immediately preceded their commencement, were denominated the terms of St Hilary, of Easter, of the Holy Trinity, and of St Michael; which terms have been since regulated and abbreviated by several acts of parliament; particularly Trinity-term by stat. 32 Hen. VIII. cap. 2, and Michaelmas-term by stat. 16 Car. I. cap. 6, and again by stat. 24 Geo. II. cap. 48.\n\nTerms, Oxford. Hilary or Lent-term begins January 14th, and ends the Saturday before Palm-Sunday. Easter-term begins the tenth day after Easter, and ends the Thursday before Whitunday. Trinity-term begins the Wednesday after Trinity-Sunday, and ends after the 6th or 6th of July, sooner or later, as the vice chancellor and convocation please. Michaelmas-term begins October the 10th, and ends December the 17th.\n\nTerms, Cambridge. Lent-term begins January the 14th, and ends Friday before Palm-Sunday. Easter-term begins the Wednesday after Easter-week, and ends the week before Whitunday. Trinity-term begins the Wednesday after Trinity-Sunday, and ends the Friday after the commencement, or 2d of July. Michaelmas-term begins October the 10th, and ends December the 16th.\n\nTerms, Scottish. The court of session has two terms, the winter and summer. The winter begins on 12th November, and ends 11th March, only there is a recess of three weeks at Christmas. The summer term commences, 12th May, and ends 11th July. The court of exchequer has four terms: 1. Candlemas term begins 15th January, and ends 3rd February; 2. Whitunite term begins 12th May, and ends 2nd June; 3. Lammas term begins 17th June, and ends 5th July; 4. Martinmas term begins 24th November, and ends 20th December.\n\nTerms, Irish. In Ireland the terms are the same as at London, except Michaelmas term, which begins October the 13th, and adjourns to November the 3d, and thence to the 6th.\n\nTermines, a genus of insects belonging to the order of aptera. See Entomology Index.\n\nTerminalia, in antiquity, feasts celebrated by the Romans in honour of the god Terminus.\n\nTerminalia, a genus of plants belonging to the class polygamy. See Botany Index.\n\nTermini, in Architecture, denote a kind of statues or columns, adorned on the top with the figure of a man's, woman's, or satyr's head, as a capital; and the lower part ending in a kind of fleur or fleabard.\n\nTerminus, in Pagan worship, an ancient deity among the Romans, who presided over the stones or landmarks, called termini, which were held to sacred, that it was accounted sacrilege to move them; and as the criminal became devoted to the gods, it was lawful for any man to kill him. The worship of this deity was instituted by Numa Pompilius, who, to render landmarks, and consequently the property of the people, sacred, erected a temple on the Tarpeian mount to Terminus.\n\ntern.

The Oxford marbles tell us that he was the son of Derdeneus of Lesbos, and that he flourished in the 381st year of these records; which nearly answers to the 27th Olympiad, and 671st year B.C. The marbles inform us likewise, that he taught the nomes, or airs, of the lyre and flute, which he performed himself upon this last instrument, in concert with other players on the flute. Several writers tell us that he added three strings to the lyre, which before his time had but four; and in confirmation of this, Euclid and Strabo quote two verses, which they attribute to Terpander himself.\n\nThe tetrachord's restraint we now despise,\nThe seven-string'd lyre a nobler strain supplies.\n\nAmong the many signal services which Terpander is said to have done to music, none was of more importance than the notation that is ascribed to him for ascertaining and preserving melody, which before was traditional, and wholly dependent on memory. The invention, indeed, of musical characters has been attributed by Alypius and Gaudenius, two Greek writers on music, and upon their authority by Boethius, to Pythagoras, who flourished full two centuries after Terpander. But Plutarch, from Heraclides of Pontus, affirms us that Terpander, the inventor of nomes for the cithara, in hexameter...\nTerpander, hexameter verse, set them to music, as well as the verses of Homer, in order to sing them at the public games: And Clemens Alexandrinus, in telling us that this musician wrote the laws of Lycurgus in verse, and set them to music, makes use of the same expression as Plutarch; which seems clearly to imply a written melody.\n\nAfter enumerating the airs which Terpander had composed and to which he had given names, Plutarch continues to speak of his other compositions; among which he describes the poems, or hymns for the cithara, in heroic verse. These were used in after-times by the rhapsodists, as prologues or introductions to the poems of Homer and other ancient writers. But Terpander rendered his name illustrious, not less by his performances upon the flute and cithara than by his compositions. This appears by the marbles already mentioned; by a passage in Athenaeus, from Hellanicus, which informs us that he obtained the first prize in the musical contests at the Carnean games; and by the testimony of Plutarch, who says, \"no other proof need be urged of the excellence of Terpander in the art of playing upon the cithara, than the register of the Pythian games, from which it appears that he gained four prizes successively at those solemnities.\" Of the works of this poet only a few fragments now remain.\n\nTERRA AUSTRALIS INCognita, a name for a large unknown continent, supposed to lie towards the south pole, and which for a long time was sought after by navigators. The voyages of Captain Cook have ascertained this matter as much as it probably ever will be. (See SOUTH SEA; COOK'S DISCOVERIES, No. 47, 48, 68, 69; and AMERICA, No. 4.) On this subject Captain Cook expresses himself as follows: \"I had now made the circuit of the Southern ocean in a high latitude, and traversed it in such a manner as to leave not the least room for the possibility of there being a continent, unless near the pole, and out of the reach of navigation. By twice visiting the tropical sea, I had not only settled the situation of some old discoveries, but made there many new ones, and left, I conceive, very little more to be done even in that part. Thus I flatter myself, that the intention of the voyage has in every respect been fully answered; the southern hemisphere sufficiently explored; and a final end put to the searching after a southern continent, which has at times engrossed the attention of some of the maritime powers for near two centuries past, and been a favourite theory amongst the geographers of all ages. That there may be a continent, or large tract of land near the pole, I will not deny; on the contrary, I am of opinion there is; and it is probable that we have seen a part of it. The excellent cold, the many islands, and vast floes of ice, all tend to prove that there must be land to the south; and for my persuasion that this southern land must lie or extend farther to the north, opposite to the northern Atlantic and Indian oceans, I have already assigned some reasons; to which I may add, the greater degree of cold experienced by us in these seas than in the Southern Pacific ocean under the same parallels of latitude.\"\n\nTERRA FIRMA, in Geography, is sometimes used for a continent, in contradistinction to islands.\n\nTERRA FIRMA, otherwise called NEW CASTILE, or CAJETELLA DEL ORO, a country of America, bounded on the north by the North sea and part of the Atlantic ocean, by the same sea and Guiana on the east, by the country of the Amazons and Peru on the south, and by the Pacific ocean and Veragua on the west. It lies between 62 and 83 degrees of west longitude, and between the equator and 12 degrees of north latitude; being upwards of 1200 miles in length from east to west, and 800 in breadth from north to south. It had the name of Cajetella del Oro from the quantity of gold found in the districts of Uraba and other parts; and was first discovered by the celebrated Columbus in his third voyage.\n\nThe climate is neither pleasant nor healthy; the inhabitants one part of the year being scorched by the most intense and burning heat, and the other almost drowned with perpetual floods of rain, pouring from the sky with such violence as if a general deluge was to ensue.\n\nIn so large a tract of country the soil must necessarily vary. Accordingly, in some parts it is a barren land, or drowned mangrove land, that will scarce produce any kind of grain; in others it yields Indian corn, balsams, gums, and drugs, almost all manner of fruits as well of Old as of New Spain, sugar, tobacco, Brazilwood, and several other kinds of dyeing woods; a variety of precious stones, particularly emeralds and sapphires; venison and other game. The plantations of cacao, or chocolate nuts, in the district of the Caracas, are esteemed the best in America. The mountains abound with tygers, and, according to some, with lions, and great numbers of other wild beasts. The rivers, seas, and lakes, teem with fish, and also with alligators; and the bowels of the earth were once furnished with the richest treasures, now almost exhausted. The fame may be said of the pearl fisheries on the coast, which are far from being so profitable now as formerly.\n\nTerra Firma is a very mountainous country. Terra Firma Proper, in particular, consists of prodigious high mountains, and deep valleys flooded more than half the year. The mountains in the provinces of Cartagena and St Martha, according to Dampier, are the highest in the world: being seen at least 200 miles off: from these runs a chain of hills of almost equal height, quite through South America, as far as the straits of Magellan, called the Cordilleras des Andes. The province of Venezuela also, and district of the Caracas, the most northerly parts of South America, are almost a continued chain of hills, separated by small valleys, pointing upon the coast of the North sea. A chain of barren mountains, almost impassable, runs through the province of Popayan from north to south, some whereof are volcanoes; but towards the shores of the Pacific ocean it is a low country, flooded great part of the year.\n\nThe principal rivers of Terra Firma are, the Darien, Chatire, Santa Maria, Concepcion, Rio Grande or Magdalena, Maracaibo, and Orinoco.\n\nTerra Firma contains the provinces of Terra Firma Proper or Darien, of Cartagena, St Martha, Rio de la Hacha, Venezuela, Comana, New Andalusia or Paria, New Granada, and Popayan.\n\nTerra Firma Proper lies in the form of a crescent, about the spacious bay of Panama, being the isthmus which joins South and North America; and extending in length between the two seas 300 miles, but in breadth, where the isthmus is narrowest, only 60. Here are found gold mines, gold sands, and fine pearls; and though the land is generally rough, there are some fruitful valleys, watered by rivers, brooks, and springs. The chief places are Panama and Porto Bello.\n\nThe inhabitants of Terra Firma have never been thoroughly subdued, and in all probability never will; as they\nTERRA Japonica, or Catechu, a drug which was formerly supposed to be an extract from the seeds of the areca catechu, is obtained from the mimosa catechu.

See PUZZOLANA.\n\nTERRA Filia, Son of the Earth, a student of the university of Oxford, formerly appointed in public acts to make satirical and jesting speeches against the members thereof, to tax them with any growing corruptions, &c.\n\nTERRACE, a walk or bank of earth, raised in a garden or court to a due elevation for a prospect. The name is also given to the roofs of houses that are flat, and wherein we may walk.\n\nTERRAQUEOUS, in Geography, a name given to our globe, because consisting of land and water.\n\nTERRAS, or TARRAS, in Mineralogy, a species of argillaceous earth, differing little from puzzolana, but in being more compact and hard, porous and spongy. It is generally of a whitish yellow colour, and contains more heterogeneous particles, as spar, quartz, flint, &c., and something more calcareous earth; it effervesces with acids, is magnetic, and fusible per se. When pulverized, it serves as a cement, like puzzolana. It is found in Germany and Sweden.\n\nA species of red earth has been found in the parish of St Elizabeth in Jamaica, which turns out to be an excellent substitute for terras or puzzolana earth, and may therefore be of great value to the inhabitants of the West Indies.\n\nOne measure of this earth, mixed with two of well slaked lime, and one of sand, forms a cement that answers extremely well for buildings in water, for it soon hardens and becomes like a stone.\n\nTERRASON, ABBE JOHN, a French writer, born at Lyons in 1669. He distinguished himself in the dispute concerning Homer, between La Motte and Madame Dacier, by writing a Dissertation contre l'Ilinde. He wrote a political and moral romance called Sethos, full of learning and philosophy; and another capital work of his is a French translation of Diodorus Siculus. He died in 1750.\n\nTERRA Verte, in the colour-trade, the name of a green earth much used by painters, both singly for a good standing green, and in mixture with other colours. The name is French, and signifies \"green earth.\"\n\nIt is an indurated clay, of a deep bluish green colour, and is found in the earth, not in continued strata or beds, as most of the other earths are, but in large flat masses of different sizes, imbedded in other strata; these break irregularly in the cutting, and the earth is generally brought out of the pit in lumps of different sizes. It is of a fine, regular, and even structure, and not very hard. It is of an even and glossy surface, very smooth to the touch, and in some degree resembling the morochthus or French chalk, but adhering firmly to the tongue. It does not stain the hand in touching it; but being drawn along a rough surface, it leaves an even white line, with a greenish cast.\n\nIt does not effervesc with acids, and burns to a dusky brown colour. It is dug in the island of Cyprus, and in many parts of France and Italy. That from the neighbourhood of Verona has been esteemed the best in the world; but of late there has been some dug in France that equals it. There is also an earth dug on Mendip Hills, in the sinking for coal, which, though wholly unobserved, is nearly, if not wholly, of equal value. When scraped, and the finer parts separated, it is ready to be made up with oil for the use of the painters, and makes the most true and lasting green of any simple body they use.\n\nTERRESTRIAL, something partaking of the nature of earth, or belonging to the globe of earth; thus we say, the terrestrial globe, &c.\n\nTERRIER, a small hound to hunt the fox or badger; so called because he creeps into the ground, as ferrets do into the coney-burrows, after the fox, &c.\n\nTERRITORY, in Geography, denotes an extent or compass of land, within the bounds or belonging to the jurisdiction of any state, city, or other subdivision of a country.\n\nTERROR. See Fear and Fright.\n\nTERTIAN FEVER. See Medicine, no 126.\n\nTERTULLIAN, or QUINTUS SEPTIMUS FLORENS TERTULLIANUS, a celebrated priest of Carthage, was the son of a centurion in the militia, who served as pro-consul of Africa. He was educated in the Pagan religion; but being convinced of its errors, embraced Christianity, and became a zealous defender of the faith. He married, it is thought, after his baptism. Afterwards he took orders, and went to Rome; where, during the persecution under the emperor Severus, he published his Apology for the Christians, which is, in its kind, a masterpiece of eloquence and learning; and at the beginning of the third century he embraced the sect of the Montanists. He lived to a very great age, and died under the reign of Antoninus Caracalla, about the year 216. Many of his works are still extant, in all of which he discovers a great knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, a lively imagination, a strong, elevated, and impetuous style, great eloquence and strength of reasoning; but is sometimes obscure. His Apology and Prescriptions are most esteemed. The best editions of his works are those of Rigault; especially that of Venice in 1746, folio. Pamellus and Alix, Mr Thomas, and the Sieur du Foffé, have written his life; and Rigault, M. de l'Aube Epine, Father Petau, and other learned men, have published notes on his works.\n\nTERUNCIOUS, in antiquity, a very small brass coin in use among the Romans.\n\nThe inconvenience of such very small pieces being soon found, the teruncius became disused, but its name is still retained in reckoning, and thus it became a money of account. The teruncius at first was a quarter of the as, or libra; hence, as the as contained twelve ounces, the teruncius contained three, whence the name, which is formed of the Latin tres unciae. Teruncius was also used for the quarter of the denarius; so that when the denarius was at ten ases, the teruncius was worth two and a half; and when the denarius was risen to fifteen, the teruncius was worth four. See DENARIUS.\n\nTESSELATED PAVEMENTS, those of rich mosaic work, made of curious square marbles, bricks, or tiles, called tesserae from their resembling dice.\n\nTESSERA, in Roman antiquity, denoted in its primary sense a cube or dye; so called from the Greek word τεσσαρα or τεσσαρα, four; respect being had to its number.\nnumber of sides, distinct from the two horizontal planes above and below. And it was thus distinguished from the talus, which being round at each end, contained only four planes or faces on which it could stand; and therefore when thrown had no more than two side faces in view. Hence ludere talis et ludere tellorius, are spoken of by Roman writers as two different games. The syllable tes occurs often in Roman inscriptions. The word telleria was applied to many other things, not so much from a multitude in the figure, as from the relation they bore to some other thing of which they were the sign or token; as the points on the upper plane of the dye denoted the good or ill success of the cast.\n\nThe telleria hospitalis was either public or private. As to the former, we find among the inscriptions published by Gruter instances of two municipal towns which put themselves under the patronage of the Roman governor; and the reciprocal engagement between them, engraved on two copperplates, in the form of an oblong square, with a pediment at the top, is called in both telleria hospitalis. The design of it was to cultivate or maintain a lasting friendship between private persons and their families; and gave a mutual claim to the contracting parties and their descendants of a reception and kind treatment at each other's houses, as occasion offered. For which end those telleria were so contrived as best to preserve the memory of that transaction to posterity. And one method of doing this was by dividing one of them lengthwise into two equal parts; upon each of which one of the parties wrote his name, and interchanged it with the other. From this custom came the prevailing expression telleram hospitalen confingere, applied to persons who violated their engagements.\n\nThe telleria frumentarie were small tallies given by the emperors to the populace at Rome, entitling them to the reception of a quantity of corn from the public at stated seasons. The person who had the inspection of these was called tellarius. They were made of wood and of stone.\n\nThere was another kind of telleria which intitled persons to a right of the public games and other diversions, usually made in the form of an oblong square.\n\nThe telleria militaris was a signal given by the general or chief commander of an army, as a direction to the soldiers for executing any duty or service required of them. This, upon urgent occasions, was only vocal; but, in ordinary cases, it was written on a tablet, commonly made of wood. Beside these civil and military telleria, there are others which relate to religious affairs, and may be called sacred.\n\nTESSON, or TESTON. See TESSTER.\n\nTESSOUWA, a considerable town in Africa, situated east of Mourzouk, the capital of the kingdom of Fezzan. Near this town a deep and rapid stream is said to have existed, but was overwhelmed by the moving sands so frequent in Africa.\n\nTEST, a vessel used in metallurgy for absorbing the scoriae of metallic bodies when melted. See CUPEL, under ORES, Reduction of.\n\nTEST-Act, in Law, is the statute 25 Car. II. cap. 2, which directs all officers, civil and military, to take the oaths, and make the declaration against transubstantiation, in the court of King's Bench, or Chancery, the next term, or at the next quarter-sessions, or (by subsequent statutes) within six months after their admission; and also within the same time to receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the usage of the church of England, in some public church, immediately after divine service or sermon, and to deliver into court a certificate thereof signed by the minister and church warden, and also to prove the same by two credible witnesses, upon forfeiture of 5l. and disfability to hold the said office.\n\nThe avowed object of this act was to exclude from places of trust all members of the church of Rome; and hence the dissenters of that age, if they did not support the bill when passing through the two houses of parliament, gave it no opposition. For this part of their conduct they have been often censured with severity, as having betrayed their rights from resentment to their enemies. But is this a fair state of the case? Were any rights in reality betrayed? That the dread of a popish successor and of popish influence was the immediate and urgent cause of passing the test-act, is indeed true; but that the legislature, when guarding against an impending evil, had not likewise a retrospect to another from which they had so recently been delivered, is not so evident. If it be proper to support an established church as a branch of the constitution, and if the test-act be calculated to afford that support to the church of England, it is probable that the deliberations of parliament were as much influenced by the dread of puritanic fury, and a renewal of the covenant, as by apprehensions of a persecution from a popish king and popish councils. That the members of the church established by law in England had as much reason to dread the effects of power in the hands of Puritans as in the hands of Papists, no impartial man will controvert, who is not a stranger to that period of our national history; and that it was the duty of the legislature by every method in their power to provide for the security of the constitution against the machinations of both its enemies, will be admitted by all but such as are in love with anarchy on the one hand, or with despotism on the other.\n\nMany people, when they talk or write of the test-act, seem to think that it was framed in opposition to the religious opinions of the church of Rome; and finding the Protestant dissenters, who abhor these opinions, deprived by it of their civil rights, they speak with indignation of a law which confounds the innocent with the guilty. But all this proceeds from a palpable mistake of the purpose of the test. As the legislature had no authority to make laws against any opinions whatever, on account of their being false in theology; so it is not to be supposed that, in their deliberations on the test-act, the members of that august body took into their consideration the comparative orthodoxy of the distinguishing tenets of the Catholics and Puritans. As a religious sect they might esteem the latter much more than the former; but if they found that both had combined with their theological doctrines opinions respecting civil and ecclesiastical government, inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the English constitution, they had an undoubted right to enact a law, by which none should be admitted to offices, in the execution of which they could injure the constitution, without previously giving security that their administration should support it in all its branches. It had not then been doubted, nor is there reason to doubt yet, but that an established religion is necessary, in conjunction with civil govern-\nment, to preserve the peace of society; and therefore in every well regulated state an established religion must be supported, not because it is the duty of the civil magistrate to conduct his subjects to future happiness, but because he cannot without such an establishment preserve among them present tranquillity. The establishment which must best answer this purpose, is that which, teaching the great and unchangeable duties of morality, is most acceptable in its government and forms of worship to the majority of the people; and therefore in giving a legal establishment to one constitution of the church in preference to all others, it is only this circumstance, and not the comparative purity of the rival churches, viewed merely as ecclesiastical corporations, to which it is the business of the legislature to pay attention. At the time when the test-act passed the two houses of parliament, the established church of England was certainly more acceptable to the great body of the people and to all ranks in the state, than any one of the sects, whether Catholic or Protestant, which differed from her; and therefore it was the duty of the legislature to preserve to that church all her privileges and immunities, and to prevent those hostile sectaries from doing her injury in the discharge of any civil office with which they might be entrusted. It was with this view that the test-act was formed; and it is with the same view that the legislature has hitherto rejected every petition for its repeal. In doing so, it deprives no man of his rights, far less of rights which conscience calls upon him to maintain at every hazard; for the rights of individuals to hold civil offices are not inherent, but derived from the legislature, which of course must be the judge upon what terms they are to be held. The legislature of England has excluded from many offices, civil and military, every man who will not give security, that in the discharge of his public duty he will support the church established by law; and as the test of his intention it requires him, before he enters upon his office, to renounce the doctrine of transubstantiation, and receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper in some public church, according to the liturgy of the church of England. Whether this be the most proper test that could have been enacted, may well be questioned; but that in a country abounding with sectaries of various denominations, who agree in nothing but venomous hostility to the religious establishment, some test is necessary, seems incontrovertible, if it be the business of the legislature to preserve the public peace.\n\nTo this it will be replied, That the public peace in Scotland is preserved without a test, and that therefore a test cannot be necessary in England. This is plausible, but not conclusive. For 40 years after the Revolution, there was in Scotland no denomination of Christians but those of the Presbyterian church, established by law, the Protestant Episcopalians, whose church had been established prior to that event, and the adherents to the church of Rome. The Episcopalians and Papists were effectually excluded from every office in which they could injure the ecclesiastical establishment, by the several restrictions under which they were laid, on account of their attachment, real or supposed, to the abdicated family of Stuart. The penal laws operated upon them more powerfully than a religious test. It is to be observed too, that in the church of Scotland, though her clergy are better provided for than any other parochial clergy perhaps in Europe (A), there is nothing of that splendor and temporal power which in England excite envy to clamour against the establishment, under the pretence of maintaining the cause of religious liberty. Yet even in Scotland a religious test is occasionally exacted of civil officers. In the royal boroughs of that part of the united kingdom, no man can hold the office of a magistrate without previously swearing the burgess-oath (see SECEDE, No. 8.), and every instructor of youth, whether in schools or colleges, may be called upon to qualify himself for his office, by subscribing the established Confession of Faith. The burgess-oath is a more effectual test than that which is required of magistrates in England; for a man might with a safe conscience receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper occasionally in a church \"at which he would not swear to abide and defend the same to his life's end.\" This test appears to us to be necessary in boroughs, where faction is commonly blended with fanaticism; and if those sectaries which, at their first appearance in 1732, were insignificant, if not contemptible, continue to multiply, and to imbibe principles much more pernicious than those which were held by their fathers, it may perhaps be found expedient to extend some test over the whole country.\n\nWe do not, however, by any means, wish to see the sacramental test introduced into Scotland. A test may be necessary to secure to the church all her rights and immunities; but to receive the sacrament can give her no such security, whilst it leads inevitably to the profanation of a sacred ordinance. A much better test would be, to require every man, before he be admitted to an executive office, to swear that in the discharge of it he will be careful to maintain all the rights and privileges of the church established by law. Such an oath no sensible and peaceable dissenters could refuse; for it would not bind him to communicate with the established church; and he cannot be ignorant that it belongs not to the executive government, but to the legislature, to determine what shall be the religion of the state. On this account, we cannot help thinking that the members\n\n(A) There are indeed many livings in the church of England, and probably in other churches, to which nothing in the church of Scotland can be compared in respect of emolument; but these rich benefices bear no proportion to the number of those which, in this age of unavoidable expense, cannot afford to the incumbents the means of decent subsistence as gentlemen. In the church of Scotland many livings amount to 200l. each annually; and we have reason to hope, that when the present plan for augmenting the stipends of the clergy has been extended over Scotland, very few will be below 100l.; whilst in England the vicarages and small rectories, from which we have reason to believe that the incumbents reap not 80l. a-year, greatly exceed in number all the livings in Scotland? Nay we doubt if there be not upwards of a thousand livings in England and Wales from which the rector or vicar derives not above 50l. annually.\nof the legislative body should be subjected to no religious test whatever, that they may be at freedom to reform the corruptions of the church, or to exchange one establishment for another, should they find such exchange expedient. If this reasoning be just, it will be difficult to vindicate that clause of 25 Car. II. and of 1 Geo. I., in which it is enacted, that no member shall vote or sit in either house of parliament till he hath, in the presence of the house, subscribed and repeated the declaration against transubstantiation, the invocation of saints, and the sacrifice of the mass. The church of Rome is indeed a very corrupt society; but if it be not for the purity of her doctrines and government that any church is established in preference to all others, why should that particular church be precluded from the possibility of obtaining a legal establishment in Great Britain, even though the were to become most acceptable to the majority of all ranks in the kingdom? The English Catholics have unquestionably greater reason to complain of this test, than either they or the dissenters have to complain of the law which requires every civil and military officer to receive the Lord's Supper in the established church.\n\n**Test for Acids and Alkalies.** See Chemistry.\n\n**Test Liquors for Wines.** See Wine.\n\n**TESTACEA,** in the Linnaean system, comprehends the third order of vermes, or shell-fish. See Conchology Index.\n\n**TESTACEOUS,** in Natural History, an epithet synonymous with Testacea. See above.\n\n**TESTAMENT,** or Last Will. Testaments both Justinian and Sir Edward Coke agree to be so called, because they are testamentum: an etymon which seems to favour too much of conceit; it being plainly a substantive derived from the verb aghari, in like manner as juramentum, incrementum, and others, from other verbs. The definition of the old Roman lawyers is much better than their etymology; voluntatis nostrae justa sententia de eo, quod quis post mortem suam fieri velit: which may be thus rendered into English, \"the legal declaration of a man's intentions, which he wills to be performed after his death.\" It is called sententia, to denote the circumcision and prudence with which it is supposed to be made: it is voluntatis nostrae sententia, because its efficacy depends on its declaring the testator's intention, whence in English it is emphatically styled his will; it is justa sententia; that is, drawn, attested, and published, with all due solemnities and forms of law; it is de eo, quod quis post mortem suam fieri velit, because a testament is of no force till after the death of the testator.\n\nThese testaments are divided into two sorts; written, and verbal or nuncupative; of which the former is committed to writing; the latter depends merely upon oral evidence, being declared by the testator in extremitate, before a sufficient number of witnesses, and afterwards reduced to writing.\n\nBut as nuncupative wills and codicils (which were formerly more in use than at present when the art of writing is become more general) are liable to great impositions, and may occasion many perjuries, the statute of frauds, 29 Car. II. c. 3, enacts, 1. That no written will shall be revoked or altered by a subsequent nuncupative one, except the same be in the lifetime of the testator reduced to writing, and read over to him, and approved; and unless the same be proved to have been so done by the oaths of three witnesses at the least, who, by statute 4 and 5 Anne, c. 16, must be such as are admissible upon trials at common law. 2. That no nuncupative will shall in anywise be good, where the estate bequeathed exceeds 30l. unless proved by three such witnesses, present at the making thereof (the Roman law requiring seven), and unless they or some of them were specially required to bear witness thereto by the testator himself; and unless it was made in his last sickness, in his own habitation or dwelling-house, or where he had been previously resident ten days at the least, except he be surprised with sickness on a journey, or from home, and dies without returning to his dwelling. 3. That no nuncupative will shall be proved by the witnesses after six months from the making, unless it were put in writing within six days. Nor shall it be proved till fourteen days after the death of the testator, nor till process hath first issued to call in the widow, or next of kin, to contest it if they think proper. Thus hath the legislature provided against any fraud in setting up nuncupative wills, by so numerous a train of requisites, that the thing itself has fallen into disuse; and hardly ever heard of, but in the only instance where favour ought to be shown to it, when the testator is surprised by sudden and violent sickness. The testamentary words must be spoken with an intent to bequeath, not any loose idle discourse in his illness; for he must require the bystanders to bear witness of such his intention; the will must be made at home, or among his family or friends, unless by unavoidable accident, to prevent impositions from strangers: it must be in his last sickness; for if he recovers, he may alter his dispositions, and have time to make a written will; it must not be proved at too long a distance from the testator's death, lest the words should escape the memory of the witnesses; nor yet too hastily and without notice, lest the family of the testator should be put to inconvenience or surprize.\n\nAs to written wills, they need not any witness of their publication. We speak not here of devises of lands, which are entirely another thing, a conveyance by statute, unknown to the feudal or common law, and not under the same jurisdiction as personal testaments. But a testament of chattels, written in the testator's own hand, though it has neither his name nor seal to it, nor witnesses present at its publication, is good; provided sufficient proof can be had that it is his hand-writing. And though written in another man's hand, and never signed by the testator, yet if proved to be according to his instructions and approved by him, it hath been held a good testament of the personal estate. Yet it is the safer and more prudent way, and leaves less in the breast of the ecclesiastical judge, if it be signed or sealed by the testator, and published in the presence of witnesses; which last was always required in the time of Bracton; or rather he in this respect has implicitly copied the rule of the civil law.\n\nNo testament is of any effect till after the death of the testator; Nam omne testamentum morte confirmando est, et voluntas testatoris est ambulatoria usque ad mortem. And therefore, if there be many testaments, the last will overthrows all the former; but the republication of a former will revoke one of a later date, and establishes the first again.\n\nRegularly, every person hath full power and liberty to make a will, that is not under some special prohibition by\nTestament by law or custom; which prohibitions are principally upon three accounts; for want of sufficient discretion; for want of sufficient liberty and free-will; and on account of criminal conduct.\n\n1. In the first species are to be reckoned infants, under the age of 14 if males, and 12 if females; which is the rule of the civil law. For though some of our common lawyers have held that an infant of any age (even four years old) might make a testament, and others have denied that under 18 he is capable; yet as the ecclesiastical court is the judge of every testator's capacity, this case must be governed by the rules of the ecclesiastical law. So that no objection can be admitted to the will of an infant of 14, merely for want of age; but if the testator was not of sufficient discretion, whether at the age of 14 or 24, that will overthrow his testament. Madmen, or otherwise non compos mentis, idiots or natural fools, persons grown childhood by reason of old age or distemper, such as have their senses befogged with drunkenness,—all these are incapable, by reason of mental disability, to make any will so long as such disability lasts. To this class also may be added such persons as are born deaf, blind, and dumb; who, as they have always wanted the common inlets of understanding, are incapable of having animus testamenti; and their testaments are therefore void.\n\n2. Such persons as are intestate for want of liberty or freedom of will, by the civil law are of various kinds; as prisoners, captives, and the like. But the law of England does not make such persons absolutely intestate; but only leaves it to the discretion of that court to judge upon the consideration of their particular circumstances of durefs, whether or not such persons could be supposed to have liberum animum testamenti. And with regard to feme-coverts, our laws differ still more materially from the civil. Among the Romans there was no distinction; a married woman was as capable of bequeathing as a feme-sole. But with us a married woman is not only utterly incapable of devising lands, being excepted out of the statute of wills, 34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c. 5, but also she is incapable of making a testament of chattels, without the license of her husband. For all her personal chattels are absolutely his own; and he may dispose of her chattels real, or shall have them to himself, if he survives her: it would be therefore extremely inconsistent to give her a power of defeating that provision of the law, by bequeathing those chattels to another. The queen-consort is an exception to this general rule, for she may dispose of her chattels by will, without the consent of her lord; and any feme-covert may make her will of goods which are in her possession in auter droit, as executrix or administratrix; for these can never be the property of the husband: and if she has any pin-money or separate maintenance, it is said she may dispose of her savings thereout by testament, without the control of her husband. But if a female sole makes her will, and afterwards marries, such subsequent marriage is deemed a revocation in law, and entirely vacates the will.\n\n3. Persons incapable of making testaments on account of their criminal conduct, are in the first place all traitors and felons, from the time of conviction; for then their goods and chattels are no longer at their own disposal, but forfeited to the king. Neither can a felon de se make a will of goods and chattels, for they are forfeited by the act and manner of his death; but he may make a devise of his lands, for they are not subject to any forfeiture. Outlaws also, though it be but for debt, are incapable of making a will so long as the outlawry subsists, for their goods and chattels are forfeited during that time. As for persons guilty of other crimes, short of felony, who are by the civil law precluded from making testaments (as usurers, libellers, and others of a worse stamp), at the common law their testaments may be good. And in general the rule is, and has been to at least ever since Glanvil's time, quod liberum fit cujuscumque ultima voluntas.\n\nTestaments may be avoided three ways: 1. If made by a person labouring under any of the incapacities before-mentioned; 2. By making another testament of a later date; and, 3. By cancelling or revoking it. For though I make a last will and testament irrevocable in the strongest words, yet I am at liberty to revoke it; because my own act or words cannot alter the disposition of law, so as to make that irrevocable which is in its own nature revocable. For this, faith Lord Bacon, would be for a man to deprive himself of that which, of all other things, is most incident to human condition; and that is, alteration or repentance. It hath also been held, that, without an express revocation, if a man, who hath made his will, afterwards marries and hath a child, this is a presumptive or implied revocation of his former will which he made in his state of celibacy. The Romans were also wont to lay aside testaments as being inofficioso, deficient in natural duty, if they disdained or totally passed by (without affixing a true and sufficient reason) any of the children of the testator. But if the child had any legacy, though ever so small, it was a proof that the testator had not lost his memory or his reason, which otherwise the law presumed; but was then supposed to have acted thus for some substantial cause: and in such case no querela inofficioso testamenti was allowed. Hence probably has arisen that groundless vulgar error of the necessity of leaving the heir a shilling, or some other express legacy, in order to disinherit him effectually; whereas the law of England makes no such wild supposition of forgetfulness or insanity; and therefore, though the heir or next of kin be totally omitted, it admits no inofficioso to set aside such a testament.\n\nTESTAMENT, in Scots Law.

See LYRE.\n\nTESTUDO, in the military art of the ancients, was a kind of cover or screen which the soldiers, e.g., a whole company, made themselves of their bucklers, by holding them up over their heads, and standing close to each other. This expedient served to shelter them from darts, stones, &c. thrown upon them, especially those thrown from above, when they went to the assault.\n\nTESTUDO, was also a kind of large wooden tower which moved on several wheels, and was covered with bullock-hides, serving to shelter the soldiers when they approached the walls to mine them, or to batter them with rams.

Of these Teutones, Virgil is to be understood in the epithet Teutonicus, an appellation which more lately came to be applied to the Germans in general, and later still the appellation Alemanni.\n\nThe Teutones, in conjunction with the Cimbri and Ambiones, made war on the Romans, and marched towards Italy in the year 101 B.C. We are told, that the Teutones alone were so numerous, that they were fix whole days without intermission in passing by the Roman camp. In Transalpine Gaul they engaged the Roman consul Marius; but were defeated with incredible slaughter; 100,000 of them, according to the lowest calculations, being killed on the spot. According to others, the number of those killed and taken prisoners amounted to 200,000. The inhabitants made fences for vineyards of their bones.

After the death of Barbarossa, the Germans, who had signalized themselves before Acre or Ptolemais, resolved to choose another leader; and at last fixed their choice upon Frederic duke.\nduke of Swabia, second son to the emperor, and Henry duke of Brabant. Under these generals they behaved with so much bravery, that Henry king of Jerusalem, the patriarch, and several other princes, determined to reward their valour by instituting an order of knighthood in their favour. This was accordingly done; and our new knights had at first the title of the knights of St George; afterwards it was thought proper to put them under the tutelage of the Virgin Mary, to whom there was already an hospital dedicated on Mount Zion, for the relief of German pilgrims. From this time they were called Equites Marianii, or knights of St Mary. Laws, regulations, and statutes, were drawn up for them by the Christian kings in Syria and the patriarch; and among other obligations it was required, that every person admitted to the privileges of the order should be of noble parentage; that the order should defend the Christian religion and the Holy Land; that they should exercise hospitality towards the Christians in general, but particularly those of their own country; and that they should with all their power endeavour to propagate and extend the Christian faith and the religion of Jesus. In the year 1192, having become rich by donations from the superstitious, they elected their first grand-master, Henry Walpot, a German, who had distinguished himself by his zeal and valour; and their choice was confirmed by the emperor. The following year, Pope Celestine III. confirmed their privileges already granted, giving them the title of the Teutonic knights of the hospital of St Mary the Virgin. By the conditions of this bull, they vowed perpetual continence, obedience, and poverty; obligations which it may well be imagined were not very strictly kept.

See Tabor.\n\nTHALES, a celebrated Greek philosopher, and the first of the seven wise men of Greece, was born at Miletus about 640 B.C. In order to improve himself in the knowledge of the sciences, he travelled into Egypt, where he discoursed with the priests and other learned men. Some say that he married; but others observe, that he eluded the solicitations of his mother on this head, by telling her, when he was young, that it was too soon; and afterwards, that it was too late. Thales acquired great reputation by his wisdom and learning; he was the first among the Greeks who foretold eclipses of the sun, and made extraordinary discoveries in astronomy. Thales was the author of the Ionian sect of philosophers, who were thus called from his being born at Miletus, a city of Ionia. He maintained that water was the principle of which all the bodies in the universe are composed; that the world was the work of God; and that God sees the most secret thoughts in the heart of man. He said, \"That the most difficult thing in the world is to know ourselves; the most easy to advise others; and the most sweet to accomplish our desires. That, in order to live well, we ought to abstain from what we find fault with in others. That the bodily facility conflicts in health, and that of the mind in knowledge. That the most ancient of beings is God, because he is uncreated; that nothing is more beautiful than the world, because it is the work of God; nothing more extensive than space, quicker than spirit, stronger than necessity, wiser than time.\" It was also one of his sentences, \"That we ought never to say that to any one that may be turned to our prejudice; and that we should live with our friends as with persons that may become our enemies.\" He thanked God for three things; that he was born of the human, not of the brute species; a man, and not a woman; a Greek, and not a barbarian. None of the ancient philosophers ever applied themselves more carefully to the study of astronomy than Thales. Diogenes Laertius reports, that leaving his lodging with an old woman to contemplate the stars, he fell into a ditch; on which the good woman cried, \"How canst thou know what is doing in the heavens, when thou canst not perceive what is at thy feet?\" He went to see Croesus, who was marching with a powerful army into Cappadocia, and enabled him to pass the river Halys without making a bridge. Thales died soon after, at about 90 years of age. He composed several treatises in verse, on meteors, the equinoxes, &c., but they are all lost.\n\nTHALIA, in Pagan mythology, one of the nine muses.

It has been erroneously said, that its name is Isis till it arrives at Dorchester, 15 miles below Oxford, when, being joined by the Thame or Tame, it assumes the name of the Thames, which, it has been observed, is formed from a combination of the words Thame and Isis. What was the origin of this vulgar error, cannot now be traced. Poetical fiction, however, has perpetuated this error, and invested it with a kind of classical facility. \"It plainly appears (says Camden), that the river was always called Thames or Tems, before it came near the Thame; and in several ancient charters granted to the abbey of Malmesbury, as well as that of Enham, and in the old deeds relating to Cricklade, it is never considered under any other name than that of Thames.\" He likewise says, that it occurs nowhere under the name of Isis. All the historians who mention the incursions of Ethelwold into Wilshire in the year 905, or of Canute in 1016, concur likewise in the same opinion, by declaring, that they passed over the Thames at Cricklade in Wilshire. It is not probable, moreover, that Thames Head, an appellation by which the source has usually been distinguished, should give rise to a river of the name of Isis; which river, after having run half its course, should reassume the name of Thames, the appellation of its parent spring. About a mile below the source of the river is the first corn-mill, which is called Kemble Mill. Here the river may properly be said to form a constant current; which, though not more than nine feet wide in the summer, yet in the winter becomes such a torrent as to overflow the meadows for many miles around. But, in the summer, the Thames Head is so dry, as to appear nothing but a large dell, interposed with stones and weeds. From Somerford the stream winds to Cricklade, where it unites with many other rivulets. Approaching Kempsford, it again enters its native county, dividing it from Berkshire at Ingleham. It widens considerably in its way to Lechlade; and being there joined by the Lech and Coln, at the distance of 138 miles from London, it becomes navigable for vessels of 90 tons. At Enham, in its course north-east, to Oxford, is the first bridge of stone; a handsome one, of three arches, built by the earl of Abingdon. Passing by the ruins of Godstow nunnery, where the celebrated Fair Rosamond was interred, the river reaches Oxford, in whose academic groves its poetical name of Isis has been so often invoked. Being there joined by the Charwell, it proceeds south-east to Abingdon, and thence to Dorchester, where it receives the Tame. Continuing its course south-east by Wallingford to Reading, and forming a boundary to the counties of Berks, Bucks, Surrey, Middlesex, Essex, and Kent, it washes the towns of Henley, Marlow, Maidenhead, Windsor, Eton, Egham, Staines, Laleham, Chertsey, Weybridge, Shepperton, Walton, Sunbury, East and West Molesey, Hampton, Thames Ditton, Kingston, Teddington, Twickenham, Richmond, Illeworth, Brentford, Kew, Mortlake, Barnes, Chiswick, Hammersmith, Putney, Fulham, Wandsworth, Battersea, Chelsea, and Lambeth. Then, on the north bank of the river, Thames, are Westminster and London, and, on the opposite side, Southwark; forming together one continued city, extending to Limehouse and Deptford; and hence the river proceeds to Greenwich, Erith, Greenhithe, Gray's Thurrock, Gravesend, and Leigh, into the ocean. It receives in its course from Dorchester the rivers Kennet, Loddon, Coln, Wey, Mole, Wandle, Lea, Roding, Darent, and Medway. The jurisdiction of the lord mayor of London over the Thames extends from Coln ditch, a little to the west of Staines, to Yendal or Yenleet to the east, including part of the rivers Medway and Lea; and he has a deputy, named the water-bailiff, who is to search for and punish all offenders against the laws for the preservation of the river and its fish. Eight times a year the lord mayor and aldermen hold courts of conservancy for the four counties of Surry, Middlesex, Essex, and Kent. Though the Thames is said to be navigable 138 miles above the bridge, yet there are so many flats, that in summer the navigation westward would be entirely stopped, when the springs are low, were it not for a number of locks. But these are attended with considerable expense; for a barge from Lechlade to London pays for passing through them £31. 15s. 6d. and from Oxford to London £21. 8s. This charge, however, is in summer only, when the water is low; and there is no lock from London bridge to Bolter's lock; that is, for 57½ miles above the bridge. The plan of new cuts has been adopted, in some places, to shorten and facilitate the navigation. There is one near Lechlade, which runs nearly parallel to the old river, and contiguous to St John's bridge; and there is another a mile from Abingdon, which has rendered the old stream toward Culham bridge useless. But a much more important undertaking has lately been accomplished; namely, the junction of this river with the Severn. A canal had been made, by virtue of an act of parliament in 1730, from the Severn to Wallbridge, near Stroud. A new canal now ascends by Stroud, through the vale of Chalford, to the height of 343 feet, by means of 28 locks, and thence to the entrance of a tunnel near Sapperton, a distance of near eight miles. The canal is 42 feet in width at top and 30 at the bottom. The tunnel (which is extended under Sapperton hill, and under that part of Earl Bathurst's grounds called Halewood, making a distance of two miles and three furlongs) is near 15 feet in width, and can navigate barges of 70 tons. The canal descending hence 134 feet, by 14 locks, joins the Thames at Lechlade, a distance of above 20 miles. In the course of this vast undertaking, the canal, from the Severn at Froomladde to Ingleham, where it joins the Thames, is a distance of more than 30 miles. The expense of it exceeded the sum of 200,000l. of which 3000l. are said to have been expended in gunpowder alone, used for the blowing up of the rock. This new canal was completed in 1789, in less than seven years from its commencement. A communication, not only with the Trent, but with the Mersey, has likewise been effected by a canal from Oxford to Coventry; and an act of parliament has passed to extend another canal from this, at Braunton, to the Thames at Brentford. This is to be called The Grand Junction Canal. On the extensive advantages resulting from these navigable communications from the metropolis with the ports of Bristol, Liverpool, Hull, &c.\nand the principal manufacturing towns in the inland parts of the kingdom, it is needless to expatiate. The tide flows up the Thames as high as Richmond, which, following the winding of the river, is 70 miles from the ocean; a greater distance than the tide is carried by any other river in Europe. The water is esteemed extremely wholesome, and fit for use in very long voyages, during which it will work itself perfectly fine.\n\nThames is also the name of a river in the state of Connecticut in America. See the article CONNECTICUT.\n\nTHANE, or THANUS, a name given to the nobility in Britain before the time of William the Conqueror. It signifies a minister or honourable retainer, from the verb *thanian*, \"to minister.\" There were several degrees of nobility among the Anglo-Saxons; but those most commonly mentioned are the king's thanes and the alderman's thanes. The king's thanes seem to have been of three different degrees, according to their different degrees of wealth or favour at court. The alderman's thanes seem to have been of the lowest degree of nobility, and next to them those who were promoted to that dignity from their advancement in the church, from their valour, success in agriculture or commerce: for if a ceorl or farmer applied to learning and attained to priestly orders; if he acquitted himself so well as to obtain from a nobleman five hythes of land, or a gilt sword, helmet, and breast-plate, the reward of his valour; or if by his industry he had acquired the property of five hythes of land; or if he applied to trade, and made three voyages beyond sea in a ship of his own, and a cargo belonging to himself, he was denominated a thane.\n\nThe thanes, who were the only nobility among the Anglo-Saxons, were a very numerous body of men, comprehending all the considerable landholders in England, and filling up that space in society between the ceorls or yeomanry on the one hand, and the royal family on the other; which is now occupied both by the nobility and gentry. In times of war, they constituted the flower of their armies, and in times of peace they swelled the trains of their kings, and added greatly to the splendour of their courts, especially at the three great festivals of Christmas, Easter, and Whitunside.\n\nFrom this body all the chief officers, both civil and military, as aldermen, greaves, earls, heretogens, &c., were taken; and to obtain some of these offices was the great object of their ambition. Before they obtained an office, their lands were their only support; and they lived in greater or less affluence, according to the extent of their estates. They divided into two parts; one of which they called their inlands, and the other their outlands. Their inlands they kept in their own immediate possession, and cultivated them by the hands of their slaves and villains, in order to raise provisions for their families; their outlands they granted to ceorls or farmers, either for one year, or for a term of years; for which they received a certain stipulated proportion of their produce annually. These customs had long prevailed among their ancestors in Germany, and were adhered to by their posterity in England till the conquest.\n\nThe thanes were under no obligations on account of their lands, except the three following, which were indispensably necessary to the defence and improvement of their country: To attend the king with their followers in military expeditions, to assist in building and defending the royal castles, and in keeping the bridges and highways in proper repair. To these obligations all proprietors of land (even the churchmen for a long time not excepted) were subjected; and these services were considered as due to their country, rather than to the persons of their kings; and were agreed to by all as being necessary to their own preservation and convenience.\n\nThis title of thane was abolished in England at the conquest, upon the introduction of the feudal system by William. The titles of earl and baron were about the same period introduced into Scotland by Malcolm Canmore, when the title of thane fell into disuse.\n\nTHANET, an island of the county of Kent, surrounded by the sea except on the north-east side, where it is bounded by the branches of the river Stour, now inconsiderable to what they were formerly. It contains several villages, and the sea port towns of Margate and Ramsgate, and has the title of an earldom. It is celebrated for being the spot through which arts, sciences, and divine knowledge, came into this happy isle. The Britons called it Richborough, from its vicinity to the city of that name, now only a venerable ruin; but the Saxons called it Thanet, from fire, having so many beacons erected on it. It is in the north-east part of the county, lies open to the sea on the north and east, with the river Wantsum on the west and south, is about 10 miles long from the North Foreland to Sarre Bridge, and about 8 broad from Westgate to Sandwich Ferry. The north part of it is chiefly arable; and the south and west parts consist of marsh or pasture-lands. The soil is generally very fertile, especially in producing the best barley, of which it is computed above 20,000 quarters are annually sent to London.\n\nTHAPSIAS, the DEADLY CARROT, a genus of plants belonging to the class pentandria, and in the natural system ranging under the 45th order, umbellatae. See BOTANY Index.\n\nTHAWING, the revolution of ice into its former fluid state by the warmth of the air. See CONGELATION and FROST.\n\nTHEA. See TEA.\n\nTHEATINES, a religious order in the Roman church, so called from their principal founder John Peter Caraffa, then bishop of Theate, or Chieti, in the kingdom of Naples, and afterwards pope, under the name of Paul IV. The names of the other founders were Gaetan, Boniface, and Configliere. These four pious men desiring to reform the ecclesiastical state, laid the foundation of an order of regular clerks at Rome in the year 1524. Pope Clement VII. approved the institution, and permitted the brethren to make the three religious vows, to elect a superior every three years, and to draw up statutes for the regulation of the order. They were the first who endeavoured, by their example, to revive among the clergy the poverty of the apostles and first disciples of our Saviour, and were also the first who assumed the title of regular clerks.\n\nTHEATRE, a place in which shows or dramatic representations are exhibited.\n\nFor the origin of the dramatic art we always turn our eyes to Greece, the nursery of the arts and sciences. It may indeed have been known among more ancient nations,\nnations, but no records remain sufficient to support this opinion. The different states of Greece asserted their claim to the honour of having given it birth, but the account of the Athenians is most generally received. It derived its origin from the hymns which were sung in the festivals of Bacchus in honour of that deity. While these resounded in the ears of the multitude, choruses of Bacchants and Fauns, ranged round certain obscene images which they carried in triumphal procession, chanted lascivious songs, and sometimes sacrificed individuals to public ridicule.\n\nThis was the practice in the cities; but a still greater licentiousness reigned in the worship paid to the false divinity by the inhabitants of the country, and especially at the festival when they gathered the fruits of his beneficence. Vintagers, befouled with wine-lees, and intoxicated with joy and the juice of the grape, rode forth in their carts, and attacked each other on the road with grofs sarcasms, revenging themselves on their neighbours with ridicule, and on the rich by publishing their injustice.\n\nAmong the poets who flourished at that time, some celebrated the great actions and adventures of gods and heroes, and others attacked with asperity the vices and absurdities of individuals. The former took Homer for their model, and supported themselves by his example, of which they made an improper use. Homer, the most tragic of poets, the model of all who have succeeded him, had in the Iliad and the Odyssey brought to perfection the heroic poem, and in his Margites had employed pleasantry. But as the charm of his works depends in a great measure on the passions and motion with which he knew to animate them, the poets who came after him endeavoured to introduce into theirs an action which might excite emotion or mirth in the spectators: some even attempted to produce both, and ventured certain rude essays, which have since been styled indifferently either tragedies or comedies, because they unite the characters of those two dramas. The authors of these sketches have been distinguished by no discovery; they only form in the history of the art a succession of names which it would be useless to recall to light.\n\nThe necessity and power of theatrical interest was already known. The hymns in honour of Bacchus, while they described his rapid progress and splendid conquests, became imitative; and in the contests of the Pythian games, the players on the flute who entered into competition were enjoined by an express law to represent successively the circumstances that had preceded, accompanied, and followed the victory of Apollo over Python.\n\nSome years after this regulation, Sufarion and Thespis, both born in a small borough of Attica, named Icaria, appeared each at the head of a company of actors, the one on a kind of stage, the other in a cart (A). The former attacked the vices and absurdities of his time; and the latter treated more noble subjects, which he took from history.\n\nThe comedies of Sufarion were in the same taste with those indecent and satirical farces which were afterwards performed in some of the cities of Greece. They were long the favourite entertainment of the country people. Athens did not adopt this species of exhibition until after it was brought to perfection in Sicily.\n\nThespis had more than once seen in the festivals, in which as yet hymns only were sung, one of the fingers, mounted on a table, form a kind of dialogue with the chorus. From this hint he conceived the idea of introducing into the tragedies an actor who, by simple recitals introduced at intervals, should give relief to the chorus, divide the action, and render it more interesting. This happy innovation, together with some other liberties in which he had allowed himself, gave alarm to the legislator of Athens, who was more able than any other person to discern the value or danger of the novelty. Solon condemned a species of composition in which the ancient traditions were disguised by fictions. \"If we applaud falsehood in our public exhibitions (said he to Thespis), we shall soon find that it will insinuate itself into our most sacred engagements.\"\n\nThe excessive approbation and delight with which both the city and country received the pieces of Thespis and Sufarion, at once justified and rendered useless the suspicious foresight of Solon. The poets, who till then had only exercised their genius in dithyrambics and licentious satire, struck with the elegant forms which these species of composition began to assume, dedicated their talents to tragedy and comedy. Soon after a greater variety was introduced in the subjects of the former of these poems. Those who judged of their pleasures only from habit exclaimed, that these subjects were foreign to the worship of Bacchus; but the greater number thronged with still more eagerness after the new pieces.\n\nPhrynicus, the disciple of Thespis, made choice of that kind of verse which is most suitable to the drama, was the author of some other changes, and left tragedy in its infancy.\n\nÆschylus received it from his hands enveloped in a rude vestment, its visage covered with false colours, or a mask inexpresive of character, without either grace or dignity in its motions, inspiring the desire of an interest which it with difficulty excited, still attached to the buffooneries which had amused its infant years, and expressing its conceptions sometimes with elegance and dignity, but frequently in a feeble and low style, polluted with grofs obscenities.\n\nIn his first tragedies he introduced a second actor; and afterward, copying the example of Sophocles, who had just entered on his theatrical career, he admitted a third, and sometimes even a fourth. By this multiplicity of personages, one of his actors became the hero of the piece, and attracted to himself the principal interest; and as the chorus now held only a subaltern station, Æschylus took care to shorten its part, and perhaps even carried this precaution too far.\n\nHe is censured for having admitted mute characters into his drama. Achilles, after the death of his friend, and Niobe, after the destruction of her children, appear\n\n(A) Sufarion represented his first pieces towards the year 580 before Christ. Some years after, Thespis made his first attempts in tragedy, and acted his Alcestis in 536.\non the stage, and remain during several scenes motionless, with their heads covered with a veil, and without uttering a word; but if their eyes had overflowed with tears, and they had poured forth the bitterest lamentations, could they have produced an effect so terrible as this veil, this silence, and this abandonment to grief?\n\nIt was not sufficient that the noble and elevated style of tragedy should leave in the minds of the auditors a strong impression of grandeur; to captivate the multitude, it was requisite that every part of the spectacle should concur to produce the same effect. It was then the general opinion that nature, by bestowing on the ancient heroes a more lofty stature, had impressed on their persons a majesty which procured them as much respect from the people as the ensigns of dignity by which they were attended. Æschylus therefore raised his actors on high stilts or buckles. He covered their features, which were frequently disagreeable, with a mask that concealed their irregularity. He clothed them in flowing and magnificent robes, the form of which was so decent, that the priests of Ceres have not blushed to adopt it. The inferior actors were also provided with masks and dresses suited to their parts.\n\nInstead of those wretched scaffolds which were formerly erected in haste, he obtained a theatre furnished with machines, and embellished with decorations. Here the sound of the trumpet was reverberated, incense was seen to burn on the altars, the shades of the dead to arise from the tomb, and the furies to rush from the gulfs of Tartarus. In one of his pieces these infernal divinities appeared, for the first time, with masks of a horrid paleness, torches in their hands, serpents intertwined in their hair, and followed by a numerous retinue of dreadful spectres. It is said that, at the sight of them, and the sound of their terrific howlings, terror seized on the whole assembly, women miscarried, and children expired with fear; and that the magistrates, to prevent similar accidents in future, commanded that the chorus should consist only of fifteen actors instead of fifty.\n\nThe effect of so many new objects could not but astonish the spectators; nor were they less surprized and delighted at the intelligence displayed in the performance of the actors, whom Æschylus almost always exercised himself. He regulated their steps, and taught them to give additional force to the action by new and expressive gestures.\n\nThe progress of the art was extremely rapid. Æschylus was born 525 years before Christ, 11 years after Thespis had acted his Alcestis. He had for competitors Choerilus Pratinas, and Phrynichus, whose glory he eclipsed, and Sophocles, who rivalled his own. Sophocles was born about the year 497 B.C., about 14 years before Euripides. These carried tragedy to the highest perfection to which it attained among the Greeks. Æschylus painted men greater than they can be, Sophocles as they ought to be, and Euripides as they are.\n\nInvented towards the 50th Olympiad (about 580 B.C.), and adapted to the rude manners of the rustics, comedy ventured not to approach the capital; and if by chance some companies of actors, who were unconnected with any others, found their way into the city, and performed their indecent farces, they were less authorized than tolerated by the government. It was not till after a long infancy that this species of drama began suddenly to make a rapid improvement in Sicily. Instead of a succession of scenes without connection or tendency, the philosopher Epicharmus introduced an action, all the parts of which had a dependence on each other; and conducted his subject, without wandering from it, through a just extent to a determinate end. His pieces, subjected to the same laws as tragedy, were known in Greece, where they were considered as models; and comedy soon shared with her rival the suffrages of the public, and the homage due to genius. The Athenians, especially, received her with the same transports as they would have testified at the news of a victory: many of their poets exercised their genius in this novel species of composition; and their names adorn the numerous list of writers who have been distinguished in comedy from the time of Epicharmus. Such were, among the more ancient, Magnes, Cratinus, Crates, Pherecrates, Eupolis, and Aristophanes. They all flourished in the age of Pericles.\n\nIf we peruse the comic pieces which have come down to us, we shall be convinced that the sole object of the authors was to please the multitude. The gods and heroes were travestied, gross and obscene language was often employed, and virulent invectives were often thrown out against individuals of the first rank for genius and virtue. Towards the end of the Peloponnesian war the licentiousness of comedy was restrained. The chorus was laid aside, because the rich citizens were alarmed, and would no longer contribute money to support it, nor provide masks with portraits for exposing individuals.\n\nThe poets being thus restrained from mentioning names of living persons on the stage, invented false names. They still exposed real and known characters; and thus gave a more exquisite gratification to the spectators, who were highly amused with finding out the persons intended. The consequence of the law was only to make that done with delicacy which was formerly done in the most indecent and scurrilous manner. Aristophanes, in some of his latest pieces, has given us some good examples of this kind of comedy, which is sometimes called the middle comedy.\n\nComedy was still liable to abuse, and therefore required farther reformation. As the use of real names had formerly been prohibited, real subjects were also forbidden; and comedy from that time was no longer a fury armed with torches, or a firebrand scattering mischief, but a pleasing and instructive companion. This is called the new comedy. The most eminent among the Greeks in this improved species was Menander. His writings are now lost; but we may form a good estimate of their merit from the comedies of Terence, which are said to have been borrowed from Menander, and to have nearly resembled the original, though inferior in that vis comica by which the elegant Grecian was distinguished. The comedy of Menander is that which has been cultivated in modern times.\n\nTo give some idea of a Grecian theatre, we shall describe very shortly the theatre of Bacchus in Athens, which was built by the famous architect Philos in the time of Pericles. The part intended for the spectators was of a semicircular form, at the diameter of which was erected the stage. The orchestra occupied the space where the pit in modern theatres is situated, where\nThe music, the chorus, and the mimi were placed. It was four feet elevated above the ground. The spectators were arranged in three galleries round all the sides of the orchestra except that next the stage, each gallery containing eight rows of seats. At the farther end of the orchestra, where the stage is erected in modern theatres, stood the thymele or logeion, but projecting a little towards the audience. It was a little higher than the orchestra, and did not extend the whole breadth of it. In some theatres it was only six feet square. Here the principal part of the chorus made their recitations, and in comical interludes the mimi performed. Behind the thymele appeared the stage or proscenium, considerably elevated. No part of this theatre was covered except the stage, and a high gallery called circys set apart for the women. The Athenians, being exposed to the weather, came usually with great cloaks, to secure them from the rain or the cold; and for defence against the sun, they had the sedation, a kind of parasol, which the Romans used also in their theatres by the name of umbrellas; but when a sudden storm arose, the play was interrupted, and the spectators dispersed.\n\nA sort of tent-work over the entire area of the edifice might have been contrived as a shelter from the rain and a shade from the sun. Such a covering would have obviated the inconveniences of roofed theatres, which obstructed the free communication of the air, and of unroofed theatres, which do not keep out the weather. At Athens the plays were always represented in the daytime, which made the unroofed theatres less inconvenient.\n\nPlays were represented only during the three festivals solemnized in honour of Bacchus. The first of these was celebrated at the Piraeus, where some of Euripides's pieces were first performed. The second, which lasted only one day, was kept at the end of January or beginning of February. The third, called the greater Dionysia, was celebrated a month after. It continued several days, and attracted a great multitude of spectators. In the festivals which lasted only one day, five or six dramatic pieces, either tragedies or comedies, were performed. But in the greater Dionysia, which continued longer, 12 or 15, and sometimes more, were acted. The performance began early in the morning, and sometimes lasted the whole day.\n\nThe chorus, according to the subject demanded, was composed of men and women, old men or youths, citizens or slaves, priests, soldiers, &c., to the number of 15 in tragedy, and 24 in comedy. The chorus came upon the stage preceded by a flute-player, who regulated their steps; sometimes one after the other, but in tragedy more frequently three in front and five in depth, or five in front and three in depth.\n\nThe same persons performed both in tragedy and comedy; but, as among ourselves, it was rare to meet with any who excelled in both. The pay of those who had acquired great reputation was considerable. Polus gained a talent in two days (equal to £75 sterling). Players of eminence were solicited by different actors of Greece to attend their festivals. If, after making an engagement, they failed, they were obliged to pay a certain sum of money; and if they were absent during the festivals of their own republic, they were condemned to a heavy fine.\n\nThe actors had habits and symbols suited to their parts. Kings wore a diadem, leaned on a sceptre which supported an eagle on its top, and were dressed in long robes of purple or other splendid colours ornamented with gold. Heroes, besides having their stature frequently increased to fix feet English, and their bulk in proportion, were frequently covered with the skin of a lion or a tiger, and armed with swords, quivers, and clubs. All who suffered misfortunes wore a black, brown, or dirty white garment, which frequently hung cap. There were various kinds of masks for tragedy, comedy, and satire. These certainly took away the pleasure arising from the expression of the countenance; but at any rate, little pleasure could be derived from this circumstance in a Grecian theatre, from its immense size, and the great distance of the audience from the stage.\n\nDramatic entertainments were introduced at Rome in the year of the city 391. They were called ludi scenici, because they were first acted in a shade formed by the branches and leaves of trees. They were borrowed immediately from Etruria, whence also they received their first players. These Etrurians at first only danced to a flute, without either singing or acting. The Roman youth soon imitated them at their solemn festivals, adding raillery in rude verses, and gestures adapted to the subject. These verses were called Felicenni, from Felicenna, a city of Etruria. Livius Andronicus was the first poet who wrote a regular play in Latin. This happened in the year of Rome 512 or 514, about 160 years after the death of Sophocles and Euripides, and 52 after that of Menander. The Grecian model was afterwards introduced and cultivated much by succeeding dramatic writers. This was the model of Menander, for the old and middle comedy was unknown at Rome. As the Romans were only imitators of the Greeks in the dramatic art, as well as in most of the arts and sciences, nothing more is necessary to be said in addition to the account which we have already given of the Grecian stage.\n\nThe origin of the English stage is hid in obscurity. It was not, however, copied from the Grecian or Roman; for it was evidently different in form as well as in matter, and may with more propriety be deduced from a Gothic original. It appears that there were theatrical entertainments in England almost as early as the conquest; for we are told by William Stephaniades and Fitz-Stephen, a monk, who in the reign of Henry II. wrote his Descriptio Nobilitatis Civitatis Londinensis, that \"London instead of the common interludes of the theatre, had plays of a more holy kind; representations of the miracles of confessors, and the sufferings of martyrs. At this time there were also certain sets of idle people, who travelled the countries and were called Mummers, a kind of vagrant comedians, whose excellence consisted altogether in mimicry and humour.\n\nIt is probable that, soon after this time, the dramatic representations called Mysteries were exhibited: these mysteries were taken from scripture-history: some represented the creation of the world, with the fall of Adam and Eve; some the story of Joseph; and others even the incarnation and sufferings of the Son of God. These pieces were exhibited in a manner so ridiculous as to favour libertinism and infidelity, as appears by a petition of the chanters of St Paul's cathedral to Richard II. in 1378, praying, that \"some unexpert people might...\"\nbe prohibited from representing the history of the Old Testament to the prejudice of the said clergy, who had been at great expense to represent it publicly at Christmas.\"\n\nIn the year 1390, the parish clerks of London are said to have played interludes at Skinner's well on three successive days in July; and, in 1429, to have acted for eight days successively a play concerning the creation of the world, at the same place which thence acquired the name of Clerkenwell.\n\nThese Mysteries were succeeded by Moralities, in which there were some rude traces of a fable and a moral; and some also of poetry, the virtues, vices, and other affections of the mind being frequently personified.\n\nAfter these Moralities came what were called Interludes, which made some approaches to wit and humour. Many of these pieces were written by John Heywood, better to Henry VIII.\n\nIn the time of Henry VIII, one or two pieces had been published under the classical names of Comedy and Tragedy, but they appear not to have been intended for popular use. It was not till the religious ferment had subsided that the public had leisure to attend to dramatic poetry. In the reign of Elizabeth, tragedies and comedies began to appear in form, and could the poets have persevered, the first models were good. Gorboduc, a regular tragedy, was acted in 1561; and Galscogine, in 1566, exhibited Jocasta, a translation from Euripides, as also The Supposes, a regular comedy, from Ariosto, near thirty years before any of Shakespeare's were printed.\n\nThe people, however, still retained a relish for their old mysteries and moralities, and the popular dramatic poets seem to have made them their models. The graver sort of moralities appear to have given birth to our modern tragedy; as our comedy evidently took its rise from the lighter interludes of that kind. And as most of these pieces contain an absurd mixture of religion and buffoonery, an eminent critic has well deduced from thence the origin of our unnatural tragic-comedies. Even after the people had been accustomed to tragedies and comedies, moralities still kept their ground. One of them, entitled The New Custom, was printed so late as 1573. At length they assumed the name of masque, and, with some classical improvements, became in the two following reigns the favourite entertainments of the court.\n\nAs for the old mysteries, which ceased to be acted after the reformation, they seem to have given rise to a third species of stage exhibition; which, though now confounded with tragedy or comedy, was by our first dramatic writers considered as quite distinct from them both: these were historical plays, or histories; a species of dramatic writing which resembled the old mysteries in representing a series of historical events simply in the order of time in which they happened, without any regard to the three great unities. These pieces seem to differ from tragedy just as much as historical poems do from epic: as the Pharsalia does from the Æneid. What might contribute to make dramatic poetry take this turn was, that soon after the mysteries ceased to be exhibited, there was published a large collection of poetical narratives, called the Mirror for Magistrates, where-\n\nin a great number of the most eminent characters in English history are drawn relating their own misfortunes. This book was popular and of a dramatic cast; and therefore, as an elegant writer has well observed, might have its influence in producing historic plays. These narratives probably furnished the subjects, and the ancient mysteries suggested the plan.\n\nThat our old writers considered historical plays as somewhat distinct from tragedy and comedy, appears from numberless passages of their works. \"Of late days (says Stow in his Survey of London), instead of those stage plays have been used comedies, tragedies, interludes, and histories, both true and fained.\" Beaumont and Fletcher, in the prologue to the Captain, say,\n\n\"This is nor comedy, nor tragedy,\nNor history.\"\n\nPolonius in Hamlet commends the actors as the best in the world, either for tragedies, comedies, histories, pastoral, &c. And Shakespeare's friends, Heminge and Condell, in the first folio edition of his plays, in 1623, have not only intitled their book \"Mr William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies,\" but, in their table of contents, have arranged them under those three several heads; placing in the clasps of histories, \"King John, Richard II, Henry IV, two parts, Henry V, Henry VI, three parts, Richard III, and Henry VIII.\"\n\nThis distinction deserves the attention of the critics: for if it be the first canon of sound criticism to examine any work by those rules the author prescribed for his observance; then we ought to try Shakespeare's histories by the general laws of tragedy and comedy. Whether the rule itself be vicious or not, is another inquiry; but certainly we ought to examine a work only by those principles according to which it was composed. This would save much impertinent criticism.\n\nNot fewer than 19 playhouses had been opened before the year 1633, when Prynne published his Histrio-mastix. From this writer we learn that tobacco, wine, and beer, were in those days the usual accommodations in the theatre, as now at Sadler's Wells. With regard to the ancient prices of admission, the playhouse called the Hope had five different priced seats, from sixpence to half-a-crown. Some houses had penny benches. The two-penny gallery is mentioned in the prologue to Beaumont and Fletcher's Woman-hater; and seats of threepence and a groat in the pallage of Prynne last referred to. But the general price of what is now called the Pit seems to have been a shilling. The time of exhibition was early in the afternoon, their plays being generally acted by day-light. All female parts were performed by men, no actresses being ever seen on the public stage before the civil wars. And as for the playhouse furniture and ornaments, they had no other scenes nor decorations of the stage, but only old tapestry, and the stage firewood with rushes, with habits accordingly; as we are assured in a short Discourse on the English Stage, subjoined to Fleckney's Love's Kingdom, 1674, 12mo.\n\n(n) For the state of the theatre during the time of Shakespeare, see PLAYHOUSE; where a full account of it\n\n(a) We have been anxious to give as full an account of the ancient English drama as we could: we must not omit,\nTheatre, it is given from the late valuable edition of our illustrious poet's works by Mr Malone. During the whole reign of James I. the theatre was in great prosperity and reputation; dramatic authors abounded, and every year produced a number of new plays; it became a fashion for the nobility to celebrate their weddings, birthdays, and other occasions of rejoicing, with masques and interludes, which were exhibited with surprising expense; our great architect, Inigo Jones, being frequently employed to furnish decorations, with all the luxuriance of his invention and magnificence of his art. The king and his lords, and the queen and her ladies, frequently performed in these masques at court, and the nobility at their private houses; nor was any public entertainment thought complete without them. This taste for theatrical entertainments continued during great part of the reign of King Charles I.; but, in the year 1633, it began to be opposed by the Puritans from the press; and the troubles that soon after followed entirely suspended them till the restoration of King Charles II. in 1660.\n\nThe king, at his restoration, granted two patents, one to Henry Killigrew, Esq. and the other to Sir William Davenant, and their heirs and assigns, for forming two distinct companies of comedians. Killigrew's were called the King's Servants, and Davenant's the Duke's Company. About ten of the company called the King's Servants were on the royal household establishment, having each ten yards of scarlet cloth, with a proper quantity of lace allowed them for liveries; and in their warrants from the lord chamberlain they were styled gentlemen of the great chamber.\n\nTill this time no woman had been seen upon the English stage, the characters of women having always been performed by boys, or young men of an effeminate aspect, which probably induced Shakespeare to make so few of his plays depend upon female characters, as they must have been performed to great disadvantage. The principal characters of his women are innocence and simplicity, such as Desdemona and Ophelia; and his specimen of fondness and virtue in Portia is very short. But the power of real and beautiful women was now added to the stage; and all the capital plays of Shakespeare, Fletcher, and Ben Jonson, were divided between the two companies, by their own alternate choice, and the approbation of the court.\n\nThe king's servants seem to have been allowed to be the best company; and when the variety of plays began to be exhausted, they drew the greatest audiences. Davenant, therefore, to make head against them, first added spectacle and music to action, and introduced a new species of plays, since called dramatic operas; among these were, The Tempest, Pygmalion, and Circe; which, with many others, were set off with the most expensive decorations of scenes and habits, and with the best voices and dancers.\n\nIn 1684 the two houses united, and continued together for ten years. In 1690 the play began at four o'clock; and, we are told, the ladies of fashion used to take the evening air in Hyde-park after the representation; by which it appears that the exhibitions were in summer too. The principal actors were, Betterton, Montfort, Kynaston, Sandford, Nokes, Underhill, and Leigh, commonly called Tony Leigh; the actresses were, Mrs Betterton, Barry, Leigh, Butler, Montfort, and Bracegirdle; and to this company, in this year, old Cibber was admitted as a performer in the lowest rank. It was a rule with the patentees, that no young person, who offered himself as an actor, should be admitted into pay till after at least half a year's probation; and Cibber waited full three quarters of a year before he was taken into a salary of 10s. a-week.\n\nIn 1695 a new theatre was opened with Mr Congreve's comedy of Love for Love, which had such extraordinary success (says Cibber) that scarce any other play was acted there till the end of the season; but when the season ended, which appears to have begun in June, he does not tell us, and it is indeed difficult to guess; for though the company acted in summer, it seems improbable that they should shut up the house in winter, as it is difficult to conceive any reason for so doing. Congreve was then in such high reputation, that this company offered him a whole share (but into how many shares the whole was divided Colley has not told us) upon condition he would give them a new play every year. This offer he accepted, and received the advantage, though he never fulfilled the condition; for it was three years before he produced the Mourning Bride, and three more before he gave them the Way of the World.\n\nIt is not necessary that we give in detail the remaining history of the English stage: those who are anxious to be acquainted with it may consult Cibber's history of the stage, continued by Victor, under the title of A History of the Theatres of London and Dublin from the year 1730. We shall only mention a few facts respecting the salaries of the players about that period, and the rise of the price of play tickets.\n\nA difference having arisen in 1733 between the managers and actors, most of the actors set up for themselves at the little theatre in the Haymarket. Upon this the managers published the following account of their salaries, to show the public how little room they had to mutiny. To Mr Colley Cibber, from the time of letting his share till he left the stage, £21. 12s. per week. Mr The, Cibber £1. and his wife's whole salary Gentleman till her death, without doing the company any service man's Man the greatest part of the winter; and his own also, during the time of his being ill, who performed but seldom till after Christmas. Mr Mills jun. £1. under the same circumstances with regard to his wife. Mr Mills £1. per day for 200 days certain, and a benefit clear of all charges. Mr Johnston £1. Mr Miller £1. paid him eight weeks before he acted, besides a present of 10 guineas. Mr Harper £1. and a present of 10 guineas. Mr Griffin £1. and a present. Mr Shepard £1. Mr Hallam, for himself and father (though the latter is of little or no service) £1. Mrs Heron £1. raised from 40s. last winter, yet refused to play several parts assigned her.\nher, and acted but seldom this season. Mrs Butler 3l. per week. By these and other salaries, with the incident charges (besides clothes and scenes), the patentees are at the daily charge of 49l. odd money, each acting-day.\n\nTill about the same time, the prices at the theatre were 4s. the boxes, 2s. 6d. the pit, 1s. 6d. the first gallery, and 1s. the second, except upon the first run of a new play or pantomime, when the boxes were 5s. the pit 3s. the first gallery 2s. and the second 1s. But Fleetwood thought fit to raise the prices for an old pantomime, which was revived without expense. This produced a riot for several nights, and at last a number deputed by the pit had an interview with the manager in the green room, where it was agreed, that the advanced prices should be constantly paid at the doors, and that such persons as did not choose to stay the entertainment should have the advanced part of their money returned. This was a very advantageous agreement for the manager; because, when the audience had once paid their money, and were seated, very few went out at the end of the play, and demanded their advanced money; the few that did it at first, soon grew tired, and at last it settled in the quiet payment of the advanced price, as at this day.\n\nIt has been frequently a subject of debate, whether the stage be favourable to morals. We do not mean to enter into the controversy; but we shall make an observation or two. It will be allowed by all, that the intention of the players in acting, is to procure money; and the intention of the audience in attending the theatre, is to seek amusement. The players then will only act such plays as they believe will answer their intention. And what sort of plays are these? They are such as correspond with the opinions, manners, and taste, of the audience. If the taste of the audience be gross, therefore the plays will be gross; if delicate and refined, they will be the same. And if we go back to the time of Shakespeare, we shall find that this has been uniformly the case. The conclusion, then, which we draw, is this, if the taste of the audience be pure, free from licentiousness, the plays will be the same, and the stage will be favourable to virtue.\n\nTHEBAID, a celebrated heroic poem of Statius, the subject of which is the civil war of Thebes, between the two brothers Eteocles and Polynices; or Thebes taken by Theseus.\n\nTHEBES, the name of a celebrated city of ancient Greece. It is supposed to have been built by Cadmus, about the year of the world 2555. This Cadmus, according to the Greeks, was the son of Agenor king of Sidon or of Tyre; but the Sidonians allow him to have been of no higher quality than his cook, and tell us that his wife was a musician at court, with whom he ran away into Greece. The Greek writers tells us, that being commanded by his father to go in search of his daughter Europa, whom Jupiter in the shape of a bull had carried off, and forbid to return without her, he built, or rebuilt, the city of Thebes, after having long fought her in vain. He was at first opposed by the Hyantes and Aones; the former of whom he defeated in battle, and forced to retire into Locris; the latter submitted, and were incorporated among his subjects.\n\nThose who endeavour to extract some truth from the multitude of fables in which the early part of the Grecian history is obscured, are of opinion that Cadmus was supposed to be one of the Canaanites expelled by Joshua; and that he was of the family of the Cadmonites mentioned by Moses the exiled and Joshua. He is universally allowed to have introduced the Phoenician letters into Greece, set up the first schools, and introduced brafs; which, from him, had the name of Cadmean given to it. The government of Thebes continued for a long time monarchical; and the names of a number of its kings have been transmitted to us, with some account of their transactions; but very much obscured by fable.\n\nThough the Thebans had been famed in the early period of their history for their martial achievements, bans a degree in process of time they seem to have degenerated. At the time of the invasion of Xerxes, they were the first people in Greece who were gained over to the Persian interest. On account of this conduct, they became very obnoxious to the other states, especially to the Athenians, whose power and renown increased every day, and threatened at last to swallow them up altogether. The Thebans being in no condition to oppose such a formidable power, put themselves under the protection of the Spartans, who, out of jealousy of the Athenians, falsely readily forgave them; and so grateful were the Thebans for the kindness shown them at this time, that during the whole of the Peloponnesian war Sparta had not a more faithful ally. By these means they not only recovered the government of Boeotia, of which they had been formerly in possession, till deprived of it on account of their siding with the Persians, but their city became one of the first in Greece. By this prosperity the Thebans were so much elated, that, when the peace of Antalcidas came to be signed, they refused to agree to it, as they were thus once more deprived of the government of Boeotia; so that it was not without the utmost difficulty that they were overawed into it by the other states. Not content with forcing them to give up this point, however, the Spartans undertook to change the form of the Theban government, which at this time was the citadel of a democracy, and accomplished through the treachery of those who had the care of the citadel.\n\nThe Thebans continued under the power of the Spartans for four years; at the end of which term a conspiracy being formed against them by some of the principal people in the city, among whom was a young nobleman named Pelopidas, the Spartans were massacred and driven out, and the citadel regained. During the tumult Epaminondas, afterwards the celebrated general, with a number of the best citizens, joined the party of Pelopidas; and the latter having called a general assembly of the Thebans, proclaimed liberty to them, and exhorted them in the strongest manner to fight for their country. This speech was received with the greatest acclamations; Pelopidas was unanimously proclaimed the preserver of Thebes, and was charged with the management of the war which was then to be declared against Sparta.\n\nThese transactions so much exasperated the Spartans, that they immediately sent their king Cleombrotus against them, though it was then the depth of winter. The Athenians, in the meantime, who had hitherto assisted the Thebans, declined any farther connection, lest they should draw upon themselves the resentment of\nThe Spartans. But they were soon after determined to act again on the same side, by an attempt which the Spartan general, Spheidas, had rashly made on the Pyraus or harbour of Athens. Thus, by means of the Athenians, a powerful diversion was made in favour of the Thebans, who gradually recovered all the towns of Boeotia, and at length began to act offensively against their enemies, and made a powerful invasion in Phocis. They had now many sharp encounters with them; which, though they did not amount to decisive battles, yet did not fail to raise their courage, and depress that of the Spartans. In these encounters Pelopidas always signalized himself; and in the battle of Tanagra, where the Lacedemonians were entirely defeated by the Athenians and their allies, Pelopidas had a principal share in the victory, and killed the Spartan general with his own hand. Soon after this, with a body of only 300 Thebans, he entirely routed and dispersed near 1000 Spartans; which was the greatest disgrace the latter had ever known; for till that time, whether in war with the Greeks or barbarians, they had never been overcome by an equal, much less by such an inferior number of troops.\n\nThese successes of the Thebans greatly alarmed the Athenians, who continually fought to oppose their growing power. In this opposition they were joined by the Plateans, who on this account became extremely obnoxious to the Thebans, so that they at last came to a resolution to surprise their city. This they accomplished, and entirely destroyed it, together with Thebia, another city extremely well affected to Athens. Soon after this, the Thebans, encouraged by their success, began to think of enlarging their territories, and of making encroachments on their neighbours, as they saw other states had done before them. This spirit of conquest is said to have been raised by their general Pelopidas; in which he was seconded by Epaminondas, a person who, though like him endowed with all the necessary qualities to make a complete captain or patriot, had till then preferred a private life, and lived in a constant course of virtue and the study of philosophy. He had as yet seldom appeared in public, except to get himself excused from those state employments which were so eagerly courted by others. This, however, had not hindered him from contracting an intimate friendship with Pelopidas, which had been daily improved by the correspondence of their tempers and principles, as well as by that zeal which both displayed for the good of their country; which last had made them, even before this time, appear together in action, and to such advantage, that Epaminondas's merit could be no longer concealed, nor indeed suffer him to continue longer in his beloved retirement; so that he saw himself, at length deservedly placed at the head of the Theban troops; where he gave such early proofs of his future prowess and abilities, as justly gave him the next rank to Pelopidas. Both came now to be considered in the same light, as generals in the field, as governors at home, and as complete statesmen in the council. When the general treaty for restoring peace to Greece came to be propounded by the Athenians, and was upon the point of being executed by the rest of the states, the Thebans refused to agree to it, unless they were comprehended in it under the name of Boeotians. This demand was as strenuously opposed by the other contracting powers as\n\nVol. XX. Part I.\nThebes, some say 50,000 men, besides great numbers of those who followed the camp, rather for plunder than fighting, and were computed about 25,000 more. The army was divided into four columns, and moved straight towards Sellasia, the place of rendezvous, from which they pursued their journey with fire and sword towards Sparta. But here they were repulsed by Agesilaus, who was then returned to that metropolis.\n\nTo repair, in some measure, this disgrace, and at the same time to leave some lasting monument which should redound as much to his glory as to the mortification of the Spartans, Epaminondas left not their territories till he had restored the posterity of the old Messenians to their ancient dominions, out of which they had been banished near 300 years; rebuilt their capital, and left a strong garrison for its defence. He was, however, nearly cut off in his return by Iphicrates, whom the Athenians had sent with 12,000 men to intercept him; but this last loitered too long at Corinth, that the Thebans had passed the defiles of Cenchreae, the chief place where he could have obstructed his retreat had he taken possession of it in proper time. Epaminondas continued his march till he came in full view of the city of Corinth. He found the roads choked up with trees, rocks, stones, and every thing that could render them impassable; and the Corinthians well fortified, and resolute on a stout defence. But he came so furiously upon them, notwithstanding all these difficulties, that they abandoned all their entrenchments and outworks to the Thebans, and fled into the city. Thither they pursued them sword in hand, and made an horrible slaughter of them; insomuch that Corinth must have unavoidably fallen into their hands, had their generals thought fit to pursue these advantages; but whether they were afraid of the Athenians falling upon them, or apprehended some dangerous ambush in a country with which they were but indifferently acquainted, or whether the army was too much weakened through so many fatigues, or lastly, whether the coldness of the season, it being then the depth of winter, would not permit them to proceed farther, they immediately marched towards Boeotia. This gave such an advantage to their enemies, that they met with a very mortifying reception at their return to Thebes, where they were both arrested, and seized as state-prisoners, for having presumed to prolong their command four months longer than the time limited by law, which time took in almost the whole of their expedition from their first entrance into Peloponnesus. However, at last, the judges being ashamed to proceed any farther, they were both honourably acquitted.\n\nThis prosecution had been chiefly carried on and encouraged by Menecrates, a discontented Theban, and a bold and able speaker, who, by his artful calumnies at the trial, had so far prevailed with the judges as to get Epaminondas deprived of the government of Boeotia for a whole year, though he could not gain the same advantage against Pelopidas, who was a greater favourite of the people, as being his senior.\n\nBy this delay the Spartans, with much difficulty, had recovered themselves from their great defeat at Leuctra, and settled their affairs in as good a posture as they could; but though they had repulsed the Thebans in Peloponnesus, yet from the exploits they had performed there, especially in the dismembering the whole kingdom of Messenia from them, they had still cause to fear what their forces might do under two such generals; and had accordingly taken due care to strengthen themselves against them, and to provide themselves with a great number of auxiliaries from other states, especially from that of Athens, with whom they had renewed their old treaty, and had agreed that each should have the command five days alternately. Soon after this treaty the Arcadians renewed the war, and took Palene in Laconia by storm, put the garrison to the sword, and were presently assisted by the Argives and Elecans, and especially by the Thebans, who lent to them 7000 foot and 500 horse under the command of Epaminondas. This so alarmed the Athenians likewise, that they immediately lent Gobrias with some forces to oppose his passage in good earnest; and he so behaved himself against the Thebans, that they were forced to abandon Peloponnesus a second time. This ill success gave fresh occasion to the enemies of Epaminondas to blame his conduct in the highest terms, notwithstanding the singular bravery with which he and his troops had forced the pass. Even his friends could not but suspect him of partiality for the Spartans, in not pursuing his advantage over them, and making a greater slaughter of them when he had it in his power; whilst his enemies made it amount to no less than treachery to his country: so that their brave general was once more deprived of the government of Boeotia, and reduced to the deplorable condition of a private man. He did not continue long under this disgrace, before an occasion offered to make his services again of such necessity to the state, as to give him an opportunity to retrieve his fame, and wipe off the stain which his enemies had thrown upon him.\n\nThe Thebans, who had groaned some time under the tyranny of the usurper Alexander, fumed the Pherean, sent an embassy to Thebes to implore their aid and protection; upon which Pelopidas was immediately sent as ambassador to expostulate with him on their behalf. He was then in Macedon, from whence he took the young prince Philip, afterwards the celebrated monarch, in order to protect and educate him; and, upon his return, marched directly to Pharsalus in Thessaly, in order to punish the treachery of some mercenaries, who had deserted the Thebans in that expedition; but when he came thither, he was surprized to be met by the tyrant at the head of a numerous army before that city, whilst his own was but as an handful of men in comparison of it. However, whether he supposed, or would be thought to do so, that Alexander came thither to justify himself, and answer to the complaints alleged against him, he went, with Menenias his colleague, to him unarmed and unattended, not doubting but his character as ambassador from so powerful a republic, joined to his own character and authority, would protect them from insult or violence; but he found himself mistaken; for Alexander had no sooner got them into his hands, than he cauled them to be seized, and sent prisoners to Pherean.\n\nThe Thebans, highly resenting the indignity offered A Theban to their ambassadors, sent immediately an army into army sent Thessaly; but the generals were repulsed with great loss by the Pherean usurper; and it was owing to Epaminondas, who was among them only as a private centinel, that they were not totally cut off. For the Thebans, finding\nfinding themselves in such imminent danger, which they attributed to the incapacity of their generals, had immediately recourse to him, whose valour and experience had been so often tried; and, partly by persuasions and intrigues, and partly by threats, obliged him to take the command. This soon gave a different turn to their affairs, and converted their flight into a safe and regular retreat; for he took the horse and light-armed foot, and placed himself at their head in the rear, and charged the enemy with such vigour and bravery, that he obliged them to desist from their pursuit.\n\nHowever, as the army had suffered such loss before as not to be able to pursue them in their turn, he was obliged to return with them to Thebes, with their pusillanimous generals; where the latter were fined 12,000 drachmas each, and the former was reinstated in the command, and sent with a new reinforcement to repair the late dishonour, and prosecute their revenge. The news of his being in full march on this errand greatly alarmed the tyrant; but Epaminondas, preferring the safety of his imprisoned colleague to all other considerations, forbore pushing hostilities to extremes, for fear of provoking the enemy to wreak all his fury on him: to prevent which, he contented himself for a while hovering about with his army, and now and then with such flight skirmishes as should intimidate the tyrant, and bring him the sooner to make some satisfactory offers. Alexander being fully convinced of the superiority of the Theban general, was glad to accept of a truce of 30 days, and to restore Pelopidas and Iphigenia to him; upon which he immediately withdrew his forces, and returned with them to Thebes.\n\nBy this time Thebes was raised to a sufficient height of reputation and glory to begin to aim in earnest at the sovereignty of Greece. The main obstacle to it was, that the other states grew so jealous of her present greatness, as to enter into the strongest alliances and confederacies to prevent its farther growth; so that not being able now to procure many allies at home, they made no difficulty to seek for them abroad; and the Lacedaemonians, by leading the van, gave them a plausible pretence to follow their steps, and procure an alliance with Persia, which at that time they found was ready to accept of the offers on any terms; the only question was, which of the three states should be preferred, Sparta, Athens, or Thebes. At the same time, the Thebans propounded to their new confederates to send likewise proper deputies to the Persian court, in order to support their respective interests; which they readily agreed to. These were the Arcadians, Eleans, and Argives; at the head of whose delegation Pelopidas was sent on behalf of the Thebans; which the Athenians being apprised of, appointed two on their part. These being all arrived at the Persian court, began to pursue each their respective interests; but Pelopidas had by that time gained such credit there, both for his singular address and his extraordinary exploits, that he was distinguished in a particular manner from all the other deputies, and was received by the king with manifest marks of honour and esteem, who freely owned himself convinced that the Thebans were the people on whom he could most safely depend; and after having greatly applauded the equity of his demands, ratified and confirmed them with great readiness, to the no small mortification of the other states. The subsistence of them was, that the liberties formerly granted to the other towns of Greece should be confirmed; that Megara, in particular, should continue free and independent on the jurisdiction of Sparta; that the Athenians should lay up their fleet; and that the Thebans should be looked upon as the ancient and hereditary friends of Peria.\n\nThe Thebans took advantage of the differences which prevailed among the Greeks as a pretence for increasing their forces; and Epaminondas thought it a proper opportunity for his countrymen to make a bold effort to obtain the dominion at sea, as they had obtained it in a past great measure at land. He proposed it to them in a public assembly, and encouraged their hopes from the experience of the Lacedaemonians, who in Xerxes's time had, with ten ships only at sea, gained the superiority over the Athenians, who had no fewer than 200; and added, that it would be a disgrace now to Thebes to suffer two such republics to enslave the empire of so extensive an element, without putting in at least for their share of it. The people readily came into his proposal, not without extraordinary applause, and immediately ordered 100 galleys to be equipped; and in the mean while sent him to Rhodes, Chios, and Byzantium, to secure those states in their interest, and get what assistance he could from them. His negotiations had all the success that could be wished for, notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of the Athenians, and of their admiral Leches, who was sent with a powerful squadron against him. But what more effectually thwarted all his measures, was the work that they found for him at land, and the obliging the Thebans to take part in the quarrels that then reigned among their neighbours: so that whatever projects they had concerted, proved abortive for the present; and the death of Epaminondas, which happened not long after, put an effectual stop to them.\n\nDuring the absence of that general, and of his colleague Pelopidas, the Orchomenians, being spirited up by some Theban fugitives, had formed a design to change the Theban government into an aristocracy; and 300 horsemen of the former had been actually sent to put it in execution. Their project, however, was timely discovered by the vigilance of the magistrates, who caused them to be seized, and put immediately to death. They next sent a sufficient force against the city of Orchomenos, with orders to put all the men to death, and to sell the women and children for slaves, which was punctually done; after which they razed that noble city to the ground. Pelopidas was then on his way to Thessaly, at Pelopidas the head of a powerful army, whither he had been sent marches to assist the Thebans, who still groaned under the tyranny of Alexander the Pheraeus, and had made several brave efforts to recover their liberty, but had been still overpowered by that usurper. Being joined by the Thessalians, he encamped in the face of the enemy, though far superior in number, and consisting of above 20,000 men. A fierce engagement soon ensued, in which both sides fought with uncommon bravery. The place where the battle was fought was called Cynocephala, from several little hills on it, between which there ran a large plain. Both sides endeavoured at first to post themselves on these eminences with their foot, whilst Pelopidas ordered his cavalry to charge that of the enemy below; which they did with such success, that they soon put them to the rout, and pursued them over the plain. This obliged the tyrant to gain the tops of the hills, where he\nTHE\n\ngreatly annoyed the Thebans that endeavoured to force those ascents; so that Pelopidas was obliged to give over his pursuit to come to their relief. This immediately inspired the Thebans with fresh courage, who began again to charge the enemy at several onsets; and soon threw them into such disorder, that they were forced to give way. Pelopidas no sooner perceived the advantage, than he began to look about for Alexander, with a design of engaging him. Having found him out as he was commanding his right wing, and endeavouring to rally his men, he moved directly to him; and being got near enough to be heard by him, challenged him to decide the battle by single combat with him. Alexander, instead of accepting the offer, turned about, and with all the speed he could run to screen himself amongst his guards. Upon this Pelopidas charged him with such furious speed, that he obliged him to retire farther, and shelter himself within the thickest ranks; the flight of which made him attack with fresh vigour, and fight more desperately against him. He tried in vain several times to break through their ranks to reach him, cutting down great numbers of those that came forward to oppose him: his eagerness at length exposed him so far to the darts that were shot at him at a distance, that some of them went quite through his armour, and gave him a desperate wound or two, while the rest advanced and stabbed him in the breast with their spears.\n\nIt is scarcely possible for words to express the grief and despair which not only his brave Thebans, but likewise the Thebans and other allies, showed at the sight of their slain general: some of the latter, who had perceived the danger he was exposed to, came down the hill with all possible speed to his relief; but when they perceived that they were come too late to save him, both they and the rest of the little army thought on nothing now but to revenge his death. They rallied accordingly, both horse and foot, as quick as possible, and began to charge the enemy afresh, and with such desperate fury, that they at length gained a complete victory over them, and killed above 3000 of them in the pursuit, besides a much greater number which they had slain on the field of battle, though they still looked upon all these advantages as vastly too small to compensate the loss of their brave general.\n\nThe news of his death had no sooner reached Thebes, than the whole city was seen in as deep a mourning as his army. However, they sent a reinforcement to it of 7000 foot and 700 horse, as well to revenge the death of that general, as to improve the victory he had gained over the enemy; by the help of which they fell so furiously on them, that they quickly broke and totally defeated the shattered remains of Alexander's army. Hereupon he was forced to sue for peace, and to accept it on such conditions as the conquerors thought fit to impose. He was at length dispatched in his bed by his wife Thebe, assisted by her brothers, about seven years after his defeat. His body was afterwards dragged along the streets, trodden under foot, and left a prey to the dogs.\n\nAll this while the Thebans were watching to improve every commotion that happened, every success they met with, to the forwarding of their then reigning and favourite project, of increasing their power above all the rest, and in their turn to give laws to Greece. Their late success in Thessaly, and the rupture between the Arcadians and Mantineans at the same time, about some consecrated money which the former had taken out of the temple of Olympias to pay their troops employed against the Eleans, and which the latter called a downright sacrilege, besides other discords that reigned in the other states of Greece, gave fresh encouragement to Thebes to set up for arbitrators in those disputes; and so much the more, as those who had embezzled the sacred money, and wanted rather to embroil matters than to have them brought to light, sent that republic word that the Arcadians were just upon the point of revolting to the Spartans, and advised them to come and put an immediate stop to it. At the same time they dispatched some private directions to a Theban officer at Tegea, to apprehend several of their own people as disturbers of the peace. This was accordingly done, and several eminent persons were confined as prisoners of state: they were soon after discharged, and loud complaints were made against such arbitrary and unjust proceedings. The officer was accused before the Theban senate of having intermeddled in their affairs, and endeavoured to interrupt the good correspondence between the two states. It was even insisted on by some of the Tegeans, that he should be indicted and proceeded against by his principals; whilst the more moderate sort, who foresaw the consequences that were likely to attend such appeals, and that it would infallibly bring the Thebans upon them, loudly protested against their marching into their territories, and did all they could to prevent it. The Thebans, however, were become too powerful and ambitious to miss so fair an opportunity of getting once more footing in Peloponnesus, as they had long ago premeditated; and Epaminondas was so far from making a secret of their design, that he told the Arcadian deputies in justification of it, that as it was on their accounts lest the Thebans engaged in the war, they had acted states of treacherously with them in making peace with Athens without their consent: however, that when he had joined his army on his march into Peloponnesus to assist his friends, he would soon see what proofs the Arcadians would give of their fidelity. This speech did not fail to alarm them greatly; especially as it was spoken in such a majestic style and threatening tone. Even those who were best affected to the Thebans could not forbear expressing their dislike of it; and all that had the welfare of Peloponnesus at heart readily agreed with the Mantineans, that there was no time to be lost to use all proper means to prevent the impending storm.\n\nAthens and Sparta were accordingly applied to, and a combination was easily prevailed upon to assist the Mantineans, and nation to come into a strict confederacy against the Thebans; and to prevent all disputes about the command of the army, it was agreed that each state should have it in its own territories; which plainly shows how terrified they all were at the apprehension of a fresh invasion of the Thebans; for this was a point which neither the Spartans nor Athenians would have so readily given up to the Arcadians, though they had formerly as strenuously insisted upon it, even when they were almost reduced to the last extremity, and had never been able to obtain it till now. But Epaminondas was then in full march at the head of his Boeotian troops, with some Euboean auxiliaries, and a body of stout Theban horse; and was moreover to be joined by the Messenians, Argives, and several\nThebes several other nations, as soon as he had entered Peloponnesus. The confederate army against him had ordered their rendezvous at Mantinea, the place which they naturally concluded would be first attacked, as being the chief seat of those who had revolted from the Thebans. But whilst they were securing themselves on that side, Epaminondas, who wisely considered how far this confederacy and expedition must have drained the city of Sparta of its main strength, broke up privately from Nemea, where he had lain for some time encamped, and marched all that night with a design to have surprised that important capital; but his project being timely discovered, the vigilant king took care to disconcert it; so that, though the Theban general made several vigorous assaults on that city, he was so stoutly repulsed, and the Spartans behaved with such intrepid valour, that he was forced to retire and turn his thoughts against Mantinea, which he judged by this time to have been quite defenceless. He judged rightly indeed; for the place was not only drained of its troops, but likewise of its inhabitants, who took that opportunity, whilst the scene of war was in Lacedemon, to gather in their harvest, and were scattered all over the country; so that he would not have met with any difficulty in gaining the town, had not the Athenian auxiliaries come unexpectedly to its relief, and given him a fresh repulse.\n\nThese two last defeats greatly exasperated the Theban general, who had never before experienced such disasters, and could not but foresee that they would not only lessen his reputation with his allies, but, if not timely retrieved, would fully the glory of all his former exploits. What added to his present difficulties was, that the time allotted him for his expedition was almost expired; so that he had but a short space left to undertake some brave achievement, which might recover his and his country's honour, and keep up the spirits of his auxiliaries and those under his protection. He was moreover got very far into his enemy's country, and saw plain enough how narrowly they watched all his motions, and how well prepared they were to oppose him whatever attempt he resolved upon, whether to attack them or to retreat. Under all these difficulties, he rightly considered, that he must immediately resolve upon a decisive battle; in which, if his pristine fortune followed him, he might at once retrieve his affairs, and make himself master of Peloponnesus; or, if that failed him, as it lately had done, fall honourably in the attempt. In this engagement Epaminondas made the wisest disposition of his troops, attacked and fought with the most intrepid courage and conduct, and had opened himself a way through the Spartan phalanxes, thrown them into the utmost confusion, and made a terrible slaughter of them, inasmuch that the field of battle was covered with their wounded and slain, when, in the heat of the fight, having ventured himself too far in order to give them a total overthrow, the enemy rallied again, pouring with their whole fury three volleys of darts at him, some of which he drew out and returned to them, till at length, being covered with wounds, and weakened with the loss of so much blood, he received a mortal wound from a javelin, and was with great difficulty rescued from the enemy by his brave Thebans, and brought alive, though speechless, into his tent. As soon as he had recovered himself, he asked his friends that were about him what was become of his shield; and being told that it was safe, he beckoned to have it brought to him, and killed it. He next inquired which side had gained the victory; and being answered, The Thebans; he replied, Then all is well; and upon observing some of his friends bewail his untimely death, and leaving no children behind him, he is said to have answered, Yes; I have left two fair daughters, the victory of Leuctra, and this of Mantinea, to perpetuate my memory. Soon after this, upon drawing the point of the javelin out of his body, he expired.\n\nThe consequence of this great general's fall, and of this bloody fight in which neither party could boast any great advantage over the other, but a great loss of men on both sides, infomuch that Xenophon makes it a drawn battle, was, that both parties agreed on a cessation of arms, and parted, as it were by consent, to take care of their wounded and slain. The Thebans indeed thus far gained the greater share of glory, that they renewed the fight, and after a most desperate contest, gained the victory over those Spartans that opposed them, and refused the body of their dying general out of their hands. However, an effectual end was put to this bloody war, and a general peace agreed on by all but Sparta; who refused it only because the Messenians were included in it. But as to the Thebans, they had no great reason to Peace congratulate of this dear-bought victory, since their power and glory began to decline from that very time; so that it may be truly said, that it rose and set with their great general.\n\nOn the death of Epaminondas, the Thebans relapsed into their former state of inactivity and indolence; and Thebes to the present time having ventured to oppose Alexander the Great, their city was taken, and the inhabitants slaughtered for several hours, after which the buildings were destroyed. It was rebuilt by Cassander, but never afterwards made any considerable figure among the states of Greece. About the year 146 B.C. it fell under the power of the Romans, under which it continued till the extinction of their empire by the Turks. It is now called Thive, and is nothing to what it was formerly; yet it is four miles in circumference, but so full of the ruins, that there are not above 4000 Turks and Christians in it. It is now famous for a fine fort of white clay, of which they make bowls for pipes after the Turkish fashion. They are never burnt, but dry naturally, and become as hard as a stone. There are two mosques in Thebes, and a great many Greek churches. It is seated between two small rivers, in E. Long. 23° 45'. N. Lat. 38° 17'.\n\nTHEBES, in Egypt, one of the most renowned cities of the ancient world. It was also called Diopolis, or the city of Jupiter, and was built, according to some, by Osiris, according to others by Bufris. Its length, Ancient in Strabo's time, was 80 furlongs, or ten miles; but this was nothing in comparison of its ancient extent, before it was ruined by Cambyses, which, we are told, was no less than 420 stadia, or 52 miles and an half. The wealth of this city was so great, that, after it had been plundered by the Persians, what was found, on burning the remains of the pillage, amounted to above 300 talents of gold and 2300 of silver.\n\nMr Bruce visited the ruins of this celebrated city; but informs us that nothing now remains except four temples, and these neither so entire nor magnificent as some others at a place called Dendera. Thebes has been\nThebes, been celebrated by Homer for its hundred gates; but Mr Bruce informs us, that no vestiges of these are now remaining, neither can we discover the foundation of any wall it ever had; \"and as for the horsemen and chariots it is said to have sent out, all the Thebaid sown with wheat would not have maintained one half of them. Thebes, at least the ruins of the temples called Medinet Habu, are built in a long stretch of about a mile broad, most parsimoniously chosen at the sandy foot of the mountains. The Horti Pensiles, or hanging gardens, were surely formed upon the sides of these hills, then supplied with water by mechanical devices. The utmost is done to spare the plain, and with great reason; for all the space of ground this ancient city has had to maintain its myriads of horses and men, is a plain of three quarters of a mile broad between the town and the river, upon which plain the water rises to the height of four and five feet. All this pretended populousness of ancient Thebes I therefore believe to be fabulous.\"\n\nMr Bruce, after examining the ground on which Thebes is supposed to have stood, thinks that it had no walls, and that consequently Homer's story of its having an hundred gates is misrepresentation. The mountains of the Thebaid stand close behind the town, not in a ridge, but standing single, so that you can go round each of them. A hundred of these are said to be hollowed out for sepulchres and other purposes. These, he thinks, were the hundred gates of Homer; in proof of this they are still called by the natives Beban el Melute, \"the ports or gates of the kings.\"\n\nAll that is said of Thebes by poets or historians after the days of Homer is meant of Diospolis, which was built by the Greeks long after Thebes was destroyed, as its name testifies; though Diodorus says it was built by Bufiris. It was on the east side of the Nile, whereas ancient Thebes was on the west, though both are considered as one city; and Strabo says, that the river runs through the middle of Thebes, by which he means between Old Thebes and Diospolis.\n\nTHEFT, or SIMPLE LARCENY, is \"the felonious taking and carrying away of the personal goods of another.\" This offence certainly commenced then, whenever it was, that the bounds of property, or laws of meum and tuum, were established. How far such an offence can exist in a state of nature, where all things are held to be common, is a question that may be solved with very little difficulty. The disturbance of any individual in the occupation of what he has seized to his present use, seems to be the only offence of this kind incident to such a state. But, unquestionably, in social communities, when property is established, any violation of that property is subject to be punished by the laws of society; though how far that punishment should extend is matter of considerable doubt.\n\nBy the Jewish law it was only punished with a pecuniary fine, and satisfaction to the party injured; and in the civil law, till some very late constitutions, we never find the punishment capital. The laws of Draco at Athens punished it with death; but his laws were said to be written with blood; and Solon afterwards changed the penalty to a pecuniary mullet. And so the Attic law in general continued; except that once, in a time of dearth, it was made capital to break into a garden and steal figs: but this law, and the informers against the offence, grew so odious, that from them all malicious informers were styled fycophants; a name which we have much perverted from its original meaning. From these examples, as well as the reason of the thing, many learned and scrupulous men have questioned the propriety, if not lawfulness, of inflicting capital punishment for simple theft. And certainly the natural punishment for injuries to property seems to be the loss of the offender's own property; which ought to be universally the case, were all men's fortunes equal. But as those who have no property themselves are generally the most ready to attack the property of others, it has been found necessary, instead of a pecuniary, to substitute a corporal punishment; yet how far this corporal punishment ought to extend, is what has occasioned the doubt. Sir Thomas More and the Marquis Becaria, at the distance of more than two centuries, have very sensibly propounded that kind of corporal punishment which approaches the nearest to a pecuniary satisfaction, viz. a temporary imprisonment, with an obligation to labour, first for the party robbed, and afterwards for the public, in works of the most salutary kind; in order to oblige the offender to repair, by his industry and diligence, the depredations he had committed upon private property and public order. But, notwithstanding all the remonstrances of speculative politicians and moralists, the punishment of theft still continues throughout the greatest part of Europe to be capital: and Puffendorf, together with Sir Matthew Hale, are of opinion that this must always be referred to the prudence of the legislature; who are to judge, by them, when crimes are become so enormous as to require such sanguinary restrictions. Yet both these writers agree, that such punishment should be cautiously inflicted, and never without the utmost necessity.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon laws nominally punished theft with death, if above the value of twopence; but the criminal was permitted to redeem his life by a pecuniary ransom; as, among their ancestors the Germans, by a stated number of cattle. But in the 9th year of Henry I. this power of redemption was taken away, and all persons guilty of larceny above the value of twopence were directed to be hanged; which law continues in force to this day. For though the inferior species of theft, or petit larceny, is only punished by whipping at common law, or (by stat. 4 Geo. I. c. 11.) may be extended to transportation for seven years, as is also expressly directed in the case of the Plate-glas Company; yet the punishment of grand larceny, or the stealing above the value of twopence (which sum was the standard in the time of King Athelstan, 800 years ago), is at common law regularly death; which, considering the great intermediate alteration in the price or denomination of money, is undoubtedly a very rigorous constitution; and made Sir Henry Spelman (above a century since, when money was at twice its present rate) complain, that while every thing else was risen in its nominal value, and become dearer, the life of man had continually grown cheaper. It is true, that the mercy of juries will often make them strain a point, and bring in larceny to be under the value of twopence, when it is really of much greater value: but this, though evidently justifiable and proper when it only reduces the present nominal value of money to the ancient standard, is otherwise a kind of pious perjury, and does not at all excuse our common law in this respect from the imputation of levity,\nTHEMISTOCLES, the renowned Athenian admiral, general, and patriot, who gained the battle of Salamis against the Persians. Being banished his country by his ungrateful fellow-citizens, he fled to Artaxerxes king of Persia; but, in order to avoid taking up arms against his country, he flew himself, 464 B.C. See ATTICA, no 76, et seq.\n\nTHEOBALD, Lewis, the son of an attorney at Sittingbourne in Kent, was a well-known writer and critic in the early part of the 18th century. He engaged in a paper called the Confor, published in Mit's Journal, wherein, by delivering his opinions with too little reserve concerning some eminent wits, he exposed himself to their resentment. Upon the publication of Pope's Homer, he praised it in terms of extravagant admiration, yet afterwards thought proper to abuse it as carelessly; for which Pope at first made him the hero of his Dunciad, though he afterwards laid him aside for another. Mr Theobald not only exposed himself to the satire of Pope, but waged war with Mr Dennis, who treated him more roughly, though with less satire. He nevertheless published an edition of Shakespeare, in which he corrected, with great pains and ingenuity, many faults that had crept into that poet's writings. This edition is still in great esteem; being in general preferred to those published by Pope, Warburton, and Hanmer. He also wrote some plays, and translated others from the ancients.\n\nTHEOBROMA, a genus of plants belonging to the class of polyadelphia, and order of pentandra; and in the natural system ranging under the 37th order Columbiferae. See BOTANY Index.\n\nTHEOCRACY, in matters of government, a state governed by the immediate direction of God alone; such was the ancient government of the Jews before the time of Saul.\n\nTHEOCRITUS, the father of pastoral poetry, was born at Syracuse in Sicily. Two of his poems ascertain his age; one addressed to Hiero king of Syracuse, who began his reign about 275 years before Christ; and the other to Ptolemy Philadelphus king of Egypt. Hiero, though a prince distinguished in arms and political wisdom, does not seem to have been a patron of learning. This is supposed to have given birth to the 16th Idyllium. From Syracuse Theocritus went to Alexandria, where he seems to have found a magnificent patron in Ptolemy Philadelphus, if we may judge from the panegyric which he composed on that prince (the 17th Idyllium). It has been said that Theocritus was strangled by Hiero, but we have not found evidence of this.\n\nThe compositions of this poet are distinguished, among the ancients, by the name of Idyllums, in order to express the smallness and variety of their natures; they would now be called Miscellanies, or Poems on several Occasions. The first nine and the eleventh are confessed to be true pastorals, and hence Theocritus has usually passed for nothing more than a pastoral poet; yet he is manifestly robbed of a great part of his fame, if his other poems have not their proper laurels. For though the greater part of his Idyllums cannot be called the songs of thepherds, yet they have certainly their respective merits. His pastorals ought to be considered as the foundation of his credit; upon this claim he will be admitted for the finisher as well as the inventor of his art, and will be acknowledged to have excelled all his imitators as much as originals usually do their copies.\nThe works of this poet were first published in folio by Aldus Manutius at Venice in 1495. A more elegant and correct edition was printed by Henry Stephens at Paris in 1566. An edition was published at Leipzig in 1765, with valuable notes by the learned Reike. But what will most highly gratify the admirers of pastoral poetry, is an edition published in 1770, 2 vols. 4to, by Mr Thomas Wharton. It is accompanied by the scholia of the best editors, and the different readings of MSS.\n\nTHEODOLITE, a mathematical instrument for measuring heights and distances. See MENSURATION and SURVEYING.\n\nTHEODORE, king of Corsica, Baron Nieuhoff in the county of La Maré in Westphalia. He had his education in the French service, and afterwards went to Spain, where he received some marks of regard from the duke of Riperda and Cardinal Alberoni; but being of an unfettered disposition, he quitted Spain, and travelled into Italy, England, and Holland, in search of some new adventure. He at last fixed his attention on Corsica, and formed the scheme of rendering himself sovereign of that island. He was a man of abilities and address; and having fully informed himself of everything relating to Corsica, went to Tunis, where he fell upon means to procure some money and arms; and then went to Leghorn, from whence he wrote a letter to the Corsican chiefs Giafferi and Paoli, offering considerable assistance to the nation if they would elect him as their sovereign. This letter was configned to Count Domenico Rivarola, who acted as Corsican plenipotentiary in Tuscany, and he gave for answer, that if Theodore brought the assistance he promised to the Corsicans, they would very willingly make him king.\n\nUpon this he, without loss of time, set sail, and landed at Tavagna in the spring of the year 1736. He was a man of a very flat appearance, and the Turkish dress he wore added to the dignity of his mein. He had a few attendants with him; and his manners were so engaging, and his offers so plausible, that he was proclaimed king of Corsica before Count Rivarola's dispatches arrived to inform the chiefs of the terms upon which he had agreed. He brought with him about 1000 sequins of Tunis, besides some arms and ammunition, and made magnificent promises of foreign assistance; whence the Corsicans, who were glad of any support, willingly gave into his schemes. Theodore instantly assumed every mark of royal dignity. He had his guards and his officers of state; he conferred titles of honour, and struck money both of silver and copper. The silver pieces were few in number, and can now hardly be met with; the copper coins have on one side T. R. that is, \"Theodorus Rex,\" with a double branch crossed, and round it this inscription, PRO BONO PUBLICO RE. CO. that is, \"For the public good of the kingdom of Corsica;\" on the other side is the value of the piece; Cinque solidi, or five sous.\n\nThe Genoese were not a little confounded with this unexpected adventurer. They published a violent manifesto against Theodore, treating him with great contempt; but at the same time they were alarmed at his appearance. Theodore replied, in a manifesto, with all the calmness and dignity of a monarch; but after being about eight months in Corsica, perceiving that the people began to cool in their affections towards him, he assembled his chiefs, and declared he would keep them no longer in a state of uncertainty, being determined to seek in person the support he so long expected. He settled an administration during his absence, recommended unity in the strongest terms, and left the island with reciprocal assurances of fidelity and affection. He went to Holland, where he was so successful as to obtain credit from several rich merchants, particularly Jews, who trusted him with cannon and other warlike stores to a great value, under the charge of a supercargo. With these he returned to Corsica in 1739; but by this time the French, as auxiliaries to the Genoese, had become so powerful in the island, that though Theodore threw in his supply of warlike stores, he did not incline to venture his person, the Genoese having set a high price on his head. He therefore again departed; and after many unavailing attempts to recover his crown, at length chose for retirement a country where he might enjoy the participation of that liberty which he had so vainly endeavoured to give his Corsicans; but his situation in England by degrees grew wretched, and he was reduced so low as to be several years before his death a prisoner for debt in the King's Bench. At length, to the honour of some gentlemen of rank, a charitable contribution was set on foot for him in the year 1753. Mr Boswell observes, that Mr Horace Walpole generously exerted himself for the unhappy Theodore, and wrote a paper in The World with great elegance and humour, soliciting a contribution for the unhappy monarch in distress, to be paid to Mr Robert Dodgery bookeller, as lord high treasurier. This brought him a very handsome sum, and he was set at liberty. That gentleman adds, that Mr Walpole has the original deed, by which Theodore made over the kingdom of Corsica in security to his creditors, and that he has also the great seal of the kingdom. Theodore died in 1756, and was buried in St Anne's churchyard, Wemminster; where, in 1757, a simple unadorned monument of marble was erected to his memory by a gentleman, with an inscription, which, after mentioning some of the above particulars, concludes with the following lines:\n\nThe grave, great teacher, to a level brings\nHeroes and beggars, galley-slaves and kings:\nBut Theodore this moral learn'd ere dead,\nFate pour'd its lesson on his living head,\nBettow'd a kingdom and deny'd him bread.\n\nTHEODORET, bishop of St Cyricus in Syria, in the 4th century, and one of the most learned fathers of the church, was born in the year 386, and was the disciple of Theodorus Mopluclia and St John Chrysostom. Having received holy orders, he was with difficulty persuaded to accept of the bishopric of St Cyricus, about the year 420. He discovered great frugality in the expenses of his table, dress, and furniture, but spent considerable sums in improving and adorning the city of Cyricus. He erected two large bridges, public baths, fountains, and aqueducts, and laboured with great zeal and success in his diocese. Yet his zeal was not confined to his own church: he went to preach at Antioch and the neighbouring towns; where he became admired for his eloquence and learning, and had the happiness to convert multitudes of people. He wrote in favour of John of Antioch and the Nestorians, against Cyril's Twelve Anathemas: he afterwards attacked the opinions of Nestorius, and was deposed in the synod held by the Eutychians.\nTHEODORUS, Eutychians at Ephesus; but was again restored by the general council of Chalcedon, in which he was present, in 451. It is thought that he died soon after; though others say that he lived till the year 457.

See CONSTANTINOPLE, n° 77—88.\n\nTHEOGONY, from θεός, God, and γονή, \"feed, offspring,\" that branch of the heathen theology which taught the genealogy of their gods.\n\nHefiod gives us the ancient theogony in a poem under that title. Among the most ancient writers, Dr Burne observes that theogony and cosmogony signified the same thing. In effect, the generation of the gods of the ancient Persians, fire, water, and earth, is apparently no other than that of the primary elements.\n\nTHEOGNIS, an ancient Greek poet of Megara in Achaia, flourished about the 50th Olympiad, 144 B.C. We have a moral work of his extant, containing a summary of precepts and reflections, usually found in the collections of the Greek minor poets.\n\nTHEOLOGY\n\nDefinition. Is a Greek word (θεολογία), and signifies that science which treats of the being and attributes of God, his relations to us, the dispensations of his providence, his will with respect to our actions, and his purposes with respect to our end. The word was first used to denote the fables of those poets and philosophers who wrote of the genealogy and exploits of the gods of Greece. It was afterwards adopted by the earliest writers of the Christian church, who styled the author of the Apocalypse, by way of eminence, ἀποκάλυψις, the Divine.\n\nAlthough every pagan nation of antiquity had some tutelary deities peculiar to itself, they may yet be considered as having all had the same theology, since an intercommunity of gods was universally admitted, and the heavenly bodies were adored as the divi majorum gentium over the whole earth. This being the case, we are happily relieved from treating, in the same article, of the truths of Christianity and the fictions of paganism, as we have elsewhere traced idolatry from its source, and shewn by what means \"the foolish hearts of men became so darkened that they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.\" See POLYTHEISM.\n\nThe absurdities and inconsistency of the pretended revelation of the Arabian impostor have been sufficiently exposed under the words ALCORAN and MAHOMETANISM; so that the only theology of which we have to treat at present is the Christian theology, which comprehends that which is commonly called natural, and that which is revealed in the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. These taken together compose a body of science so important, that in comparison with it all other sciences sink into insignificance; for without a competent knowledge of the attributes of God, of the several relations in which he stands to us, and of the ends for which we were created, it is obvious that we must wander through life like men groping in the dark, strangers to the road on which we are travelling, as well as to the fate awaiting us at the end of our journey.\n\nBut if this knowledge be necessary to all Christians, it is doubly so to those who are appointed to feed the flock of Christ, and to teach the ignorant what they are to believe, and what to do, in order to work out their own salvation. The wisdom and piety of our ancestors have accordingly founded professorships of theology intended for all our universities, where the principles of our religion the service are taught in a systematic and scientific manner; and of the church has ordained, that no man shall be admitted to the office of a preacher of the gospel who has not attended a regular course of such theological lectures.\n\nIt must not, however, be supposed, that, by merely listening to a course of lectures however able, any man will become an accomplished divine. The principles of this science are to be found only in the word and works of God; and he who would extract them pure and unsophisticated, must dig for them himself in that exhaustless mine. To fit a man for this important investigation, much previous knowledge is requisite. He must study the works of God scientifically before he can perceive the full force of that testimony which they bear to the power, the wisdom, and the goodness of their author. Hence the necessity of a general acquaintance with the physical and mathematical sciences before a man enter on the proper study of theology, for he will not otherwise obtain just and enlarged conceptions of the God of the universe. See PHYSICS, N° 115.\n\nBut an acquaintance with the physical and mathematical sciences is not alone a sufficient preparation for the study of theology. Indeed it is possible for a man to devote himself wholly to any of these sciences, as to make it counteract the only purposes for which it can be valuable to the divine; for he who is constantly immersed in matter, is apt to suspect that there is no other substance; and he who is habituated to the routine of geometrical demonstration, becomes in time incapable of reasoning at large, and estimating the force of the various degrees of moral evidence. To avert these disagreeable consequences, every man, before he enter on the study of that science which is the subject of the present article, should make himself acquainted with the principles of logic, the several powers of the human mind, and the different sources of evidence; in doing which he will find the greatest assistance from Bacon's Novum Organum.\nThe man who proposes to study theology ought to have it in view, as the ultimate end of his labours, to impart to others that knowledge which he may procure for himself. \"Amongst the many marks which distinguish the Christian philosopher from the Pagan, this (says a learned writer) is one of the most striking—the Pagan sought knowledge in a selfish way, to secrete it for his own use; the Christian seeks it with the generous purpose (first in view, though last in execution) to impart it to others. The Pagan philosopher, therefore, having cultivated the art of speaking, proceeds to that of speaking, in order to display his vanity in the dexterous use of deceit. On the other hand, the Christian philosopher cultivates the art of speaking, for the sole purpose of disseminating the truth in his office of preacher of the gospel.\"\n\nAs every man, before he enters on the proper study of theology, receives, at least in this country, the rudiments of a liberal education, it may perhaps be superfluous to mention here any books as peculiarly proper to teach him the art of speaking; we cannot however forbear to recommend to our student the attentive perusal of Quintilian's Institutions, and Dr Blair's Lectures on Rhetoric and the Belles Lettres. A familiar acquaintance with these works will enable him, if he be endowed by nature with talents fit for the office in which he proposes to engage, to express his thoughts with correctness and elegance; \"without which, it has been well observed, that science, especially in a clergyman, is but learned lumber, a burden to the owner, and a nuisance to everybody else.\"\n\nNo man can proceed thus far in the pursuits of general science without having been at least initiated in the learned languages; but he who intends to make theology his profession should devote himself more particularly to the study of Greek and Hebrew, because in these tongues the original scriptures are written. He who is incapable of consulting the original scriptures, must rest his faith, not on the sure foundation of the word of God, but on the credit of fallible translators; and if he be at any time called on to vindicate revelation against the scoffs of infidelity, he will have to struggle with many difficulties which are easily solved by him who is master of the original tongues.\n\nThe student having laid in this stock of preparatory knowledge, is now qualified to attend with advantage the theological lectures of a learned professor; but in doing this, he should be very careful neither to admit nor reject anything on the bare authority of his matter. Right principles in theology are of the utmost importance, and can rest on no authority inferior to that of the word of God. On this account we have long been of opinion, that a professor cannot render his pupils so much service by a systematical course of lectures, as by directing their studies, and pointing out the road in which they may themselves arrive in the shortest time at the genuine sense of the sacred scriptures. In this opinion we have the honour to agree with the ablest lecturer* in theology that we have ever heard. The authors of all systems are more or less prejudiced in behalf of some particular and artificial mode of faith. He, therefore, who begins with the study of them, and afterwards proceeds to the sacred volume, sees with a jaundiced eye every text supporting the peculiar tenets of his first matter, and acts as absurd a part as he who tries not the gold by the copel, but the copel by the gold. Before our young divine, therefore, sit down to the serious perusal of any one of those institutes or bodies of theology which abound in all languages, and even before he read that which the nature of our work compels us to lay before him, we beg leave to recommend to his consideration the following\n\nPreliminary Directions for the Study of Theology.\n\nChristian theology is divided into two great parts, Christian natural and revealed; the former comprehending that theology which may be known of God from the creation of the world, even his eternal power and Godhead; the latter, that which is discovered to man nowhere but in the sacred volume of the Old and New Testaments.\n\nConcerning the extent of natural theology many opinions have been formed, whilst some have contended that there is no such thing. Into these disputes we mean not at present to enter. We believe that one of them could have had an existence among sober and enlightened men, had the contending parties been at pains to define with accuracy the terms which they used. Whatever be the origin of religion, which we have endeavoured to ascertain elsewhere (see Religion, No. 6—17.), it is obvious, that no man can receive a written book as the word of God till he be convinced by some other means that God exists, and that he is a Being of power, wisdom, and goodness, who watches over the conduct of his creature man. If the progenitor of the human race was instructed in the principles of religion by the Author of his being (a fact of which it is difficult to conceive how a consistent theist can entertain a doubt), he might communicate to his children, by natural means, much of that knowledge which he himself could not have discovered had he not been supernaturally enlightened. Between illustrating or proving a truth which is already talked of, and making a discovery of what is wholly unknown, every one perceives that there is an immense difference (A).\n\nTo beings whose natural knowledge originates wholly from\n\n(A) The discriminating powers of Aristotle will not be questioned; and in the following extract made by Cicero from some of his works which are now lost, he expresses our sentiments on this important subject with his usual precision:—\"Præclare ergo Aristoteles, si essent, inquit, qui sub terra semper habitavissent, bonis, et illustri bus domiciliis, quae effrent ornata signis atque picturis, instructaque rebus illis omnibus, quibus abundant ii, qui beati putantur, nec tamen existent unquam supra terram: ACCEPISSENT AUTEM FAMA ET AUDITIONE, ESSE QUODDAM NUMEN,\"\nPreliminary from sensation, and whose minds cannot, but by much discipline, advance from sense to science, a long series of revelations might be necessary to give them at first just notions of God and his attributes, and to enable them to perceive the relation between the effect and its cause, so as to infer by the powers of their own reason the existence of the Creator from the presence of his creatures. Such revelations, however, could be satisfactory only to those who immediately received them. Whenever the Deity has been pleased by supernatural means to communicate any information to man, we may be sure that he has taken effectual care to satisfy the person so highly favoured that his understanding was not under the influence of any illusion; but such a person could not communicate to another the knowledge which he had thus received by any other means than an address to his rational faculties. No man can be required to believe, no man indeed can believe, without proof, that another, who has no more faculties either of sensation or intellect than himself, has obtained information from a source to which he has no possible access. An appeal to miracles would in this case serve no purpose; for we must believe in the existence, power, wisdom, and justice of God, before a miracle can be admitted as evidence of anything but the power of him by whom it is performed. See Miracle.\n\nIt is therefore undeniable that there are some principles of theology which may be called natural; for though it is in the highest degree probable that the parents of mankind received all their theological knowledge by supernatural means, it is yet obvious that some parts of that knowledge must have been capable of a proof purely rational, otherwise not a single religious truth could have been conveyed through the succeeding generations of the human race but by the immediate inspiration of each individual. We indeed admit many propositions as certainly true, upon the sole authority of the Jewish and Christian scriptures, and we receive these scriptures with gratitude as the lively oracles of God; but it is self-evident that we could not do either the one or the other, were we not convinced by natural means that God exists, that he is a Being of goodness, justice, and power, and that he inspired with divine wisdom the penmen of these sacred volumes. Now, though it is very possible that no man or body of men, left to themselves from infancy in a desert world, would ever have made a theological discovery; yet whatever propositions relating to the being and attributes of the first cause and the duty of man, can be demonstrated by human reason, independent of written revelation, may be called natural theology, and are of the utmost importance, as being to us the first principles of all religion. Natural theology, in this sense of the word, is the foundation of the Christian revelation; for without a previous knowledge of it, we could have no evidence that the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are indeed the word of God.\n\nOur young divine, therefore, in the regular order of his studies, ought to make himself master of natural theology before he enter upon the important task of studying the scriptures. On this subject many books have been published in our own and other languages; but perhaps there is none more worthy of attention than the Religion of Nature delineated by Mr Wollaston (B). It is a work of great merit, and bears ample testimony to its author's learning and acuteness; yet we think it ought to be read with caution. Mr Wollaston's theory of moral obligation is fanciful and groundless; and commendable whilst we readily acknowledge that he demonstrates many truths with elegance and perspicuity, we cannot deny that he attempts a proof of others, for which we believe no other evidence can be brought than the declarations of Christ and his apostles in the holy scriptures. To supply the defects of his theory of morals, we would recommend to the student an attentive perusal of Cumberland on the Law of Nature, and Paley's Elements of Moral Philosophy. A learned author * of Warburton, firms of Cumberland, that \"he excels all men in fixing the\n\nNUMEN, ET VIM DEORUM; deinde aliquo tempore, patefactis terrae faucibus, ex illis abditis sedibus evadere in hæc loca, quæ nos incolimus, atque exire potuissent: cum repente terram, et maria, coelumque vidissent: nubium magnitudinem, ventorumque vim cognovissent, adspexitentque folem, ejufque tum magnitudinem, pulchritudinemque, tum etiam efficientiam cognovissent, quod diem effeceret, toto coelo luce diffusa: cum autem terras nox opacæfet, tum coelum totum cerneret aëris distinctum et ornatum, lunæque luminum varietatem tum crecientem, tum fenebrantem, eorumque omnium ortus et occasus, atque in omni rerumtate ratos, immutabileisque cursus: hæc cum vident, PROPECTO ET ESSE DEOS, et HÆC TANTA OPERA DEORUM ESSE arbitrarentur.\" De Nat. Deorum, lib. ii. § 37.\n\nFrom this passage it is evident, that the Stagyrite, though he considered the motions of the heavenly bodies, the ebbing and flowing of the sea, and the other phenomena of nature, as affording a complete proof of the being and providence of God, did not however suppose that from these phenomena an untaught barbarian would discover this fundamental principle of religion. On the contrary, he expressly affirms, that before a man can feel the force of the evidence which they give of this important truth, he must have heard of the existence and power of God.\n\n(B) It may not be improper to inform the reader, that Mr Wollaston, the author of the Religion of Nature, was a different man from Mr Woolston, who blasphemed the miracles of our Saviour. The former was a clergyman of great piety, and of such moderate ambition as to refuse one of the highest preferments in the church of England when it was offered to him; the latter was a clergyman likewise, but remarkable only for gloomy infidelity, and a perverse desire to deprive the wretched of every source of comfort. In the mind of the former, philosophy and devotion were happily united; in the mind of the latter, there was neither devotion nor science. Yet these writers have been frequently confounded; sometimes through inadvertence from the similarity of their names; and sometimes, we are afraid, deftly, from a weak and bigotted abhorrence of every system of religion that pretends to have its foundation in reason and in the nature of things.\nthe true grounds of moral obligation, out of which natural law and natural religion both arise; and we have ourselves never read a work in which the various duties which a man owes to his Maker, himself, and his fellow-creatures, are more accurately stated or placed on a surer basis than in the moral treatise of the arch-deacon of Carlisle.\n\nAs Wollaston demonstrates with great perspicuity, the being and many of the attributes of God, it may perhaps appear superfluous to recommend any other book on that subject. The present age, however, having among other wonderful phenomena, witnessed a revival of Atheism, we would advise our student to read with much attention Cudworth's Intellectual System, and to read it rather in Moehlheim's Latin translation than in the author's original English. It is well known that Cudworth wrote his incomparable work in confutation of Hobbes's philosophy; but instead of confining himself to the whimsies of his antagonist, which were in a little time to sink into oblivion, he took a much wider range, and traced atheism through all the mazes of antiquity, exposing the weakness of every argument by which such an absurdity had ever been maintained. In exhausting the metaphysical questions agitated among the Greeks concerning the being and perfections of God, he has not only given us a complete history of ancient learning, as far as it relates to these inquiries, but has in fact anticipated most of the sophisms of our modern atheists, who are by no means such discoverers as they are supposed to be by their illiterate admirers.\n\nThe student having made himself master of natural theology, and carefully endeavoured to ascertain its limits, is now prepared to enter on the important task of searching the scriptures. In doing this, he ought to devote himself as much as possible of the prejudices of education in behalf of a particular system of faith, and sit down to the study of the sacred volume as of a work to which he is an entire stranger. He ought first to read it as a moral history of facts and doctrines, beginning with the books of Moses, and proceeding through the rest, not in the order in which they are commonly published, but in that in which there is reason to believe they were written (see Scriptures). If he be master of the Hebrew and Greek languages, he will doubtless prefer the original text to any version; and in this perilous we would advise him to consult no commentator, because his object at present is not to study the doctrines contained in the bible, but merely to discover what are the subjects of which it treats. Many histories of the bible have been written; and were we acquainted with a good one, we should recommend it as a clue to direct the young divine's progress through the various books which compose the sacred volume. Stackhouse's history has been much applauded by some, and as much censured by others. It is not a work of which we can express any high degree of approbation; but if read with attention, it may no doubt be useful as a guide to the series of facts recorded in the scriptures. Between the Old and New Testaments there is a great chasm in the history of the Jewish nation; but it is supplied in a very able and satisfactory manner by Dr. Prideaux, whose Old and New Testament connected is one of the most valuable historical works in our own or any other language. Suckford's Sacred and Profane History of the World connected is likewise a work of merit, and may be read with advantage as throwing light on many pages of the Old Testament; but this author is not entitled to the same confidence with Prideaux, as his learning was not so great, and his partialities seem to have been greater.\n\nIn thus making himself master of the history of the Old and New Testaments, the student will unavoidably acquire some general notion of the various doctrines which they contain. These it will now be his business to study more particularly, to ascertain the precise meaning of each, and to distinguish such as relate to the whole human race, from those in which Abraham and his posterity were alone interested. He must therefore travel over the sacred volume a second time; and still we would advise him to travel without a guide. From Walton's Polyglot Bible, and the large collection called Critici sacri, he may indeed derive much assistance in his endeavours to ascertain the sense of a difficult text; but we think he will do well to make little use of commentators and expounders, and still less of system-builders, till he has formed some opinions of his own reflecting the leading doctrines of the Jewish and Christian religions.\n\n\"Impressed (says an able writer) with an awful sense of the importance of the sacred volume, the philosophical divine will shake off the bias of prejudices however formed, of opinions however sanctioned, and of passions however constitutional, and bring to the study of it the advantage of a pure and impartial mind. Instead of wasting all his labour upon a number of minute and less significant particulars, and of refining away plain and obvious sense by the subtleties of a narrow and corrosive mind, his first object will be to institute a theological inquiry into the general design of the written word, and from principles fully contained and fairly understood, to illustrate the true nature and genius of the religious dispensation in all its parts. He will mark the difference between the first and second covenants, and observe the connection that subsists between them. He will trace the temporary economy of the Old Testament, and weigh the nature and intent of the partial covenant with the Jews; observing with astonishment how it was made introductory of better things to come: and he will follow it through the law and the prophets in its wonderful evolutions, till he see this vast and preparatory machine of providence crowned and completed in the eternal gospel. This New Testament, the last and best part of the religious dispensation, he will pursue through the sacred pages of that gospel with redoubled attention; contemplating the divine foundation on which it claims to be built, the supernatural means by which it was executed, and the immortal end which it has in view.\"\n\nIn the course of this inquiry into the import of the sacred volume, the student will pay particular attention to the circumstances of the age and country in which its various writers respectively lived, and to the nature of the different styles, analogical and parabolical, in which it is written. He will likewise keep in mind that God, whom it claims for its author, is the parent of truth, and that all his actions and dispensations must be consistent with one another. He will therefore compare the different passages of the Old and New Testaments which relate to the same doctrine, or to the same event, reasonably concluding that the bible must be the best interpreter of itself; and though the opinions which he thus forms...\nPreliminary forms may often be erroneous, they will seldom be dangerous errors, and may easily be corrected by mature reflection, or by consulting approved authors who have treated before him of the various points which have been the subject of his studies. Of this mode of proceeding one good consequence will be, that, having from the sacred scriptures formed a system of theology for himself, he will afterwards study the systems of other men without any violent prejudices for or against them; he will be so much attached to his own opinions as not to relinquish them in obedience to mere human authority, at the same time that he will be ready to give them up when convinced that they are not well founded; and if he have read the scriptures attentively, he will have acquired such a love of truth as to embrace her wherever she may be found.\n\nAs we have supposed that every man, after having formed a theological system of his own, will consult the systems of others, it may perhaps be expected that we should here recommend those which, in our opinion, are most worthy of his attention. To do this, however, would, we apprehend, be an interference with the rights of private judgement. But lest we should be suspected of wishing to bias the mind of the young student toward the short system which we are obliged to give, we shall just observe, that by the divines of what is called the Arminian school, Episcopus's Theologia Institutiones, Limborch's Theologia Christiana, and Locke's Reasonableness of Christianity, have long been held in the highest esteem; whilst the followers of Calvin have preferred the Institutiones of their master, Turretine's Institutiones Theologica Elementae, and Gill's Body of Divinity. This last work has many merits and many defects. Its style is coarse and tedious; and the author embraces every opportunity of introducing the discriminating tenets of his feet; but his book is fraught with profound learning, breathes the spirit of piety, and may be read with advantage by every divine who has previously formed the outlines of a system for himself.\n\nAs the Jewish and Christian dispensations are closely linked together, being only parts of one great whole, it is impossible to have an adequate notion of the latter without understanding the design of the former. Now, though the Mosaic religion is nowhere to be learned but in the Old Testament, it may be convenient for our student, after he has formed his own opinions of it from that sacred source, to know what has been written on the subject by others. For illustrating the ritual law, a learned prelate warmly recommends the Doctor Dubitantium of Maimonides, and Spencer's book entitled De Legibus Hebræorum Ritualibus. Both works have undoubtedly great merit; but our young divine will do well to read along with them Hermanni Witthi Ægyptiaca, and Dr Woodward's Discourse on the Worship of the Ancient Egyptians, where some of Spencer's notions are shortly and ably refuted. On the other parts of this dispensation, such as the nature of its civil government; the rewards and punishments peculiar to it (c); its extraordinary administration by appointed agents, endowed with supernatural powers, and directions, with the gifts of miracles and prophecy; the double sense in which the latter is sometimes involved; and the language consequent on its nature and use—the reader will find much erudition and ingenuity displayed in the second part of Warburton's Divine Legation of Moses demonstrated. That work is entitled to a serious perusal; for it displays great learning and genius, and, we believe, the heaviest censures have fallen on it from those by whom it was never read.\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the course, the student's inquiry to next business should be to inquire seriously what evidence there is that the doctrines which he has so carefully studied were indeed revealed in times past by God. He must already have perceived, in the nature and tendency of the doctrines themselves, strong marks of their origin being more than human; but he must likewise have met with many difficulties, and he must prepare himself to repel the attacks of unbelievers. Here he will find opportunities of exerting the utmost powers of his reasoning faculties, and of employing in the service of religion all the stores he may have amassed of human learning. The scriptures pretend to have been written by several men who lived in different ages of the world; but the latest of them, in an age very remote from the present. His first business therefore must be to prove the authenticity of these books, by tracing them up by historical evidence to the several writers whose names they bear. But it is not enough to prove them authentic. They profess to have been written by men divinely inspired, and of course infallible in what they wrote. He must therefore inquire into the truth of this inspiration. The Bible contains a number of truths doctrinal and moral, which are called mysteries, and asserted to be the immediate dictates of God himself. To evince this great point to man, a number of supernatural tests and evidences are inseparably connected with those mysteries; so that if the former be true, the latter must be likewise. He must therefore examine these tests and evidences, to establish the divinity of the Holy Scriptures; and in this part of his course he will find much assistance from many writers whose defences of the truth and divinity of the Christian religion do honour to human nature.\n\nThe first step towards the embracing of any truth is, Books recommended on the Mosaic dispensation. to get fairly rid of the objections which are made to it; and the general objections made by deistical writers to the Christian revelation are by no writer more completely removed than by Bishop Butler, in his celebrated work entitled The Analogy of Religion natural and revealed to the Constitution and Course of Nature. This book therefore the student should read with attention, and meditate on with patience; but as it does not furnish a positive proof of the divinity of our religion, he should pass from it to Grotius de Veritate Religionis Christianæ, and Stillingfleet's Origines Sacrae. Both these works are excellent; and the latter, which may be considered\n\n(c) On this subject the reader will find many excellent observations in Bishop Bull's Harmonia Apostolica, with its several defences, and in a small book of Dr Wells's, entitled A Help for the Right Understanding of the several Divine Laws and Covenants, whereby man has been obliged through the several ages of the world to guide himself in order to salvation.\nPreliminary considered as an improvement of the former, is perhaps the fullest and ablest defence of revelation in general that is to be found in any language. In this part of the united kingdom it is now indeed scarcely mentioned, or mentioned with indifference; but half a century ago the English divines thought it a subject of triumph, and styled its author their incomparable Stillingfleet. Other works, however, may be read with great advantage, and none with greater than Paley's Evidences of the Christian Religion, and Leslie's Short Method with the Deists; which last work, in the compass of a very few pages, contains proofs of the divinity of the Jewish and Christian revelations, to which the celebrated Dr Middleton confessed (d), that for 20 years he had laboured in vain to fabricate a specious answer (e).\n\nHaving satisfied himself of the truth of revelation in general, it may be worth the young divine's while to provide a defence of the Christian religion against the objections of modern Judaism. In this part of his studies he will need no other instruction than what he may reap from Limborch's work entitled De Veritate Religions Christianae amica collatio cum erudito Judeo.\n\n\"In that disputation, which was held with Orobius, he will find all that the stretch of human parts on the one hand, or science on the other, can produce to vanquish error or unravel sophistry. All the papers of Orobius in defence of Judaism, as opposed to Christianity, are printed at large, with Limborch's answers, fed by fiction; and the subtlest sophisms of a very superior genius are ably and satisfactorily detected and exposed by the strong, profound, and clear reasoning, of this renowned remonstrant.\" See Orobius and Limborch.\n\nThe various controversies subsisting between the several denominations of Christians, about points which separate them into different churches, ought next to be studied in the order of the course; for nothing is unimportant which divides the followers of that Master whose favourite precept was love. It has indeed been long fashionable to decry polemical divinity as an useless, if not a pernicious, study; but it is not impossible that this fashion has had its origin in ignorance, and that it tends to perpetuate those schisms which it professes to lament. We are, however, far from recommending to the young divine a perusal of the works of the several combatants on each side of a disputed question, till he has fitted himself for judging between them by a long course of preparatory study; and the only preparation which can fit him for this purpose is an impartial study of ecclesiastical history. He who has with accuracy traced the progress of our holy religion from the days of the apostles to the present time, and marked the introduction of new doctrines, and the rise of the various sects into which the Christian world is divided, is furnished with a criterion within himself by which to judge of the importance and truth of the many contested doctrines; whilst he who, without this preparation, shall read a multitude of books on any religious controversy, will be in danger of becoming a convert to his last author, if that author possess any tolerable share of art and ingenuity.\n\nThere are many histories of the Christian church which possess great merit, but we are acquainted with none which appears to us wholly impartial. Mosheim's History, and perhaps the most perfect compend (f); and one of books whose greatest excellencies is, that on every subject the best commentators are referred to for fuller information. These indeed should often be consulted, not only to supply the defects necessarily resulting from the narrowness of the limits which the author, with great propriety, prescribed to himself; but also to correct his partial obliquities; for with all his merits, and they were many and great, he is certainly not free from the influence of prejudice. Indeed there is no coming at the true history of the primitive church, but by studying the works of the primitive writers; and the principal works of the first four centuries will amply reward the labour of perusing them (g). The rise and progress of the reformation in general, the most important period of church-history, may be best learned from Sleidan's book De Statu Religiosi et Reipublicae, Carolo V. Cæsare, Commentarii; the History of the Reformation of the Church of Scotland from Knox and Spottiswoode; and that of the Church of England from the much applauded work of Bishop Burnet.\n\nAfter this course of ecclesiastical history, the young divine may read with advantage the most important controversies which have agitated the Christian world. To enumerate these controversies, and to point out the ablest authors who have written on each, would be a tedious, and perhaps not a very profitable task. On one controversy, however, we are induced to recommend a very masterly work, which is Chillingworth's book against Knott, entitled The Religion of Protestants a safe way to Salvation; in which the school jargon of that Jesuit is admirably exposed, and the long dispute between\n\n(d) This piece of information we had from the late Dr Berkeley, prebendary of Canterbury, who had it from Archbishop Secker, to whom the confession was made.\n\n(e) To these defences of revelation we might have added the collection of sermons preached at Boyle's lecture from 1691 to 1732, published in three volumes folio, 1739; the works of Leland; Bishop Newton's Dissertations on Prophecy; and above all, Lardner's Credibility of the Gospel History, with the Supplement to it. But there would be an end of recommending eminent writers on this subject. We have mentioned such as we most approve among those with whom we are best acquainted; but we must, once for all, caution the reader against supposing that we approve of every thing to be found in any work except the sacred Scriptures.\n\n(f) The bishop of Landaff, in the catalogue of books published at the end of his Theological Tracts, recommends several other ecclesiastical histories as works of great merit; such as, Dupin's, Eckhard's, Gregory's and Torney's, together with Paul Ernesti Jablonski Institutiones Historiae Christianæ, published at Frankfort in three volumes, 1754-67.\n\n(g) For a proof of this position, and for a just estimate of the value of the Fathers, as they are called, see the introduction to Warburton's Julian, and Keit's Sermons at Bampton's Lectures.\nPART I. OF NATURAL THEOLOGY.\n\nSect. I. Of the Being and Attributes of God.\n\nHE who cometh to God, says an ancient divine*, deeply read in the philosophy of his age, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him. This is a truth as undeniable as that a man cannot concern himself about a nonentity. The existence of God is indeed the foundation of all religion, and the first principle of the science which is the subject of this article. It is likewise a principle which must command the assent of every man who has any notion of the relation between effects and their causes, and whose curiosity has ever been excited by the phenomena of nature. This great and important truth we have elsewhere endeavoured to demonstrate (see Metaphysics, Part III., Chap. vi.) ; but it may be proved by arguments less abstracted than the nature of that article required us to use. Of these we shall give one or two, which we hope will be level to every ordinary capacity; while, at the same time, we earnestly recommend to the young divine a diligent study of those books on the\nBeing and the subject which we have mentioned in the preceding directions.\n\nWe see that the human race, and every other species of animals, is at present propagated by the co-operation of two parents; but has this process continued from eternity? A moment's reflection will convince us that it has not. Let us take any one man alive, and let us suppose his father and mother dead, and himself the only person at present existing: how came he into the world? It will be said he was produced mechanically or chemically by the conjunction of his parents, and that his parents were produced in the same manner by theirs. Let this then be supposed; it must surely be granted, that when this man was born, an addition was made to the series of the human race. But a series which can be enlarged may likewise be diminished; and by tracing it backwards, we must at some period, however remote, reach its beginning. There must therefore have been a first pair of the human race, who were not propagated by the conjunction of parents. How did these come into the world?\n\nAnaximander tells us*, that the first men and all animals were bred in warm moisture, inclosed in crustaceous skins like crab-fish or lobsters; and that when they arrived at a proper age, their shell-like prisms growing dry, broke, and made way for their liberty. Empedocles informs us, that mother Earth at first brought forth vast numbers of legs, and arms, and heads, &c. which, approaching each other, arranging themselves properly, and being cemented together, started up at once full grown men.\n\nSurely those sages, or their followers, should have been able to tell us why the earth has not in any climate this power of putting forth vegetative men or the parts of men at present. If this universal parent be eternal and self-existent, it must be incapable of decay or the smallest change in any of its qualities; if it be not eternal, we shall be obliged to find a cause for its existence, or at least for its form and all its powers. But such a cause may have produced the first human pair, and undoubtedly did produce them, without making them spring as plants from the soil. Indeed the growth of plants themselves clearly evinces a cause superior to any vegetative power which can be supposed inherent in the earth. No plant can be propagated but from seed or slips from the parent stock; but when one contemplates the regular process of vegetation, the existence of every plant implies the prior existence of a parent seed, and the existence of every seed the prior existence of a parent plant. Which then of these, the oak or the acorn, was the first, and whence was its existence derived? Not from the earth: for we have the evidence of universal experience that the earth never produces a tree but from seed, nor feed but from a tree. There must therefore be some superior power which formed the first seed or the first tree, planted it in the earth, and gave to it those powers of vegetation by which the species has been propagated to this day.\n\nThus clearly do the processes of generation and vegetation indicate a power superior to those which are usually called the powers of nature. The same thing appears no less evident from the laws of attraction and repulsion, which plainly prevail through the whole system of matter, and hold together the stupendous structure. Experiment shows that very few particles of the most solid body are in actual contact with each other (see Being and Optics, No. 63—68, Physics, No. 23); and that there are considerable interferences between the particles of every elastic fluid, is obvious to the smallest reflection. Yet the particles of solid bodies strongly cohere, whilst those of elastic fluids repel each other. How are these phenomena accounted for? To say that the former is the effect of attraction and the latter of repulsion, is only to say that two individual phenomena are subject to those laws which prevail through the whole of the classes under which they are respectively arranged; whilst the question at issue is concerning the origin of the laws themselves, the power which makes the particles of gold cohere, and those of air repel each other. Power without subsistence is inconceivable; and by a law of human thought, no man can believe a being to operate but where it is in some manner or other actually present: but the particles of gold adhere, and the particles of air keep at a distance from each other, by powers exerted where no matter is present. There must therefore be some subsistence endowed with power which is not material.\n\nOf this subsistence or being the power is evidently immense. The earth and other planets are carried round the sun with a velocity which human imagination can scarcely conceive. That this motion is not produced by the agency of these vast bodies on one another, or by the interposition of any material fluid, has been shown elsewhere (see Metaphysics, No. 196—200, and Optics, No. 67); and since it is a law of our best philosophy, that we are not to multiply substances without necessity, we must infer that the same Being which formed the first animals and vegetables, endowing them with powers to propagate their respective kinds, is likewise the cause of all the phenomena of nature, such as cohesion, repulsion, elasticity, and motion, even the motions of the heavenly bodies themselves.\n\nIf this powerful Being be self-existent, intelligent, and independent in his actions and volitions, he is an original or first cause, and that Being whom we denominate God. If he be not self-existent and independent, there must be a cause in the order of nature prior and superior to Him, which is either itself the first cause, or a link in that series of causes and effects, which, however vast we suppose it, must be traced ultimately to some one Being, who is self-existent, and has in himself the power of beginning motion, independent of everything but his own intelligence and volition. In vain have Atheists alleged, that the series may ascend infinitely, and for that reason have no first mover or cause.\n\nAn infinite series of successive beings involves an absurdity and contradiction (see Metaphysics, No. 288): of an infinite but not to insist on this at present, we shall only beg the reader to consider such a series as a whole, and see what consequences will flow from the supposition. That we may with logical propriety consider it in this light, is incontrovertible; for the birth of each individual of the human race shows that it is made up of parts; but parts imply a whole as necessarily as an attribute implies its subject. As in this supposed series there is no cause which is not likewise an effect, nor any body moving another which was not itself moved by a third, the whole is undeniably equivalent to an infinite effect, or an infinite body moved: but if a finite effect must necessarily have proceeded from a cause, and a finite body in\nBeing in motion must have been put into that state by a mover; is there a human mind which can conceive an infinite effect to have proceeded from no cause, or an infinite body in motion to have been moved by nothing? No, surely! An infinite effect, were such a thing possible, would compel us to admit an infinite cause, and an infinite body in motion a mover of infinite power.\n\nThis great cause is God, whose wisdom, power, and goodness, all nature loudly proclaims. That the phenomena which we daily see evince the existence of one such Being, has just been shown; and that we have no reason to infer the existence of more than one, is very evident. For, not to lay more stress than it will bear on that rule of Newton's, which forbids us to multiply substances without necessity, such a harmony prevails through the whole visible universe, as plainly shows it to be under the government of one intelligence. That on this globe the several elements serve for nourishment to plants, plants to the inferior animals, and animals to man; that the other planets of our system are probably inhabited, and their inhabitants nourished in the same or a similar manner; that the sun is so placed as to give light and heat to all, and by the law of gravitation to bind the whole planets into one system with itself—are truths so obvious and so universally acknowledged, as to supersede the necessity of establishing them by proof. The fair inference therefore is, that the solar system and all its parts are under the government of one intelligence, which directs all its motions and all the changes which take place among its parts for some wise purposes. To suppose it under the government of two or more intelligences would be highly unreasonable; for if these intelligences had equal power, equal wisdom, and the same designs, one of them would evidently be superfluous; and if they had equal power and contrary designs, they could not be the parents of that harmony which we clearly perceive to prevail in the system.\n\nBut the Being capable of regulating the movements of so vast a machine, may well be supposed to possess infinite power, and to be capable of superintending the motions of the universe. That the widely extended system of nature is but one system, of which the several parts are united by many bonds of mutual connection, has been shown elsewhere (see Physics), and appears daily more and more evident from our progress in physical discoveries; and therefore it is in the highest degree unreasonable to suppose that it has more than one author, or one supreme governor.\n\nAs the unity of design apparent in the works of creation plainly proves the unity of their Author, so do the immensity of the whole, and the admirable adjustment of the several parts to one another, demonstrate His power and His wisdom. On this subject the following beautiful reflections by Mr Wollaston are deserving of the most serious attention.\n\n\"In order (says that able writer *) to prove to any Attributes of God.\n\nThere is only one original cause.\n\nVol. XX. Part I.\n\nvisits which the comets make to us, and the large trains of uncommon splendor which attend them, the far country from which they come, and the curiosity and horror which they excite not only among us, but in the inhabitants of other planets, who may also be up to see the entry and progress of these ministers of fate; to direct his eye and contemplation through those azure fields and vast regions above him up to the fixed stars, that radiant numberless host of heaven; and to make him understand how unlikely a thing it is that they should be placed there only to adorn and bespangle a canopy over our heads; to convince him that they are rather so many other firms, with their several systems of planets about them; to show him by the help of glasses still more and more of these fixed lights, and to beget in him an apprehension of their inconceivable numbers, and those immense spaces that lie beyond our reach and even our imagination: One needs but to do this (continues our author), and explain to him such things as are now known almost to every body; and by it to show, that if the world be not infinite, it is infinite similar, and undoubtedly the work of an Infinite Architect.\n\n\"But if we would take a view of all the particulars contained within that astonishing compass which we have thus hastily run over, how would wonders multiply upon us? Every corner, every part of the world, is as it were made up of other worlds. If we look upon this our earth, what scope does it furnish for admiration? The great variety of mountains, hills, valleys, plains, rivers, seas, trees, and plants! The many tribes of different animals with which it is stocked; the multifarious inventions and works of one of these, i.e., of us men; with the wonderful instincts of others, guiding them uniformly to what is best for themselves, in situations where neither sense nor reason could direct them. And yet when all these (heaven and earth) are surveyed as nicely as they can be by the help of our unassisted senses and of telescopes, we may discover by the assistance of good microscopes, in very small parts of matter, as many new wonders as those already discovered, new kingdoms of animals, with new and curious architecture. So that as our senses and even conception fainted before in the vast journeys we took in considering the expanse of the universe, they here again fail us in our researches into the principles and minute parts of which it is composed. Both the beginnings and the ends of things, the least and the greatest, all conspire to baffle us; and which way forever we prosecute our inquiries, we still meet with fresh subjects of amazement, and fresh reasons to believe that there are indefinitely more and more behind, that will forever escape our eagerness pursuits and deepest penetration.\n\n\"In this vast assemblage, and amidst all the multifarious motions by which the several processes of generation and corruption, and the other phenomena of nature, are carried on, we cannot but observe that there are stated methods, as so many forms of proceeding, to which things punctually and religiously adhere. The same causes circumstanced in the same manner produce always the same effects; all the species of animals among us are made according to one general idea; and so are those of plants also, and even of minerals. No new species are brought forth or have arisen anywhere; and the old are preserved and continued by the old ways.\n\n\"It appears, lastly, beyond dispute, that in the part\nBeing and Attributes of God.\n\nAnd model of the world there is a contrivance for accomplishing certain ends. The sun is placed near the centre of our system, for the more convenient dispensing of his benign influences to the planets moving about him; the place of the earth's equator intersects that of her orbit, and makes a proper angle with it, in order to diversify the year, and create an useful variety of seasons; and many other things of this kind will be always observed, and though a thousand times repeated, be meditated upon with pleasure by good men and true philosophers. Who can observe the vapours to ascend, especially from the sea, meet above in clouds, and fall again after condensation, without being convinced that this is a kind of distillation, in order to clear the water of its grosser salts, and then by rains and dews to supply the fountains and rivers with fresh and wholesome liquor; to nourish the vegetables below by showers, which descend in drops as from a watering-pot upon a garden? Who can view the structure of a plant or animal, the indefinite number of its fibres and fine vessels, the formation of larger vessels, and the several members out of them, with the apt disposition of all these; the means contrived for the reception and distribution of nutriment; the effect this nutriment has in extending the vessels, bringing the vegetable or animal to its full growth and expansion, continuing the motion of the several fluids, repairing the decays of the body, and preserving life? Who can take notice of the several faculties of animals, their arts of faving and providing for themselves, or the ways in which they are provided for; the uses of plants to animals, and of some animals to others, particularly to mankind; the care taken that the several species should be propagated, without confusion, from their proper seeds; the strong inclination planted in animals for that purpose, their love of their young and the like.—Who (says our author) can observe all this, and not see a design in such regular pieces, so nicely wrought and so admirably preserved? If there were but one animal in existence, and it could not be doubted but that his eyes were formed that he might see with them, his ears that he might hear with them, and his feet to be instruments by which he might remove himself from place to place; if design and contrivance can be much less doubted, when the same things are repeated in the individuals of all the tribes of animals; if the like observations be made with respect to vegetables and other things; and if all these classes of things, and much more the individuals comprehended under them, be inconceivably numerous, as most unquestionably they are—one cannot but be convinced, from what so plainly runs through the nobler parts of the visible world, that not only they, but other things, even those that seem to be less noble, have their ends likewise, though not always perceived by capacities limited like ours. And since we cannot, with the Epicureans of old, suppose the parts of matter to have contrived among themselves this wonderful form of a world, to have taken by agreement each its respective part, and then to have pursued in conjunction constant ends by certain methods and measures concerted, there must be some other Being, whose wisdom and power are equal to such a mighty work as is the structure and preservation of the world. There must be some Almighty Mind who modelled and preserves it: lays the causes of things so deep; prescribes them such uniform and steady laws; defines and adapts them to certain purposes; and makes one thing fit and answer another so as to produce one harmonious whole. Yes,\n\nThese are thy glorious works, Parent of good! Almighty, thine this universal frame, Thus wondrous fair; Thyself how wondrous then!\n\nHow wondrous in wisdom and in power!\"\n\nBut the goodness of God is not less conspicuous in goodness in his works than His power or His wisdom. Contrivance proves design, and the predominant tendency of the contrivances indicates the disposition of the designer. \"The world (says an elegant and judicious writer *) * Dr Paley, abounds with contrivances, and all the contrivances in it which we are acquainted are directed to beneficial purposes. Evil no doubt exists; but it is never that we can perceive the object of contrivance. Teeth are contrived to eat, not to ache; their aching now and then is incidental to the contrivance, perhaps inseparable from it; but it is not its object. This is a distinction which well deserves to be attended to. In delineating implements of husbandry, one would hardly say of a sickle that it is made to cut the reaper's fingers, though from the construction of the instrument, and the manner of using it, this mischief often happens. But if he had occasion to describe instruments of torture or execution, this, he would say, is to extend the finesse; this to dislocate the joints; this to break the bones; this to scourch the soles of the feet. Here pain and misery are the very objects of the contrivance. Now nothing of this sort is to be found in the works of nature. We never discover a train of contrivance to bring about an evil purpose. No anatomist ever discovered a system of organization calculated to produce pain and disease; or, in explaining the parts of the human body, ever said, this is to irritate, this to inflame, this duct is to convey the gravel to the kidney, this gland to secrete the humour which forms the gout. If by chance he come to a part of which he knows not the use, the most that he can say is, that to him it appears to be useless; no one ever supposes that it is put there to incommode, to annoy, or to torment. If God had wished our misery, he might have made sure of his purpose, by forming our senses to be as many fores and pains to us as they are now instruments of gratification and enjoyment; or, by placing us among objects so ill suited to our perceptions as to have continually offended us, instead of ministering to our refreshment and delight. He might have made, for instance, every thing we tasted bitter, every thing we saw loathsome, every thing we touched a stinging, every smell a stench, and every sound a discord.\"\n\nInstead of this, all our sensations, except such as are excited by what is dangerous to our health, are pleasures to us: The view of a landscape is pleasant; the taste of nourishing food is pleasant; sounds not too loud are agreeable, while musical sounds are exquisite; and scarcely any smells, except such as are excited by effluvia obviously pernicious to the brain, are disagreeable; while some of them, if not too long indulged, are delightful. Our lives are preserved and the species is continued by obeying the impulse of appetites; of which the gratification is exquisite when not repeated too frequently, to answer the purposes of the Author of our being. Since, then, God has called forth his confluence\nBeing and mate wisdom to contrive and provide for our happiness, attributes and has made those things which are necessary to our existence and the continuance of the race sources of our greatest sensual pleasures, who can doubt but that benevolence is one of his attributes; and that, if it were not impious to draw a comparison between them, it is the attribute in which he himself most delighteth.\n\nBut it is not from sensation only that we may infer the benevolence of the Deity: He has formed us with minds capable of intellectual improvement, and he has implanted in the breast of every man a very strong desire of adding to his knowledge. This addition, it is true, cannot be made without labour; and at first the requisite labour is to most people irksome; but a very short progress in any study converts what was irksome into a pleasure of the most exalted kind; and he who by study, however intense, enlarges his ideas, experiences a complacency, which, though not so poignant perhaps as the pleasures of the sensualist, is such as endears him to himself, and is what he would not exchange for anything else which this world has to offer, except the still sweeter complacency arising from the consciousness of having discharged his duty.\n\nThat the practice of virtue is attended with a peculiar pleasure of the purest kind, is a fact which no man has ever questioned, though the immediate source of that pleasure has been the subject of many disputes. He who attributes it to a moral sense, which instinctively points out to every man his duty, and on the performance of it rewards him with a sentiment of self-approbation, must of necessity acknowledge benevolence to be one of the attributes of that Being who has so constituted the human mind. That to protect the innocent, relieve the distressed, and do to others as we would in like circumstances wish to be done by, fills the breast, previous to all reflection, with a holy joy, as the conviction of any crime tears it with remorse, cannot indeed be controverted. Many, however, contend, that this joy and this remorse spring not from any moral instinct implanted in the mind, but are the consequence of early and deep-rooted associations of the practice of virtue with the hope of future happiness, and of vice with the dread of future misery. On the respective merits of these two theories we shall not now decide, but only observe, that they both lead with equal certainty to the benevolence of the Deity, who made us capable of forming affections, and subjected these affections to fixed laws. This being the case, the moral sense, with all its instantaneous effects, affords not a more convincing proof of his goodness, than that principle in our nature by which remote circumstances become so linked together, that the one circumstance never occurs without bringing the other also into view. It is thus that the pleasing complacency, which was perhaps first excited by the hopes of future happiness, comes in time to be so associated with the consciousness of virtuous conduct, the only thing entitled to reward, that a man never performs a meritorious action without experiencing the most exquisite joy diffused through his mind, though his attention at that instant may not be directed either to heaven or futurity. Were we obliged, before we could experience this joy, to estimate by reason the merit of every individual action, and trace its connection to heaven and future happiness through a long train of intermediate reasoning, we should be in a great measure deprived of the present reward of virtue; and therefore this associating principle contributes much to our happiness. But the benevolence of a Being, who seems thus anxious to furnish us with both sensual and intellectual enjoyments, and who has made our duty our greatest pleasure, cannot be questioned; and therefore we must infer, that the Author of Nature wishes the happiness of the whole sensible and intelligent creation.\n\nTo such reasoning as this in support of the Divine Objections, Benevolence many objections have been made. Some of them appear at first sight plausible, and are apt to flatter the faith of him who has bestowed no time on the study of that branch of general science which is called physics (see Physics). To omit these altogether in such an article as this might be construed into neglect; while it is certain that there is in them nothing worthy the attention of that man who is qualified either to estimate their force, or to understand the arguments by which they have often been repelled.\n\nIt has been asked, Why, if the Author of Nature be a benevolent Being, are we necessarily subject to pain, disease, and death? The scientific physiologist replies, Because from these evils Omnipotence itself could not in our present state exempt us, but by a constant series of miracles. He who admits miracles, knows likewise that mankind were originally in a state in which they were not subject to death; and that they fell under its dominion through the fault of their common progenitors. But the fall and restoration of man is the greatest subject of revealed religion; and at present we are disfranchising the question like philosophers who have no other data on which to proceed than the phenomena of nature. Now we know, that as all matter is divisible, every system composed of it must necessarily be liable to decay and dissolution; and our material system would decay and be dissolved long before it could serve the purposes of nature, were there not methods contrived with admirable wisdom for repairing the waste occasioned by perpetual friction. The body is furnished with different fluids, which continually circulate through it in proper channels, and leave in their way what is necessary to repair the solids. These again are supplied by food ad extra; and to the whole processes of digestion, circulation, and nutrition, the air we breathe is absolutely necessary. But as the air is a very heterogeneous fluid, and subject to violent and sudden changes, it is obvious that these changes must affect the blood, and by consequence the whole frame of the human body. The air indeed in process of time consumes even marble itself; and therefore we cannot wonder, that as it is in one state the parent of health, it should in another be the source of disease to such creatures as man and other terrestrial animals. Nor could these consequences be avoided without introducing others much more deplorable. The world is governed by general laws, without which there could be among men neither arts nor sciences; and though laws different from those by which the system is at present governed might perhaps have been established, there is not the smallest reason to imagine that they could on the whole have been better, or attended with fewer inconveniences. As long as we have material and solid bodies capable of motion, liable to resistance from other solid bodies, supported by food,\nsubject to the agency of the air, and divisible, they must necessarily be liable to pain, disease, corruption, and death, and that too by the very influence of those laws which preserve the order and harmony of the universe. Thus gravitation is a general law so good and so necessary, that were it for a moment suspended, the world would instantly fall to pieces; and yet by means of this law the man must inevitably be crushed to death on whom a tower shall chance to tumble. Again, the attraction of cohesion is a general law, without which it does not appear that any corporeal system could possibly exist: it is by this law too, or a modification of it, that the glands and lacteals of the human body extract from the blood such particles as are necessary to nourish the solids; and yet it is by means of the very same modification of the very same law that a man is liable to be poisoned.\n\nAlthough the human body could not have been preserved from dangers and dilution but by introducing evils greater on the whole than those to which it is now liable, why, it has sometimes been asked, is every disorder to which it is subject attended with sickness or with pain? and why is such a horror of death implanted in our breasts, feeling that by the laws of nature death is inevitable? We answer, That sickness, pain, and the dread of death, serve the very best purposes. Could a man be put to death, or have his limbs broken without feeling pain, the human race had long ago been extinct. Felt we no uneasiness in a fever, we should be insensible of the disease, and die before we suspected our health to be impaired. The horror which generally accompanies our reflections on death tends to make us more careful of life, and prevents us from quitting this world rashly when our affairs prosper not according to our wishes. It is likewise an indication that our existence does not terminate in this world; for our dread is seldom excited by the prospect of the pain which we may suffer when dying, but by our anxiety concerning what we may be doomed to suffer or enjoy in the next stage of our existence; and this anxiety tends more perhaps than anything else to make us live while we are here in such a manner as to ensure our happiness hereafter.\n\nThus from every view that we can take of the works and laws of God, and even from considering the objections which have sometimes been made to them, we are compelled to acknowledge the benevolence of their Author. We must not, however, suppose the Divine benevolence to be a fond affection like that which is called benevolence among men. All human affections and passions originate in our dependence and wants; and it has been doubted whether any of them be at first disinterested (see PASSION): but he to whom existence is essential cannot be dependent; he who is the Author of everything can feel no want. The divine benevolence therefore must be wholly disinterested, and of course free from those partialities originating in self-love, which are alloys in the most sublime of human virtues. The most benevolent man on earth, though he wishes the happiness of every fellow-creature, has still, from the ties of blood, the endearments of friendship, or, perhaps from a regard to his own interest, some particular favourites whom, on a competition with others, he would certainly prefer. But the equal Lord of all can have no particular favourites. His benevolence is therefore coincident with justice; or, that which is called divine justice, is only benevolence exerting itself in a particular Being and manner for the propagation of general felicity. When God prescribes laws for regulating the conduct of his intelligent creatures, it is not because he can reap any benefit from their obedience to those laws, but because such obedience is necessary to their own happiness; and when he punishes the transgressor, it is not because in nature there is any disposition to which the prospect of such punishment can afford gratification, but because in the government of free agents punishment is necessary to reform the criminal, and to intimidate others from committing the like crimes.\n\nThe essence of this self-existent, all-powerful, infinitely wise, and perfectly good Being, is to us wholly incomprehensible. That it is not matter, is shown by the process of argumentation by which we have proved it to exist: but what it is we know not, and it would be impious presumption to inquire. It is sufficient for all the purposes of religion to know that God is some how or other present to every part of his works; that existence and every possible perfection is essential to him; and that he wishes the happiness of all his creatures. From these truths we might proceed to illustrate the perpetual superintendence of his providence, both general and particular, over every minute part of the universe: but that subject has been discussed in a separate article; to which, therefore, we refer the reader. (see PROVIDENCE). We shall only observe at present, that the manner in which animals are propagated affords as complete a proof of the constant superintendence of divine power and wisdom, as it does of the immediate exertion of these faculties in the formation of the parent pair of each species. For were propagation carried on by necessary and mechanical laws, it is obvious, that in every age there would be generated, in each species of animals, the very same proportion of males to females that there was in the age preceding. On the other hand, but could generation depend on fortuitous mechanism, it is not flantly preconceivable but that, since the beginning of the world, sent to his several species of animals should in some age have generated nothing but males, and others nothing but females; and that of course many species would have been long since extinct. As neither of these cases has ever happened, the preservation of the various species of animals, by keeping up constantly in the world a due, though not always the same, proportion between the sexes of male and female, is a complete proof of the superintendence of divine providence, and of that saying of the apostle, that it is \"in God we live, move, and have our being.\"\n\nSect. II. Of the Duties and Sanctions of Natural Religion.\n\nFrom the short view that we have taken of the divine perfections, it is evidently our duty to reverence in our minds the self-existent Being to whom they belong. This is indeed not only a duty, but a duty of which no man who contemplates these perfections, and believes them to be real, can possibly avoid the performance. He who thinks irreverently of the Author of nature, can never have considered ferociously the power, the wisdom, and the goodness, displayed in his works; for whoever has a tolerable notion of these must be convinced, that he who performed them has no imperfection;\nPart I.\n\nDuties and Sanctions of Natural Religion.\n\nSanctified by whom no positive idea should be formed.\n\nHow he ought to be spoken of; and what is meant by serving him.\n\nTheology.\n\nThat his power can accomplish every thing which involves not a contradiction; that his knowledge is intuitive, and free from the possibility of error; and that his goodness extends to all without partiality and without any alloy of selfish design. This conviction must make every man on whose mind it is impressed ready to prostrate himself in the dust before the Author of his being; who, though infinitely exalted above him, is the source of all his enjoyments, constantly watches over him with paternal care, and protects him from numberless dangers. The sense of so many benefits must excite in his mind a sentiment of the liveliest gratitude to him from whom they are received, and an ardent wish for their continuance.\n\nWhile silent gratitude and devotion thus glow in the breast of the contemplative man, he will be careful not to form even a mental image of that all-perfect Being to whom they are directed. He knows that God is not material; that he exists in a manner altogether incomprehensible; that to frame an image of him would be to assign limits to what is infinite; and that to attempt to form a positive conception of him would be impiously to compare himself with his Maker.\n\nThe man who has any tolerable notion of the perfections of the Supreme Being will never speak lightly of him, or make use of his name at all but on great and solemn occasions. He knows that the terms of all languages are inadequate and improper, when applied directly to him who has no equal, and to whom nothing can be compared; and therefore he will employ these terms with caution. When he speaks of his mercy and compassion, he will not consider them as feelings wringing the heart like the mercy and compassion experienced by man, but as rays of pure and disinterested benevolence. When he thinks of the stupendous system of nature, and hears it, perhaps, said that God formed it for his own glory, he will reflect that God is so infinitely exalted above all his creatures, so perfect in himself, that he can neither take pleasure in their applause, nor receive any accession of any kind from the existence of ten thousand worlds. The immense fabric of nature therefore only displays the glory or perfections of its Author to us and to other creatures who have not faculties to comprehend him in himself.\n\nWhen the contemplative man talks of serving God, he does not dream that his services can increase the divine felicity; but means only that it is his duty to obey the divine laws. Even the pronoun He, when it refers to God, cannot be of the same import as when it refers to man; and by the philosophical divine it will seldom be used but with a mental allusion to this obvious distinction.\n\nAs the man who duly venerates the Author of his being will not speak of him on trivial occasions, so will he be still further from calling upon him to witness impertinences and falsehood, (see OATH). He will never mention his name but with a pause, that he may have time to reflect in silence on his numberless perfections, and on the immense distance between himself and the Being of whom he is speaking. The slightest reflection will convince him that the world with all that it contains depends every moment on that God who formed it; and this conviction will compel him to wish for the divine protection of himself and his friends from all dangers and misfortunes. Such a wish is in effect a prayer, and will always be accompanied with adoration, confession, and thanksgiving (see PRAYER). But adoration, duties and confessions, supplication, and thanksgiving, constitute what is called worship, and therefore the worship of God is a natural duty. It is the addressing of ourselves as his dependants to him as the supreme cause and governor of the world, with acknowledgements of what we enjoy, and petitions for what we really want, or he knows to be convenient for us. As if, ex gr. I should in some humble and composed manner (says Mr Wollaston) pray to that \" Almighty Being, upon whom depends the existence of the world, and by whose providence I have been preserved to this moment, and enjoyed many undeserved advantages, that he would graciously accept my grateful sense and acknowledgments of duty, of all his beneficence towards me; that he would deliver me from the evil consequences of all my transgressions and follies; that he would endue me with such dispositions and powers as may carry me innocently and safely through all future trials, and may enable me on all occasions to behave myself conformably to the laws of reason piously and wisely; that He would suffer no being to injure me, no misfortunes to befall me, nor me to hurt myself by any error or misconduct of my own; that he would vouchsafe me clear and distinct perceptions of things; with so much health and prosperity as may be good for me; that I may at least pass my time in peace, with contentment and tranquillity of mind; and that having faithfully discharged my duty to my family and friends, and endeavoured to improve myself in virtuous habits and useful knowledge, I may at last make a decent and happy exit, and find myself in some better state.\"\n\nThat an untaught savage would be prompted by instinct to address the Supreme Being in such terms as this, we are so far from thinking, that to us it appears not probable that such a savage, in a state of solitude, would be led by instinct to suppose the existence of that Being. But as soon as the being and attributes of God were, by whatever means, made known to man, every sentiment expressed in this prayer must necessarily have been generated in his mind; for not to be sensible that we derive our existence and all our enjoyments from God, is in effect to deny his being or his providence; and not to feel a wish that he would give us what we want, is to deny either his goodness or his power.\n\nThe worship of God therefore is a natural duty resulting from the contemplation of his attributes and a sense of our own dependence. But the reasoning which has led us to this conclusion respects only private devotion; for it is a question of much greater difficulty, and far enough from being yet determined, whether public worship be a duty of that religion which can with any propriety be termed natural. Mr Wollaston indeed positively affirms that it is, and endeavours to prove his position by the following arguments.\n\n\"A man (says he) may be considered as a member of some society; and as such he ought to worship God for it, if he has the opportunity of doing it, if there be proper prayers used publicly to which he may refer, and if his health, &c. permit. Or the society may be considered as one body, that has common interests and concerns, and as such is obliged to worship the Deity, and offer one prayer. Besides, there are many who know not of themselves...\"\nDuties and themselves how to pray; perhaps cannot so much as Sanctions of read. These must be taken as they are; and consequently some time and place appointed where they may have suitable prayers read to them, and be guided in their devotions. And further, towards the keeping mankind in order, it is necessary there should be some religion professed, and even established, which cannot be without public worship. And were it not for that sense of virtue which is principally preserved (so far as it is preserved) by national forms and habits of religion, men would soon lose it all, run wild, prey upon one another, and do what else the worst of savages do.\n\nThese are in themselves just observations, and would come with great force and propriety from the tongue or pen of a Christian preacher, who is taught by revelation that the Matter whom he serves has commanded his followers \"not to forsake the assembling of themselves together,\" and has promised, \"that if two of them shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of his Father who is in Heaven.\" As urged by such a man, and on such grounds, they would serve to show the fitness of the divine command, and to point out the benefits which a religious obedience to it might give us reason to expect. But the author is here professing to treat of natural religion, and to state the duties which result from the mere relation which subsists between man as a creature and God as his creator and constant preserver. Now, though we readily admit the benefits of public worship as experienced under the Christian dispensation, we do not perceive any thing in this reasoning which could lead a pious thief to expect the same benefit previous to all experience. When the author thought of national forms and establishments of religion, he certainly lost sight of his proper subject, and, as such writers are too apt to do, comprehended under the idea of nature what belongs only to that which is revealed. Natural religion, in the proper sense of the words, admits of no particular forms, and of no legal establishment. Private devotion is obviously one of its duties, because sentiments of adoration, confession, supplication, and thanksgiving, necessarily spring up in the breast of every man who has just notions of God and of himself; but it is not so obvious that such notions would induce any body of men to meet at stated times for the purpose of expressing their devotional sentiments in public. Mankind are indeed social beings, and naturally communicate their sentiments to each other; but we cannot conceive what should at first have led them to think that public worship at stated times would be acceptable to the self-existent Author of the universe. In case of a famine, or any other calamity in which the whole tribe was equally involved, they might speak of it to each other, inquire into its cause, and in the extremity of their distress join perhaps in one fervent petition, that God would remove it. In the same manner they might be prompted to pour forth occasional ejaculations of public gratitude for public mercies; but it does not follow from these incidental occurrences that they would be led to institute times and places and forms of national worship, as if they believed the omnipotent Deity more ready to hear them in public than in private. That the appointment of such times and forms and places is beneficial to society, experience teaches us; and therefore it is the duty, and has been the practice, of the supreme magistrate, in every age and in every civilized country, to provide for the maintenance of the national worship. But this practice has taken its rise, not from the deductions of reason, but either from direct revelation, as among the Jews and Christians; or from tradition, which had its origin in some early revelations, as among the more enlightened Pagans of ancient and modern times.\n\nWe hope none of our readers will imagine that we mean, in any degree, to call in question the fitness or the duty of public worship. This is far from our intention; but while we are convinced of the importance and necessity of this duty, we do not apprehend that we lessen its dignity, or detract from the weight of almost universal practice, by endeavouring to derive that practice from its true source, which appears to us to be not human reason, but divine revelation.\n\nBut whatever doubts may be entertained with respect to the origin of public worship, there can be none as to the foundation of moral virtue. Reason clearly perceives it to be the will of our Maker, that each individual of the human race should treat every other individual as, in similar circumstances, he would expect to be treated himself. It is thus only that the greatest sum of human happiness can be produced (see Moral Philosophy, No. 17. and 135.) for were all men temperate, sober, just in their dealings, faithful to their promises, charitable to the poor, &c., it is obvious that no miseries would be felt on earth, but the few which, by the laws of corporeal nature, unavoidably result from the union of our minds with systems of matter. But the design of God in forming sentient beings was to communicate to them some portion, or rather some resemblance, of that felicity which is essential to himself; and therefore every action which in its natural tendency co-operates with this design must be agreeable to him, as every action of a contrary tendency must be disagreeable.\n\nFrom this reasoning it follows, that we are obliged not only to be just and benevolent to one another, but also to abstain from all unnecessary cruelty to inferior animals. That we have a right to tame cattle, and employ them for the purposes of agriculture and other arts where strength is required, is a position which we animals a little has seldom been controverted. But if it is the intention of God to communicate a portion of happiness to all his creatures endowed with sense, it is obvious that we sin against him when we subject even the horse or the ass to greater labour than he is able to perform; and this sin is aggravated when from avarice we give not the animal a sufficient quantity of food to support him under the exertions which we compel him to make. That it is our duty to defend ourselves and our property from the ravages of beasts of prey, and that we may even exterminate such beasts from the country in which we live, are truths which cannot be questioned; but it has been the opinion of men, eminent for wisdom and learning, that we have no right to kill an ox or a sheep for food, but in consequence of the divine permission to Noah recorded in the ninth chapter of the book of Genesis. Whether this opinion be well or ill founded we shall not positively determine, though the arguments on which it rests are of such a nature as the reasoners of the present day would perhaps find it no easy task to answer; but it cannot admit of a doubt, that, in killing such animals, we are, in duty to their Creator and ours, bound to put them to the least possible pain. If this be granted, it is still more evident\nDuties and evident that we act contrary to the divine will when we torture and put to death such animals as are confessedly not injurious to ourselves, or to any thing on which the comforts of life are known to depend. We are indeed far from being convinced with the poet, that insects and reptiles \"in mortal sufferance feel as when a giant dies:\" but their feelings on that occasion are certainly such, as that, when we wantonly inflict them, we thwart, as far as in our power, the benevolent purpose of the Creator in giving them life and sense. Let it be observed too, that the man who practises needless cruelty to the brute creation is training up his mind for exercising cruelty towards his fellow-creatures, to his slaves if he have any, and to his servants; and, by a very quick progress, to all who may be placed beneath him in the scale of society.\n\nSuch are the plain duties of natural religion; and if they were universally practised, it is evident that they would be productive of the greatest happiness which mankind could enjoy in this world, and that piety and virtue would be their own reward. They are however far from being universally practised; and the consequence is, that men are frequently raised to affluence and power by vice, and sometimes sunk into poverty by a rigid adherence to the rules of virtue.\n\nThis being the case, there can be no question of greater importance, while there are few more difficult to be answered, than \"What are the sanctions by which natural religion enforces obedience to her own laws?\" It is not to be supposed that the great body of mankind should, without the prospect of an ample reward, practise virtue in those instances in which such practice would be obviously attended with injury to themselves; nor does it appear reasonable in any man to forego present enjoyment, without the well-grounded hope of thereby securing to himself a greater or more permanent enjoyment in reverent. Natural religion therefore, as a system of doctrines influencing the conduct, is exceedingly defective, unless it affords sufficient evidence, intelligible to every ordinary capacity, of the immortality of the soul, or at least of a future state of rewards and punishments. That it does afford this evidence, is strenuously maintained by some divines, and by many philosophers of a different description, who, though they profess Christianity, seem to have some unaccountable dread of being deceived by their bibles in every doctrine which cannot be supported by philosophical reasoning.\n\nOne great argument made use of to prove that the immortality of the soul is among the doctrines of natural religion, is the universal belief of all ages and nations that men continue to live in some other state after death has separated their souls from their bodies. \"Quod si omnium confusus nature vox est: omnique, qui ubique sint, consentiunt ebe aliquid, quod ad eos pertineat, qui vita cesserint: nobis quoque idem existimandum est: et si, quorum aut ingenio, aut virtute animus excellit, eos arbitratur, quia natura optima sunt, cernere naturam maxime: verisimile est, omnem optimam quisque maximae posteritati serviat, ebe aliquid, cujus est mortem semper fit habiturus. Sed ut deos effe natura opinamus, qualeque sint, ratione cognoscimus, sic permanere animos arbitramur confusa natum omnium.\"\n\nThat this is a good argument for the truth of the doctrine, through whatever channel men may have received it, we readily acknowledge; but it appears not to us to be any proof of that doctrine's being the deduction of human reasoning. The popular belief of Paganism, both ancient and modern, is so fantastic and absurd, that it could never have been rationally inferred from what nature teaches of God and the soul. In the Elysium of the Greek and Roman poets, departed spirits were visible to mortal eyes; and must therefore have been clothed with some material vehicle of sufficient density to reflect the rays of light, though not to resist the human touch. In the mythology of the northern nations, as deceased heroes are represented as eating and drinking, they could not be considered as entirely divested of matter; and in every popular creed of idolatry, future rewards were supposed to be conferred, not for private virtue, but for public violence, on heroes and conquerors and the destroyers of nations. Surely no admirer of what is now called natural religion will pretend that these are part of its doctrines; they are evidently the remains of some primeval tradition obscured and corrupted in its long progress through ages and nations.\n\nThe philosophers of Greece and Rome employed much of the philosophy and great talents in disquisitions concerning the immortality of the soul and its state after death as could afford no rational support to suffering virtue. (See Metaphysics, Part III. chap. 4.) Socrates is indeed an exception. Confining himself to the study of ethics, that excellent person inferred by the common moral arguments (see Moral Philosophy, No. 232—246), that the reality of a future state of rewards and punishments is in the highest degree probable. He was not, however, at all times absolutely convinced of this important truth; for a little before his death he said to some who were about him, \"I am now about to leave this world, and ye are still to continue in it; which of us have the better part allotted us, God only knows.\" And again, Plato in the end of his most admired discourse concerning the Apology, immortality of the soul, delivered at a time when he must have been serious, he said to his friends who came to pay their last visit, \"I would have you to know that I have great hopes that I am now going into the company of good men; yet I would not be too peremptory and confident concerning it.\"\n\nNext to Socrates, Cicero was perhaps the most respectable of all the philosophers of antiquity; and he seems to have studied this great question with uncommon care: yet what were his conclusions? After retailing the opinions of various sages of Greece, and showing that some held the soul to be the heart; others, the blood in the heart; some the brain; others, the breath; one, that it was harmony; another, that it was number; one, that it was nothing at all; and another, that it was a certain quintessence without a name, but which might properly be called ethereal—he gravely adds, \"Harum fententiarum qua vera fit, Deus aliquis videt: qua rerum illimina, magna quaestio est.\" He then proceeds to give his own opinion; which was, that the soul is part of God.\n\nTo us who know by other evidence that the soul is immortal, and that there will be a future state in which all\nDuties and all the obliquities of the present state be made straight,\nSanctions of the argument drawn from the moral attributes of God,\nNatural Religion, and the unequal distribution of the good things of this\nlife, appears to have the force of demonstration. Yet none of us will surely pretend to say that his powers of\nreasoning are greater than were those of Socrates and Cicero; and therefore the probability is, that had we\nbeen like them destitute of the light of revelation, we\nshould have been disturbed by the same doubts, and have\nsaid with the latter, on reading the arguments of the\nformer as detailed by Plato. \"Necio quomodo, dum\nlego, affention: cum posui librum, et mecum ipse de im-\nmortaliitate animorum cepi cogitare, affention illa elabi-\ntur *.\"\n\nIbid.\n\nWithout the light of revelation we should have doubted\nlike them.\n\nNo one, we hope, will suspect us of an impious at-\ntempt to weaken the evidence of a future state. God for-\nbid! The expectation of that state is the only support\nof virtue and religion; and we think the arguments we\nhave stated elsewhere, and referred to on the present oc-\ncasion, make the reality of it so highly probable, that,\nthough there were no other evidence, he would act a\nvery foolish part who should confine his attention wholly\nto the present life. But we do not apprehend that we\ncan injure the cause either of virtue or of religion, by\nconfessing, that those arguments which left doubts in\nthe minds of Socrates and Cicero appear not to us to\nhave the force of complete demonstration of that life and\nimmortality which our Saviour brought to light through\nthe gospel.\n\nWere the case, however, otherwise; were the argu-\nments which the light of nature affords for the immor-\ntality of the human soul as convincing as any geometri-\ncal demonstration—natural religion would still be defec-\ntive; because it points out no method by which such as\nhave offended God may be restored to his favour, and\nto the hopes of happiness which by their sin they had\nlost. That he who knows whereof we are made would\nshow himself placable to sinners, and that he would find\nsome way to be reconciled, might perhaps be reasonably\ninferred from the consideration of his benevolence dif-\nplayed in his works. But when we come to inquire more\nparticularly how we are to be reconciled, and whether a\nproposition will be required, nature stops short, and ex-\npects with impatience the aid of some particular revela-\ntion. That God will receive returning sinners, and ac-\ncept of repentance instead of perfect obedience, cannot\nbe certainly known by those to whom he has not de-\nclared that he will. For though repentance be the most\nprobable, and indeed the only means of reconciliation\nwhich nature suggests; yet whether he, who is of purer\neyes than to behold iniquity, will not require something\nfurther before he restore sinners to the privileges which\nthey have forfeited, mere human reason has no way of\ndiscovering. From nature therefore arises no sufficient\ncomfort to sinners, but anxious and endless solicitude\nabout the means of appeasing the Deity. Hence those\ndifferent ways of sacrificing, and those numberless super-\nstitions which overspread the heathen world, but which\nwere so little satisfactory to the wiser part of mankind,\nthat, even in those days of darkness, the philosophers\nfrequently declared that, in their opinion, those rites and\noblations could avail nothing towards appeasing the\nwrath of an offended God, or making their prayers ac-\nceptable to him. Hence Socrates and one of his disciples\nare represented by Plato† as expecting a person divinely † In Alcibi-\ncommissioned to inform them whether sacrifices be ac-\nceptable to the deity, and as resolving to offer no more\ntill that person's arrival, which they piously hoped might\nbe at no great distance.\n\nThis darkness of the pagan world is to us who live\nunder the sunshine of the gospel happily removed by the\nvarious revelations contained in the scriptures of the Old\nand New Testaments. These taken together exhibit\nsuch a display of providence, such a system of doctrines,\nand such precepts of practical wisdom, as the ingenuity\nof man could never have discovered. The Christian,\nwith the scriptures in his hands, can regulate his con-\nduct by an infallible guide, and rest his hopes on the\nsurest foundation. These scriptures it is now our business\nto examine.\n\nPART II. OF REVEALED THEOLOGY.\n\nIN every civilized country the popular system of the-\nology has claimed its origin from divine revelation. The\nPagans of antiquity had their augurs and oracles; the\nChinese have their inspired teachers Confucius and Fohi:\nthe Hindoos have their sacred books derived from Bra-\nhama; the followers of Mahomet have their Koran dic-\ntated by an angel; and the Jews and Christians have\nthe scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, which\nthey believe to have been written by holy men of old,\nwho spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy\nGhost.\n\nThat the claims of ancient Paganism to a theology\nderived from heaven, as well as the similar claims of the\nChinese, Hindoos, and Mahometans, are ill founded, has\nbeen shown in various articles of this work, (see CHINA,\nHINDOSTAN, MAHOMETANISM, MYTHOLOGY, and PO-\nLYTHEISM); whilst under the words RELIGION, REVE-\nLATION, and SCRIPTURE, we have sufficiently proved\nthe divine inspiration of the Jewish and Christian scrip-\ntures, and of course the divine origin of Jewish and Chris-\ntian theology. These indeed are not two systems of theo-\nlogy, but parts of one system which was gradually re-\nvealed as men were able to receive it; and therefore\nboth scriptures must be studied by the Christian divine.\n\nThere is nothing in the sacred volume which it is not true,\nof importance to understand; for the whole proceeds\nfrom the fountain of truth: but some of its doctrines are\nmuch more important than others, as relating imme-\ndiately to man's everlasting happiness; and these it has\nbeen customary to arrange and digest into regular sys-\ntems, called bodies or institutes of Christian theology.\nCould these artificial systems be formed with perfect im-\npartiality, they would undoubtedly be useful, for the\nbible contains many historical details, but remotely re-\nlated to salvation; and even of its most important truths,\nit requires more time and attention than the majority of\nChristians have to bestow, to discover the mutual con-\nnections and dependence.\n\nArtificial systems of theology are commonly divided\ninto two great parts, the theoretic and the practical; and\nand these again are subdivided into many inferior branches.\n\nUnder the theoretic part are sometimes classified,\n\n1. Dogmatic theology; which comprehends an entire system of all the dogmas or tenets which a Christian is bound to believe and profess. The truth of these the divine must clearly perceive, and be able to enforce on his audience; and hence the necessity of studying what is called,\n\n2. The exegesis, or the art of attaining the true sense of the holy scriptures; and,\n\n3. Hermeneutic theology, or the art of interpreting and explaining the scriptures to others; an art of which no man can be ignorant who knows how to attain the true sense of them himself.\n\n4. Polemical theology, or controversy; and,\n\n5. Moral theology, which is distinguished from moral philosophy, or the simple doctrine of ethics, by teaching a much higher degree of moral perfection than the mere light of reason could ever have discovered, and adding new motives to the practice of virtue.\n\nThe practical sciences of the divine are,\n\n1. Homiletic or pastoral theology; which teaches him to adapt his discourses from the pulpit to the capacity of his hearers, and to pursue the best methods of guiding them by his doctrine and example in the way of salvation.\n\n2. Catechetical theology, or the art of teaching youth and ignorant persons the principal points of evangelical doctrine, as well with regard to belief as to practice.\n\n3. Confessional theology, or the science which decides on doubtful cases of moral theology, and that calms the scruples of conscience which arise in the Christian's soul during his journey through the present world.\n\nWe have mentioned these divisions and subdivisions of the science of theology, not because we think them important, but merely that our readers may be at no loss to understand the terms when they meet with them in other works. Of such terms we shall ourselves make no use, for the greater part of them indicate distinctions where there is no difference, and tend only to perplex the student. As the truths of Christianity are all contained in the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, it is obvious that dogmatic theology must comprehend the speculative part of that which is called moral, as well as every doctrine about which controversy can be of importance. But no man can extract a single dogma from the bible but by the practice of what is here called the exegesis; so that all the subdivisions of this arrangement of theoretical theology must be studied together as they necessarily coalesce into one. The same thing is true of the three branches into which the practical theology is here divided. He who has acquired the art of adapting his homilies to the various capacities of a mixed audience, will need no new study to fit him for instructing children, and the most ignorant persons who are capable of instruction; and the complete matter of moral theology will find it no very difficult task to resolve all the cases of conscience which he can have reason to suppose will ever be submitted to his judgement. For these reasons we shall not trouble our readers with the various divisions and subdivisions of theology. Our preliminary directions will show them how we think the science should be studied; and all that we have to do as system-builders is to lay before them the view which the scriptures present to us of the being and perfections of God, his various dispensations to man, and the duties thence incumbent on Christians. In doing this, we shall follow the order of the divine dispensations as we find them recorded in the Old and New Testaments, dwelling longest on those which appear to us of most general importance. But as we take it for granted that every reader of this article will have previously read the whole Sacred volume, we shall not scruple to illustrate dogmas contained in the Old Testament by texts taken from the New, or to illustrate doctrines peculiar to the Christian religion by the testimony of Jewish prophets.\n\nSect. I. Of God and his Attributes.\n\nIn every system of theology the first truths to be believed are those which relate to the being and attributes of God. The Jewish lawgiver, therefore, who records the earliest revelations that were made to man, begins God to his history with a display of the power and wisdom of a known God in the creation of the world. He does not inform his countrymen, and expect them to believe, on the authority of his divine commission, that God exists; for he well knew that the being of God must be admitted, and just notions entertained of his attributes, before man can be required to pay any regard to miracles which afford the only evidence of a primary revelation. \"In the beginning (says he) God created the heavens and the earth.\" Here the being of God is assumed as a truth universally received; but the sentence, short as it is, reveals another, which, as we shall afterwards show, human reason could never have discovered.\n\nThere is nothing which the scriptures more frequently or more earnestly inculcate than the unity of the divine nature. The texts asserting this great and fundamental truth are almost numberless. \"Unto thee (says Moses to his countrymen *) it was shewed, that thou mightest Deut. iv. know that the Lord is God; there is none else besides 35 and 39, him. Know therefore that the Lord he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else. And again, \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord,\" or, as it is expressed in the original, \"Jehovah our God is one Jehovah,\" one Being to whom existence is essential, who could not have a beginning and cannot have an end. In the prophecies of Isaiah, God is introduced as repeatedly declaring, \"I am Je-† Isaiah xiv. hovah, and there is none else; there is no God besides 5, 6, 18, me; that they may know from the rising of the sun and 21. xlv. 3. from the west, that there is none besides me: I am Jeho- uah, and there is none else: Is there a God besides me? Yea there is no God; I know not any.\" In perfect harmony with these declarations of Moses and the prophets, our Saviour, addressing himself to his Father, lays it, \"This is life eternal, that they might know John xvii. Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent;\" and St Paul, who derived his doctrine from his divine Master, affirms §, that \"an idol is no Cor. viii. thing in the world; and that there is none other God but one.\"\n\nThe unity of the divine nature, which, from the order and harmony of the world, appears probable to human reason, these texts of revelation put beyond a doubt. Hence the first precept of the Jewish law, and, according to their own writers, the foundation of their whole religion, was, \"Thou shalt have none other gods before Me.\"\nHence, too, the reason of that strict command to Jews and Christians to give divine worship to none but God: \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve;\" because he is God alone. Him only must we fear, because he alone hath infinite power; in him alone must we trust, because \"he only is our rock and our salvation;\" and to him alone must we direct our devotions, because \"he only knoweth the hearts of the children of men.\"\n\nThe word אֱלֹהִים does not indicate a plurality of gods. In the opinion, however, of many eminent divines, it denotes, by its junction with the singular verb, a plurality of persons in the one Godhead; and some few have contended, that by means of this peculiar construction, the Christian doctrine of the Trinity may be proved from the first chapter of the book of Genesis. To this latter opinion we can by no means give our assent. That there are three distinct persons in the one divine nature may be inferred with sufficient evidence from a multitude of passages in the Old and New Testaments diligently compared together; but it would perhaps be rash to rest the proof of so sublime a mystery on any single text of holy scripture, and would certainly be so to rest it on the text in question. That Moses was acquainted with this doctrine, we may reasonably conclude from his so frequently making a plural name of God to agree with a verb in the singular number; but had we not possessed the brighter light of the New Testament to guide us, we should never have thought of drawing such an inference. For supposing the word אֱלֹהִים to denote clearly a plurality of persons, how could we have known that the number is neither more or less than three, had it not been afterwards to us by subsequent revelations?\n\nThere are indeed various passages in the Old Testament, of the phraseology of which no rational account can be given, but that they indicate more than one person in the Godhead. Such are those texts already noticed; \"and the Lord God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness;\" and \"the Lord God said, behold the man is become like one of us.\" To these may be added the following, which are to us perfectly unintelligible on any other supposition; \"and the Lord God said, let us go down, and there confound their language.\" If I be a Master (in the Hebrew adonim, masters), where is my fear? The fear of the Lord (Jehovah) is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy (in the Hebrew holy ones) is understanding. Remember thy Creator (Hebrew, thy Creators) in the days of thy youth. And now the Lord God and his Spirit hath sent me. Seek ye out of the book of the Lord and read; for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.\n\nThat these texts imply a plurality of divine persons, seems to us incontrovertible. When Moses represents God as saying, let us make man, the majesty of the plural number had not been adopted by earthly sovereigns; and it is obvious that the Supreme Being could not, as has been supposed, call on angels to make man; for in different places of scripture creation is attributed to God alone. Hence it is that Solomon speaks of Creators in the plural number, though he means only the one Supreme Being, and exhorts men to remember them in the days of their youth. In the passage first quoted from Isaiah, there is a distinction made between the Lord God and his Spirit; and in the other, three divine persons are introduced, viz. the Speaker, the Lord, and the Spirit of the Lord. It does not, however, appear evident from these passages, or from any other that we recollect in the Old Testament, that the persons in Deity are three and no more: but no sober Christian will harbour a doubt but that the precise number was by some means or other made known to the ancient Hebrews; for inquiries leading to it would be naturally suggested by the form in which the high priest was commanded to bless the people. The Lord blest thee and keep thee. The Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.\n\nThe form of Christian baptism establishes the truth of a Trinity the doctrine of the Trinity beyond all reasonable ground in unity of dispute. Go (says our blessed Saviour) and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. What was it the apostles were to teach all nations? Was it not to turn from their vanities to the living God; to renounce their idols and false gods, and to be baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost? What now must occur to the Gentile nations on this occasion, but that, instead of all their deities, whom they had before bowed down, they were in future to serve, worship, and adore, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as the only true and living God? To suppose that God and two creatures are here joined together in the solemn rite by which men were to be admitted into a new religion, which directly condemns all creature-worship, would be so unreasonable, that we are persuaded such a supposition never was made by any converted Polytheist of antiquity. The nations were to be baptized in the name of three persons, in the same manner, and therefore, doubtless, in the same sense. It is not said in the name of God and his two faithful servants; nor in the name of God, and Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which might have suggested a thought that one only of the three is God; but in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Whatever honour, reverence, or regard, is paid to the first person in this solemn rite, the same is paid to all three. Is he acknowledged as the object of worship? So are the other two likewise. Is he God and Lord over us? So are they. Are we enrolled as subjects, servants, and foldiers under him? So are we equally under all. Are we hereby regenerated and made the temple of the Father? So are we likewise of the Son and Holy Ghost. We will come (says our Saviour) and make our abode with him.\n\nIf those who believe the inspiration of the scriptures could require any further proof that the Godhead comprehends a trinity of persons in one nature, we might urge the apostolical form of benediction; \"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.\" Would St Paul, or any other man of common sense, have in the same sentence, and in the most solemn manner, recommended his Corinthian converts to the love of God, and to the grace and communion of two creatures? We should think it very absurd to recommend a man at once to the favour of a king and a beggar.\nBut how, it will be asked, can three divine persons be but one and the same God? This is a question which has been often put, but which, we believe, no created being can fully answer. The divine nature and its manner of existence is, to us, wholly incomprehensible; and we might with greater reason attempt to weigh the mountains in scales, than by our limited faculties to fathom the depths of infinity. The Supreme Being is present in power to every portion of space, and yet it is demonstrable, that in his essence he is not extended (see Metaphysics, No. 309, 310). Both these truths, his inextension and omnipresence, are fundamental principles in what is called natural religion; and when taken together they form, in the opinion of most people, a mystery as incomprehensible as that of the Trinity in unity. Indeed there is nothing of which it is more difficult to form a distinct notion than unity simple, and absolutely indivisible. Though the Trinity in unity, therefore, were no Christian doctrine, mysteries must still be believed; for they are inseparable from the religion of nature as from that of revelation; and atheism involves the most incomprehensible of all mysteries, even the beginning of existence without a cause. We must indeed form the best notions that we can of this and all other mysteries; for if we have no notions whatever of a Trinity in unity, we can neither believe nor disbelieve that doctrine. It is however to be remembered, that all our notions of God are more or less analogical; that they must be expressed in words which, literally interpreted, are applicable only to man; and that propositions understood in this literal sense may involve an apparent contradiction, from which the truth meant to be expressed by them would be seen to be free, had we direct and adequate conceptions of the divine nature. On this account it is to be wished that men treating of the mystery of the Holy Trinity, had always expressed themselves in scripture language, and never aimed at being wise above what is written; but since they have acted otherwise, we must, in justice to our readers, animadvert on one or two statements of this doctrine, which we have reason to believe are earnestly contended for by some who consider themselves as the only orthodox.\n\nIn the scriptures, the three persons are denominated by the terms Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or by God, the Word, who is also declared to be God, and the Spirit of God. If each be truly God, it is obvious that they must all have the same divine nature, just as every man has the same human nature with every other man; and if there be but one God, it is equally obvious that they must be of the same individual substance or essence, which no three men can possibly be. In this there is a difficulty; but, as will be seen by and by, there is no contradiction. The very terms Father and Son imply such a relation between the two persons so denominated, as that though they are of the same substance, possessed of the same attributes, and equally God, just as a human father and his son are equally men, yet the second must be personally subordinate to the first. In like manner, the Holy Ghost, who is called the Spirit of God, and is said to proceed from the Father, and to be sent by the Son, must be conceived as subordinate to both, much in the same way as a son is subordinate to his parents, though possessed of equal or even of superior powers. That this is the true doctrine, appears to us undeniable from the words of our Saviour himself, who, in a prayer addressed to his Father, styles him by way of pre-eminence, \"the only true God,\" as John being the fountain or origin of the Godhead from which the Son and the Holy Ghost derive their true divinity. In like manner, St. Paul, when opposing the polytheism of the Greeks, says expressly, that \"to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him, or for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.\"\n\nThat the primitive fathers of the Christian church maintained this subordination of the second and third persons of the blest Trinity to the first, has been evinced with complete evidence by Bishop Bull. We shall transcribe two quotations from him, and refer the reader for fuller satisfaction to sect. 4. of his Defensio fidei Nicaeae. The first shall be a passage cited from Novatian, in which the learned prelate affirms us the sense of all the ancients is expressed. \"Quia quid est Filius, non ex se est, quia nec innatus est; sed ex patre est, quia genitus est; five dum verbum est, five dum virtus est, five dum sapientia est, five dum lux est, five dum Filius est, et quicquid horum est, non aliunde est quam ex Patre, Patri fac originem suam debens.\" The next is from Athanasius, who has never been accused of holding low opinions respecting the second person of the holy Trinity. This father, in his fifth discourse against the Arians, says, καὶ ἡ γὰρ τοῦ Λουκᾶν ἐστὶ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ὁ λόγος καὶ ὁ λόγος, ἢ πάντων τῶν ἀνθρώπων. Ὁς γὰρ ἦν ὁ ἀνθρώπους, καὶ ἦν ὁ ἀνθρώπους ὁ λόγος; according to John, the Word was in this first principle, and the Word was God. For God is the principle; and because the Word is from the principle, therefore the Word is God. Agreeably to this doctrine, the Nicene fathers, in the creed which they published for the use of the universal church, style the only begotten Son, God of God, ὁ Ἰησοῦς τῷ Θεῷ.\n\nRegardless however of antiquity, and of the plain sense of scripture, some modern divines of great learning have contended, that the three persons in Deity are all confounded, co-eternal, co-ordinate, without derivation, subordination, or dependence, of any sort, as to nature or essence; while others affirm, that the second and third persons derive from the first their personality, but not their nature. We shall consider these opinions as different, though, from the obscurity of the language in which we have always seen them expressed, we cannot be certain but they may be one and the same. The maintainers of the former opinion hold, that the three persons called Elohim in the Old Testament, naturally independent on each other, entered into an agreement before the creation of the world, that one of them should in the fulness of time assume human nature, for the purpose of redeeming mankind from that misery into which it was foreseen that they would fall. This antemundane agreement, they add, constitutes the whole of that paternal and filial relation which subsists between the first and second persons whom we denominate Father and Son; and they hold, that the Son is said to be begotten before all worlds, to indicate that He who was before all worlds was begotten, or to be begotten, into the office of\nof redeemer; or, more decisively, to signify that he undertook that office before the creation, and affirmed to himself some appearance or figure of the reality in which he was to execute it; and he is called ἀπογεννημένος or the only begotten, because he alone was begotten into the office of redeemer.\n\nTo many of our readers we doubt not but this will appear a very extraordinary doctrine, and not easy to be reconciled with the unity of God. It is however sufficiently overturned by two sentences of holy scripture, about the meaning of which there can be no dispute. \"In this (says St John) was manifested the love of God towards us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.\" Taking the word Son in its usual acceptation, this was certainly a wonderful degree of love in the Father of mercies to send into the world on our account a person so nearly related to him as an only son; but if we substitute this novel interpretation of the words only begotten Son in their stead, the apostle's reasoning will lose all its force. St John will then be made to say, \"In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent a divine person equal to himself, and no way related to him, but who had before the creation covenanted to come into the world, that we might live through him.\" Is this a proof of the love of the person here called God? Again, the inspired author of the epistle to the Hebrews, treating of our Saviour's priesthood, says, among other things expressive of his humiliation, that \"though he was a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;\" if we substitute this metaphorical fopship in place of the natural, the reasoning of the author will be very extraordinary. \"Though this divine personage agreed before all worlds to suffer death for the redemption of man, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.\" What sense is there in this argument? Is it a proof of condescension to fulfill one's engagement? Surely, if the meaning of the word Son, when applied to the second person of the blest Trinity, were what is here supposed, the inspired writer's argument would have been more to the purpose for which it is brought had it run thus; \"Though he was not a Son, i.e., though he had made no previous agreement, yet condescended he to learn,\" &c.\n\nThe other opinion, which supposes the Son and the Holy Ghost to derive from the Father their personality, but not their nature, is to us wholly unintelligible; for personality cannot exist, or be conceived in a state of separation from all natures, any more than a quality can exist in a state of separation from all substances. The former of these opinions we are unable to reconcile with the unity of God; the latter is clothed in words that have no meaning. Both, as far as we can understand them, are palpable polytheism; more palpable indeed than that of the Grecian philosophers, who though they worshipped gods many, and lords many, yet all held one God supreme over the rest. See Polytheism, No. 32.\n\nBut if the Son and the Holy Ghost derive their nature as well as their personality from the Father, will it not follow that they must be posterior to him in time, since every effect is posterior to its cause? No; this consequence seems to follow only by reasoning too closely from one nature to another, when there is between the two but a very distant analogy. It is indeed true, that among men, every father must be prior in time as well as in the order of nature to his son; but were it essential to a man to be a father, so as that he could not exist otherwise than in that relation, it is obvious that his son would be coeval with himself, though still as proceeding from him, he would be posterior in the order of nature. This is the case with all necessary causes and effects. The visible sun is the immediate and necessary cause of light and heat, either as emitting the rays from his own substance, or as exciting the agency of a fluid diffused for that purpose through the whole system. Light and heat therefore, must be as old as the sun; and had he existed from eternity, they would have existed from eternity with him, though still, as his effects, they would have been behind him in the order of nature. Hence it is, that as we must speak analogically of the Divine nature, and when treating of mind, even the Supreme mind, make use of words literally applicable only to the modifications of matter, the Nicene fathers illustrate the eternal generation of the second person of the blest Trinity by this procession of light from the corporeal sun, calling him God of God, light of light.\n\nAnother comparison has been made use of to enable us to form some notion, however inadequate, how three Divine persons can subsist in the same substance, and thereby constitute but one God. Moses informs us, that man was made after the image of God. That this relates to the soul more than to the body of man, has been granted by all but a few gross anthropomorphites; but it has been well observed *, that the soul, though in itself one indivisible and unextended substance, is conceived as consisting of three principal faculties, the understanding, the memory, and the will. Of these, though they are all coeval in time, and equally essential to a rational soul, the understanding is in the order of nature obviously the first, and the memory the second; for things must be perceived before they can be remembered; and they must be remembered and compared together before they can excite volitions, from being some agreeables, and others disagreeable. The memory therefore may be said to spring from the understanding, and the will from both; and as these three faculties are conceived to constitute one soul, so may three Divine persons partaking of the same individual nature or essence constitute one God.\n\nThese parallels or analogies are by no means brought forward as proofs of the Trinity, of which the evidence is to be gathered wholly from the word of God; but the Catholic doctrine they serve perhaps to help our labouring minds to form of the justest notions of that mystery which it is possible for any of us to form in the present state of our existence; and they seem to refuse the doctrine sufficiently from the charge of contradiction, which has been so often urged against it by Unitarian writers. To the last analogy we are aware it has often been objected, that the soul may as well be said to consist of ten or twenty faculties as of three, since the passions are equally essential to it with the understanding, the memory, and the will, and are as different from one another as these three faculties are.\nThis, however, is probably a mistake; for the best philosophy seems to teach us, that the passions are not innate; that a man might exist through a long life a stranger to many of them; and that there are probably no two minds in which are generated all the passions (see Passion); but understanding, memory, and will, are absolutely and equally necessary to every rational being. But whatever be in this, if the human mind can be conceived to be one indivisible substance, consisting of different faculties, whether many or few, why should it be thought an impossibility for the infinite and eternal nature of God to be communicated to three persons acting different parts in the creation and government of the world, and in the great scheme of man's redemption.\n\nTo the doctrine of the Trinity many objections have been made, as it implies the divinity of the Son and the Holy Ghost; of whom the former assumed our nature, and in it died for the redemption of man. These we shall notice when we come to examine the revelations more peculiarly Christian; but there is one objection which, as it respects the doctrine in general, may be properly noticed here. It is said that the first Christians borrowed the notion of a Triune God from the later Platonists; and that we hear not of a Trinity in the church till converts were made from the school of Alexandria. But if this be the case, we may properly ask, whence had those Platonists the doctrine themselves? It is not surely so simple or so obvious as to be likely to have occurred to the reasoning mind of a Pagan philosopher; or if it be, why do Unitarians suppose it to involve a contradiction? Plato indeed taught a doctrine in some respects similar to that of the Christian Trinity, and so did Pythagoras, with many other philosophers of Greece and the East (see Platonism, Polytheism, and Pythagoras); but though these fables appear to have been on some occasions extremely credulous, and on others to have indulged themselves in the most mysterious speculations, there is no room to suppose that they were naturally weaker men than ourselves, or that they were capable of inculcating as truths what they perceived to involve a contradiction. The Platonic and Pythagorean trinities never could have occurred to the mind of him who merely from the works of creation endeavoured to discover the being and attributes of the Creator; and therefore as those philosophers travelled into Egypt and the East in quest of knowledge, it appears to us in the highest degree probable, that they picked up this mysterious and sublime doctrine in those regions where it had been handed down as a dogma from the remotest ages, and where we know that science was not taught systematically, but detailed in collections of tententious maxims and traditionary opinions. If this be so, we cannot doubt but that the Pagan trinities had their origin in some primeval revelation. Nothing else indeed can account for the general prevalence of a doctrine so remote from human imagination, and of which we find vestiges in the sacred books of almost every civilized people of antiquity. The corrupt state in which it is viewed in the writings of Plato and others, is the natural consequence of its descent through a long course of oral tradition; and then falling into the hands of men who bent every opinion as much as possible to a conformity with their own speculations. The trinity of Platonism therefore, instead of being an objection, lends, in our opinion, no feeble support to the Christian doctrine, since it affords almost a complete proof of that doctrine's having made part of the first revelations communicated to man.\n\nHaving thus discovered that the one God comprehends three persons, let us now inquire what this triune God exerted when he created the heaven and the earth. That by the heaven and the earth is here meant the whole universe, visible and invisible, is known to every person acquainted with the phraseology of Scripture; and we need inform no man conversant with English writers, that by creation, in its proper sense, is meant bringing into being or making that to exist which existed not before. It must, however, be acknowledged, that the Hebrew word יָעֵד does not always imply the production of substance, but very often the forming of particular organized bodies out of pre-existing matter. Thus when it is said * that \"God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind,\" and again, \"that he created man male and female;\" though the word יָעֵד is used on both occasions, we are not to conceive that the bodies of the first human pair, and of these animals, were brought into being from nonentity, but only that they were formed by a proper organization being given to pre-existent matter. But when Moses says, \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,\" he taught by cannot be supposed to mean, that \"in the beginning God Moses only gave form to matter already existing of itself;\" for in the very next verse we are assured that after this act of creation was over, \"the earth was still without form and void,\" or, in other words, in a chaotic state.\n\nThat the Jews, before the coming of our Saviour, understood their lawgiver to teach a proper creation, is plain from that passage in the second book of the Maccabees, in which a mother, to persuade her son to suffer the cruellest tortures rather than forsake the law of his God, uses the following argument: \"I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not.\" To the same purpose the inspired author of the epistle to the Hebrews, when magnifying the excellence of faith, says, \"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear;\" where, as Bishop Pearson has ably proved, the phrase ἐκ ῥήματος is equivalent to εὐεργέτης, in the quotation from the Maccabees.\n\nThe very first verse, therefore, of the book of Genesis informs us of a most important truth, which all the uninspired wisdom of antiquity could not discover. It assures us, that as nothing exists by chance, so nothing is necessarily existing but the three divine persons in the one Godhead. Every thing else, whether material or immaterial, derives its substance, as well as its form or qualities, from the fiat of that self-existent Being, \"who was, and is, and is to come.\"\n\nIt does not, however, follow from this verse, or from any other passage in the sacred Scriptures, that the universe whole universe was called into existence at the same instant; neither is it by any means evident that the chaos of our world was brought into being on the first of those six days during which it was gradually reduced into form. From a passage in the book of Job, in which we are told by God himself, that when the \"foundation of the earth\nearth was laid the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy,\" it appears extremely probable that worlds had been created, formed, and inhabited, long before our earth had any existence. Nor is this opinion at all contrary to what Moses says of the creation of the stars; for though they are mentioned in the same verse with the sun and moon, yet the manner in which, according to the original, they are introduced, by no means indicates that all the stars were formed at the same time with the luminaries of our system. Most of them have been created long before, and some of them since, our world was brought into being; for that clause (verse 16.) \"he made the stars also,\" is in the Hebrew no more than \"and the stars;\" the words he made being inserted by the translators. The whole verse therefore ought to be rendered thus, \"and God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light with the stars to rule the night;\" where nothing is intimated with respect to the time when the stars were formed, any more than in that verse of the Psalms *, which exhorts us to give thanks to God who made the moon and stars to rule by night; for his mercy endureth \"for ever.\" The first verse of the book of Genesis informs us, that all things spiritual and corporeal derive their existence from God; but it is nowhere said that all matter was created at the same time.\n\nThat the whole corporeal universe may have been created at once must be granted; but if so, we have reason to believe that this earth, with the sun and all the planets of the system, were suffered to remain for ages in a state of chaos, \"without form and void;\" because it appears from other scriptures, that worlds of intelligent creatures existed, and even that some angels had fallen from a state of happiness prior to the era of the Mosaic cosmogony. That the sun and the other planets revolving round him were formed at the same time with the earth, cannot indeed be questioned; for it is not only probable in itself from the known laws of nature, but is expressly affirmed by the sacred historian, who relates the formation of the sun and moon in the order in which it took place; but there is one difficulty which has furnished ignorance with something like an objection to the divine legation of the Hebrew lawgiver, and which we shall notice.\n\nMoses informs us, that on the first day after the production of the chaos, the element of light was created; and yet within a few sentences he declares, that the sun, the fountain of light, was not made till the fourth day. How are these two passages to be reconciled? We answer, That they may be reconciled many ways. Moses wrote for the use of a whole people, and not for the amusement or instruction of a few astronomers; and in this view his language is sufficiently proper, even though we suppose the formation of the sun and the other planets to have been carried on at the same time, and in the same progressive manner, with the formation of this earth. The voice which called light into existence would separate the fiery and luminous particles of the chaos from those which were opaque, and, on this hypothesis, consolidate them in one globe, diffusing an obscure light through the planetary system; but if the earth's atmosphere continued till the fourth day loaded with vapours, as from the narrative of Moses it appears to have done, he fun could not till that day have been seen from the earth, and may therefore, in popular language, be said with sufficient propriety to have been formed on the fourth day, as it was then made to appear. (See Creation, n° 13.) But though this solution of the difficulty serves to remove the objection, and to secure the credit of the sacred historian, candour compels us to confess that it appears not to be the true solution.\n\nThe difficulty itself arises entirely from supposing the sun to be the sole fountain of light; but the truth of this opinion is not self-evident, nor has it ever been established by satisfactory proof. It is indeed to a mind divested of undue deference to great names, and considering the matter with impartiality, an opinion extremely improbable. The light of a candle placed on an eminence may in a dark night be seen in every direction at the distance of at least three miles. But if this small body be rendered visible by means of rays emitted from itself, the flame of a candle, which cannot be supposed more than an inch in diameter, must, during every instant that it continues to burn, throw from its own substance luminous matter sufficient to fill a spherical space of six miles in diameter. This phenomenon, if real, is certainly surprising; but if we pursue the reflection a little farther, our wonder will be greatly increased. The matter which, when converted into flame, is an inch in diameter, is not, when of the confluence of cotton and tallow, of the dimensions of the 20th part of an inch; and therefore, on the common hypothesis, the 20th part of an inch of tallow may be so rarefied as to fill a space of 113,5976 cubic miles! a rarefaction which to us appears altogether incredible. We have indeed heard much of the divisibility of matter ad infinitum, and think we understand what are usually called demonstrations of the truth of that proposition; but these demonstrations prove not the actual divisibility of real solid substances, but only that on trial we shall find no end of the ideal process of dividing and subdividing imaginary extension.\n\nOn the whole, therefore, we are much more inclined to believe that the matter of light is an extremely subtle fluid, diffused through the corporeal universe, and only excited to agency by the sun and other fiery bodies, than that it consists of streams continually issuing from the substance of these bodies. It is indeed an opinion pretty generally received, and certainly not improbable in itself, that light and electricity are one and the same substance (see Electricity Index); but we know that the electrical fluid, though pervading the whole of corporeal nature, and, as experiments show, capable of acting with great violence, yet lies dormant and unperceived till its agency be excited by some foreign cause. Just so it may be with the matter of light. That substance may be \"diffused from one end of the creation * to the other. It may traverse the whole universe, form a communication between the most remote spheres, penetrate into the inmost recesses of the earth, and only wait to be put in a proper motion to communicate visible sensations to the eye. Light is to the organ of sight what the air is to the organ of hearing. Air is the medium which, vibrating on the ear, causes the sensation of sound; but it equally exists round us at all times, though there be no favorable body to put it in motion. In like manner, light may be equally extended at all times, by night as well as by day, from the most distant fixed stars to this earth, though it then only strikes our eyes so as to excite visible sensations when impelled by the sun or some other means of\nNor let any one imagine that this hypothesis interferes with any of the known laws of optics; for if the rays of light be impelled in straight lines, and in the same direction in which they are supposed to be emitted, the phenomena of vision must necessarily be the same.\n\nMoses therefore was probably a more accurate philosopher than he is sometimes supposed to be. The element of light was doubtless created, as he informs us, on the first day; but whether it was then put in that state in which it is the medium of vision, we cannot know, and we need not inquire, since there was neither man nor inferior animal with organs fitted to receive its impressions. For the first three days it may have been used only as a powerful instrument to reduce into order the jarring chaos. Or if it was from the beginning capable of communicating visible sensations, and dividing the day from the night, its agency must have been immediately excited by the Divine power till the fourth day, when the sun was formed, and endowed with proper qualities for instrumentally discharging that office. This was indeed miraculous, as being contrary to the present laws of nature: but the whole creation was miraculous; and we surely need not hesitate to admit a less miracle where we are under the necessity of admitting a greater. The power which called light and all other things into existence, could give them their proper motions by ten thousand different means; and to attempt to solve the difficulties of creation by philologic theories respecting the laws of nature, is to trifle with the common sense of mankind: it is to consider as subservient to a law that very power by whose continued exertion the law is established.\n\nHaving thus proved that the universe derives its being, as well as the form and adjustment of its several parts, from the one supreme and self-existent God, let us here pause, and reflect on the sublime conceptions which such astonishing works are fitted to give us of the divine perfections.\n\nAnd, in the first place, how strongly do the works of creation impress on our minds a conviction of the infinite power of their Author? He spoke, and the universe started into being; he commanded, and it stood fast. How mighty is the arm which \"stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth;\" which removes the mountains and they know it not; which overturneth them in his anger; which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble! How powerful the word which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and which fealeth up the stars;\" which sustains numberless worlds of amazing bulk suspended in the regions of empty space, and directs their various and inconceivably rapid motions with the utmost regularity!\n\n\"Lift up your eyes on high, and behold, who hath created all these things? By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. He stretcheth out the North over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. He has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out the heavens with a span; and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure; and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance. Behold! the nations are as a drop of the bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance; behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing. All nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him as lefs than nothing, and vanity. To whom then will ye liken God, or what likened will ye compare unto him?\"\n\nAs the works of creation are the effects of God's power, they likewise in the most eminent manner display his wisdom. This was so apparent to Cicero, even from the partial knowledge in astronomy which his time afforded, that he declared \"those who could assert the contrary void of all understanding.\" But if that great De Naturae Deorum, master of reason had been acquainted with the modern discoveries in astronomy, which exhibit numberless worlds scattered through space, and each of immense magnitude; had he known that the sun is placed in the centre of our system, and that to diversify the seasons the planets move round him with exquisite regularity; could he have conceived that the distinction between light and darkness is produced by the diurnal rotation of the earth on its own axis, instead of that disproportionate whirling of the whole heavens which the ancient astronomers were forced to suppose; had he known of the wonderful motions of the comets, and considered how such eccentric bodies have been preserved from falling upon some of the planets in the same system, and the several systems from falling upon each other; had he taken into the account that there are yet greater things than these, and \"that we have seen but a few of God's works;\"—that virtuous Pagan would have been ready to exclaim in the words of the Psalmist, \"O Lord, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all; the earth is full of thy riches.\"\n\nThat creation is the offspring of unmixed goodness, And good has been already shown with sufficient evidence (see next Metaphysics, No. 312, and No. 29, of this article); and from the vast number of creatures on our earth endowed with life and sense, and a capability of happiness, and the infinitely greater number which probably inhabit the planets of this and other systems, we may infer that the goodness of God is as boundless as his power, and that \"as is his majesty, so is his mercy.\" Out of his own fulness hath he brought into being numberless worlds, replenished with myriads of myriads of creatures, furnished with various powers and organs, capacities and instincts; and out of his own fulness he continually and plentifully supplies them all with everything necessary to make their existence comfortable. \"The eyes of all wait upon him, and he giveth them their meat in due season. He openeth his hand and satisfies the desires of every living thing: he loveth righteousnes and judgement; the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord. He watereth the ridges thereof abundantly; he setteth the furrows thereof; he maketh it soft with flowers, and bleareth the springing thereof. He crowneth the year with his goodness; and his paths drop fatness. They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness; and the little hills rejoice on every side. The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered with corn; they shout with joy, they also sing.\" Surely the whole of what may be seen on and about this terrestrial globe, and say, if our Maker hath a sparing hand. Surely the Author of so much happiness must be essential goodnes; and we must conclude with St John, that \"God is love.\"\n\nThese attributes of power, wisdom, and goodness, so\nconspicuously displayed in the works of creation, belong in the same supreme degree to each person in the blessed Trinity; for Moses declares that the heaven and the earth were created, not by one person, but by the Father himself. The Logos indeed, or second person, appears to have been the immediate Creator; for St John affirms us*, that \"all things were made by him, and that without him was not any thing made that was made.\" Some Arian writers of great learning (and we believe the late Dr Price was of the number) have affirmed, that a being who was created himself may be endowed by the Omnipotent God with the power of creating other beings; and as they hold the Logos or word, to be a creature, they contend that he was employed by the Supreme Deity to create, not the whole universe, but only this earth, or at the utmost the solar system. \"The old argument (says one of them), that no being inferior to the great Omnipotent can create a world, is so childish as to deserve no answer. Why may not God communicate the power of making worlds to any being whom he may choose to honour with so glorious a prerogative? I have no doubt but such a power may be communicated to many good men during the progress of their existence; and to say that it may not, is not only to limit the power of God, but to contradict acknowledged analogies.\"\n\nWe are far from being inclined to limit the power of God. He can certainly do whatever involves not a direct contradiction; and therefore, though we know nothing analogous to the power of creating worlds, yet as we perceive not any contradiction implied in the notion of that power being communicated, we shall admit that such a communication may be possible, though we think it in the highest degree improbable. But surely no man will contend that the whole universe was brought into existence by any creature; because that creature himself, however highly exalted, is necessarily comprehended in the notion of the universe. Now St Paul expressly affirms†, that, by the second person in the blessed Trinity, \"were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him; and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.\" Indeed the Hebrew Scriptures in more places than one‡ expressly declare that this earth, and of course the whole solar system, was formed, as well as created, not by an inferior being, but by the true God, even Jehovah alone; and in the New Testament §, the Gentiles are said to be without excuse for not glorifying him as God, \"because his eternal power and Godhead are clearly seen from the creation of the world.\" But if it were natural to suppose that the power of creating worlds has been, or ever will be, communicated to beings inferior to the great Omnipotent, this reasoning of the apostle's would be founded on false principles, and the sentence which he passed on the Heathen would be contrary to justice.\n\nBut though it be thus evident that the Logos was the immediate Creator of the universe, we are not to suppose that it was without the concurrence of the other two persons. The Father, who may be said to be the fountain of the Divinity itself, was certainly concerned in the creation of the world, and is therefore in the apostle's creed denominated the \"Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth;\" and that the Holy Ghost or third person is likewise a Creator, we have the express testimony of two inspired writers: \"By the word of the Lord (says the Psalmist) were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath (Hebrew, Spirit) of his mouth.\" And Job declares, that the Spirit of God made him, and that the breath of the Almighty gave him life. Indeed these three divine persons are so intimately united, that what is done by one must be done by all, as they have but one and the same will. This is the reason assigned by Origen* for our paying divine worship to each; διακρίνεσθαι εἰς τοῦτο τελευταῖον p. 386. παλαιὰ τῶν ἀληθειῶν καὶ τοῦτο τῶν ἀληθειῶν, ὡς δὲ τὸ ἐπιστήμην παραγόντα, ἢ ἔστιν ἐν ἀληθείᾳ, ἢ ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ τῷ ἀληθεῖ, ἢ ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ τῷ ἀληθεῖ, ἢ ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ τῷ ἀληθεῖ. We worship the Father of truth, and the Son the truth itself, being two things as to hypostasis, but one in agreement, consent, and sameness of will. Nor is their union a mere agreement in will only; it is a physical or essential union; so that what is done by one must necessarily be done by the others also, according to that of our Saviour, \"I am in the Father and the Father in me: The Father who dwelleth in me, doth the works.\"\n\nSect. II. Of the Original State of Man, and the first Covenant of Eternal Life which God vouchsafed to make with him.\n\nIn the Mosaic account of the creation, every attentive reader must be struck with the manner in which the supreme Being is represented as making man: \"And which God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image; in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them; and God said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth; and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed: to you it shall be for meat. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his works which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.*\"\n\nThis is a very remarkable passage, and contains much important information. It indicates a plurality of persons in the Godhead, describes the nature of man as he came at first from the hands of his Creator, and furnishes data from which we may infer what were the duties required of him in that primeval state, and what were the rewards to which obedience would entitle him.\n\nOf the plurality of Divine persons, and their essential union, we have treated in the preceding section, and proceed now to inquire into the specific nature of the first man. This must be implied in the image of God, in\nin which he is said to have been created; for it is by that phrase alone that he is characterized, and his pre-eminence marked over the other animals. Now this image or likeness must have been found either in his body alone, his soul alone, or in both united. That it could not be in his body alone, is obvious; for the infinite and omnipotent God is allowed by all men to be without body, parts, or passions, and therefore to be such as nothing corporeal can possibly resemble.\n\nIf this likeness is to be found in the human soul, it comes to be a question in what faculty or power of the soul it consists. Some have contended, that man is the only creature on this earth who is animated by a principle essentially different from matter; and hence they have inferred, that he is said to have been formed in the Divine image, on account of the immateriality of that vital principle which was infused into his body when the \"Lord God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.\" That this account of the animation of the body of man indicates a superiority of the human soul to the vital principle of all other animals, cannot, we think, be questioned; but it does not therefore follow, that the human soul is the only immaterial principle of life which animates any terrestrial creature. It has been shown elsewhere (see Metaphysics, No. 235.), that the power of sensation, attended with individual consciousness, as it appears to be in all the higher species of animals, cannot result from any organic structure, or be the quality of a compound extended being. The vital principle in such animals therefore must be immaterial as well as the human soul; but as the word immaterial denotes only a negative notion, the souls of men and brutes, though both immaterial, may yet be substances essentially different. This being the case, it is plain that the Divine image in which man was formed, and by which he is distinguished from the brute creation, cannot consist in the mere circumstance of his mind being a substance different from matter, but in some positive quality which distinguishes him from every other creature on this globe.\n\nAbout this characteristic quality various opinions have been formed. Some have supposed * that the image of God in Adam appeared in that attitude, righteousness, and holiness, in which he was made; for God made man upright (Ecclesiastes vii. 2), a holy and righteous creature; which holiness and righteousness were in their kind perfect; his understanding was free from all error and mistakes; his will bialled to that which is good; his affections flowed in a right channel towards their proper objects; there were no sinful motions and evil thoughts in his heart, nor any propensity or inclination to that which is evil; and the whole of his conduct and behaviour was according to the will of God. And this righteousness (say they) was natural, and not personal and acquired. It was not obtained by the exercise of his free-will, but was created with him, and belonged to his mind, as a natural faculty or intuition. They therefore call it original righteousness, and suppose that it was lost in the fall.\n\nTo this doctrine many objections have been made. It has been said that righteousness consisting in right actions proceeding from proper principles, could not be created with Adam and make a part of his nature; because nothing which is produced in a man without his knowledge and consent can be in him either virtue or vice. Adam, it is added, was unquestionably placed in a state of trial, which proves that he had righteous habits to acquire; whereas the doctrine under consideration, affirming his original righteousness to have been perfect, and therefore incapable of improvement, is inconsistent with a state of trial. That his understanding was free from all errors and mistakes, has been thought a blasphemous position, as it attributes to man one of the incomprehensible perfections of the Deity. It is likewise believed to be contrary to fact; for either his understanding was bewildered in error, or his affections flowed towards an improper object, when he suffered himself at the persuasion of his wife to transgress the express law of his Creator. The objector expresses his wonder at its having ever been supposed that the whole of Adam's conduct and behaviour was according to the will of God, when it is so notorious that he yielded to the first temptation with which, as far as we know, he was afflicted in paradise.\n\nConvinced by these and other arguments, that the image of God in which man was created could not consist in original righteousness, or in exemption from all possibility of error, many learned men, and Bishop Bull among others, have supposed, that by the image of God is to be understood certain gifts and powers supernaturally infused by the Holy Spirit into the minds of our first parents, to guide them in the ways of piety and virtue. This opinion they rest chiefly upon the authority of Tatian, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian, Athanasius, and other fathers of the primitive church; but Bishop Bull they think, at the same time, that it is countenanced by and some several passages in the New Testament. Thus when St Paul says, \"and so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening Spirit,\" they understand the whole passage as relating to the creation of man, and not as drawing a comparison between Adam and Christ, to show the great superiority of the latter over the former. In support of this interpretation they observe, that the apostle immediately adds, \"howbeit, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterwards that which is spiritual;\" an addition which they think was altogether needless, if by the quickening Spirit he had referred to the incarnation of Christ, which had happened in the very age in which he was writing. They are therefore of opinion, that the body of Adam, after being formed of the dust of the ground, was first animated by a vital principle endowed with the faculties of reason and sensation, which entitled the whole man to the appellation of a living soul. After this they suppose certain graces of the Holy Spirit to have been infused into him, by which he was made a quickening spirit, or formed in the image of God; and that it was in consequence of this succession of powers communicated to the same person, that the apostle said, \"Howbeit, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural.\"\n\nWe need hardly observe, that with respect to a question of this kind the authority of Tatian and the other fathers quoted is nothing. Those men had no better means of discovering the true sense of the scriptures of the Old Testament than we have; and their ignorance of the language in which these scriptures are written, added to some metaphysical notions respecting the soul,\nwhich too many of them had derived from the school of Plato, rendered them very ill qualified to interpret the writings of Moses. Were authority to be admitted, we should consider that of Bishop Bull and his modern followers as of greater weight than the authority of all the ancients to whom they appeal. But authority cannot be admitted; and the reasoning of this learned and excellent man from the text of St Paul is surely very inconclusive. It makes two persons of Adam; a first, when he was a natural man composed of a body and a reasonable soul; a second, when he was endowed with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and by them formed in the image of God! In the verse following too, the apostle expressly calls the second man, of whom he had been speaking, \"the Lord from heaven;\" but this appellation we apprehend to be too high for Adam in the state of greatest perfection in which he ever existed. That our first parents were endowed with the gifts of the Holy Ghost, we are strongly inclined to believe for reasons which shall be given by and by; but as these gifts were adventitious to their nature, they could not be that image in which God made man.\n\nSince man was made in the image of God, that phrase, whatever be its precise import, must denote something peculiar and at the same time essential to human nature; but the only two qualities at once natural and peculiar to man are his shape and his reason. As none but an anthropomorphite will say that it was Adam's shape which reflected this image of his Creator, it has been concluded that it was the faculty of reason which made the resemblance. To give strength to this argument it is observed †, that when God says, \"let us make man in our image,\" he immediately adds, \"and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth;\" but as many of the cattle have much greater bodily strength than man, this dominion could not be maintained but by the faculty of reason bestowed upon him and withheld from them.\n\nIf the image of God was impressed only on the mind of man, this reasoning seems to be conclusive; but it has been well observed ‡ that it was the whole man, and not the soul alone, or the body alone, that is said to have been formed in the divine image; even as the whole man, soul and body, is the seat of the new and spiritual image of God in regeneration and sanctification. \"The very God of peace (says the apostle) sanctify you wholly; and may your whole spirit, soul and body, be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" It is worthy of notice, too, that the reason assigned for the prohibition of murder to Noah and his sons after the deluge, is, that man was made in the image of God. \"Who sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made he man.\" These texts seem to indicate, that whatever be meant by the image of God, it was stamped equally on the soul and on the body. In vain is it said that man cannot resemble God in shape. This is true, but it is little to the purpose; for man does not resemble God in his reasoning faculty more than in his form. It would be idolatry to suppose the supreme majesty of heaven and earth to have a body or a shape; and it would be little short of idolatry to imagine that he is obliged to compare ideas and notions together; to advance from particular truths to general propositions; and to acquire knowledge, as we do, by the tedious processes of inductive and syllogistic reasoning. There can therefore be no direct image of God either in the soul or in the body of man; and the phrase really seems to import nothing more than those powers or qualities True by which man was fitted to exercise dominion over the port of the inferior creation; as if it had been said, \"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, that they may have dominion, &c.\" But the erect form of man contributes in some degree, as well as his rational powers, to enable him to maintain his authority over the brute creation; for it has been observed by travellers, that the fiercest beast of prey, unless ready to perish by hunger, shrinks back from a steady look of the human face divine.\n\nBy some *, however, who have admitted the probability of this interpretation, another has been devised for its being said that man was formed in the image of God. All the members of Christ's body, say they, were written and delineated in the book of God's purposes and decrees, and had an ideal existence from eternity in the divine mind; and therefore the body of Adam might be said to be formed after the image of God, because it was made according to that idea. But to this reasoning objections may be urged, which we know not how to answer. All things that ever were or ever shall be, the bodies of us who live at present as well as the bodies of those who lived 5000 years ago, have from eternity had an ideal existence in the Divine mind; nor in this sense can one be said to be prior to another. It could not therefore be after the idea of the identical body of Christ that the body of Adam was formed; for in the Divine mind ideas of both bodies were present together from eternity, and each body was formed after the ideal archetype of itself. It may be added likewise, that the body of Christ was not God, nor the idea of that body the idea of God. Adam therefore could not with propriety be said to have been formed in the image of God, if by that phrase nothing more were intended than the resemblance between his body and the body of Christ. These objections to this interpretation appear to us unanswerable; but we mean not to dictate to our readers. Every man will adopt that opinion which he thinks supported by the best arguments; but it is obvious, that whatever more may be meant by the image of God in which man was made, the phrase undoubtedly comprehends all those powers and qualities by which he is enabled to maintain his authority over the inferior creation. Among these the faculty of reason is confessedly the most important; for it is by it that man is capable of being made acquainted with the Author of his being, the relation which subsists between them, and the duties implied in that relation from the creature to the Creator.\n\nThat the first man, however, was not left to discover religious these things by the mere efforts of his own unsanctified instruction reason, we have endeavoured to show in another place; (see RELIGION, No 5—10.) and the conclusion to which we were there led, is confirmed by the portion of revelation before us. The inspired historian says, that \"God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it, because that in it he had rested from all his works, which he created and made;\" but Adam could not have understood what was meant by the sanctification of a particular day, or of any thing else, unless he had previously received\nreceived some religious instruction. There cannot therefore be a doubt, but that as soon as man was made, his Creator communicated to him the truths of what is called natural religion, which we have endeavoured to explain and establish in Part I. of this article; and to these were added the precept to keep holy the Sabbath-day, and set it apart for the purposes of contemplation and worship.\n\nThis was a very wise institution, as all the divine institutions must be. \"The great end for which we are brought into life, is to attain the knowledge and be confirmed in the love of God.\" This includes obedience to his will in thought, word, and deed, or that course of conduct which can alone make us happy here, and fit us for everlasting glory hereafter. But of these things we cannot retain a proper sense without close and repeated application of thought; and the unavoidable cares and concerns of the present life occupying much of our attention, it is, in the nature of things, necessary that some certain portion of time should be appropriated to the purposes of religious instruction and the public adoration of our Creator, in whom we all live, and move, and have our being.\" Hence a very learned divine has inferred, that though the particular time is a matter of positive appointment, the observation of a sabbath in general is a duty of natural religion, as having its foundation in the reason of things. See SABBATH.\n\nMan therefore in his natural and original state was a rational and religious being, bound to do \"justice, to love mercy, to walk humbly with his God, and to keep holy the Sabbath-day.\" These seem to be all the duties which in that state were required of him; for as soon as he was introduced into the terrestrial paradise and admitted into covenant with his Maker, he was placed in a supernatural state, when other duties were of course enjoined.\n\nThat our first parents were both made on the sixth day, Moses expressly affirms when he says, that \"God created them male and female, and blessed them, and called their name Adam (K), in the day when they were created;\" but that they were introduced into the garden of Eden on that day, is an opinion which, however generally it may be received, seems not to be reconcilable with the plain narrative of the sacred penman. After telling us that on the sixth day God finished all his works, which he saw to be very good, and rested on the seventh day, he briefly recapitulates the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth, gives us a more particular account of the formation of the first man, informing us that the \"Lord God formed him out of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, when man became a living soul;\" and then proceeds to say, that the \"Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, where he put the man whom he had formed.\" From this short history of the first pair it appears beyond dispute evident, that neither the man nor the woman was formed in the garden; and that from their creation some time elapsed before the garden was prepared for their reception, is likewise evident from a comparison of Gen. i. 29, with Gen. ii. 16, 17. In the first of these passages God gives to man, immediately after his creation, \"every herb bearing seed which was upon the face of all the earth, before he and every tree, without exception, in which was the fruit of a tree bearing seed: to him he said it should be for meat.\" In the second, \"he commanded the man, saying, of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\" When the first grant of food was given, Adam and his wife must have been where no tree of knowledge grew, and they must have been intended to live at least so long in that state as that they should have occasion for food, otherwise the formal grant of it would have been not only superfluous, but apt to mislead them with respect to the subsequent restriction.\n\nIn this original state man was under the discipline of what we have called natural religion, entitled to happiness while he should perform the duties required of him, and liable to punishment when he should neglect those duties, or transgress the law of his nature as a rational and moral agent. This being the case, it is a matter of some importance, to ascertain, if we can, what the rewards and punishments are which natural religion holds out to her votaries.\n\nThat under every dispensation of religion the pious and virtuous man shall enjoy more happiness than misery; and that the incorrigibly wicked shall have a greater portion of misery than happiness, are truths which cannot be controverted by any one who admits, that the Almighty governor of the universe is a Being of wisdom, goodness, and justice. But respecting the rewards of virtue and the punishment of vice, more than these general truths seems not to be taught by natural religion. Many divines, however, of great learning did not, and worth, have thought otherwise, and have contended, that from the nature of things the rewards bestowed by an infinite God upon piety and virtue must be eternal like their author. These men indeed appear willing life, enough to allow that the punishments with which natural religion is armed against vice must be only of a temporary duration, because reason, say they, is ready to revolt at the thought of everlasting punishment.\n\nThis opinion, which confounds natural with revealed religion, giving to the former an important truth which belongs exclusively to the latter, has been so ably controverted by a learned writer, that we shall submit his arguments to our readers in preference to anything which we can give ourselves.\n\n\"If reason doth, on the one hand, seem to revolt at everlasting punishment, we must confess that vanity, on the other, (even when full plumed by vanity), hath scarcely force enough to rise to the idea of infinite rewards. How the heart of man came to consider this as no more than an adequate retribution for his right conduct during the short trial of his virtue here, would\n\n(K) The woman was some time afterwards distinguished by the name of Eve, אֵוֶה, because she was to be the mother all living, and particularly of that blest seed which was to bruise the head of the serpent. See Parkhurst's Lexicon on the word.\nbe hard to tell, did we not know what monsters PRIDE begot of old upon Pagan philosophy; and how much greater still these latter ages have disclosed, by the long incubation of school-divinity upon folly. What hath been urged from natural reason, in support of this extravagant presumption, is so very slender, that it recoils as you enforce it. First, you say, \"that the soul, the subject of these eternal rewards, being immaterial, and so therefore unaffected by the causes which bring material things to an end, is, by its nature, fitted for eternal rewards.\" This is an argument ad ignorantiam, and holds no farther.—Because an immaterial being is not subject to that mode of dissolution which affects material substances, you conclude it to be eternal. This is going too fast. There may be, and probably are, many natural causes (unknown indeed to us), whereby immaterial beings come to an end. But if the nature of things cannot, yet God certainly can, put a final period to such a being when it hath served the purpose of its creation. Both ANNIHILATION impeach that wisdom and goodness which was displayed when God brought it out of nothing? Other immaterial beings there are, viz., the souls of brutes, which have the same natural security with man for their existence, of whose eternity we never dream. But pride, as the poet observes, calls God unjust,\n\nIf man alone engrosses not heaven's high care;\nAlone made perfect here, IMMORTAL there.\n\nHowever, let us (for argument's sake) allow the human soul to be unperishable by nature, and secured in its existence by the unchangeable will of God, and see what will follow from thence.—An infinite reward for virtue during one moment of its existence, because reason discovers that, by the law of nature, some reward is due? By no means. When God hath amply repaid us for the performance of our duty, will he be at a loss how to dispose of us for the long remainder of eternity? May he not find new and endless employment for reasonable creatures, to which, when properly discharged, new rewards and endless succession will be assigned? Modest reason seems to dictate this to the followers of the law of nature. The flattering expedient of ETERNAL REWARDS for virtue here was invented in the simplicity of early speculation, after it had fairly brought men to conclude that the soul is immaterial.\n\nAnother argument urged for the eternity of the rewards held out by natural religion to the practice of piety and virtue is partly physical and partly moral. The merit of service (say the admirers of that religion) increases in proportion to the excellence of that Being to whom our service is directed and becomes acceptable. An infinite being, therefore, can dispense no rewards but what are infinite. And thus the virtuous man becomes entitled to immortality.\n\nThe misfortune is, that this reasoning holds equally on the side of the unmerciful doctors, as they are called, who doom the wicked to EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT. Indeed were this the only discredit under which it labours, the merciful doctors would hold themselves little concerned. But the truth is, that the argument from infinity proves just nothing. To make it of any force, both the parties should be infinite. This inferior emanation of God's image, MAN, should either be supremely good or supremely bad, a kind of deity or a kind of devil. But these reasoners, in their attention to the divinity, overlook the humanity, which makes the decrees keep pace with the accumulation, till the rule of logic, that the conclusion follows the weaker part, comes in to end the dispute.*\n\nThese arguments seem to prove unanswerably that immortality is not essential to any part of the compound being man, and that it cannot be claimed as a reward due to his virtue. It is not indeed essential to any created being, for what has not existence of itself, cannot of itself have perpetuity of existence (see METAPHYSICS, No. 272, &c.) ; and as neither man nor angel can be profitable to God, they cannot claim from him anything as a debt. Both, indeed, as moral agents, have duties prescribed them; and while they faithfully perform these duties, they have all the security which can arise from the perfect benevolence of him who brought them into existence, that they shall enjoy a sufficient portion of happiness to make that existence preferable to non-existence; but reason and philosophy furnish no data from which it can be inferred that they shall exist for ever. Man is composed in part of perishable materials. However perfect Adam may be thought to have been when he came first from the hands of his Creator, his body, as formed of the dust of the ground, must have been naturally liable to decay and dissolution. His soul, indeed, was of a more durable substance; but as it was formed to animate his body, and had no prior conscious existence, it is not easy to conceive what should have led him, under an equal providence, where rewards and punishments were exactly distributed, to suppose that one part of him should survive the other. In his natural and original state, before the covenant made with him in paradise, he was unquestionably a mortal creature. How long he continued in that state, it seems not possible to form a plausible conjecture. Bishop Gore's interpretation of Warburton supposes him to have lived several years production under no other dispensation than that of natural religion; into paradise during which he was as liable to death as his fallen posterity are at present.\n\n\"We must needs conclude (says this learned writer*), Divine that God having tried Adam in the state of nature, and Legation, approved of the good use he made of his free-will under book ix. the direction of that light, advanced him to a superior chap. i. station in Paradise. How long, before this remove, How long man had continued subject to natural religion alone, we can continue only guess: but of this we may be assured, that it ed in that was some considerable time before the garden of Eden state, could naturally be made fit for his reception. Since Moses, when he had concluded his history of the creation, and of God's rest on, and sanctification of, the seventh day proceeds to speak of the condition of this new world in the following terms: \"And God made every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth.\" Which † Gen. ii. seems plainly to intimate, that when the seeds of vegetables had been created on the third day, they were left to nature, in its ordinary operations, to mature by sun and showers. So that when in course of time Paradise was become capable of accommodating its inhabitants, they were transplanted thither.\"\n\nThis reasoning is not without a portion of that ingenuity which was apparent in every thing that fell from the pen of Warburton; but it was completely confuted.\ned almost as soon as it was given to the public, and shown to be deduced from premises which could be employed against the author's system. If only the seeds of vegetables were created on the third day, and then left to nature, in its ordinary operations, to mature by sun and showers, the first pair must have perished before a single vegetable could be fit to furnish them with food; and we may suppose that it was to prevent this disaster that the garden of Eden was miraculously stored at once with full grown trees and fruit in perfect maturity, whilst the rest of the earth was left under the ordinary laws of vegetation. There is, however, no evidence that they were only the seeds of vegetables that God created. On the contrary, Moses says expressly, that God made the earth on the third day bring forth the herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind; and when he recapitulates the history of the creation, he says, that God made, not every seed, but every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew. From the process of vegetation, therefore, nothing can be inferred with respect to the time of Adam's introduction into Paradise, or to ascertain the duration of his original state of nature. If angels were created during the six days of which the Hebrew lawgiver writes the history, an hypothesis very generally received (see Angel), though in the opinion of the present writer not very probable, there can be no doubt but our first parents lived a considerable time under the law of nature before they were raised to a superior situation in the garden of Eden; for it seems very evident that the period of their continuance in that station was not long. Of this, however, nothing can be said with certainty. They may have lived for years or only a few days in their original state; but it is very necessary to distinguish between that state in which they were under no other dispensation than what is commonly called natural religion, entitled, upon their obedience, to the indefinite rewards of piety and virtue, and their state in Paradise when they were put under a new law, and by the free grace of God promised, if they should be obedient, a supernatural and eternal reward. Into that state we must now attend them, and ascertain, if we can, the precise terms of the first covenant.\n\nMoses, who in this investigation is our only guide, tells us, that the Lord God, after he had formed the first pair, \"planted a garden eastward in Eden, and took the man and put him into the garden to dress it and to keep it.\" And the Lord God (continues he) commanded the man, saying, of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.\" Here is no mention made of the laws of piety and moral virtue resulting from the relation in which the various individuals of the human race stand to each other, and Gen. ii., in which all as creatures stand to God their Almighty and beneficent Creator. With these laws Adam was already well acquainted; and he must have been sensible, that as they were founded in his nature no subsequent law could dispense with their obligation. They have been equally binding on all men in every state and under every dispensation; and they will continue to be so as long as the general practice of justice, mercy, and piety, shall contribute to the sum of human happiness. The new law peculiar to his paradisaical state was the command not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This was a positive precept, not founded in the nature of man, but very proper to be the test of his obedience to the will of his Creator. The laws of piety and virtue are sanctioned by nature, or by that general system of rules according to which God governs the physical and moral worlds, their life and by which he has secured, in some state or other, made with happiness to the pious and virtuous man, and misery to such as shall prove incorrigibly wicked. The law respecting the forbidden fruit was sanctioned by the penalty of death denounced against disobedience; and by the subjects of that law the nature of this penalty must have been perfectly understood; but Christian divines, as we shall afterwards see, have differed widely in opinion respecting the full import of the Hebrew words which our translators have rendered by the phrase thou shalt surely die. All, however, agree that they threatened death, in the common acceptation of the word, or the separation of the soul and body as one part of the punishment to be incurred by eating the forbidden fruit; and hence we must infer, that had the forbidden fruit not been eaten, our first parents would never have died, because the penalty of death was denounced against no other transgression. What therefore is said respecting the fruit of the tree of knowledge, implies not only a law but also a covenant (L.), promising to man, upon the observance of one positive precept, immortality or eternal life; which is not essential to the nature of any created being, and cannot be claimed as the merited reward of the greatest virtue or the most fervent piety.\n\nThis obvious truth will enable us to dispose of the objections which have been sometimes brought by free-thinking divines against the wisdom and justice of punishing so severely as by death the breach of a mere positive precept; which, considered in itself, appears to be a precept of very little importance. We have only to reply, that as an exemption from death is not due either\n\n(L.) It does not appear that any transaction between God and mankind in general was denominated by a word equivalent to the English word covenant till the end of the fourth century, when such phraseology was introduced into the church by the celebrated Augustine, bishop of Hippo. That the phraseology is strictly proper, no man can suppose who reflects on the infinite distance between the contracting parties, and the absolute dominion of the one over the other. To be capable of entering into a covenant, in the proper sense of the word, both parties must have a right either to agree to the terms proposed or to reject them; but surely Adam had no right to bargain with his Maker, or to refuse the gift of immortality on the terms on which it was offered to him. The word dispensation would more accurately denote what is here meant by the word covenant; but as this last is in general use, we have retained it as sufficient, when thus explained, to distinguish what man received from God upon certain positive conditions, from what he had a claim to by the constitution of his nature.\neither to the nature or to the virtue of man, it was wise and just to make it depend on the observance of a positive precept, to impress on the minds of our first parents a constant conviction that they were to be preserved immortal, not in the ordinary course of divine providence, but by the special grace and favour of God. The same consideration will show us the folly of those men who are for turning all that is said of the trees of knowledge and of life into figure and allegory. But the other trees which Adam and Eve were permitted to eat were certainly real trees, or they must have perished for want of food. And what rules of interpretation will authorise us to interpret eating and trees literally in one part of the sentence and figuratively in the other? A garden in a delightful climate is the very habitation, and the fruits produced in that garden the very food, which we should naturally suppose to have been prepared for the progenitors of the human race; and though in the garden actually fitted up for this purpose two trees were remarkably distinguished from the rest, perhaps in situation and appearance as well as in use, the distinction was calculated to serve the best of purposes. The one called the tree of life, of which, while they continued innocent, they were permitted to eat, served as a sacramental pledge or assurance on the part of God, that as long as they should observe the terms of the covenant their life should be preserved; the other, of which it was death to taste, was admirably adapted to impress on their minds the necessity of implicit obedience to the Divine will, in whatever manner it might be made known to them.\n\nA question has been started of some importance, What would have finally become of men if the first covenant had not been violated? That they would have been all immortal is certain; but it is by no means clear that they would have lived for ever on this earth. On the contrary, it has been an article of very general belief in all ages of the church†, that the garden of Eden was an emblem or type of heaven, and therefore called Paradise (see Paradise); and that under the first covenant, mankind, after a sufficient probation here, were to be translated into heaven without tasting death. This doctrine is not indeed explicitly taught in Scripture; but many things conspire to make it highly probable. The frequent communications between God and man before the fall (M), seem to indicate that Adam was training up for some higher state than the terrestrial paradise. Had he been intended for nothing but to cultivate the ground and propagate his species, he might have been left like other animals to the guidance of his own reason and instincts; which, after the rudiments of knowledge were communicated to him, must surely have been sufficient to direct him to every thing necessary to the comforts of a life merely sensual and rational, otherwise he would have been an imperfect animal. It is obvious too, that this earth, however fertile it may have originally been, could not have afforded the means of subsistence to a race of immortal beings multiplying to infinity. For these reasons, and others which will readily occur to the reader, it seems incontrovertible, that, under the first covenant, either mankind would have been successively translated to some superior state, or would have ceased to propagate their kind as soon as the earth should have been replenished with inhabitants. He who reflects on the promise, that, after the general resurrection, there is to be a new heaven and a new earth, will probably embrace the latter part of the alternative; but that part in its consequences differs not from the former. In the new earth promised in the Christian revelation, nothing is to dwell but righteousness. It will therefore be precisely the same with what we conceive to be expressed by the word heaven; and if under the first covenant this earth was to be converted into a similar place, where, after a certain period, men should neither marry nor be given in marriage, but enjoy what divines have called the beatific vision, we may confidently affirm, that, had the first covenant been faithfully observed, Adam and his posterity, after a sufficient probation, would all have been translated to some superior state or heaven.\n\nTo fit them for that state, the gifts of divine grace and the feet have been absolutely necessary. To them it gifts of was a state certainly supernatural, otherwise a God of infinite wisdom and perfect goodness would not, for a grace, moment, have placed them in an inferior state. But to enable any creature, especially such a creature as man, whom an ancient philosopher has justly styled ζων παράδεισος, to rise above its nature, foreign and divine aid is unquestionably requisite: and therefore, though we cannot persuade ourselves that the gifts of the Holy Ghost constituted that image of God in which man was originally made, we agree with Bishop Bull, that these gifts were bestowed on our first parents to enable them to fulfil the terms of the covenant under which they were placed.\n\nOn the whole, we think it apparent from the portions of scripture which we have examined, that Adam and Eve were endowed with such powers of body and mind as fitted them to exercise dominion over the other animals; that those powers constituted that image of God in which they are said to have been formed; that they received by immediate revelation the first principles of all useful knowledge, and especially of that system which is usually called natural religion; that they lived for some time with no other religion, entitled to the natural rewards of piety and virtue, but all the while liable to death; that they were afterwards translated into paradise, where they were placed under a new law, with the penalty of death threatened to the breach of it, and the promise of endless life if they should faithfully observe it; and that they were endowed with the gifts of the Holy Ghost, to enable them, if not wanting fore improved themselves, to fulfil the terms of that covenant, which perly called has been improperly termed the covenant of works, since the covenant flowed from the mere grace of God, and conferred privileges on man to which the most perfect human virtue could lay no just claim.\n\nSect.

Of the Fall of Adam, and its Consequences.\n\nFrom the preceding account of the primeval state of man,\n\n---\n\n(M) That there were such frequent communications, has been shown to be in the highest degree probable by the late Dr Law bishop of Carlisle. See his Discourse on the several Dispensations of revealed Religion.\nman, it is evident that his continuance in the terrestrial paradise, together with all the privileges which he there enjoyed, were made to depend on his observance of one positive precept. Every other duty incumbent on him, whether as resulting from what is called the law of his nature, or from the express command of his God, was as much his duty before as after he was introduced into the garden of Eden; and though the transgression of any law would undoubtedly have been punished, or have been forgiven only in consequence of sincere repentance and amendment, it does not appear that a breach of the moral law, or of the commandment respecting the sanctification of the Sabbath-day, would have been punished with death, whatever may be the import of that word in the place where it is first threatened. The punishment was denounced only against eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil: \"For the Lord God commanded the man, saying, of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\" To the word death in this passage divines have affixed many and different meanings. By some it is supposed to import a separation of the soul and body, while the latter was to continue in a state of conscious existence; by others, it is taken to imply annihilation or a state without consciousness; by some, it is imagined to signify eternal life in torments; and by others spiritual and moral death, or a state necessarily subject to sin. In any one of these acceptations it denoted something new to Adam, which he could not understand without an explanation of the term; and therefore, as it was threatened as the punishment of only one transgression, it could not be the divine intention to inflict it on any other.\n\nThe abstaining from a particular fruit in the midst of a garden abounding with fruits of all kinds, was a precept which at first view appears of easy observation; and the penalty threatened against the breach of it was, in every sense, awful. The precept, however, was broken notwithstanding that penalty; and though we may thence infer that our first parents were not beings of such absolute perfection as by divines they have sometimes been represented, we shall yet find, upon due consideration, that the temptation by which they were seduced, when taken with all its circumstances, was such as no wise and modest man will think himself able to have resisted. The short history of this important transaction, as we have it in the third chapter of the book of Genesis, is as follows.\n\n\"Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made; and he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, ye shall not surely die: For God doth know, that on the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wife, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.\"\n\nTo the less attentive reader this conversation between the serpent and the woman must appear to begin abruptly; and indeed it is not possible to reconcile it with the natural order of a dialogue, or even with the common rules of grammar, but by supposing the tempter's question, \"Yea, hath God said, ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?\" to have been suggested by something immediately preceding either in words or in significant signs. Eve had undoubtedly by some means or other informed the serpent that she was forbidden to eat of the fruit on which he was probably feasting; and that information, whether given in words or in actions, must have produced the question with which the sacred historian begins his relation of this fatal dialogue. We are told that the woman saw that the tree was good for food; that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wife; but all this she could not have seen, had not the serpent eaten of its fruit in her presence. In her walks through the garden, it might have often appeared pleasant to her eyes; but previous to experience she could not know but that its fruit was the most deadly poison, far less could she conceive it capable of conferring wisdom. But if the serpent ate of it before her, and then extolled its virtues in rapturous and intelligible language, she would at once see that it was not destructive of animal life, and naturally infer that it had very singular qualities. At the moment she was drawing this inference, it is probable that he invited her to partake of the delicious fruit, and that her refusal produced the conference before us. That the yielded to his temptation need excite no wonder; for she knew that the serpent was by nature a mute animal, and if he attributed his speech to the virtues of the tree, she might infer, with some plausibility, that what had power to raise the brute mind to human, might raise the human to divine, and make her and her husband, according to the promise of the tempter, become as gods, knowing good and evil. Milton, who was an eminent divine as well as the prince of poets, makes her reason thus with herself.\n\nGreat are thy virtues, doubles, best of fruits,\nTho' kept from man, and worthy to be admir'd;\nWhole taile, too long forborne, at first effay\nGave elocution to the mute, and taught\nThe tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFor us alone\nWas death invented? or to us denied\nThis intellectual food, for beasts reserved?\nFor beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first\nHath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy\nThe good befallen him, author unsuspect,\nFriendly to man, far from deceit or guile.\nWhat fear I then, rather what know to fear\nUnder this ignorance of good and evil,\nOf God or death, of law or penalty?\nHere grows the cure of all, this fruit divine,\nFair to the eye, inviting to the taste,\nOf virtue to make wife: what hinders then\nTo reach, and feed at once both body and mind?\n\nParadise Lost, book ix.\nFull of these hopes of raising herself to divinity, and not, as has sometimes been supposed, led headlong by a sensual appetite, she took of the fruit and did eat, and gave to her husband with her, and he did eat. The great poet makes Adam delude himself with the same sophistry that had deluded Eve, and infer, that as the serpent had attained the language and reasoning powers of man, they should attain\n\nProportional ascent, which could not be\nBut to be gods, or angels, demi-gods.\n\nThus was the covenant, which, on the introduction of our first parents into paradise, their Creator was graciously pleased to make with them, broken by their violation of the condition on which they were advanced to that supernatural state; and therefore the historian tells us, that \"lest they should put forth their hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever, the Lord God sent them forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence they were taken (x).\"\n\nHad they been so sent forth without any farther intimation reflecting their present condition or their future prospects, and if the death under which they had fallen was only a loss of consciousness, they would have been in precisely the same state in which they lived before they were placed in the garden of Eden; only their minds must now have been burdened with the inward sense of guilt, and they must have known themselves to be subject to death; of which, though not exempted from it by nature, they had probably no apprehension till it was revealed to them in the covenant of life which they had so wantonly broken.\n\nGod, however, did not send them forth thus hopeless and forlorn from the paradise of delights which they had so recently forfeited. He determined to punish them for their transgression, and at the same time to give them an opportunity of recovering more than their lost inheritance. Calling therefore the various offenders before him, and inquiring into their different degrees of guilt, he began with pronouncing judgment on the serpent in terms which implied that there was mercy for man.\n\n\"And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field: upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life; and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"\n\nThat this sentence has been fully inflicted on the serpent, no reasoning can be necessary to evince. Every species of that reptile is more hateful to man than any other terrestrial creature; and there is literally a perpetual war between them and the human race. It is remarkable too that the head of this animal is the only part which it is safe to bruise. His tail may be bruised, or even cut off, and he will turn with fury and death on his adversary: but the slightest stroke on the head infallibly kills him. That the serpent, or at least the greater part of serpents, go on their belly, every one knows; though it is said, that in some parts of the earth serpents have been seen with wings, and others with feet, and that these species are highly beautiful. If there be any truth in this story, we may suppose that these walking and flying serpents have been suffered to retain their original elegance, that mankind might see what the whole race was before the curse was denounced on the tempter of Eve: but it is certain that most of the species have neither wings nor feet, and that many of the most poisonous of them live in burning deserts, where they have nothing to eat but the dust among which they crawl.\n\nTo this degradation of the serpent, infidels have objected, that it implies the punishment of an animal which was incapable of guilt; but this objection is founded in thoughtlessness and ignorance. The elegant form of any species of inferior animals adds nothing to the happiness of the animals themselves: the ais is probably as happy as the horse, and the serpent that crawls as he that flies. Fine proportions attract indeed the notice of man, and tend to impress upon his mind just notions of the wisdom and goodness of the Creator; but surely the symmetry of the horse or the beauty of the peacock is more properly displayed for this purpose than the elegance of the instrument employed by the enemy of mankind. The degradation of the serpent in the presence of our first parents must have served the best of purposes. If they had so little reflection as not yet to have discovered that he was only the instrument with which a more powerful being had wrought their ruin, they would be convinced, by the execution of this sentence, that the forbidden fruit had no power in itself to improve the nature either of man or of beast. But it is impossible that they could be so stupid as this objection supposes them. They doubtless knew by this time that some great and wicked spirit had actuated the organs of the serpent; and that when enmity was promised to be put between its seed and the seed of the woman, that promise was not meant to be fulfilled by serpents occasionally biting the heels of men, and by men in return bruising the heads of serpents! If such enmity, though it has literally taken place, was all that was meant by this prediction, why was not Adam directed to bruise the head of the identical serpent which had seduced his wife? If he could derive any consolation from the exercise of revenge, surely it would be greater from his revenging himself on his own enemy, than from the knowledge that there should be a perpetual warfare between his descendants and the breed of serpents through all generations.\n\nWe are told, that when the foundations of the earth were laid, the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy; and it is at least probable that there would be similar rejoicing when the six days work of creation was finished. If so, Adam and Eve, who were but a little lower than the angels, might be admitted into the chorus, and thus be made acquainted with the existence of good and evil spirits. At all events, we cannot doubt but their gracious and merciful Creator\n\n(x) The ideas which this language conveys are indeed allegorical; but they inform us of this, and nothing but this, that immortal life was a thing extraneous to our nature, and not put into our paste or composition when first fashioned by the forming hand of the Creator.\" Warburton's Divine Legation, book ix, chap. 1.\nCreator would inform them that they had a powerful enemy; that he was a rebellious angel capable of deceiving them in many ways; and that they ought therefore to be constantly on their guard against his wiles. They must have known too that they were themselves animated by something different from matter; and when they found they were deceived by the serpent, they might surely, without any remarkable stretch of sagacity, infer that their malignant enemy had actuated the organs of that creature in a manner somewhat similar to that in which their own souls actuated their own bodies. If this be admitted, the degradation of the serpent would convince them of the weakness of the tempter when compared with their Creator; and confirm their hopes, that since he was not able to preserve unharmed his own instrument of mischief, he should not be able finally to prevail against them; but that though he had bruised their heels, the promised seed of the woman should at last bruise his head, and recover the inheritance which they had lost. See Prophecy, No 9, 10.\n\nHaving thus punished the original instigator to evil, the Almighty Judge turned to the fallen pair, and said to the woman, \"I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\" And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns also and thistles shalt thou bring forth unto thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\"\n\nHere is a terrible denunciation of toil and misery and death upon two creatures; who, being ruined to nothing, and formed for nothing but happiness, must have felt infinitely more horror from such a sentence, than we, who are familiar with death, intimate with misery, and \"born to sorrow as the sparks fly upward,\" can form any adequate conception of. The hardship of it, too, seems to be aggravated by its being severer than what was originally threatened against the breach of the covenant of life. It was indeed said, \"In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die:\" but no mention was made of the woman's incurring sorrow in conception, and in the bringing forth of children; of the curse to be inflicted on the ground; of its bringing forth thorns and thistles instead of food for the use of man; and of Adam's eating bread in sorrow and the sweat of his face till he should return to the dust from which he was taken.\n\nThese seeming aggravations, however, are in reality instances of divine benevolence. Adam and Eve were now subjected to death; but in the sentence passed on the serpent, an obscure intimation had been given them that they were not to remain for ever under its power. It was therefore their interest, as well as their duty, to reconcile themselves as much as possible to their fate; to wean their affections from this world, in which they were to live only for a time; and to hope, with humble confidence, in the promise of their God, that, upon their departure from it, they should be received into some better state. To enable them to wean their affections from earth, nothing could more contribute than to combine sensual enjoyment with sorrow, and lay them under the necessity of procuring their means of subsistence by labour, hard and often fruitless. This would daily and hourly impress upon their minds a full conviction that the present world is not a place fit to be an everlasting habitation; and they would look forward, with pious resignation, to death, as putting a period to all their woes. Had they indeed been furnished with no ground of hope beyond the grave, we cannot believe that the Righteous Judge of all the earth would have added to the penalty originally threatened. That penalty they would doubtless have incurred the very day on which they fell; but as they were promised a deliverance from the consequences of their fall, it was proper to train them up by severe discipline for the happiness reserved for them in a future state.\n\nAfter the passing of their sentence, the man and woman were turned out into the world, where they had formerly lived before they were placed in the garden of Eden; and all future access to the garden was for ever denied them. They were not, however, in the same state in which they were originally before their introduction into Paradise: They were now conscious of guilt; doomed to severe labour; liable to sorrow and sickness, disease and death: and all these miseries they had brought, not only on themselves, but also on their unborn posterity to the end of time. It may seem indeed to militate against the moral attributes of God, to inflict misery on children for the sins of their parents; but before anything can be pronounced concerning the Divine goodness and justice in the present case, we must know precisely how much we suffer in consequence of Adam's transgression, and whether we ourselves any share in that guilt which is the cause of our sufferings.\n\nThat women would have had less sorrow in the bringing forth of children; that we should have been subjected to less toil and exempted from death, had our parents been first parents not fallen from their paradisaical state—are exempted truths incontrovertible by him who believes the inspiration of the Holy Scriptures; but that mankind would under the influence of the Holy Scriptures have been wholly free from pain and every first corporeal distress, is a proposition which is not to be found there, in the Bible, and which therefore no man is bound to believe. The bodies of Adam and Eve consisted of flesh, blood, and bones, as ours do; they were surrounded by material objects as we are; and their limbs were unquestionably capable of being fractured. That their souls should never be separated from their bodies while they obtained from the forbidden fruit, they knew from the infallible promise of him who formed them, and breathed into their nostrils the breath of life; but that not a bone of themselves or of their numerous posterity should ever be broken by the fall of a stone or of a tree, they were not told, and had no reason to expect. Of such fractures, pain would surely have been the consequence; though we have reason to believe that it would have been quickly removed by some infallible remedy, probably by the fruit of the tree of life.\n\nPerhaps it may be said, that if we suppose our first parents or their children to have been liable to accidents of this kind in the garden of Eden, it will be difficult to conceive how they could have been preserved from death,\nFall of Adam as a stone might have fallen on their heads as well as on their feet, and have at once destroyed the principle of vitality. But this can be said only by him who knows little of the physical world, and still less of the power of God. There are many animals which are susceptible of pain, and yet not easily killed; and man in paradise might have resembled them. At any rate, we are sure that the Omnipotent Creator could and would have preserved him from death; but we have no reason to believe that, by a constant miracle, he would have preserved him from every kind of pain. Indeed, if, under the first covenant, mankind were in a state of probation, it is certainly conceivable that some one individual of the numerous race might have fallen into sin, without actually breaking the covenant by eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge; and such a sinner would undoubtedly have been punished by that God who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity: but how punishment could have been inflicted on a being exempted from all possibility of pain as well as of death, we confess ourselves unable to imagine. Remorse, which is the inseparable consequence of guilt, and constitutes in our present state great part of its punishment, flows from the fearful looking for of judgment, which the sinner knows shall, in a future state, devour the adversaries of the gospel of Christ; but he, who could neither suffer pain nor death, had no cause to be afraid of future judgment, and was therefore not liable to the tortures of remorse. We conclude, therefore, that it is a mistake to suppose pain to have been introduced into the world by the fall of our first parents, or at least that the opinion contrary to ours has no foundation in the word of God.\n\nDeath, however, was certainly introduced by their fall; for the inspired apostle affirms us, that in Adam all die*; and again, that through the offence of ONE many are dead†. But concerning the full import of the word death in this place, and in the sentence pronounced upon our first parents, divines hold opinions extremely different. Many contend, that it includes death corporal, spiritual or moral, and eternal; and that all mankind are subjected to these three kinds of death, on account of their share in the guilt of the original transgression, which is usually denominated original sin, and considered as the source of all moral evil.\n\nThat all men are subjected to death corporal in consequence of Adam's transgression, is universally admitted; but that they are in any sense partakers of his guilt, and on that account subjected to death spiritual and eternal, has been very strenuously denied. To discover the truth is of great importance; for it is intimately connected with the Christian doctrine of redemption. We shall therefore state, with as much impartiality as we can, the arguments commonly urged on each side of this much agitated question.\n\nThose who maintain that all men sinned in Adam, generally state their doctrine thus: \"The covenant being made with Adam as a public person, not for himself only but for his posterity, all mankind descending from him by ordinary generation sinned in him and fell with him in that first transgression; whereby they are deprived of that original righteousness in which he was created, and are utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all that is spiritually good, and wholly inclined to all evil, and that continually; which is commonly called original sin, and from which do proceed all actual transgressions, so as we are by nature children of wrath, bond-slaves to Satan, and justly liable to all punishments in this world and in that which is to come, even to everlasting separation from the comfortable presence of God, and to most grievous torments in soul and body, without intermission, in hell fire for ever.\"\n\nThat which in this passage we are first to examine, is the sentence which affirms all mankind descending from Adam by ordinary generation to have sinned in him and fallen with him in his first transgression; the truth of which is attempted to be proved by various texts of Holy Scripture. Thus St Paul says expressly, that \"by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.\" But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if, through the offence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many; and not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift (for the judgment was by one unto condemnation); but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. For if, by one man's offence, death reigned by one; much more they, who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. Therefore as, by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so, by the righteousness of One, the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners; so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.* In this passage the apostle affirms us, that all upon whom death hath passed have sinned; but death hath passed upon infants, who could not commit actual sin. Infants therefore must have sinned in Adam, since death hath passed upon them; for death \"is the wages only of sin.\" He tells us likewise, that by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; and therefore, since the Righteous Judge of heaven and earth never condemns the innocent with the wicked, we must conclude, that all men partake of the guilt of that offence for which judgment came upon them to condemnation. These conclusions are confirmed by his saying expressly, that \"by one man's disobedience many (i.e., all mankind) were made sinners;\" and elsewhere †, that \"there is none righteous, no not one;\" and that his Ephesians 2:13 and converts ‡ were dead in trespasses and sins, and were by Eph. ii. 14 nature children of wrath even as others.\" The same doctrine, it is said, we are taught by the inspired writers of the Old Testament. Thus Job, expostulating with God for bringing into judgment with him such a creature as man, says, \"Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.\" And Eliphaz, reproving the patient patriarch for what he deemed presumption, asks †, \"What is man that he should be clean, or he who is born of a woman that he should be righteous?\" Job xiv. From these two passages it is plain, that Job and his unfailing friend, though they agreed in little else, admitted as a truth unquestionable, that man inherits from his parents a sinful nature, and that it is impossible for any thing born of a woman by ordinary generation to be righteous. The psalmist talks the very same language; when acknowledging his transgressions, he says ||, \"Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" Having\nHaving thus proved the fact, that all men are made sinners by Adam's disobedience, the divines, who embrace this side of the question, proceed to inquire how they can be partakers in guilt which was incurred so many ages before they were born. It cannot be by imitation; for infants, according to them, are involved in this guilt before they be capable of imitating any thing. Neither do they admit that sin is by the apostle put for the consequences of sin, and many said to be made sinners by one man's disobedience, because by that disobedience they were subjected to death, which is the wages of sin. This, which they call the doctrine of the Arminians, they affirm to be contrary to the whole scope and design of the context; as it confounds together sin and death, which are there represented, the one as the cause, and the other as the effect. It likewise exhibits the apostle reasoning in such a manner as would, in their opinion, disgrace any man of common sense, and much more an inspired writer; for then the sense of these words, \"Death hath passed upon all men, for that all have sinned,\" must be, death hath passed upon all men, because it hath passed upon all men; or, all men are obnoxious to death, because they are obnoxious to it. The only way therefore, continue they, in which Adam's posterity can be made sinners through his disobedience, is by the imputation of his disobedience to them; and his imputation is not to be considered in a moral sense, as the action of a man committed by himself, whether good or bad, is reckoned unto him as his own; but in a forensic sense, as when one man's debts are in a legal way placed to the account of another. Of this we have an instance in the apostle Paul, who said to Philemon concerning Onesimus, \"If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee any thing (ἀναγκαίον), let it be imputed to me,\" or placed to and put on my account. And thus the posterity of Adam are made sinners by his disobedience; that being imputed to them and put to their account, as if it had been committed by them personally, though it was not.\n\nSome few divines of this school are indeed of opinion, that the phrase, \"By one man's disobedience many were made sinners,\" means nothing more than that the posterity of Adam, through his sin, derive from him a corrupt nature. But though this be admitted as an undoubted truth, the more zealous abettors of the system contend, that it is not the whole truth. \"It is true (say they) that all men are made of one man's blood, and that blood tainted with sin; and so a clean thing cannot be brought out of an unclean. What is born of the flesh is flesh, carnal and corrupt; every man is conceived in sin and brought into iniquity; but there is a difference between being made sinners and becoming sinful. The one respects the guilt, the other the pollution of nature; the one is previous to the other, and the foundation of it. Men receive a corrupt nature from their immediate parents; but they are made sinners, not by any act of their disobedience, but only by the imputation of the sin of Adam.\"\n\nTo illustrate this doctrine of imputed sin, they observe, that the word ἀπολάθησαν, used by the apostle, signifies constituted in a judicial way, ordered and appointed in the dispensation of things so it should be; just as Christ was made sin or a sinner by imputation, or by that constitution of God which laid upon him the sins of all his people, and dealt with him as if he had been the guilty person. That this is the sense of the passage, they argue further from the punishment inflicted on men for the sin of Adam. The punishment threatened to that sin was death; which includes death corporal, moral, and eternal. Corporal death, say they, is allowed by all to be suffered on account of the sin of Adam; and if so, there must be guilt, and that guilt made over to the sufferer, which can be done only by imputation. A moral death is no other than the loss of the image of God in man, which consisted in righteousness and holiness; and particularly it is the loss of original righteousness, to which succeeded unrighteousness and unholiness. It is both a sin and a punishment for sin; and since it comes on all men as a punishment, it must suppose preceding sin, which can be nothing but Adam's disobedience; the guilt of which is made over to his posterity by imputation. This appears still more evident from the posterity of Adam being made liable to eternal death in consequence of his transgression; for the wages of sin is death, even death eternal, which never can be inflicted on guiltless persons. But from the passage before us we learn, that \"by the offence of one judgement came upon all men to condemnation;\" and therefore the guilt of that offence must be reckoned to all men, or they could not be justly condemned for it. That Adam's sin is imputed to his posterity, appears not only from the words, \"by one man's disobedience many were made sinners;\" but likewise from the opposite clause, \"so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous;\" for the many ordained to eternal life, for whom Christ died, are made righteous, or justified, only through the imputation of his righteousness to them; and therefore it follows, that all men are made sinners only through the imputation of Adam's disobedience.\n\nTo this doctrine it is said to be no objection that Adam's posterity were not in being when his sin was committed; for though they had not then actual being, they had yet a virtual and representative one. They were in him both formally and federally, and sinned in him; just as Levi was in the loins of Abraham, and Rom. vii. paid in him tithes to Melchizedek. From Adam they derive a corrupt nature; but it is only from him, as their federal head, that they derive a share of his guilt, and Rom. vii. are subjected to his punishment. That he was a federal head to all his posterity, the divines of this school think Adam a figure evident from his being called a figure of Christ; and deral head the first Adam described as natural and earthly, in contrast to his posterity; the second Adam described as spiritual and the Lord from heaven; and from the punishment threatened against his sin being inflicted not on himself only, but on all his succeeding offspring, He could not be a figure of Christ, say they, merely as a man; for all the sons of Adam have been men as well as he, and in that sense were as much figures of Christ as he; yet Adam and Christ are constantly contrasted, as though they had been the only two men that ever existed, because they were the only two heads of their respective offspring. He could not be a figure of Christ on account of his extraordinary production; for though both were produced in ways uncommon, yet each was brought into the world in a way peculiar to himself. The first Adam was formed of the dust of the ground; the second, though not begotten by a man, was born of a woman. They did not therefore resemble each other in the manner of their formation, but in their office as\nTHEOLOGY.\n\nFall of Adam, and its consequences.\n\nNor have any of the posterity of Adam, it is said, reason to complain of such a procedure. Had he stood in his integrity, they would have been, by his standing, partakers of all his happiness; and therefore should not murmur at receiving evil through his fall. If this do not satisfy, let it be considered, that since God, in his infinite wisdom, thought proper that men should have a head and representative, in whose hands their good and happiness should be placed, none could be so fit for this high station as the common parent, made after the image of God, so wise, so holy, just, and good. Lastly, to silence all objections, let it be remembered, that what God gave to Adam as a federal head, relating to himself and his posterity, he gave as the Sovereign of the universe, to whom no created being has right to talk.\n\n*See Gill's Body of Divinity.*\n\nSuch are the consequences of Adam's fall, and such the doctrine of original sin, as maintained by the more rigid followers of Calvin. That great reformer, however, was not the author of this doctrine. It had been taught, so early as in the beginning of the fifth century, by St Augustine, the celebrated bishop of Hippo (i.e., Augustine); and the authority of that father had made it more or less prevalent in both the Greek and Roman churches long before the Reformation. Calvin was indeed the most eminent modern divine by whom it has been held in all its rigour; and it constitutes one great part of that theological system which, from being taught by him, is now known by the name of Calvinism.\n\nBut if it was as sovereign of the universe that God gave to Adam what he received in paradise relating to himself and his posterity, Adam could in no sense of the words be a federal head; because, upon this supposition, there was no covenant. The Sovereign of the universe may unquestionably dispense his benefits, or withhold them, as seems expedient to his infinite wisdom; and none of his subjects or creatures can have a right to say to him, What doth thou? But the dispensing or withholding of benefits is a transaction very different from the entering into covenants; and a judgment is to be formed of it on very different principles. Every thing around us proclaims that the Sovereign of the universe is a being of perfect benevolence; but, say the disciples of the school now under consideration, the dispensation given to Adam in paradise was so far from being the offspring of benevolence, that, as it is understood by the followers of Calvin, it cannot possibly be reconciled with the eternal laws of equity. The self-existent and all-sufficient God might or might not have created such a being as man; and in either case there would have been no reason for the question \"What doth thou?\" But as soon as he determined to create him capable of happiness or misery, he would not have been either benevolent or just, if he had not placed him a state where, by his own exertions, he might, if he chose, have a greater share of happiness than of misery, and find his existence, upon the whole, a blesting. They readily acknowledge, that the existence of any created being may be of longer or shorter duration, according to the good pleasure of the Creator; and therefore they have no objection to the apostolic doctrine, that \"in Adam all die,\" for immortality being not a debt, but a free gift, may be bestowed on any terms, and with perfect justice withdrawn when these terms are not complied with. Between death, however, as it implies a loss of consciousness, and the extreme misery of eternal life in torments, there is an immense difference. To death all mankind might justly be subjected through the offence of one; because they had originally no claim to be exempted from it, though that one and they too had remained for ever innocent: but eternal life in torments is a punishment which a God of justice and benevolence can never inflict but upon personal guilt of the deepest die. That we can personally have incurred guilt from a crime committed some thousands of years before we were born, is impossible. It is indeed a notion as contrary to Scripture as to reason and common sense: for the apostle expressly informs us, \"that sin is the transgression of the law;\" and the sin of Adam was the transgression of a law which it was never in our power either to observe or to break. Another apostle assures us, that Rom. iv. \"where no law is, there is no transgression;\" but there is now no law, nor has been any these 3000 years, forbidding mankind to eat of a particular fruit; for, according to the Calvinists themselves, Adam had no sooner committed his first sin, by which the covenant with him was broken, than he ceased to be a covenant head. This law given him was no more; the promise of life by it ceased; and its sanction, death, took place. But if this be so, how is it possible that his unborn posterity should be under a law which had no existence, or that they should be in a worse state in consequence of the covenant being broken, and its promise having ceased, than he himself was before the covenant was first made? He was originally a mortal being, and was promised the supernatural gift of immortality on the single condition of his abstaining from the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. From that fruit he did not abstain; but by eating it fell back into his natural state of mortality. Thus far it is admitted that his posterity fell with him: for they have no claim to a supernatural gift which he had forfeited by his transgression. But we cannot admit, i.e., the divines of this school, that they fell into his guilt; for to render it possible for a man to incur guilt by the transgression of a law, it is necessary not only that he have it in his power to keep the law, but also that he be capable of transgressing it by a voluntary deed. But surely no man could be capable of voluntarily eating the forbidden fruit 3000 years before he himself or his volitions existed. The followers of Calvin think it a sufficient objection to the doctrine of transubstantiation, that the same numerical body cannot be in different places at the same instant of time. But this ubiquity of body, say the remonstrants, is not more palpably absurd, than the supposition that a man could exert volitions before he or his will had any existence.\n\nNor will the introduction of the word imputation into this important question remove a single difficulty. For what is that we mean by saying that the sin of Adam is imputed to his posterity? Is the guilt of that sin transferred from him to them? So surely thought Dr Gill, when he said that it is made over to them. But this is the same absurdity as the making over of the fleshy qualities of bread and wine to the internal substance of our Saviour's body and blood! This imputation either found the posterity of Adam guilty of his sin, or it made them so. It could not find them guilty for\nfor the reason already assigned; as well as because the apostle says expressly, that for the offence of one judge- ment came upon all men, which would not be true had all offended. It could not make them guilty; for this reason, that if there be in physics or metaphysics a single truth felt-evident, it is, that the numerical powers, actions, or qualities, of one being cannot possibly be transferred to another, and be made its powers, actions, or qualities. Different beings may in distant ages have qualities of the same kind; but as easily may 4 and 3 be made equal to 9, as two beings be made to have the same identical quality. In Scripture we nowhere read of the actions of one man being imputed to another.\n\n\"Abraham (we are told) believed in God, and it was counted to him for righteousness;\" but it was his own faith, and not the faith of another man, that was so counted. \"To him that worketh not, but believeth, his faith (not another's) is imputed for righteousness.\" And of our faith in him that raised Christ from the dead, it is said, that \"it shall be imputed, not to our fathers or our children, but to us for righteousness.\"\n\nWhen this phrase is used with a negative, not only is the man's own personal sin spoken of, but the non-imputation of that sin means nothing more but that it brings not upon the sinner condign punishment. Thus when Shimei \"said unto David,\" Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me,\" it could not be his meaning that the king should not think that he had offended; for with the same breath he added, \"Neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely, the day that my lord the king went of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. For thy servant doth know that I have sinned.\" Here he plainly confesses his sin, and declares, that by intreting the king not to impute it to him, he wished only that it should not be remembered as that the king should take it to heart, and punish him as his perverstness deserved. When therefore it is said *, that \"God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their iniquities, the meaning is only that for Christ's sake he was pleased to exempt them from the punishment due to their sins. In like manner, when the prophet, foretelling the sufferings of the Messiah, says, that \"the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all,\" his meaning cannot be, that the Lord by imputation made his immaculate Son guilty of all the sins that men have ever committed; for in that case it would not be true that the \"just suffered for the unjust,\" as the apostle expressly teaches †; but the sense of the verse must be, as Bishop Cordell translated it, \"through him the Lord pardoneth all our sins.\" This interpretation is countenanced by the ancient version of the Seventy, ναυ Κυριος μακάρισεν αυτον την ἀπολογίαν αυτου; words which express a notion very different from that of imputed guilt. The Messiah was, without a breach of justice, delivered for sins of which he had voluntarily offered to pay the penalty; and St Paul might have been justly charged by Philemon with the debts of Onesimus, which he had desired might be placed to his account. Had the apostle, however, expressed no such desire, surely Philemon could by no deed of his have made him liable for debts contracted by another; far less could he by imputation, whatever that word may mean, have made him virtually concur in the contracting of those debts. He could not have been justly subjected to suffering without his own consent; and he could not possibly have been made guilty of the sins of those for whom he suffered.\n\nThe doctrine of imputed guilt therefore, as understood by the Calvinists, is, in the opinion of their opponents, without foundation in Scripture, and contrary to the nature of things. It is an impious absurdity (say they), to which the mind can never be reconciled by the hypothesis, that all men were in Adam both seminally and federally, and finned in him, as Levi paid tithes to Melchizedek in the loins of Abraham. The apostle, when he employs that argument to lessen in the minds of his countrymen the pride of birth and the lofty opinions entertained of their priesthood, plainly intimates, that he was using a bold figure, and that Levi's paying tithes is not to be understood in a strict and literal sense.\n\n\"Now consider (says he) how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. And, as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes in Abraham: for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.\" This is a very good argument to prove that the Levitical priesthood was inferior in dignity to that of Melchizedek; and by the apostle it is employed for no other purpose. Levi could not be greater than Abraham, and yet Abraham was inferior to Melchizedek. This is the whole of St Paul's reasoning, which lends no support to the doctrine of original sin, unless it can be shown that Levi and all his descendants contracted from father to son this circumstance such a strong propensity to the payment of tithes, as made it a matter of extreme difficulty for them, in every subsequent generation, to comply with that part of the divine law which constituted them receivers of tithes. That all men were seminally in Adam, is granted; and it is likewise granted that they may have derived from him, by ordinary generation, diseased and enfeebled bodies: but it is as impossible to believe that moral guilt can be transmitted from father to son by the physical act of generation, as to conceive a scarlet colour to be a cube of marble, or the sound of a trumpet a cannon ball. That Adam was as fit a person as any other to be entrusted with the good and happiness of his posterity, may be true; but there is no fitness whatever, according to the Arminians, in making the everlasting happiness or misery of a whole race depend upon the conduct of any fallible individual. \"That any man should so represent me (says Dr Taylor *), that when he is guilty, I am to be reputed guilty; when he transgresses, I shall be accountable and punishable for his transgression; and this before I am born, and consequently before I am in any capacity of knowing, helping, or hindering, what he doth: all this everyone who utters his understanding must clearly see to be false, unreasonable, and altogether inconsistent with the truth and goodness of God.\" And that no such appointment ever had place, he endeavours to prove, by showing that the texts of Scripture upon which is built the doctrine of the Calvinists respecting original sin, will each admit of a very different interpretation.\n\nOne of the strongest of these texts is Romans v. 19. The several which we have already quoted, and which our author thus explains. He observes, that the apostle was a Jew, and was familiarly acquainted with the Hebrew tongue; that he built up his epistle as well for the use of his own countrymen as for the benefit of the Gentile converts; and that though he made use of the Greek language,\nTHEOLOGY.\n\nOur translators seem to consider it as used absolutely without any antecedent; but this is inaccurate, as it may be questioned whether the relative was ever used in any language without an antecedent either expressed or understood. Accordingly, the Calvinist critics, and even many Remonstrants, consider ἐν τῇ ἀπογεννημένῳ in the beginning of the verse as the antecedent to ὁ in the end of it, and translate the clause under consideration thus: \"And to death hath palled upon all men, in whom (viz. Adam) all have sinned.\" Θανάτος, however, stands much nearer to ὁ than ἀπογεννημένῳ; and being of the same gender, ought, we think, to be considered as its real antecedent: but if so, the clause under consideration should be thus translated: \"and to death hath palled upon all men, unto which (ο) all have sinned, or, as the Arminians explain it, have suffered. If this criticism be admitted as just, ὁ ὁ μυστικόν as standing here under a particular emphasis, denoting the utmost length of the consequences of Adam's sin (p); as if the apostle had said, \"so far have the consequences of Adam's sin extended, and spread their influence among mankind, introducing not only a curse upon the earth, and sorrow and toil upon its inhabitants, but even death, universal death, in every part, and in all ages of the world.\" His words (say the Remonstrants) will unquestionably bear this sense; and it is surely much more probable that it is their true sense, than that an inspired writer should have taught a doctrine subversive of all our notions of right and wrong, and which, if really embraced, must make us incapable of judging when we are innocent and when guilty.\n\nWhen the apostle says that there is none righteous, no not one, he gives us plainly to understand that he is quoting from the 14th Psalm; and the question first to be answered is, In what sense were these words used by the Psalmist? That they were not meant to include all the men and women then living, far less all that have ever lived, is plain from the fifth verse of the same Psalm, where we are told that those wicked persons \"were in great fear, because God was in the congregation of the righteous.\" There was then, it seems, a congregation of righteous persons, in opposition to those called the children of men, of whom alone it is said that there was none that did good, no not one. The truth is, that the persons of whom David generally complains in the book of Psalms, constituted a strong party disaffected to his person and government. That faction he describes as proud and oppressive, as devising mischief against him, as violent men continually getting together for war. He styles them his enemies; and sometimes characterizes them by the appellation which was given to the apostate descendants of Cain before the deluge. Thus in the 57th Psalm, which was composed when he fled from Saul to the cave in which he spared that tyrant's life, he complains, \"I lie among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears,\" &c.; and\n\n(o) That σὺν, when construed with a dative case, often signifies to or unto, is known to every Greek scholar. Thus ἐν τῷ ἀπολογεῖν ἑαυτὸν, the way to fame, (Lucian.). Κακοῦχος ἐν τῷ ἀπολογεῖν, a criminal unto death, (Demotis.). Ἐν τῷ ἀπολογεῖν ἑαυτὸν, to carry to death or execution, (Hec.). Ἐν τῷ ἀπολογεῖν ἑαυτὸν, ye have been called to liberty, (Gal. v. 13.). Κακοῦχος ἐν τῷ ἀπολογεῖν ἑαυτὸν, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, (Ephes. ii. 10.). See also 1 Thess. iv. 7.; 2 Tim. ii. 14.; and many other places of the New Testament.\n\n(p) ἐν ὁ ὁ has likewise this import, denoting the terminus ad quem in Phil. iii. 12. and iv. 10.\nand again, in the 58th Psalm, he says, \"Do ye indeed speak righteousnes, O congregation? Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?\" By comparing these texts with 1 Sam. xxvi. 19, it will appear evident that by the sons of men mentioned in them, he meant to characterize those enemies who exasperated Saul against him. Now it is well known, that there was a party adhering to the interests of the house of Saul, which continued its enmity to David during the 40 years of his reign, and joined with Absalom in rebellion against him only eight years before his death. But it is the opinion of the most judicious commentators, that the 14th Psalm was composed during the rebellion of Absalom; and therefore it is surely much more probable, that by the children of men, of whom it is said there is \"none that doth good, no not one,\" the inspired poet meant to characterize the rebels, than that he should have directly contradicted himself in the compass of two sentences succeeding each other. Had he indeed known that all the children of men, as descending from Adam, \"are utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all that is spiritually good, and wholly and continually inclined to all evil,\" he could not, with the least degree of consistency, have represented the Lord as looking down from heaven upon them, to see if there were any that did understand and seek after God; but if by the children of men was meant only the rebel faction, this scenerical representation is perfectly consistent, as it was natural to suppose that there might be in that faction some men of good principles misled by the arts of the rebel chiefs.\n\nHaving thus ascertained the sense of the words as originally used by the Psalmist, the Arminian proceeds to inquire for what purpose they were quoted by the apostle; and in this inquiry he seems to find nothing difficult. The aversion of the Jews from the admission of the Gentiles to the privileges of the gospel, the high opinion which they entertained of their own worth and superiority to all other nations, and the strong persuasion which they had that a strict obedience to their own law was sufficient to justify them before God, are facts universally known; but it was the purpose of the apostle to prove that all men stood in need of a Redeemer, that Jews as well as Gentiles had been under the dominion of sin, and that the one could not in that respect claim any superiority over the other. He begins his epistle, therefore, with showing the extreme depravity of the Heathen world; and having made good that point, he proceeds to prove, by quotations from the book of Psalms, Proverbs, and Isaiah, that the Jews were in no wise better than they, that every mouth might be stopped, and all the world become guilty, or insufficient for their own justification before God.\n\nThe next proof brought by the Calvinists in support of their opinion, that all men derive guilt from Adam by ordinary generation, is that text in which St Paul says that the Ephesians \"were by nature children of wrath even as others.\" To this their opponents reply, that the doctrine of original sin is in this verse, as in the last quoted, countenanced only by our translation, and not by the original Greek as understood by the ancient fathers of the Christian church, who were greater masters of that language than we. The words are καὶ ἐκ τοῦ γενέσθαι ὑπὸ ῥατής, where it is impossible that ὑπὸ ῥατής can signify natural, otherwise the apostle will be made to say, not that we are by nature derived from Adam liable to wrath, but that we were naturally begotten by wrath in the abstract! For taking the word ὑπὸ ῥατής in the sense of really or truly, both the ancient and modern Greeks appear indeed to have the authority of St Paul himself; who, writing to Timothy, calls him ἀγαθὸς ἀνὴρ, \"his true or genuine son;\" not to signify that he was the child of the apostle by natural generation, but that he was closely related to him in the faith to which St Paul had converted him. That the words ἐκ τοῦ γενέσθαι ὑπὸ ῥατής can signify nothing but truly or reality relations to wrath, is still farther evident from the ground assigned of that relation. It is not the sin of Adam, or the impurity of natural generation, \"but the trespasses and sins in which the Ephesians in time past walked, according to the course of the world, according to the prince of the power of the air,\" the spirit that at the time of the apostle's writing \"worked in the children of disobedience.\" Surely no man can suppose that the Ephesians at any past time walked in Adam's trespass and sin, or that the prince of the power of the air tempted them to eat the forbidden fruit.\n\nHaving thus commented on the principal texts which are cited from the New Testament to prove the doctrine of original sin, the Arminians treat those which are quoted from the Old Testament, in support of the same doctrine, with much less ceremony. Thus, when Job says, \"who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one,\" he is speaking, say they, not of the pravity of our nature, but of its frailty and weaknesses, of the shortness and misery of human life. The sentence is proverbial; and as it is used only to signify, that nothing can be more perfect than its original, it must, whenever it occurs, be understood according to the subject to which it is applied. That in the place under consideration,\ntion it refers to our mortality; they think plain from the context; and Dr Taylor adds *, with some plausibility, that if the words refer to the guilt which we are supposed to derive from Adam, they will prove too much to serve the common scheme of original sin. They will prove that our natural and inherent pravity, so far from rendering us fit subjects of wrath, may be urged as a reason why God should not even bring us into judgment; for the patriarch's whole expostulation runs thus, \"Dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one, and bringest me into judgment with thee? Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?\"\n\nThe other text, quoted from the same book, they think still less to the purpose; for Eliphaz is evidently contrasting the creature with the Creator; in comparison with whom, he might well say, without alluding to original guilt, \"what is man that he should be clean? and he who is born of a woman that he should be righteous?\" Behold he putteth no trust in his saints; yea the heavens are not clean in his sight. How much more abominable and filthy is man, who drinketh iniquity like water?\" He does not say, who derives by birth an iniquitous nature; for he knew well, that as we are born, we are the pure workmanship of God, \"whose hands have fashioned and formed every one of us;\" but \"who drinketh iniquity like water,\" who maketh himself iniquitous by running headlong into every vicious practice.\n\nOf the text quoted from the fifty-first psalm in support of the doctrine of original sin, Dr Taylor labours †, by a long and ingenious criticism, to prove that our translators have mistaken the sense. The word which they have rendered *shapen*, he shows to be used once by Isaiah, and twice in the book of Proverbs, to signify brought forth; and that which is rendered conceived me, is never, he says, employed in scripture to denote human conception. In this last remark, however, he is contradicted by a great authority, no less indeed than that of Mr Parkhurst ‡, who says, that the LXX constantly render it by νεων or νεογεννημενος, and the Vulgate generally by concipio. Without taking upon us to decide between these two eminent Hebrew scholars, we shall only observe, that upon one occasion || it certainly denotes ideas much grofter than those which the Psalmist must have had of his mother's conception; and that there, at least, Dr Taylor properly translates it, incafecebant, adding, \"de hoc vero incafeceendi generi loqui Davidem nemo famus extimare potest. Matrem enim incafeceisse, aut ipsum caleficiisse eo modo quo incafece-rent Jacobi pecudes Regem dicere, profris indecorum et absurdum.\" He contends, however, that the original force of the word is to be hot, and that it is applied to conception, to repentment, to warmth by which the body is nourished, to idolaters in love with idols, and to the heat of metals. The heat of idolaters, of repentment, and of metals, are evidently foreign to the Psalmist's purpose; and the idea conveyed by the word incafeceire being set aside for the reasons already assigned, there remains only the warmth by which the body is nourished, and of that warmth our author is confident that David spoke.\n\nIf this criticism be admitted, the whole verse will then run thus: \"Behold I was born in iniquity, and in sin did my mother nurse me;\" which hath no reference to the original formation of his constitution, but is a periphrasis of his being a sinner from the womb, and means nothing more than that he was a great sinner, or had contracted early habits of sin. He no more designed to signify in this verse, that by ordinary generation he had a nature conveyed to him which was utterly indispensible, disabled, and opposite to all that is spiritually good, and wholly and continually inclined to evil, than he meant in another * to signify strictly and properly that \"the wicked are estranged from the womb, and tell lies as soon as they are born;\" or that Job meant to signify †, that from the moment he came from his mother's womb he had been a guide to the widow and a succour to the fatherless. All these are hyperbolical forms of expression; which, though they appear strained, and perhaps extravagant, to the phlegmatic inhabitants of Europe, are perfectly suited to the warm imaginations of the orientals, and to the genius of eastern languages. They mean not that Job was born with habits of virtue, that the wicked actually walked, and spoke, and spoke lies from the instant of their birth, or that the Psalmist was really shapen in sin and conceived in iniquity. This last sentence, if interpreted literally, would indeed be grossly impious: it would make the inspired penman throw the whole load of his iniquity and sin from off himself upon him who shaped, and upon her who conceived him; even upon that God \"whose hands had made him and fashioned him, and whom he declares that he will praise for having made him fearfully and wonderfully,\" and upon that parent who conceived him with sorrow, and brought him forth with pain, and to whom the divine law commanded him to render honour and gratitude. \"But if, after all (says Dr Taylor ‡), you will adhere to the literal sense of the text for the common doctrine of original sin, show me any good reason why you ought not part ii. to admit the literal sense of the text, this is my body, for transubstantiation? If you say, it is absurd to suppose that Christ speaks of his real natural body; I say, it is likewise absurd to suppose that the Psalmist speaks of his being really and properly shapen in iniquity, and conceived in sin. If you say, that the sense of the words this is my body may be clearly explained by other texts of scripture where the like forms of speech are used; I say, and have shown, that the Psalmist's sense may as clearly and evidently be made out by parallel texts, where you have the like kind of expression. If you say that transubstantiation is attended with consequences hurtful to piety, I say that the common doctrine of original sin is attended with consequences equally hurtful; for it is a principle apparently leading to all manner of iniquity to believe that sin is natural to us; that it is interwoven and ingrafted into our very constitution from our conception and formation in the womb.\"\n\nThe Arminians having thus, as they think, proved that the posterity of Adam are not in any sense rendered eaten guilty by his sin, contend, that the death threatened against his eating of the forbidden fruit, and which, in consequence of his transgression, came upon all men, according to can mean nothing more than the loss of that vital principle which he received when God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and he became a living soul. Every thing beyond this is pure conjecture, which has no foundation in the scriptures of truth, and is directly contrary to all the notions of right and wrong which we\nwe have been able to acquire from the study of those very scriptures. It is not conceivable from anything in the history, that Adam could understand it of the loss of any other life than that which he had lately received, for no other life is spoken of to which the threatened death can be opposed; and in such circumstances it was strange indeed, if by the word death he understood either eternal life in misery, or a necessity of continuing in sin. The sense therefore of the threatening, say they, is this: \"I have formed thee of the dust of the ground, and breathed into thy nostrils the breath of life; and thus thou art become a living soul. But if thou eatest of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt cease to be a living soul; for I will take from thee the breath of life, and thou shalt return to the dust of which thou wast formed.\"\n\nThus far the Arminians of the present day are agreed in opposing the doctrine of the rigid Calvinists, and in stating their own notions of the consequences of Adam's fall; but from that event their adversaries deduce one consequence, which some of them admit and others deny. It is said, that though we cannot possibly be partakers in Adam's guilt, we yet derive from him a moral taint and infection, by which we have a natural propensity to sin; that having lost the image of God, in which he was created, Adam begat sons in his own image; and in one word, that the sensual appetites of human nature were inflamed, and its moral and intellectual powers greatly weakened by the eating of the forbidden fruit. The heathens themselves acknowledged and lamented this depravity; though they were ignorant of the source from which it sprung. The scriptures assert it, affirming that no man can be born pure and clean; that whatever is born of the flesh, or comes into the world by ordinary generation, is flesh, carnal and corrupt; that the imagination of the thoughts of man's heart is only evil continually; that the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked; and that out of it proceeds all that is vile and sinful.\n\nThis depravity of human nature, thus clearly deducible from scripture, and confirmed by the testimony of ages, an ingenious writer of the moderate Arminian school undertakes to illustrate upon the principles of natural knowledge. \"We know (says he f), that there are several fruits in several parts of the world of sonoxious a nature as to destroy the best human constitution on earth. We also know that there are some fruits in the world which inflame the blood into fevers and frenzies; and we are told that the Indians are acquainted with a certain juice, which immediately turns the person who drinks it into an idiot, leaving him at the same time in the enjoyment of his health and all the powers of his body. Now I ask Whether it be not possible, nay whether it be not rational, to believe, that the same fruit, which, in the present infirmity of nature, would utterly destroy the human constitution, might, in its highest perfection, at least disturb, impair, and displace it? and whether the same fruit, which would now inflame any man living into a fever or frenzy, might not inflame Adam into a turbulence and irregularity of passion and appetite? and whether the same fluids, which inflame the blood into irregularity of passion and appetite, may not naturally produce infection and impair the constitution? That the forbidden fruit had the effect to produce irregularity of appetite, appears as from other proofs,\n\n*Job xiv. 4.*\nJohn iii. 6.\nRom. iii. 5.\nJer. xvii. 9.\nMat. xv. 19.\n\n†Gill's Bo-\ndy of Divi-\nnity, book\n11. and 13.\n\n‡Scripture\nDoctrine,\n&c.\n\nVol. XX. Part I.\nregularity of passions and appetites equal at least to what Adam displayed in the garden of Eden. When the three young men mentioned in the book of Daniel submitted to be burnt alive in a fiery furnace rather than worship Nebuchadnezzar's golden image; when Daniel himself resolved, rather than conceal the worship of God for one month only of his life, to be torn in pieces by hungry lions; and, to come nearer to our own times, when numbers of men and women, during the reign of Mary queen of England, chose rather to be burnt at a stake than renounce the reformed religion and embrace the errors of popery—surely all these persons exhibited a virtue, a faith in God, and a steady adherence to what they believed to be the truth, far superior to what Adam displayed, when his wife gave him of the forbidden fruit, and he did eat.\" If it be said that these persons were supported under their trials by the grace of God strengthening them, the same will be said of Adam. He was undoubtedly supplied with every aid from the spirit of grace which was necessary to enable him to fulfill his duty; for being designed for more than mere animal life, even for the refined enjoyments of heaven, there is every reason to believe, as we have already observed, that he was put under the guidance of the Holy Ghost, to train him for that supernatural state of felicity. These communications of the Spirit would of course be withdrawn when he forfeited his right to those privileges, on account of which they were originally vouchsafed to him; but that any positive malignity or taint was infused into his nature, that his more rational powers were weakened, or his appetites inflamed by the forbidden fruit, there is no evidence to be found in scripture, or in the known constitution of things. The attributing of this supposed hereditary taint to the noxious qualities of the forbidden fruit, is a whimsical hypothesis, which receives no countenance from any well authenticated fact in natural history. After the numberless falsehoods that have been told of the poison tree of Java, something more would be requisite than the common evidence of a lying voyager to give credit to the qualities of the Indian tree, of which the fruit instantly turns the wisest man into an idiot; and yet for this singular story our ingenious author vouches not even that evidence, slight as it generally is. The inference drawn from the covering used by our first parents is contradicted by every thing that we know of human nature; for surely no man, inflamed to the utmost with the fire of animal love, ever turned his eyes from a naked beauty ready and eager to receive him to her embrace. Yet this, it seems, was the behaviour of Adam and Eve in such a state! According to our author, the juice of the forbidden fruit had rendered their carnal appetites violent and independent of reason; according to the scripture, they were both naked; and as they were husband and wife, there was no law prohibiting them from gratifying their inflamed appetites. In such circumstances, how did they conduct themselves? One would naturally imagine that they immediately retired to some shady grove, and pleased themselves in all the soft dalliances of wedded love. Their conduct, however, was very different. We are told, that \"they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons to cover their nakedness.\" And this transaction is brought as a proof of the impetuosity of their carnal appetites. The truth is, that the carnal appetite appears not to be naturally more violent than is necessary to answer the end for which it was implanted in the human constitution. Among savages the desires of animal love are generally very moderate; and even in society they have not often, unless inflamed by the luxurious arts of civil life, greater strength than is requisite to make mankind attend to the continuation of their species. In the decline of empires highly polished, where the difference of rank and opulence is great, and where every man is ambitious of emulating the expense of his immediate superiors, early marriages are prevented by the inability of most people to provide for a family in a way suitable to what each is pleased to consider as his proper station; and in that state of things the violence of animal love will indeed frequently produce great irregularities. But for that state of things, as it was not intended by the Author of nature, it is perhaps unreasonable to suppose that provision should be made; and yet we believe it will be found, upon due consideration, that if the desires of animal love were less violent than they are, the general consequences would be more pernicious to society than all the irregularities and vices which these desires now accidentally produce; for there would then be no intercourse between the sexes whatever except in the very highest stations of life. That our constitution is attended with many sensual appetites and passions, is true; and that there is a great danger of their becoming excessive and irregular in a world so full of temptation as ours is, is also true; but there is no evidence that all this is the consequence of Adam's fall, and far less that it amounts to a natural propensity to sin. For I presume (says Dr Taylor), that by a natural propensity is meant a necessary inclination to sinning that we or that we are necessarily sinful from the original bent and bias of our natural powers. But this must be false; for then we should not be sinful at all, because that which sin is necessary, or which we cannot help, is not sin. That we are weak and liable to temptation, is the will of God holy and good, and for glorious purposes to ourselves; but if we are wicked, it must be through our own fault, and cannot proceed from any constraint, or necessity, or taint in our constitution.\"\n\nThus have we given as full and comprehensive a view as our limits will permit of the different opinions of the Calvinists and Arminians respecting the consequences of Adam's fall. If we have dwelt longer upon the scheme of the latter than of the former, it is because every Arminian argument is built upon criticism, and appeals to the original text; whilst the Calvinists rest their faith upon the plain words of scripture as read in our translation. If we might hazard our own opinion, we should say that the truth lies between them, and that it has been found by the moderate men of both parties, who, while they make use of different language, seem to us to have the same sentiments. That all mankind really and Arm-inned in Adam, and are on that account liable to mortal nian's grievous torments in soul and body, without intermission, and, in hell fire for ever, is a doctrine which cannot be reconciled to our natural notions of God. On the other hand, if human nature was not somehow debauched by the fall of our first parents, it is not easy to account for the numberless phrases in scripture which certainly seem to speak that language, or for the very general opinion of the Pagan philosophers and poets reflecting the golden age and the degeneracy of man. Cicero, in a quotation preferred...\nTheology preserved by St Augustine from a work that is now lost, has these remarkable words, \"Homo non ut a matre fed ut a noverca natura editus est in vitam, corpore nudo et fragili, et infirmo; animo autem anxio ad molestias, humilitate timores, mollis ad labores, prono ad libidines; in quo tamen inflat tanquam obrutus quidam divinis ignis ingenitum et mentis.\" Nor do we readily perceive what should induce the more zealous Arminians to oppose so vehemently this general opinion of the corruption of human nature. Their desire to vindicate the justice and goodness of God does them honour; but the doctrine of inherent corruption militates not against these attributes; for what we have lost in the first Adam has been amply supplied to us in the second; and we know from the highest authority that the duties required of us are in proportion to our ability, since we are told, that \"unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required.\"\n\nSect. IV. View of Theology from the fall of Adam to the coming of Christ.\n\nWe have dwelt long on the original state of man, his introduction into the terrestrial paradise, the privileges to which he was there admitted, his forfeiture of those privileges, and the state to which he was reduced by transgressing the law of his Maker; but the importance of these events renders them worthy of all the attention that we have paid to them. They paved the way for the coming of Christ and the preaching of the gospel; and unless we thoroughly understand the origin of the gospel, we cannot have an adequate conception of its design. By contrasting the first with the second Adam, St Paul gives us clearly to understand, that one purpose for which Christ came into the world and suffered death on the cross, was to restore to mankind that life which they had lost by the fall of their original progenitor. The preaching of the gospel therefore commenced with the first hint of such a restoration; and the promise given to Adam and Eve, that \"the seed of the woman should bruise the head of the serpent,\" was as truly evangelical as these words of the apostle, by which we are taught, that \"this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.\"\n\nChristianity may be said to have commenced with the fall.\n\nChristianity therefore is indeed very near as old as the creation; but its principles were at first obscurely revealed, and afterwards gradually developed under different forms as mankind became able to receive them, (see Prophecy, No. 5, &c.). All that appears to have been at first revealed to Adam and Eve was, that by some means or other one of their posterity should in time redeem the whole race from the curse of the fall; or if they had a distant view of the means by which that redemption was to be wrought, it was probably communicated to them at the institution of sacrifices, (see Sacrifice). This promise of a future deliverance served to comfort them under their heavy sentence; and the institution of sacrifices, whilst it impressed upon their minds lively ideas of the punishment due to their transgression, was admirably calculated to prepare both them and their posterity for the great atonement which, in due time, was to take away the sins of the world.\n\nOur first parents, after their fall, were so far from being left to fabricate a mode of worship for themselves by those innate powers of the human mind on which we daily hear so much, and feel so little, that God was graciously pleased to manifest himself to their senses, and visibly to conduct them by the angel of his presence in all the rites and duties of religion. This is evident from ages of the different discourses which he held with Cain, as well as from the complaint of that murderer of being hid from his face, and from its being said, that \"he went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt on the east of Eden.\" Nor does it appear that God wholly withdrew his visible presence, and left mankind to their own inventions, till their wickedness became so very great that his spirit could no longer strive with them. The infant state of the world stood in constant need of his supernatural guidance and protection. The early inhabitants of this globe cannot be supposed to have been able, with Moses*, to look up to him who is invisible, and perform a worship purely rational and spiritual. They were all tillers of the ground, or keepers of cattle; employed in cultivating and replenishing this new world; and, through the curse brought upon it by their forefather, forced, with him, to eat their bread \"in the sweat of their brow.\" Man in such circumstances could have little leisure for speculation; nor has mere speculation, unless furnished with principles from another source, ever generated in the human mind adequate notions of God's nature or providence, or of the means by which he can be acceptably worshipped. Frequent manifestations, therefore, of his presence would be necessary to keep a tolerable sense of religion among them, and secure obedience to the divine institutions; and that the Almighty did not exhibit such manifestations, cannot be inferred from the silence of that very short history which we have of those early ages. Adam himself continued 930 years a living monument of the justice and mercy of God; of his extreme hatred and abhorrence of sin, as well as of his love and long suffering towards the sinner. He was very sensible how sin had entered into the world, and he could not but apprize his children of its author. He would at the same time inform them of the unity of God, and his dominion over the evil one; of the means by which he had appointed himself to be worshipped; and of his promise of future deliverance from the curse of the fall. Such information would produce a tolerable idea of the Divine Being, and afford sufficient motives to obey his will. The effects of it accordingly were apparent in the righteous family of Seth, who soon distinguished themselves from the posterity of Cain, and for their eminent piety were honoured with the appellation of the sons of God. Of this family sprang a person so remarkable for virtue and devotion, as to be exempted from Adam's sentence and the common lot of his sons; for after he had walked with God 300 years, and prophesied to his brethren, he was translated that he should not see death. Of this miraculous event there can be no doubt but that his contemporaries had some visible demonstration; and as the fate of Abel was an argument to their reason, so the translation of Enoch was a proof to their senses of another state of life after the present. To Adam himself,\nif he was then alive (s), it must have been a lively and affecting instance of what he might have enjoyed, had he kept his innocence; it must have been a comfortable earnest of the promised victory over the evil one; and have confirmed his hope, that when the head of the serpent should be completely bruised, he and his posterity would be restored to the favour of their Maker, and behold his presence in bliss and immortality.\n\nNotwithstanding this watchful care of God over his fallen creature man, vice, and probably idolatry, spread through the world with a rapid pace. The family of Seth married into that of Cain, and adopted the manners of their new relations. Rape and violence, unbounded lust and impurity of every kind, prevailed universally; and when those giants in wickedness had filled the earth with tyranny, injustice, and oppression; when the whole race was become entirely carnal—God, after raising up another prophet to give them frequent warnings of their fate for the space of 120 years, was at length obliged, in mercy to themselves as well as to the succeeding generations of men, to cut them off by a general deluge. See Deluge.\n\nThus did God, by the spirit of prophecy, by frequent manifestations of his own presence; and by uninterrupted tradition—make ample provision for the instruction and improvement of the world for the first 1600 years. After the deluge he was pleased to converse again with Noah, and make in his person a new and extensive covenant with mankind, (see Prophecy, No. 11). Of his power, justice, and goodness; of his supreme dominion over the earth and the heavens; of his abhorrence of sin, and his determination not to let it go unpunished—that patriarch and his family had been most awfully convinced; nor could they or their children, for some time, want any other argument to enforce obedience, fear, and worship. The sons of Noah were an hundred years old when the deluge overwhelmed the earth. They had long conversed with their ancestors of the old world, had frequented the religious assemblies, observed every Sabbath day, and been instructed by those who had been Adam. It is therefore impossible that they could be ignorant of the creation of the world, of the fall of man, or of the promise of future deliverance from the consequences of that fall; or that they could offer their sacrifices, and perform the other rites of the instituted worship, without looking forward with the eye of faith to that deliverance seen, perhaps obscurely, through their typical oblations.\n\nIn this state of things religion might for some time be safely propagated by tradition. But when by degrees mankind corrupted that tradition in its most essential parts; when, instead of the one Supreme God, they set up several orders of inferior deities, and worshipped all the host of heaven; when, at the same time they were uniting under one head, and forming a universal empire under the patronage of the Sun their chief divinity (see Babel)—God saw it necessary to disperse them into distinct colonies, by causing such discord among them as rendered it impossible for any one species of idolatry to be at once universally established.\n\nAfter this dispersion, there is reason to believe that particular revelations were vouchsafed wherever men were disposed to regard them. Peleg had his name prophetically given him from the dispersion which was to happen in his days; and not only his father Eber, but all the heads of families mentioned from Noah to Abraham, are with much plausibility supposed to have had the spirit of prophecy on many occasions. Noah was undoubtedly both priest and prophet; and living till within two years of the birth of Abraham, or, according to others, till that patriarch was near 60 years old, he would surely be able to keep up a tolerable sense of true religion among such of his descendants as sojourned within the influence of his doctrine and example. His religious son Shem, who lived till after the birth of Isaac, could not but preserve in tolerable purity the faith and worship of the true God among such of his own descendants as lived in his neighbourhood.\n\nBut though the remains of true religion were thus preserved among a few righteous men, idolatry had in a short time prevailed so far among the sons of Noah, that God, saw it expedient not only to shorten the lives of men, but also to withdraw his presence from the generality, who had thus rendered themselves unworthy of such communications; and to select a particular family, in which his worship might be preserved pure amidst the various corruptions that were spreading over the world. With this view Abraham was called, and, after many remarkable trials of his faith and constancy, admitted to a particular intimacy and friendship with his Maker. God was entered into a peculiar covenant with him, engaging to be his present guide, protector, and defender; to bestow all temporal blessings upon him and his seed; and to make some of those seed the instruments of conveying blessings of a higher kind to all the nations of the earth.\n\nIt was doubtless for his singular piety that Abraham was fixed upon to be the parent of that people, who should preserve the knowledge of the unity of God in the midst of an idolatrous and polytheistic world; but we are not to imagine that it was for his sake only that all this was done, or that his less worthy descendants were by the equal Lord of all treated with partial fondness for the virtues of their ancestor; it was for the benefit of mankind in general that he was called from his country, and from his father's house, that he might preserve the doctrine of the divine unity in his own family, and be an instrument in the hand of Providence (and a fit one he was) to convey the same faith to the nations around him. Accordingly, we find him distinguished among the neighbouring princes, and kings reproved for his sake; who being made acquainted with his prophetic character, desired his intercession with God. History tells us of his conversing on the subject of religion with the most learned Egyptians, who appear to have derived from him or some of his descendants the rite of circumcision, and to have been for a while stopt in their progress towards the last stage of that degrading idolatry which afterwards rendered their national worship the opprobrium of the whole earth, (see Polytheism, No. 28).\n\nWe are informed that his name was held in the greatest veneration all over the East; that the Magians, Sabians, Persians,\n\n(s) According to the Samaritan chronology, he was alive; according to the Hebrew, he had been dead 57 years.\nPersians, and Indians, all glory in him as the greatest reformer of their respective religions; and to us it appears extremely probable, that not only the Brahmins, but likewise the Hindoo god Brahma*, derive their names from the father of the faithful. As he was let into the various counsels of the Almighty, and taught to reason and reflect upon them; as he was fully apprified of the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, with the particular circumstances of that miraculous event; and as he had frequent revelations of the promised Redeemer, whose day he longed earnestly to see, and seeing it was glad—there can be no doubt but that he and his family took care to propagate these important doctrines in every nation which they visited; for the only reason which we can conceive for his being made to wander from place to place was, that different people might be induced to inquire after his profession, his religion, and his hopes.\n\nBut though the Supreme Being was pleased to manifest himself in a more frequent and familiar manner to Abraham, he by no means left the rest of the world without sufficient light. Lot professed the true religion in the midst of Sodom. In Canaan we meet with Melchizedek, king and priest of the most high God, who blessed Abraham, and to whom that patriarch himself did homage. Abimelech king of Gerar receiving an admonition from the Lord, immediately paid a due regard to it; and the same sense of religion and virtue descended to his son. Laban and Bethuel acknowledged the Lord, and the former of them was even favoured with a vision. In Arabia, we find Job and his three friends, all men of high rank, entering into the deepest disquisitions in theology; agreeing about the unity, omnipotence, and spirituality of God; the justice of his providence, with other fundamental articles of true religion; and mentioning divine inspiration or revelation as a thing not uncommon in their age and country* (v).\n\nBalaam appears to have been a true prophet; and as he was unquestionably a man of bad morals, the natural inference is, that the gift of prophecy was then, as afterwards bestowed on individuals, not for their own sakes, but for the sake of the public; and that, as in “every nation, he who feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted of him,” so in those early ages of the world, when mankind were but children in religious knowledge, they were blessed with the light of divine revelation wherever they were disposed to make a proper use of it.\n\nVery few, however, appear to have had this disposition; and therefore God was pleased to adopt Abraham and part of his posterity as the race from which the great Redeemer was to spring, to train them up by degrees in suitable notions of their Creator, and gradually to open up to them, as they were able to receive it, the nature of that dispensation under which “all the nations of the earth were to be blessed in the patriarch’s seed,” (see Prophecy, No. 13). For this purpose, he held frequent correspondence with them; and to strengthen and confirm their faith, to fix and preserve their dependence on the one God of heaven and earth, he daily gave them new promises, each more magnificent than that which preceded it. He blessed Isaac, miraculously increased his substance, and soon made him the envy of the neighbouring princes. He foretold the condition of his two sons, renewed the promise made to Abraham, and blessed the adopted son Jacob, with whom he condescended to converse as he had conversed with Abraham and Isaac; renewing to him the great promise; bestowing upon him all kinds of riches; and impressing such terror upon all the cities which were round about him as prevented them from hurting either him or his family.\n\nAll this was indeed little enough to keep alive even in the mind of Jacob a tolerable sense of duty and dependence on his Creator. After the first vision he is surprised, and hesitates, seemingly inclined to make a kind of stipulation with his Maker. “If (says he) God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God.” It appears not to have been till after many such revelations, blessings, and deliverances, and being reminded of the vow which on this occasion he had vowed, that he set himself in good earnest to perform the religion of his own family, and to drive out from it all strange gods*. So little able, in that age, were the boasted powers of the human mind to preserve in the world just notions of the unity of the Godhead, that we see there was a necessity for very frequent revelations, to prevent even the best men from running headlong into polytheism and idolatry.\n\nThus was God obliged to treat even with the patriarchs themselves, by way of positive covenant and express compact; to promise to be their God if they would be his people; to give them a portion of temporal blessings as introductory to future and spiritual ones; and to engage them in his service by immediate rewards, till they could be led on to higher views, and prepared by the bringing in of a better hope to worship him in spirit and in truth. With regard to what may be called the theory of religion, mankind were yet scarcely got out of their childhood. Some extraordinary persons indeed occasionally appeared in different countries, such as Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Job, with many others, who had a more enlarged prospect of things, and entertained more worthy sentiments of the divine dispensations and of the ultimate end of man; but these were far superior to the times in which they lived, and appear to have been providentially raised up to prevent the savage state and savage idolatry from becoming universal among men.\n\nThe worship which was practised by those holy men appears to have consisted principally of the three kinds archaic worship of sacrifice mentioned elsewhere (see Sacrifice); to ship of sacrifice which were doubtless added prayers and praises, with the ages performed in faith.\n\n(u) There are great disputes among the learned respecting the antiquity and the author of the book of Job, and whether it be a history of events, or a poem which has its foundation in history. All sober men, however, are agreed, that there really was such a person as Job, eminent for patience under uncommon sufferings; and that he was of very remote antiquity. The LXX. give us the names of his father and mother, and say that he was the fifth from Abraham.\nthe more valuable oblation of pure hands and devout hearts. Such of them as looked forward to a future redemption, and had any tolerable notion of the means by which it was to be effected, as Abraham certainly had, must have been sensible that the blood of bulls and of goats could never take away sin, and that their sacrifices were therefore valuable only when they were offered in faith of that great promise, \"which they, having seen it afar off, were persuaded of, and embraced; and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims upon earth.\"\n\nThat such persons looked for \"a better country, even a heavenly one,\" in a future state cannot be questioned; for they knew well how sin and death had entered into the world, and they must have underlaid the promise made to their original progenitor, and repeatedly renewed to themselves, to include in it a deliverance at some period from every consequence of the first transgression. They were to all intents and purposes Christians as well as we. They indeed placed their confidence in a Redeemer, who in the fulness of time was to appear upon earth, while we place ours in a Redeemer that has been already manifested; they expressed that confidence by one mode of worship, we express it by another; but the patriarchal worship had the same end in view with the Christian—the attainment of everlasting life in heaven.\n\nThe generality of men, however, appear not, in the early age of which we now write, to have extended their views beyond the present life. From the confused remains of ancient tradition, they acknowledged indeed some superior power or powers, to whom they frequently applied for direction in their affairs; but in all probability it was only for direction in temporal affairs, such as the cultivation of the ground, or their transactions with each other. In the then state of things, when no part of the world was overstocked with inhabitants, and when luxury with its consequences were everywhere unknown, virtue and vice must have produced their natural effects; and the good man being happy here, and the wicked man miserable, reason had no data from which to infer the reality of a future state of rewards and punishments. Those who were blest with the light of revelation undoubtedly looked forward to that state with a holy joy; but the rest worshipped superior powers from worldly motives. How many of those powers there might be, or how far their influence might reach, they knew not. Uncertain whether there be one Supreme Governor of the whole world, or many co-ordinate powers presiding each over a particular country, climate, or place—gods of the hills and of the valleys, as they were afterwards distinguished—they thought that the more of these they could engage in their interest the better. Like the Samaritans therefore, in after times, they fought, wherever they came, the \"manners of the god of the land,\" and served him, together with their own gods.\n\nThus was the world ready to lose all knowledge of the true God and his worship, had not he been graciously pleased to interpose, and take effectual care to preserve that knowledge in one nation, from which it might be conveyed to the rest of mankind at different times, and in greater or lesser degrees, as they should be capable of receiving it. To this purpose he made way for the removal of Jacob and his family to one of the most improved and polished countries of the world; and introduced them into it in a manner so advantageous, as to give them an opportunity of imparting much religious knowledge to the natives. The natives, however, were gross idolaters; and that his chosen people might be as far as possible from the contagion of their example, he placed them upon the borders of Egypt, where, though they multiplied exceedingly, they were by their very occupation still kept a separate people, and must have been rendered, by a long and severe oppression, in a great degree adverse to the manners and religion of their neighbours. This aversion, however, seems to have gradually become less and less; and before they were miraculously redeemed from their house of bondage, they had certainly lost all correct notions of the unity of God, and the nature of his worship, and had adopted the greater part of the superstitions of their task-masters. Of this we need no other proof than what is implied in the words of Moses, when he said unto God, \"Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, the God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say unto me, What is his name? and I say unto them, What shall I say unto them?\" Had not the defined lawgiver of the Hebrews been aware that his countrymen had adopted a plurality of gods, this difficulty could not have occurred to him; for names are never thought of but to distinguish from each other beings of the same kind; and he must have remembered, that in Egypt, where the multitude of gods was marshalled into various classes, the knowledge of their names was deemed of great importance. This we learn likewise from Herodotus, who informs us, that the Pelasgi, Lib. ii., after settling in Greece, thought it necessary to consult cap. 52, the oracle of Dodona, whether it would be proper to give to their own gods the names of the Egyptian divinities; and that the oracle, as might have been supposed, assured them that it would. Indeed the Hebrews during their residence in Egypt had acquired such an attachment to the idolatrous worship of the country, that it appears never to have left them entirely till many ages afterwards, when they were carried captive into Babylon, and severely punished for their repeated apostacies; and so completely were they infatuated by these superstitions at the era of their exodus, that, as the prophet Ezekiel informs us, they rebelled against God, ch. xxvii, and would not cast away their abominations, or forsake the idols of Egypt, even in the very day that the hand of Omnipotence was lifted up to bring them forth out of that land in which they had been so long and so cruelly oppressed. In such a state of things, to have suffered them to remain longer in Egypt, could have served no good purpose; and therefore to fulfill the promise which he had given to Abraham, God determined to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians by means which should convince both them and their offspring of his own supremacy over heaven and earth.\n\nAs Moses was the person appointed to deliver God's message to Pharaoh, and to demand of him leave for the Israelites to go three days journey into the wilderness to serve the God of their fathers, it was necessary that he should be endowed with the power of working miracles to evince the reality of his divine mission. Without a conviction that his claims were well founded, neither Pharaoh nor his own countrymen could reasonably have been expected to listen to the proposals of a man who, though blest in his youth with a princely education, had come directly on his embassy from the humble employment.\nTheology from the fall of Adam to the coming of Christ.\n\nThe ployment of a shepherd, which he had for many years exercised in the country of Midian. To prove that he was really sent by God, any visible and undoubted control of the laws of nature would have been abundantly sufficient; but he was to prove not only this truth, but also the unity of the Divine nature; and the miracles which he was directed to work were executions of judgments against the very gods of Egypt.\n\nWhen Pharaoh first turned a deaf ear to his request, though enforced by the conversion of a rod into a serpent, at the command of Jehovah he smote with the same rod upon the waters in the river, which were instantly converted into blood, and occasioned the death of all the fishes that swam in them. To any people this miracle would have been a proof of Divine agency; but it was in a particular manner calculated to open the eyes of the blind and infatuated Egyptians, who considered the Nile as one of their greatest gods, and all the fishes that it contained as subordinate divinities. They called that noble river sometimes Sirius, sometimes Ophir, sometimes Canopus (see Canopus), and not unfrequently Ωκεανος (x); and adored it as the parent of all their deities. What then must the people have thought when they found their most revered god, at the command of a servant of Jehovah, converted into blood, and all his sacred offspring into stinking carcasses? To conceive their consternation, if it can be conceived, the reader must remember, that the Egyptian priests held blood in the utmost abhorrence, as a thing of which the very touch would deeply pollute them, and require immediate and solemn expiation. The same sacred river was a second time polluted, when it sent forth frogs, which covered all the land of Egypt, and died in the housetops, in the villages, and in the fields; thus rendering it impossible for the people to avoid the touch of dead bodies, though from every such contact they believed themselves to contract an impurity, which, in the case before us, must have been the more grievous, that in the whole country there was not left a pool of uninfected water to wash away the stain.\n\nThe third plague inflicted on the Egyptians was, the converting of the dust of the land into lice, upon man and upon beast, throughout the whole kingdom. To see the propriety of this miracle as a judgement upon their idolatry, we must recollect their utter abhorrence of all kinds of vermin, and their extreme attention to external purity above every other people perhaps that has hitherto existed on the face of the earth. On this head they were more particularly solicitous when about to enter the temples of their gods; for Herodotus informs us, that their priests wore linen raiment only, and shaved off every hair from their heads and bodies, that there might be no lause or other detestable object upon them when performing their duty to the gods. This plague therefore, while it lasted, made it impossible for them to perform their idolatrous worship, without giving such offence to their deities as they imagined could never be forgiven. Hence we find, that on the production of the lice, the priests and magicians perceived immediately from what hand the miracle had come, and exclaimed, \"This is the finger of God!\" The fourth plague seems to have been likewise acknowledged to be the finger of God, if not by the magicians, at least by Pharaoh; for in a fit of terror he agreed that the Israelites should go and serve the Lord. That he was terrified at the swarm of flies which infested the whole country, except the land of Goshen, will excite no wonder, when it is known that the worship of the fly originated in Egypt; whence it was carried by the Caphtorim to Palestine; by the Phoenicians to Sidon, Tyre, and Babylon; and from these regions to other parts of the world. The denunciation of this plague was delivered to Pharaoh early in the morning, when he was on the banks of the Nile, probably paying his accustomed devotion to his greatest god; and when he found himself and his people tormented by a swarm of subordinate divinities, who executed the judgement of Jehovah in defiance of the power of the supreme numen of Egypt, he must have been convinced, had any candour remained in his mind, that the whole system of his superstition was a mas of absurdities, and that his gods were only humble instruments at the disposal of a Superior Power. He was not, however, convinced; he was only alarmed, and quickly relapsed into his wonted obduracy. The fifth plague therefore, the murrain among the cattle, brought death and destruction on his most revered gods themselves. Neither Osiris, nor Isis, nor Ammon, nor Pan, had power to save his brute representatives. The sacred bull, and heifer, and ram, and goat, were carried off by the same malady which swept away all the other herds of deities, these dii feroces, who lived on grass and hay. The impression of this punishment must have been awful on the minds of the Egyptians, but perhaps not equal to that which succeeded it.\n\nIn Egypt there were several altars on which human sacrifices were offered; and from the description of the persons qualified to be victims, it appears that those unhappy beings must have been foreigners, as they were required to have bright hair and a particular complexion. The hair of the Israelites was much brighter than that of the Egyptians, and their complexions fairer; and therefore there can be little doubt but that, during their residence in Egypt, they were made to furnish the victims demanded by the bloody gods. These victims being burnt alive on a high altar, and thus sacrificed for the good of the nation, their ashes were gathered together by the priests, and scattered upwards in the air, that a blessing might be entailed on every place to which an atom of this dust should be wafted. Moses too, by the direction of the true God, took ashes of the furnace, probably of one of those very furnaces in which some of his countrymen had been burnt, and sprinkling them towards heaven in the sight of Pharaoh, brought boils and blains upon all the people, of so malignant a nature, that the magicians and the other ministers of the medical gods, with which Egypt abounded beyond all other countries, could not themselves escape the infection.\n\nThe powers of darkness were thus foiled; but the heart of the monarch was still hardened. Destruction was therefore next brought on him and his country by the elements, which were among the earliest idol deities not\n\n(x) Whence came the Greek word Ωκεανος, the ocean.\nnot only of the Egyptians, but of every other polytheistic nation. \"The Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt; so that there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, such as there was none like it in all the land Egypt since it became a nation. And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.\" This was a dreadful calamity in itself; and the horror which it excited in the minds of the people must have been greatly aggravated by the well-known fact, that Egypt is blessed with a sky uncommonly serene; that in the greatest part of it rain has never been seen at any other time since the creation of the world; and that a flight and transient shower is the utmost that in the ordinary course of nature falls anywhere throughout the country. The small quantity of vegetables which was left undestroyed by the fire and the hail was afterwards devoured by locusts, which by a strong east wind were brought in such numbers from Arabia, where they abounded at all times, that they covered the whole face of the earth, and did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees, so that there remained not any green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through all the land of Egypt.\n\nThe ninth plague which the obstinacy of Pharaoh brought upon his country, whilst it severely punished the Egyptians for their cruelty to the Hebrews, struck at the very foundation of all idolatry. We have elsewhere shown, that the first objects of idolatrous worship were the contending powers of light and darkness (see Polytheism); and that the benevolent principle, or the power of light, was everywhere believed to maintain a constant superiority over the power of darkness. Such was the faith of the ancient Persians; and such, as a very learned writer has lately proved, was likewise the faith of the earlier Egyptians. It was therefore with wisdom truly divine, that God, to show the vanity of their imaginations, brought upon those votaries of light, who fancied themselves the offspring of the sun, a preternatural darkness, which, for three days, all the powers of their supreme deity, and his subordinate agents, could not dispel.\n\nThe tenth and last plague brought on this idolatrous people was more universally and severely felt than any which had preceded it. It was likewise, in some sense, an instance of the lex talionis, which requires an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, &c. Moses was commanded, at his first interview with Pharaoh, to say, \"Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son, even my first-born. Let my son go that he may serve me; and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy first-born.\" Before this threat was put in execution, every attempt was made to soften the hardened heart of the obdurate tyrant. The waters of his sacred river were turned into blood, and all the fishes that it contained slain; frogs were brought over all the land to pollute the people; the ministers of religion were rendered so impure by vermin, that they could not discharge their wonted offices; the animals most revered as gods, or emblems of gods, were cut off by a murrain; the elements, that were everywhere worshipped as divinities, carried through the land a devastation, which was completed by swarms of locusts; the ashes from the sacred furnace, which were thought to convey blessings whithersoever they were wafted, were made to communicate incurable diseases; a thick and preternatural darkness was spread over the kingdom, in defiance of the power of the great Osiris; and when the hearts of the people and their sovereign continued still obdurate, the eldest son in each family was slain, because they refused to let go Israel, God's first-born. From this universal petition the Israelites were preferred by sprinkling the door-pots of their houses with the blood of one of the animals adored in Egypt; a fact which, as it could not be unknown to Pharaoh or his subjects, ought to have convinced that people of the extreme absurdity of their impious superstitions. This effect it seems not to have had; but the death of the first-born produced the deliverance of the Hebrews; for when it was found that there was not a house where there was not one dead, \"Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and blest me also. And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men (Y).\" The wonted obstinacy of the monarch indeed very soon returned; and his subjects, forgetting the loss of their children, joined with him in a vain attempt to bring back to bondage the very people whom they had been thus urgent to send out of the land; but their attempt was defeated by Jehovah, and all who engaged in it drowned in the Red sea.\n\nThe God of Israel having thus magnified himself over the Egyptians and their gods, and rescued his people from bondage by such means as must not only have struck terror and astonishment into the whole land, but also have spread his name through all the countries which had any communication with that far-famed nation, proceeded to instruct and exercise the Hebrews for many years in the wilderness. He inculcated upon them Reason of the unity of the Godhead; gave them statutes and retaining judgements more righteous than those of any other nation; and by every method consistent with the freedom in the will of moral agency guarded them against the contagion of heresies, idolatry and polytheism. He sent his angel before them to keep them in the way, took upon himself the office of their supreme civil governor, and by his presence directed them in all their undertakings. He led them with repeated signs and wonders through the neighbouring nations, continued to try and discipline them.\n\n(y) For this account of the plagues of Egypt, we are indebted to the very valuable Observations on the subject published by Mr Bryant. We have not quoted the authorities by which the learned and pious author supports his opinions; because it is to be hoped, that for a fuller account of these important transactions the reader will have recourse to his work, of which we have given only a very brief abstract. For much of the preceding parts of this section, we acknowledge our obligations to Bishop Law's admirable discourse on the Several Dispensations of Revealed Religion.\nthem till they were tolerably attached to his government and established in his worship, and introduced them into the Promised Land when its inhabitants were ripe for destruction. At their entrance into it, he gave them a summary repetition of their former laws, with more such ordinances, both of a ceremonial and moral kind, as were both suited to their temper and circumstances, as well as to prefigure, and by degrees to prepare them for, a more perfect dispensation under the Messiah.\n\nThe Jewish law had two great objects in view; of which the first was to preserve among them the knowledge of the true God, a rational worship springing from that knowledge, and the regular practice of moral virtue: and the second was to fit them for receiving the accomplishment of the great promise made to their ancestors, by means analogous to those which a schoolmaster employs to fit his pupils for discharging the duties of mature years. Every thing in that law peculiar to itself, its various ceremonies, modes of sacrificing, the sanctions by which it was enforced, and the theocratic government by which it was administered, had a direct tendency to promote one or other of these ends; and keeping these ends in view, even the minutest laws, at which impious ignorance has affected to make itself merry, will be discovered by those who shall study the whole system, and are at the same time acquainted with the genius of ancient polytheism, to have been enacted with the most consummate wisdom.\n\nIt is not easy for us, who have been long blest with the light of revelation, to conceive the propensity of all nations, in that early age of the world, to the worship of false gods, of which they were daily adding to the number. It is indeed probable, from many passages of Scripture, as well as from profane authors of the greatest antiquity, that one supreme numen was everywhere acknowledged: but he was considered as an extraordinary being, too highly exalted to concern himself with the affairs of this world, the government of which, it was believed, he had delegated to various orders of subordinate deities. Of these deities, some were supposed to have the charge of one nation and some of another. Hence it is, that we read of the gods of Egypt, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the different nations around Palestine. None of these nations denied the existence of their neighbour's gods; but all agreed that while the Egyptians were the peculiar care of Osiris and Isis, the Amorites might be the favourites of Moloch, the Phoenicians of Cronus, and the Philistines of Dagon; and they had no objection occasionally to join with each other in the worship of their respective tutelary deities. Nay, it was thought impiety in foreigners, while they sojourned in a strange country, not to sacrifice to the gods of the place. Thus Sophocles makes Antigone say to her father, that a stranger should both venerate and abhor those things which are venerated and abhorred in the city where he resides; and another author*, who, though comparatively late, drew much of his information from ancient writings, which are now lost, affirms us, that this complaisance proceeded from the belief that the several parts of the world were from the beginning distributed to several powers, of which each had his peculiar allotment and residence.\"\n\nFrom this notion of local divinities, whose power or partial fondness was confined to one people, the Israelites, on their departure from Egypt, appear not to have been free (z). Hence it is, that when the true God first tells them, by their leader Moses†, that if they would obey his voice indeed and keep his covenant, then they should be a peculiar treasure to him above all people: to prevent them from supposing that he shared the earth with the idols of the heathen, and had from partial fondness chosen them for his portion, he immediately adds, for all the earth is mine. By this purpose of separation he gave them plainly to understand that they were chosen to be his peculiar treasure for some purpose other than general importance; and the very first article of the covenant which they were to keep was, that they should have no other gods but him. So inveterate, however, was the principle which led to an intercommunity of the objects of worship, that they could not have kept this article of the covenant but in a state of separation from the rest of mankind‡; and that separation could neither have been effected nor continued without the visible providence of the Almighty watching over them as his peculiar treasure. This we learn from Moses himself, who, when interceding for the people after their idolatrous worship of the golden calf, and intreating that the presence of God would still accompany them, adds these words §: \"For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? Is it not in that thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are on the face of the earth.\" On this separation every thing depended; and therefore to render it the more secure, Jehovah was graciously pleased to become likewise their supreme Magistrate, making them a \"kingdom of priests and a holy nation,\" and delivering to them a digest as well of their civil as of their religious laws.\n\nThe Almighty thus becoming their King, the government of their Israelites was properly a theocracy, in which the two societies, civil and religious, were of course incorporated. They had indeed after their settlement in the Promised Land, at first, temporary judges occasionally raised up; and afterwards permanent magistrates called kings, to lead their armies in war, and to give vigour to the administration of justice in peace: but neither these judges nor these kings could abrogate a single law of the original code, or make the smallest addition to it but by the spirit of prophecy. They cannot\n\n(z) It is not indeed evident that they had got entirely quit of this absurd opinion at a much later period. Jephtha, one of their judges, who, though half organized (as Warburton observes) by a bad education, had probably as correct notions of religion as an ordinary Israelite, certainly talked to the king of Ammon as if he had believed the different nations of the earth to be under the immediate protection of different deities: \"Wilt not thou (says he) possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess! So whosoever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.\" (Judges xi. 24.)\nnot therefore be considered as supreme magistrates, by whatever title they may have been known; for they were to go out and come in at the word of the priests, who were to ask counsel for them of the Lord, and with whom they were even associated in all judicial proceedings, as well of a civil as of a spiritual nature*. Under any other than a theocratic government the Hebrews could not have been kept separate from the nations around them; or if they could, that separation would not have answered the great purpose for which it was established. \"The people, on their leaving Egypt, were sunk into the lowest practices of idolatry. To recover them by the discipline of a separation, it was necessary that the idea of God and his attributes should be impressed upon them in the most sensible manner. But this could not be commodiously done under his character of God of the universe: under his character of King of Israel, it well might. Hence it is, that we find him in the Old Testament so frequently represented with affections analogous to human passions. The civil relation in which he stood to the Israelites made such a representation natural; the grossness of their conceptions made the representation necessary; and the guarded manner in which it was always qualified prevented it from being mischievous†.\" Hence too it is, that under the Mosaic dispensation, idolatry was a crime of state, punishable by the civil magistrate. It was indeed high treason, against which laws were enacted on the juttest principles, and carried into effect without danger of error. Nothing less indeed than penal laws of the severest kind could have restrained the violent propensity of that headstrong people to worship, together with their own God, the gods of the Heathen. But penal laws enacted by human authority for errors in religion are manifestly unjust; and therefore a theocratic government seems to have been absolutely necessary to obtain the end for which the Israelites were separated from the surrounding nations.\n\nIt was for the same purpose that the ritual law was given, after their presumptuous rebellions in the wilderness. Before the buffaloes of the golden calf, and their frequent attempts to return into Egypt, it seems not to have been the Divine intention to lay on them a yoke of ordinances; but to make his covenant depend entirely on their duly practising the rite of circumcision; observing the festivals instituted in commemoration of their deliverance from bondage, and other signal services vouchsafed them; and keeping inviolate all the precepts of the decalogue (a), which, if they had done, they should have even lived in them†. But after their repeated apostacies, and impious wishes to mix with the surrounding nations, it was necessary to subject them to a multifarious ritual, of which the ceremonial parts were solemn and splendid, fitted to engage and fix the attention of a people whose hearts were gross; to inspire them with reverence, and to withdraw their affections from the pageantry of those idle superstitions which they had so long winneffed in the land of Egypt.\n\nTo keep them warmly attached to their public worship, that worship was loaded with opulent and magnificent rites, and so completely incorporated with their civil polity as to make the same things at once duties of religion and acts of state. The service of God was indeed so ordered as to be the constant business as well as entertainment of their lives, supplanting the place of all other entertainments; and the sacrifices which they were commanded to offer on the most solemn occasions, were of such animals as the Egyptians and other Heathens deemed sacred.\n\nThus a heifer without blemish was in Egypt held sanctified to the goddess Isis, and worshipped as the representative of that divinity; but the same kind of heifer, by the ritual law of the Hebrews commanded to be burnt without the camp, as the vilest animal, and the water of separation to be prepared from her ashes*. Num. xii; The goat was by the Egyptians held in great veneration as emblematical of their ancient god Pan, and sacrifices of the most abominable kind were offered to the impure animal (see PAN); but God, by his servant Moses, enjoined the Israelites to offer goats themselves as sacrifices for sin, and on one occasion to dismiss the live animal loaded with maledictions into the wilderness†. The Egyptians, with singular zeal, worshipped a calf without blemish as the symbol of Apis, or the god of fertility; and it appears from the book of Exodus, that the Israelites themselves had been infected with that superstition. They were, however, so far from being permitted by their Divine lawgiver to consider that animal as sacred, that their priests were commanded to offer for themselves a young calf as a sin-offering†. No animal was in Egypt held in greater reverence than the ram, the symbol of their god Ammon, one of the constellations. It was therefore with wisdom truly divine, that Jehovah, at the institution of the passover, ordered his people to kill and eat a young ram on the very day that the Egyptians began their annual solemnities § in honour of that animal as one of their greatest gods; and that he enjoined the blood of this divine victimity to be sprinkled as a sign on the two side-panels and upper door-post of the house in which he was eaten, cap. iv.\n\nSurely it is not in the power of imagination to conceive a ritual better calculated to cure the Israelites of their propensity to idol worship, or to keep them separate from the people who had first given them that propensity, than one which enjoined them to offer in sacrifice the very creatures which their superstitious matters had worshipped as gods. \"Shall we (said Moses) sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not flume us?\"\n\nBut it was not against Egyptian idolatry only that the ritual law was framed: the nations of Syria, in the midst of whom the Israelites were to dwell, were addicted to many cruel and absurd superstitions, against which it was necessary to guard the people of God as against the brute-worship of Egypt. We need not inform any reader of the book of Moses that those nations worshipped\n\n---\n\n(a) Of these precepts we think it not necessary, in an abstract so short as this, to waste the reader's time with a formal and laboured defence. To the decalogue no objection can be made by any man who admits the obligations of natural religion; for, except the observation of the Sabbath-day, it enjoins not a single duty which does not by the confession of all men result from our relations to God, ourselves, and our fellow-creatures.\nTheology ped the sun and moon and all the host of heaven; or that it was part of their religion to propitiate their offended gods by occasionally sacrificing their sons and their daughters. From such worship and sacrifices the Israelites were prohibited under the severest penalties; but we cannot consider that prohibition as making part of the ritual law, since it relates to practices impious and immoral in themselves, and therefore declared to be abominations to the Lord. The Phoenicians, however, and the Canaanites, entertained an opinion that every child came into the world with a polluted nature, and that this pollution could be removed only by a lufrat fire. Hence they took their new-born infants, and with particular ceremonies made them pass through the flame of a pile sacred to Baal or Moloch, the symbols of their great god the sun. Sometimes this purgation was delayed till the children had arrived at their tenth or twelfth year, when they were made either to leap through the flame, or run several times backwards and forwards between two contiguous sacred fires; and this lustration was supposed to free them from every natural pollution, and to make them through life the peculiar care of the deity in whose honour it was performed.\n\nThe true God, however, who would have no fellowship with idols, forbade all such purifications among his people, whether done by fires consecrated to himself or to the bloody deities of the Syrian nations. \"There shall not be found (says he) among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire.\"\n\nThere are, in the Jewish law, few precepts more frequently repeated than that which prohibits the feeding of a kid in its mother's milk; and there being no moral fitness in this precept when considered absolutely and without regard to the circumstances under which it was given, infidel ignorance has frequently thought fit to make it the subject of profane ridicule. But the ridicule will be forborne by those who know that, among the nations round Judea, the feeding on a kid boiled in its mother's milk was an essential part of the impious and magical ceremonies celebrated in honour of one of their gods, who was supposed to have been suckled by a she-goat. Hence, in the Samaritan Pentateuch, the text runs thus: \"Thou shalt not feed a kid in its mother's milk; for whoever does so, is as one who sacrifices an abominable thing, which offends the God of Jacob.\"\n\nAnother precept, apparently of very little importance, is given in these words: \"Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.\" But its wisdom is seen at once, when we know that at funerals it was the practice of many of the heathens, in that early period, to round the corners of their heads, and mar their beards, that by throwing the hairs they had cut off on the dead body, or the funeral pile, they might propitiate the shade of the departed hero; and that in other nations, particularly in Phoenicia, it was customary to cut off all the hair of their heads except what grew on the crown, which, with great solemnity, was consecrated either to the sun or to Saturn. The unlearned Christian, if he be a man of reflection, must read with some degree of wonder such laws as these: \"Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds, lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown and the fruits of thy vineyard be defiled. Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together. Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, or of woollen and linen together.\" But his wonder will cease when he knows that all these were practices from which the Sabian idolaters of the east expected the coming of greatest advantages. Their belief in magic and judicial astrology led them to imagine, that by sowing different kinds of corn among their vines they should propitiate the gods which were afterwards known in Rome by the names of Bacchus and Ceres; that, by yoking animals to heterogeneous as the ox and the ass in the same plough, they should by a charm secure the favour of the deities who presided over the affairs of husbandry; and that a garment composed of linen and woollen, worn under certain conjunctions of the stars, would protect its owner, his flocks, his herds, and his field, from all malign influences, and render him in the highest degree prosperous through the whole course of his life. But magical ceremonies were always performed in order to render propitious good or evil demons (see Magic), and therefore such ceremonies, however unimportant in themselves, were in that age most wisely prohibited in the Mosaic law, as they naturally led those who were addicted to them to the worship of idols and impure spirits.\n\nIf the whole ritual of the Jewish economy be examined in this manner, every precept in it will be found to be directed against some idolatrous practice of the age in which it was given. It was therefore admirably calculated to keep the Israelites a separate people, and to prevent too close an intercourse between them and their Gentile neighbours. The distinction made by their law between clean and unclean animals (see Slavery, No. 33) rendered it impossible for them, without a breach of that law, to eat and drink with their idolatrous neighbours; their sacred and civil ceremonies being directly levelled against the Egyptian, Zabian, and Canaanitish superstitions, had a tendency to generate in their minds a contempt of those superstitions; and that contempt must have been greatly increased by their yearly, monthly, and daily sacrifices, of the very animals which their Egyptian masters had worshipped as gods.\n\nThat these laws might have the fuller effect on minds grofs and carnal, they were all enforced by temporal functions. Hence it is that Moses assured them, that if by temporal they would hearken to God's judgements, and keep all them, and do them, they should be blest above all nations; threatening them at the same time with utter destruction if they should at all walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them. Nor were these temporal rewards and punishments held out only to the nation as a collective body; they were promised and threatened to every individual in his private capacity as the certain consequences of his obedience or disobedience. Every particular Hebrew was commanded to honour his father and mother, that it might go well with him, and that his days might be prolonged; whilst he who cursed his father or his mother was surely to be put to death. Against every idolater, and even against the wilful transgressor of the ceremonial law, God repeatedly declared that he would set his face, and would cut off that man from among his people; and that individuals, as well as the nation, were in this life actually rewarded and punished according to their deserts, has been proved by Bishop Warburton. Indeed the Mo.\nTheology saith law, taken in its literal sense, holds out no other prospect to the Israelites than temporal happiness; such as, health, long life, peace, plenty, and dominion, if they should keep the covenant; and temporal misery, viz. disease, immature death, war, famine, want, subjection, and captivity, if they should break it. \"See (says Moses), I have set before thee this day life and good, death and evil; in that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply; and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it. But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over Jordan to possess it.\" And elsewhere, having informed them that, upon their apostacy, their land should be rendered like Sodom and Gomorrah, he adds, that all men should know the reason of such barrenness being brought upon it, and should say, \"Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, the anger of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book.\"\n\nFrom this fact, which scarcely any man of letters will venture to deny, some divines have concluded, that the ancient Israelites had no hope whatever beyond the grave; and that in the whole Old Testament there is not a single intimation of a future state. That many of the lower classes, who could neither read nor write, were in this state of darkness, may be true; but it is impossible that those who understood the book of Genesis could be ignorant that death came into the world by the transgression of their first parents, and that God had repeatedly promised to redeem mankind from every consequence of that transgression. They must likewise have known that, before the deluge, Enoch was translated into heaven without tasting death; that afterwards Elijah had the same exemption from the common lot of humanity; and that, as God is no respecter of persons, every one who served him with the zeal and fidelity of these two prophets would, by some means or other, be made capable of enjoying the same rewards. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, was not the God of the dead, but of the living.\n\nIn the earliest periods of their commonwealth, the Israelites could, indeed, only infer, from different passages of their sacred books, that there would be a general resurrection of the dead, and a future state of rewards and punishments; but from the writings of the prophets it appears, that before the Babylonish captivity that doctrine must have been very generally received. In the Psalms, and in the prophecies of Isaiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel, there are several texts which seem to us to prove, incontrovertibly, that, at the time when these inspired books were written, every Israelite who could read the scriptures must have had some hopes of a resurrection from the dead. We shall consider two of these texts, because they have been quoted by a very learned and valuable writer in support of an opinion the reverse of ours.\n\nIn a sublime song, composed with a view to incite the people to confidence in God, the prophet Isaiah has these remarkable words; \"Thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.\" We agree with Bishop Warburton that these words are figurative, and that they were uttered to give the Israelites consolation in very distressful times. The purpose of the prophet was to assure them, that though scattered, their community should, in Babylon, be as completely dispersed as a dead body reduced to dust; yet God would restore them to their own land, and raise that community again to life. This was indeed a prophecy only of a temporal deliverance; but as it is expressed in terms relating to the death and resurrection of man, the doctrine of a resurrection must then have been well known, and generally received, or such language would have been altogether unintelligible.\n\nThe prophet Ezekiel, when the state of things was most desperate, is carried by the Spirit into a valley full of dry bones, and asked this question; \"Son of man, can these bones live?\" To which he answers; \"O Lord God, thou knowest.\" He was not asked if all the dead would rise at the last day; but only if the particular bones then presented to him could live at that time; and while other bones were mouldering in corruption; and to such a question we cannot conceive any answer that a man brought up in the belief of a general resurrection could have given, but—\"O Lord God, thou knowest.\" Had Ezekiel been a stranger to the doctrine of a general resurrection, or had he not believed that doctrine, he would doubtless have answered the question that was put to him in the negative; but convinced that all men are at some period to rise from the dead, \"that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,\" he very naturally said, that God alone knew whether the bones then exhibited to him in the valley would rise before the general resurrection.\n\nBut though the more intelligent and righteous Israelites certainly \"all died in faith, and not having re-ceived the promises, but having seen them afar off, were persuaded of them and embraced them, confessing that they were strangers and pilgrims on earth, who desired a better country, that is, a heavenly one,\" they are not to suppose that this heavenly desire arose from any thing taught in the law of Moses. That law, when taken by itself, as unconnected with prior and subsequent revelations, makes no mention whatever of a heavenly inheritance, which St Paul assures us § was given Gal. iii. 430 years before to Abraham by a promise which may be traced back to the first ray of comfort vouchsafed to fallen man in the sentence passed on the original deceiver. \"Wherefore then served the law? It was added (says the apostle), because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made.\" The transgressions here alluded to were polytheism and idolatry, which, with a train of cruel and detestable vices, had overspread the whole world; and the primary intention of the law was to stem the torrent of these corruptions, for which we have seen it was admirably calculated; and, like a schoolmaster, to instruct the Israelites in the unity and worship of Jehovah, and thus by degrees bring them to Christ.\nBut though it is apparent that a future state of rewards and punishments made no part of the Mosaic dispensation, yet the law had certainly a spiritual meaning to be understood when the fulness of time should come.\n\nEvery Christian sees a striking resemblance between the sacrifice of the paschal lamb, which delivered the Israelites from the destroying angel in Egypt, and the sacrifice of the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. Indeed the whole ritual of sacrifice must have led the more intelligent of them to faith in a future sacrifice; by which, while the heel of the seed of the woman should be bruised, the head of the serpent should be completely crushed (see Sacrifice); and as prophets were raised up from time to time, to prepare them for the coming of the Messiah, and to foretell the nature of his kingdom, there can be no doubt but that those inspired teachers would lay open to them, as far as was expedient, the temporary duration of the Mosaic law, and convince them that it was only the shadow of better things to come. From the nature of their ritual, and the different prophecies vouchsafed them, which became more and more explicit as the time approached for their accomplishment, they must surely have been led to expect redemption from the curse of the fall by the sufferings of their Messiah; but that any one of them knew precisely the manner in which they were to be redeemed, and the nature of that religion which was to supercede their own, is wholly incredible. Such knowledge would have made them impatient under the yoke of ordinances to which they were subjected; for after the Christian faith came into full splendour, mankind could be no longer under the tuition of such a schoolmaster as the law, which \"had only a shadow of good things; and so far from their reality, not even the very image of them.\" Through these shadows, however, the Jews, aided by the clearer light of prophecy, though it too shone in a dark place, might have seen enough of God's plan of redemption to make them acknowledge Jesus of Nazareth, when he came among them working miracles of mercy, for the Messiah so long promised to their forefathers, and in whom it was repeatedly said, that all the nations of the earth should be blessed.\n\nWhile such care was taken to prepare the descendants of Abraham for the coming of the Prince of Peace, we must not suppose that God was a respecter of persons, and that the rest of the world was totally neglected. The dispersion of the ten tribes certainly contributed to spread the knowledge of the true God among the eastern nations. The subsequent captivity of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin must have confirmed that knowledge in the great empires of Babylon and Persia; and that particular providence of God which afterwards led Ptolemy Philadelphus to have the Jewish scriptures translated into the Greek language, laid the divine oracles open to the study of every accomplished scholar. At last, when the arms of Rome had conquered the civilized world, and rendered Judea a province of the empire; when Augustus had given peace to that empire, and men were at leisure to cultivate the arts and sciences; when the different sects of philosophers had by their disputations whetted each other's understandings, so that none of them was disposed to submit to an imposture; and when the police of the Roman government was such that intelligence of every thing important was quickly transmitted from the most distant provinces to the capital of the empire; \"when that fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons,\" and be restored to that inheritance of which the forfeiture introduced the several dispensations of revealed religion into the world.\n\nSect. V. View of Theology more peculiarly Christian.\n\nMankind being trained by various dispensations of providence for the reception of Jesus Christ, and the time fixed by the prophets for his coming being arrived, \"a messenger was sent before his face to prepare his way before him by preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.\" This messenger was John the Baptist, a very extraordinary man, and the greatest of all the prophets. His birth was miraculous, the scene of his ministry the wilderness, his manners austere, and his preaching upright, without respect of persons. He frankly told his audience that he was not the Messiah, that the Messiah would soon appear among them, that \"he was mightier than himself, and that he would baptise them with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\"\n\nMightier indeed he was; for though born, of a woman the Messiah was not the son of a human father; and though living for the first thirty years of his life in obscurity and poverty, he was the lineal descendant of David, and heir to the throne of Israel. But the dignity of his human descent, great as it was, vanishes from consideration when compared with the glory which he had with his Father before the world was. The Jewish dispensation was given by the ministry of Moses; and illustrated by subsequent revelations vouchsafed to the prophets; the immediate author of the Christian religion is the Logos or the second person of the blessed Trinity, of whom St. John declares, that \"he was in the beginning with God, and was God; that all things were made by him; and that without him was not any thing made that was made.\" We have already proved that in the one Godhead there is a Trinity of persons; and that the Logos is one of the three, is apparent from these words of the apostle, and from many other passages of sacred scripture. Thus he is called the Lord of hosts himself; the first and the last, besides whom there is no God; the most high God; God blest for ever; the mighty God, the everlasting Father, Jehovah our righteousness; and the only wise God our Saviour (b). This great Being, as the same apostle affirms us, was made flesh, and dwelt among men; not that the divine nature was or could be changed into humanity, for God is immutable, the same almighty and incomprehensible Spirit,\n\n(b) Isaiah viii. 13, 14. compared with 1 Peter ii. 7, 8.; Isaiah vi. 5. compared with John xii. 41.; Isaiah xlviv. 6. compared with Revelation xxii. 13.; Psalm lxxviii. 56. compared with 1 Corinthians x. 9. Romans ix. 5. Isaiah ix. 6. Jeremiah xxiii. 6. Jude.\nTheology Spirit yesterday, today, and forever; but the Word or second person in the godhead, assuming a human soul and body into a personal union with himself, dwelt upon earth as a man, veiling his divinity under mortal flesh. Hence he is said elsewhere to have been \"manifested in the flesh,\" and \"to have taken upon him the nature of man;\" phrases of the same import with that which affirms \"the Word to have been made flesh.\"\n\nThis incarnation of the Son of God is perhaps the greatest mystery of the Christian faith, and that to which ancient and modern heretics have urged the most plausible objections. The doctrine of the Trinity is indeed equally incomprehensible; but the nature of God and the mode of his subsistence, as revealed in scripture, no man, who thinks, can be surprised that he does not comprehend; for a revelation which should teach nothing mysterious on such a subject would be as incredible and as useless as another which contained nothing but mystery. The difficulty respecting the incarnation, which forces itself on the mind, is not how two natures so different as the divine and human can be so intimately united as to become one person; for this union in itself is not more inconceivable than that of the soul and body in one man; but that which at first is apt to stagger the faith of the reflecting Christian is the infinite distance between the two natures in Christ, and the comparatively small importance of the object, for the attainment of which the eternal Son of God is said to have taken on him our nature.\n\nUpon mature reflection, however, much of this difficulty will vanish to him who considers the ways of Providence, and attends to the meaning of the words in which this mystery is taught. The importance of the object for which the Word condescended to be made flesh, we cannot adequately know. The oracles of truth indeed inform us, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; but there are parables scattered through the New Testament which indicate, not obscurely, that the influence of his sufferings extends to other worlds besides this; and if so, who can take on him to say, that the quantity of good which they may have produced was not of sufficient importance to move even to this condescension a Being who is emphatically styled LOVE?\n\nBut let us suppose that every thing which he did and taught and suffered was intended only for the benefit of man, we shall, in the daily administration of providence, find other instances of the divine condescension; which, though they cannot be compared with the incarnation of the second person in the blest Trinity, are yet sufficient to reconcile our understandings to that mystery when revealed to us by the Spirit of God. That in Christ there should have dwelt on earth \"all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,\" is indeed a truth by which the devout mind is overwhelmed with astonishment; but it is little less astonishing that the omnipotent Creator should be intimately present at every instant of time to the meanest of his creatures, \"upholding all things, the vilest reptile as well as the most glorious angel, by the word of his power.\" Yet it is a truth self-evident, that without this constant presence of the Creator, nothing which had a beginning could continue one moment in being; that the visible universe would not only crumble into chaos, but vanish into nothing; and that the souls of men, and even the most exalted spirits of creation, would instantly lose that existence, which, as it was not of itself, and is not necessary, must depend more peculiarly on the will of Him from whom it was originally derived. See Metaphysics, No. 272-276, and Providence, No. 3.\n\nIn what particular way God is present to his works, we cannot know. He is not diffused through the universe like the anima mundi of the ancient Platonists, or that modern idol termed the substratum of space (Metaphysics, No. 309, 310); but that he is in power as intimately present now to every atom of matter as when he first brought it into existence, is equally the dictate of sound philosophy and of divine revelation; for \"in him we live and move and have our being;\" and power without subsistence is inconceivable. If then the divine nature be not debased, if it cannot be debased by being constantly present with the vilest reptile on which we tread, why should our minds recoil from the idea of a still closer union between the second person of the ever blest Trinity and the body and soul of Jesus Christ? The one union is indeed different from the other, but we are in truth equally ignorant of the nature of both. Reason and revelation assure us that God must be present to his works to preserve them in existence; and revelation informs us farther, that one of the persons in the Godhead assumed human nature into a personal union with himself, to redeem myriads of rational creatures from the miserable consequences of their own folly and wickedness. The importance of this object is such, that, for the attainment of it, we may easily conceive that he who condescends to be potentially present with the worms of the earth and the grass of the field, would condescend still farther to be personally present with the foulest foul and body of a man. Jesus Christ lived indeed a life of poverty and suffering upon earth, but his divine nature was not affected by his sufferings. At the very time when, as a man, he had not a place where to lay his head; as God, he was in heaven as well as upon earth, dwelling in light inaccessible; and while, as a man, he was increasing in wisdom and stature, his divinity was the fulness of him who filleth all in all, and from whom nothing can be hid.\n\nPerhaps the very improper appellation of mother of God, which at an early period of the church was given to the Virgin Mary, may have been one cause of the reluctance with which the incarnation has been admitted; for as we have elsewhere observed (see Nestorius), such language, in the proper sense of the words, implies what those, by whom it is used, cannot possibly believe to be true; but it is not the language of scripture. We are there taught, that \"Christ being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God; but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of man;\" that \"God sent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons;\" and that \"the Word who was in the beginning with God, and was God, by whom all things were made, was made flesh, and dwelt among men (who beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth;\" but we are nowhere taught that, as God, he had a mother! It was Hey's indeed the doctrine of the primitive church, that the Sermion on very principle of personality and individual existence in the incarnation of Mary's\nTheology\n\nMary's son, was union with the uncreated word; and this doctrine is thought to imply the miraculous conception, which is recorded in the plainest terms by two of the evangelists; for he was conceived by the Holy Ghost and born of a virgin*; but, as God, he had been begotten from all eternity of the Father, and in order of nature was prior to the Holy Ghost. This is evident from the appellation of ἀνάγκη given to him by St John; for the term being used in that age, both by the Jewish rabbies and the heathen philosophers, to denote the second divine subsistence, which they considered as an eternal and necessary emanation from the first, sometimes called ἀνάγκης and sometimes τὸ ἐξ ἀνάγκης; and the apostle giving no intimation of his using the word in any uncommon sense, we must necessarily conclude, that he meant to inform us that the divinity of Christ is of eternal generation. That the term ἀνάγκης was used in this sense by the later Platonists, and in all probability by Plato himself, we have sufficiently thrown in another place (see Platonism); and that a similar mode of expression prevailed among the Jews in the time of St John, is apparent from the Chaldee paraphrase; which, in the 110th psalm, instead of the words \"the Lord said unto my Lord,\" has, \"the Lord said unto his Word.\" Again, where we are told in the Hebrew that Jehovah said to Abraham †, \"I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward,\" we read in the Chaldee, \"my Word is thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.\" Where it is said, \"your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth,\" the paraphrast hath it, \"my Word hateth;\" and where it is said, that \"Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation §,\" in the same paraphrase it is, \"Israel shall be saved by the Word of the Lord with everlasting salvation.\" But there is a passage in the Jerusalem Targum which puts it beyond a doubt, that by the ἀνάγκης the Jews understood a divine person begotten of his Father before all worlds; for commenting on Genesis iii. 22, the authors of that work thus express themselves: \"The word of the Lord said, behold Adam, whom I created, is the only begotten upon earth, as I am the only begotten in heaven:\" in conformity with which, Philo introduces || the Logos speaking thus of himself; ὁ λόγος ἐλεύθερος ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ, ὁ λόγος ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ. I am neither unbegotten, as God, nor begotten after the same manner as you are.\n\nOrthodoxy of the Nicean creed.\n\n(c) We beg leave to recommend to our readers this author's excellent exposition of the apostle's creed, as a work which will render them great affluence in acquiring just notions of the fundamental articles of the Christian faith. They will find it, we think, a complete antidote against the poison of modern Unitarians and modern Trinitarians; of whom the former teach that Jesus Christ was a mere man, the son of Joseph as well as of Mary; while the latter, running to the other extreme, maintain, that, with respect to his divinity, he is in no sense subordinate to the Father, but might have been the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost, according to the good pleasure of the eternal three. We have been at some pains to prove his divinity, and likewise his eternal generation; but in such a short compend as we must give, it seems not to be worth while to prove his miraculous conception. That miracle is plainly affected in the New Testament in words void of all ambiguity; and as it is surely as easy for God to make a man of the substance of a woman as of the dust of the earth, we cannot conceive what should have induced any person professing Christianity to call it in question. The natural generation of Christ is a groundless fancy, which can serve no purpose whatever, even to the Unitarians.\nwhile they improved that of their neighbours. Hence, by the time that Christ came among them, they had made the word of God of none effect through a number of idle fancies which they inculcated on the people as the traditions of the elders; and as they had attached themselves to different matters in philosophy, their unauthorized opinions were of course different according to the different sources whence they were drawn. The peculiar tenets of the Essenes seem to have been a species of mystic Platonism. The Pharisees are thought to have derived their origin from a Jewish philosopher of the Peripatetic school; and the resemblance between the doctrines of the Sadducees and the philosophy of Epicurus has escaped no man's observation.\n\nThough these sects maintained mutual communion in public worship, they abhorred each other's distinguishing tenets; and their wranglings had nearly banished from them every sentiment of true religion. They agreed, however, in the general expectation of the Messiah promised to their fathers; but, unhappily for themselves, expected him as a great and temporal prince. To this mistake several circumstances contributed: some of their prophets had foretold his coming in lofty terms, borrowed from the ritual law, and the splendor of earthly monarchs. The necessity of casting this veil over those living oracles we have thrown in another place (see Prophecy, No. 17.). At the time when the predictions were made, the Mosaic system had not run out half its course, and was therefore not to be exposed to popular contempt by an information that it was only the harsh rudiment of one more easy and perfect. To prevent, however, all mistakes in the candid and impartial, when the Messiah should arrive with the credentials of miraculous powers, other prophets had described him in the clearest terms as having no form nor comeliness, as a sheep dumb before his shearers, and as a lamb brought to the slaughter; but the Jews had suffered so much from the Chaldeans, the Greeks, and other nations by whom they had been conquered, and were then suffering so much from their masters the Romans, that they could think of no deliverance greater than that which should rescue their nation from every foreign yoke.\n\nWhat men earnestly wish to be true, they readily believe. Hence that people, being fitted of the yoke under which they and the whole human race were brought by the fall of Adam, mistaking the sense of the blessing promised to all nations through the seed of Abraham, and devoting their whole attention to the most magnificent descriptions of the Messiah's kingdom, expected in him a prince who should conquer the Romans, and establish on earth a universal monarchy, of which Jerusalem was to be the metropolis.\n\nAs our Saviour came for a very different purpose, the first object of his mission was to rectify the notions of his erring countrymen, in order to fit them for the deliverance which they were to obtain through him. Accordingly, when he entered on his office as a preacher of righteousness, he embraced every opportunity of inveighing against the false doctrines taught as traditions of the elders; and by his knowledge of the secrets of all hearts, he exposed the vile hypocrisy of those who made a gain of godliness. The Jews had been led, by their separation from the rest of the world, to consider themselves as the peculiar favourites of Jehovah; and the consequence was, that, contrary to the spirit of their own law, and the explicit doctrines of some of their prophets, they looked on all other nations with abhorrence, as on people physically impure. These prejudices all mankind as the objects of love*. The importance in which Moses held the ritual law, and to which, as x. 25—38, the means of preserving its votaries from the contagion of idolatry, it was justly intitled, had led the Jews to consider every ceremony of it as of intrinsic value and perpetual obligation: but Jesus brought to their recollection God's declared preference of mercy to sacrifice; shewed them that the weightier matters of the law, judgement, mercy, and faith, claimed their regard in the first place, and its ceremonial observances only in the second; and taught them, in conformity with the predictions of their own prophets†, that the hour was about to come when the worship of God should not xxxi. 31, be confined to Jerusalem, but that \"true worshippers &c. should everywhere worship the Father in spirit and in truth.\"*\n\nIt being the design of Christ's coming into the world to break down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and Gentiles, and to introduce a new dispensation of religion which should unite all mankind as brethren in the worship of the true God, and fit them for the enjoyment of heaven; he did not content himself with merely restoring the moral part of the Mosaic law to its primitive purity, disencumbered of the corrupt gloffes of the Scribes and Pharisees, but added to it many spiritual precepts, which, till they were taught by him, had never occurred either to Jew or Gentile. The Hebrew lawgiver had prohibited murder under the penalty of death; but Christ extended the prohibition to caulefs anger, and to contemptuous treatment of our brethren, commanding his followers, as they valued their everlasting salvation, to forgive their enemies, and to love all mankind. Adultery was forbidden by the law of Moses as a crime of the deepest dye; but Jesus said to his disciples, \"that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart,\" and is of course liable to the Divine vengeance. The lex talionis was in force among the Jews, so that the man who had deprived his neighbour of an eye or a tooth, was to suffer the loss of an eye or a tooth himself; but this mode of punishment, which inflicted blemish for blemish, though suited to the hardness of Jewish hearts, being inconsistent with the mild spirit of Christianity, was abolished by our blest Lord, who severely prohibited the indulgence of revenge, and commanded his followers to love even their enemies. Perjury has in every civilized nation been justly considered as a crime of the highest atrocity, and the Mosaic law doomed the false witness to bear the punishment, whatever it might be, which he intended by swearing falsely to bring on his brother; but the Author of the Christian religion forbade not only false swearing, but swearing at all, except on solemn occasions, and when an oath should be required by legal authority. See OATH.\n\nBy thus restoring the law to its original purity, and\nin many cases extending its sense, the blessed Jesus executed the office of a Prophet to the lost sheep of the house of Israel; but had he not been more than an ordinary prophet, he could not have abrogated the most trivial ceremony of it, nor even extended the sense of any of its moral precepts; for their great lawgiver had told them, that \"the Lord their God would raise up unto them but one Prophet, like unto him, to whom they should hearken.\" That Prophet was by themselves understood to be the Messiah, whom they expected to tell them all things. It was necessary therefore that Jesus, as he taught some new doctrines, and plainly indicated that greater changes would soon be introduced, should vindicate his claim to that exalted character which alone could authorise him to propose innovations. This he did in the simplest manner, by fulfilling prophecies and working miracles (see Miracle and Prophecy); so that the unprejudiced part of the people readily acknowledged him to be of a truth \"that prophet which should come into the world—the Son of God, and the King of Israel.\" He did not, however, make any change in the national worship, or assume to himself the smallest civil authority. He had submitted to the rite of circumcision, and strictly performed every duty, ceremonial as well as moral, which that covenant made incumbent on other Jews; thus fulfilling all righteousness. Though the religion which he came to propagate was in many respects contrary to the ritual law, it could not be established, or that law abrogated, but in consequence of his death, which the system of sacrifices was appointed to prefigure; and as his kingdom, which was not of this world, could not commence till after his resurrection, he yielded during the whole course of his life a cheerful obedience to the civil magistrate, and wrought a miracle to obtain money to pay the tribute that was exacted of him. Being thus circumcised, he chose from the lowest and least corrupted of the people certain followers, whom he treated with the most enduring familiarity for three years, and commissioned at his departure to promulgate such doctrines as, consistently with the order of the divine dispensations, he could not personally preach himself. With these men, during the course of his ministry on earth, he went about continually doing good, healing the sick, casting out devils, raising the dead, reproving vice, preaching righteousness, and instructing his countrymen, by the most perfect example which was ever exhibited in the world, of whatsoever things are true, or honest, or just, or pure, or lovely, or of good report. The Scribes and Pharisees, however, finding him not that conqueror whom they vainly expected, becoming envious of his reputation among the people, and being filled with rancour against him for detecting their hypocritical arts, delivered him up to the Roman governor, who, though convinced of his innocence, yielded to the popular clamour, and crucified him between two thieves, as an enemy to Caesar.\n\nJust before he expired, he said, It is finished, intimating that the purpose was now fulfilled for which he had come into the world, and which, as he had formerly told his disciples, \"was not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.\" For his blood, as he assured them at the institution of the Eucharist, \"was to be shed for the remission of sins.\" That Christ died voluntarily for us, the just for the unjust, and that \"there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved,\" is the uniform doctrine of the prophets who foretold his coming, of John the Baptist who was his immediate forerunner, and of the apostles and evangelists who preached the gospel after his ascension into heaven. Thus Isaiah says of the Messiah, that \"he was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities; that the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and that with his stripes we are healed; that we had all like thee gone astray, turning every one to his own way, and that the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all; that he was cut off out of the land of the living, and stricken for the transgression of God's people; that his soul or life was made an offering for sin; and that he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.\" The Baptist, \"when he saw Jesus coming unto him, said to the people, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world;\" plainly intimating that his death was to be a sacrifice, since it was only as a sacrifice that the Jews could form any conception of a lamb taking away sin. The epistles of St Paul are so full of the doctrine of Christ's satisfaction, that it is needless to quote particular texts in proof of it. He tells the Romans, that Jesus Christ was set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood; he was delivered for our offences, and \"raised again for our justification; that he died for the ungodly; and that God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.\" He affirms the Corinthians that Christ died for all; that they who live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but to him who died for them and rose again; and that God made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\" He informs the Galatians, that Christ \"gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father; and that he redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.\" St Peter and St John speak the very same language; the former teaching us, that \"Christ suffered for us, and bare our sins in his own body on the tree;\" the latter, that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin, and that he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for our sins only, but also for the sins of the whole world. That John, he came into the world for the purpose of suffering, ap. 7. ii. 2. appears from his own words: for \"no man (said he) taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of myself: I x. 18. have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received from my Father.\" And that he voluntarily laid it down for mankind, is evident from his calling himself the Good Shepherd, and adding, that \"the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.\"\n\nThat Christ died for the benefit of the human race, is a truth so apparent from these texts, that no man professing Christianity has hitherto called it in question. Very different opinions have been formed indeed concerning and extent the nature and extent of that benefit, and the means by which it is applied; but that the passion and death of the blest Jesus were essential parts of his ministry on earth, his death has seldom been controverted. That on the cross he made satisfaction to his Father for the sins of the world, is the general belief of Christians; but presumptuous men, aiming at being wise beyond what is written, have started a thousand idle questions concerning the necessity\nTheology of such satisfaction, and the manner in which it was made. Some limiting the power and mercy of the Omnipotent, have dared to affirm that God could not have pardoned man without receiving full satisfaction for his offences; that nothing but the shedding of the blood of Christ could make that satisfaction; that his death was indeed sufficient to atone for a thousand worlds; that, however, he did not die for all mankind, but only for a chosen few, ordained to eternal life by a secret decree before the foundation of the world; and that the rest of the race are passed by, and doomed to eternal perdition, for the glory of God's justice. Others, convinced by every thing around them that the Creator and Governor of the universe is a being of infinite benevolence, whose only end in giving life must have been to communicate happiness, have contended, that no atonement whatever could be necessary to obtain from him the forgiveness of sin on sincere repentance; that it is contrary to all our notions of justice to punish the innocent for the guilty; and that therefore the death of Christ, though the essential part of his ministry, could not be necessary, but at the most expedient.\n\nWe enter not into these debates. The Scriptures have nowhere said what God could or could not do; and on this subject we can know nothing but what they have taught us. That \"we are reconciled to God by the death of his Son,\" is the principal doctrine of the New Testament; and without presuming to limit the power, the mercy, or the wisdom, of him who created and sustains the universe, we shall endeavour to show that it is a doctrine worthy of all acceptation. In doing this, we shall state impartially the opinions which pious men have held respecting the form or manner in which Christ by his death made satisfaction to God for the sins of the world; and we hope that our readers will embrace that opinion which shall appear to them most consonant to the general sense of sacred Scripture.\n\nThe strictest adherents to the theological system of Calvin, interpreting literally such texts of Scripture as speak of his being made sin for us, of his bearing our sins in his own body on the tree, and of the Lord's laying on him the iniquity of us all, contend, that the sins of the elect were lifted off from them and laid on Christ by imputation, much in the same way as they think the sin of Adam is imputed to his posterity. \"By bearing the sins of his people (says Dr Gill*) he took them off from them, and took them upon himself, bearing or carrying them, as a man bears or carries a burden on his shoulders. There was no sin in him inherently, for if there had, he would not have been a fit person to make satisfaction for it; but sin was put upon him by his Divine Father, as the sins of the Israelites were put upon the scape-goat by Aaron. No creature (continues he) could have done this; but the Lord hath laid on him, or made to meet on him, the iniquity of us all, not a single iniquity, but a whole mass and lump of sins collected together; and laid as a common burden upon him, even the sins of all the elect of God. This phrase of laying sin on Christ is expressive of the imputation of it to him; for it was the will of God not to impute the transgressions of his elect to themselves, but to Christ, which was done by an act of his own; for he hath made him to be sin for us, that is, by imputation, in which way we are made the righteousness of God in him; that being imputed to us by him as our sins were to Christ. The sense (says our author) is, a charge of sin was brought against him as the surety of his people. He was numbered with the transgressors; for bearing the sins of many, he was reckoned as if he had been a sinner himself, sin being imputed to him; and he was dealt with as such. Sin being found upon him by imputation, a demand of satisfaction for sin was made, and he answered it to the full. All this was with his own consent. He agreed to have sin laid upon him, and imputed to him, and a charge of it brought against him, to which he engaged to be responsible; yea, he himself took the sins of his people upon him; so the evangelist Matthew has it, 'He Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.' As he took the nature of men, so he took their sins, which made his flesh to have the likeness of sin—viii. 17. fulness, though it really was not sinful. What Christ bore being laid upon him, and imputed to him, were sins of all sorts, original and actual; sins of every kind, open and secret, of heart, lip, and life; all acts of sin committed by his people, for he has redeemed them from all their iniquities; and God, for Christ's sake, forgives all trespasses, his blood cleanses from all sin, and his righteousness justifies from all; all being imputed to him as that is to them. Bearing sin supposes it to be a burden; and indeed it is a burden too heavy to bear by a sensible sinner (E). When sin is charged home upon the conscience, and a faint groans, being burdened with it, what must that burden be, and how heavy the load which Christ bore, consisting of all the sins of all the elect from the beginning of the world to the end of it? and yet he sunk not, but stood up under it; failed not, nor was he discouraged, being the mighty God, and the Man of God's right hand, made strong for himself.\"\n\nTo the Arminians or Remonstrants, this doctrine of the imputation of the sins of men to the Son of God appears as absurd as the similar doctrine of the imputation of the sin of Adam to his unborn posterity; and it is certainly attended with consequences which have alarmed serious Christians of other denominations.\n\nWere it possible in the nature of things, says the Arminian, to transfer the guilt of one person to another, and to lay it upon him as a burden, it could not be done without violating those laws of equity which are established in the scripture and engraven on the human heart. But this is not possible. To talk of lifting lumps of sin, or transferring them like burdens from the guilty to the innocent, is to utter jargon, says he, which has no meaning; and we might with as much propriety speak of lifting a scarlet colour from a piece of cloth and laying it on the sound of a trumpet, as of literally lifting the sins of the elect from them and laying them on Christ. Guilt is seated in the mind; and no man can become a sinner but by an act of volition. If Christ therefore really took upon him the sins of his people, he must have deliberately formed a wish to have actually committed\n\n(E) By the phrase a sensible sinner, the learned author means a sinner who is not past feeling, but has a conscience alive to the sense of remorse.\ncommitted all these sins; but such a wish, though it would have made him inherently guilty, and therefore incapable of satisfying for sin, could not have cancelled deeds that were done before he was born, or have made those innocent who really had been sinners. A deed once done cannot be undone; a volition which has been formed cannot be annihilated. By sincere repentance, the habitual dispositions are indeed changed, and those who have been sinners become objects of mercy; but no power can recall the hours that are past, or make those actions which have been performed to have been not performed. To remove guilt from the sinner and lay it on the innocent may therefore be safely pronounced impossible even for Omnipotence itself, for it implies that a thing may be and not be at the same instant of time; and the doctrine which teaches that this removal was made from the elect to Christ, is an imagination of yesterday, which has no countenance from scripture, and is contrary to the established constitution of things. Those who imagine that guilt may be propagated from father to son, have something like an argument to urge for the imputation of Adam's sin to his numberless posterity; for all the men and women who have by ordinary generation been introduced into the world, have undoubtedly derived their nature from the primeval pair. But Christ did not derive his nature from the elect, that their sins should be communicated to him; nor, as he was miraculously conceived by the Holy Ghost, can we attribute to him any degree of that taint which is supposed to have been conveyed from Adam to all the other generations of men.\n\nNothing more, therefore, can be meant by \"Christ's being made sin for us,\" and \"bearing our sins in his own body on the tree,\" or by God's \"laying upon him the iniquity of us all,\" than that by his sufferings we are freed from the punishment of our sins; it being in scripture a common figure of speech, as even Dr Gill has somewhere acknowledged, to denote by the word fin the consequences of sin. That this figure is used in those texts from which he infers that Christ took the sins of the elect on himself, is evident from the verse which he quotes from the Gospel of St Matthew; in which it is said, that \"himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses.\" The sicknesses and infirmities there alluded to are the leprosy, the palsy, the fever, and demoniacal possessions: but when our blest Lord cured these diseases, surely he did not by his omnipotent word lift them off from the patients and take them on himself, so as actually to become a leper, a paralytic, and a daemoniac, or even to be reckoned as such either by the multitude, or by the priests, whose duty it was to take cognizance of every illegal uncleanness*. And if his inveterate enemies did not impute to him the leprosy when he removed that plague from others, why should it be supposed that his own Father, to whom he was at all times well-pleasing, imputed to him the sins of which, by his sufferings, he removed the punishment from those who were guilty? To impute to a person any action, whether virtuous or vicious, which he did not perform, can proceed only from ignorance, or malice, or partiality; but God is no respecter of persons, and from ignorance and malice he is removed to an infinite distance. It is indeed an undoubted truth, that \"the Lord Jesus, by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself, which he through the eternal Spirit once offered up unto God, hath fully satisfied the justice of his Father; and purchased not only reconciliation, but an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven for all those whom the Father hath given him;\"* but that he actually took on himself the sins of mankind, or that those sins were imputed to him by God, who punished him as a person whom he considered as guilty, is a doctrine equally injurious to the justice of the Father and to the immaculate purity of the Son.\n\nThe earnestness with which this doctrine was inculcated by some of the earliest reformers, and the impossibility of admitting it, which every reflecting and unprejudiced mind must feel, was probably one of the causes which drove Socinus and his followers to the extreme of denying Christ's satisfaction altogether, and considering his death as nothing more than that of an ordinary martyr, permitted for the purpose of attesting the truth of his doctrine, and paving the way for his resurrection, to confirm the great promise of immortality. According to these men, forgiveness is freely dispensed to those who repent, by the essential goodness of God, without regard to the merit or sufferings of any other being; and the gospel is said to save from sin, because it is the most perfect lesson of righteousness. The great objection of Crellius to the doctrine of the satisfaction is, that it is a hindrance to piety; for if Christ has paid the whole debt, he thinks that he must have nothing to do, as nothing more can be required of us. And if it were indeed true that our sins are imputed to Christ, and his righteousness imputed to us, this objection would be insurmountable; for God could not justly exact a double punishment for the same sin, or inflict misery on those to whom he imputes perfect righteousness. But as to this imaginary transferring of virtues and vices from one person to another, the scriptures give no countenance; so they nowhere call the death of Christ a satisfaction for the sins of men. The term has indeed been long in use among divines, and when properly explained it may be retained without any danger; but in treating of this subject, it would perhaps be more prudent to restrict ourselves to the use of scripture language, as the word satisfaction carries in it the ideas of a debt paid and accepted; whereas it is said by St Paul, that \"eternal life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord; and that we are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ, whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.\"\n\nTo clear up this matter, and attain adequate notions of the death redemption and justification, it will be necessary to look back to the fall of our first parents; for the great purpose for which Christ was promised, and for which he came into the world, was, by bruising the head of the serpent, to restore mankind to the inheritance which they had lost through the transgression of Adam. This is apparent not only from the original promise made to the woman, but also from different passages in the epistles of St Paul, who expressly calls Christ the second Adam, and says, that \"as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life;\" that \"as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous;\" and that, \"as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\"\nTheology alive.\" Hence it was that John the Baptist, when he more peculiarly Christian, saw Jesus coming to him, said to his disciples, \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away, not the sins, but the sin of the world,\" evidently alluding to Adam's sin and its consequences, since no other sin was ever committed of which the consequences extend to the whole world.\n\nThis being the case, it is undeniable, that whatever we lost in the first Adam is restored to us by the second; and therefore they who believe that the punishment denounced against eating the forbidden fruit was death corporal, spiritual, and eternal, must believe that we are redeemed from all these by Christ; who having appeared once in the end of the world to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.* If the image of God in which man was created was lost by the breach of the first covenant, it is more than restored to us by the Mediator of a better covenant, which is established upon better promises; if by the sin of Adam we were utterly indispensible, disfavored, and made opposite to all that is spiritually good, and wholly inclined to all evil, and that continually, we are freed from that dreadful curse by our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works; and if for our share in the first transgression we be justly liable to all punishments in this world and in that which is to come, the apostle affirms us, that \"when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, because that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.\" As Jesus is the Lamb slain in the divine decree from the foundation of the world, these beneficial consequences of his death have been extended by a retrospective view to all in every age whose names are written in the book of life, though it is absurd to suppose that he literally took their sins upon him, and impious to imagine that he suffered under the imputation of sin.\n\nSuch is the general doctrine of redemption, as it is taught by the more moderate Calvinists and more moderate Remonstrants; for moderate Christians of all denominations, though they express themselves differently, have nearly the same views of the fundamental articles of their common faith. It must not, however, be concealed, that many divines of great learning and piety contend strenuously against the doctrine of vicarious atonement for actual transgressions of the moral law. These are the more zealous Arminians, who deny that we inherit any mortal taint or intellectual weakness from our first parents, whom they believe never to have been in a state of greater perfection than many of their posterity who are called degenerate. According to them, we lose nothing by the fall of Adam but our title to eternal life or perpetual existence, together with those graces of the Holy Spirit which were bestowed under the first covenant to train mankind for the society of heaven; and as eternal life and supernatural grace constituted one free-gift, not due to the nature of man, or indeed of any created being, they might, when forfeited, be restored by any means or on any condition which should seem expedient to the all-wise Donor. These means, and that condition, human reason cannot indeed discover; but it seems very fit that they should be different from the means by which moral agents under the law of nature can secure to themselves the favour of their Creator, or recover it when occasionally lost. The former depends on arbitrary will and pleasure, or at least on no other principles discoverable by us; while the latter arises out of the established and well-known constitution of things. Thus moral virtue, comprehending piety, was the condition of that favour and protection which man, in his original state, could claim from his Maker; but obedience to a positive command was the condition of the free gift of immortality conferred on Adam on his introduction into paradise. The claim arising from the relation between the creature and the Creator is indissoluble, because that relation cannot be dissolved: so that the man who, by a transgression of the moral law has forfeited the favour of God, may reasonably hope to recover it by sincere repentance and a return to his duty: and nothing but such repentance and reformation can recover it; because, in a moral agent, nothing can be agreeable to God but moral dispositions, which cannot be transferred from one person to another, and for the want of which nothing can alone. Our virtues are not required nor our vices prohibited, as if the one could profit and the other injure him who created us; for \"is it any pleasure to the Almighty that we are righteous? or is it gain to him that we make our ways perfect?\" Will he reprove us for fear of us?\" No! He commands us to be virtuous, and forbids us to be vicious, only because virtue is necessary to our own happiness, and vice productive of everlasting misery.\n\nWere an immoral man to be introduced into the society of angels and just men made perfect, he would not experience in that society what we are taught to expect from the joys of heaven; because to such joys his acquired dispositions would be wholly repugnant. Nor could the sufferings of any person whatever, or the imputation of any extrinsic righteousness, make that mind which had long been immersed in the grossest sensuality relish the intellectual and refined enjoyments of heaven; or the man who had been the habitual slave of envy, malice, and duplicity, a fit inhabitant of that place where all are actuated by mutual love. On the other hand, lay the divines whose doctrine we are now detailing, it is impossible to suppose that the Father of mercies, who knows whereof we are made, should have doomed to eternal misery any moral agent who had laboured through life to serve him in sincerity and in truth; or that any atonement could be necessary to redeem from the pains of hell the man whose pious and virtuous dispositions have through penitence and prayer become united to the society of heaven. Unflinching perfection never was nor ever could be expected in man. He is brought into the world free indeed from vice, but equally destitute of virtue; and the great business of his life is to guard his mind from being polluted by the former, and to acquire dispositions habitually leading to the practice of the latter. Till these habits be fairly formed, it seems impossible that he should not sometimes deviate from the paths of rectitude, and thereby incur a temporary forfeiture of the divine favour; but the very constitution of his mind, and the purpose for which he is placed in a state of probation, show that the divine favour thus forfeited can be recovered only by repentance and reformation.\nWidely different, however, is the case with respect to the forfeiture and recovery of a free gift, to which man has no natural claim. When the condition is broken on which such a gift was bestowed, repentance can be of no avail; it must be either irrecoverably lost, or restored by the mere good pleasure of the giver. Immortality or perpetual existence is a gift which upon certain terms was freely bestowed upon the human race, and forfeited by the transgression of their first parent violating those terms. It was restored by the free grace of God, who was pleased to ordain, that \"since by man came death, by man should also come the resurrection of the dead; for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\" Hence the apostle, writing to the Romans of the benefits of being the children of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, summeth up those benefits with resurrection from the dead.\" For the creature, i.e., mankind, was made subject (except he *) to vanity or death, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope: because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together until now: and not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, viz., the redemption of our body (r). That this the redemption of our body is the consequence of the sacrifice of Christ, is taught in the most explicit terms in the epistle to the Hebrews; of which the inspired author informs us, that \"forasmuch as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil; and deliver them, who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.\" A vicarious atonement made with this view, the divines, whose theory we are now considering, acknowledge to be perfectly rational and consistent with the strictest justice. \"The law of nature (say they +) allows not of vicarious atonements; but ordains that the man who transgresseth shall himself bear the punishment of his iniquity; a punishment which no man deserves for the faults of another, unless he be partaker of the guilt by joining in the transgression.\" And in proof of this their opinion, they appeal to the words of God himself, declaring to Moses,—\"Whoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book f.\" But when the free gift of immortality was lost, it was with great wisdom, say they, that God restored it through a Mediator who should make atonement by his blood for the breach of the first covenant; since such a mediation implies that the gift restored is merely of grace, to the attainment of which man could no further co-operate than by his hopes and wishes.\n\nTo this view of redemption, and indeed to every view of it which we have yet taken, an objection forces itself upon the mind. Throughout the New Testament life and immortality are considered as a free gift, and called so in express words by St Paul *. To the scheme under consideration it is essential to consider them as * Rom. v. such; and yet we know that a large price was paid for them, as St Paul likewise acknowledges, when he twice tells the Corinthians that they were bought with a price †.\n\n\"To clear up this matter (says Bishop Warburton), and to reconcile the apostle to himself, who certainly was not defective either in natural sense or artificial logic, let us once again remind the reader, that life and immortality bestowed on Adam in paradise was a free gift, as appears from the history of his creation. As a free gift, it was taken back by the Donor when Adam fell; to which resumption our original natural rights are not subject, since natural religion teacheth, that sincere repentance alone will reinstate us in the possession of those rights which our crimes had suspended. So that when this free gift, forfeited by the first Adam, was recovered by the second, its nature continuing the same, it must still remain a free gift—a gift to which man, by and at his creation had no claim; a gift which natural religion did not bestow. But if misled by measuring this revealed mystery of human redemption by the feint idea of human transactions, where a free gift and purchased benefit are commonly opposed to one another, yet even here we may be able to set ourselves right, since, with regard to man, the character of a free gift remains to immortality restored. For the price paid by forfeited man was not paid by him, but by a Redeemer of divine extraction, who was pleased, by participating of man's nature, to stand in his stead. Hence the sacred writers seeing, in this case, the perfect agreement between a FREE GIFT and a PURCHASED POSSESSION, call it sometimes by the one and sometimes by the other name t.\"\n\nA restoration to life and immortality from that state The death of unconfiscatedness or extinction, to which all mankind of Christ were doomed in consequence of the fall, is that great atonement only our Redeemer; and according to the theologians whose actual theory we are now considering, it was the only thing in the divine intention when the promise was given to the first mother that the seed of the woman should bruise head of the serpent. But though they contend that the death of Christ does not operate directly as an atonement for the actual sins of men, they admit that it does so indirectly and by necessary consequence, since it gives opportunities for repentance and newness of life, which under the first covenant they did not enjoy. Had a man under that covenant transgressed any moral precept, he would have forfeited the favour of his God, and either been subjected to punishment or to a long course of repentance; but supposing the efficacy of repentance under\n\n(f) That by the words creature and creation the apostle here means all mankind, and by vanity and corruption, death, the reader will find proved by Dr Whitby, in his note on the place, with a strength of argument which cannot be shaken; and that the whole creation, the Gentiles as well as the Jews, groaned and travailed in pain together under the apprehension of death, is apparent from the writings of Cicero, who always seems doubtful whether death be a good or an evil; and from the lamentation of Hezekiah, when desired by the prophet to set his house in order because he should die and not live.\nTheology\n\nPart II.\n\nder the law of nature to be what they suppose it to be, he might before it was perfected have lost his existence by the eating of the forbidden fruit; and thus his penitence or punishment have ended in everlasting death. This can never be the issue of things under the new covenant, which, by the death of Christ, secures immortality to man, and gives him opportunities, as long as he shall be in a state of probation, of recovering the divine favour when forfeited, whether by a moral transgression or a temporary violation of the peculiar condition of the covenant. Hence they admit the truth of the apostle's doctrine, that we are gainers by the fall of Adam and the redemption wrought by Christ; which will appear when we come to consider their notions of justification. In the meantime it may be proper to observe, that they consider it as no small confirmation of their opinion, that it tends to put an end to the long agitated disputes concerning the extent of redemption, and to reconcile passages of scripture which, on the commonly received theories both of Calvinists and Arminians, seem to be at variance with each other.\n\nIt is well known to be one of the fundamental doctrines of the Calvinistic school, that \"none are redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only\"; and if the notions of redemption, which, in the end of the 17th century, were very generally embraced, be admitted as of faith of justification, it will not be easy to overturn the arguments by which that doctrine is supported. Such of them as are connected with the great question of election and reprobation, and enter into the decision of it, we have stated in another place (see Predestination, No. 14); but it is farther argued, that the doctrine of universal redemption reflects on the wisdom, the justice, and the power of God, and robs him of his glory.\n\nThe scriptures assure us that all men shall not be saved; but how can this be, if Christ died for all, and the scheme of salvation by his death was formed by infinite wisdom? The Arminians indeed say, that those who fail of salvation, fail through their own fault in not performing the conditions required of them; but God either knew or knew not that such men would not perform those conditions. If he knew it not, his knowledge is limited; if he did know it, where was his wisdom in providing a scheme of redemption for men to whom he was aware that it would be of no benefit?\n\n\"God, we are told, is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works;\" but there is no righteousness in making Christ bear the sins of all men, and suffer the punishment due to them, if any one of those men shall be afterwards punished eternally. If Christ has already paid the debts of the whole world, it cannot be just to cast a single inhabitant of the whole world into the prison of hell, there to be detained till he shall again have paid the uttermost farthing. \"The Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save;\" for he is and always will be the same Almighty power that he was from eternity; but if by the divine decree Christ died for all men, and yet all men shall not be saved, it would appear that man is mightier than his Maker!\n\nThe ultimate end of God in the redemption of man is admitted to have been his own glory; but if any individual of the human race, who was redeemed by Christ, shall not be saved, God will so far lose his end, and be deprived of his glory. For, if this were the case, where would be the glory of God the Father in forming a scheme which, with respect to multitudes, does not succeed? and where would be the glory of the Son of God, the Redeemer, in working out the redemption of men who are yet not to be saved by him? and where would be the glory of the Spirit of God, if redemption were not by him effectually applied to every individual for whom it was wrought? By such arguments as these do the Calvinists oppose the scheme of universal redemption, and contend that Christ died only for the elect, or such as shall be placed on his right hand at the day of judgement. This notion of a limited redemption, as they think it more worthy of the sovereignty of God, they believe to be taught by our Saviour himself, when he said, \"All that the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and him that cometh to me, I will in nowise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the Father's will who hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.\"\n\nThe Arminians, on the other hand, contend, that it is impious to limit the effects of Christ's death to a chosen few, since it appears from scripture, that by the decrees and intention of his Father he taunted death for men, that all, without exception, might through him obtain remission of their sins. Thus our Lord himself told Nicodemus, that \"as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that whoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.\" In perfect conformity with the doctrine of his divine Matter, St Paul teaches, that \"Christ died for all;\" that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; that \"he will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth;\" that \"Christ gave himself a ransom for all;\" and that \"Jesus Christ the righteous is the propitiation for our sins; and not for our's only, but for the whole world.\"\n\nOn these texts, without any commentary, the Arminians are willing to rest their doctrine of universal redemption; though they think that a very strong additional argument for its truth arises from the numberless absurdities which flow from the contrary opinion. Thus, say they, the apostles were commanded by our Savior to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, and all who hear it preached are required to believe it: but no man, as the Calvinists themselves confess, can believe the gospel as a Christian, without believing that Christ died for him; and therefore, if it be true that Christ died only for the elect, a great part of mankind are required to believe a lie, and a falsity is made the object of divine faith! Again, if Christ did not die for all, then no man can be sure that he\nTheology he is bound to believe in Christ when preached to him; nor can any man be justly condemned for infidelity: which is not only absurd in itself, but directly contrary to what we are taught by our blessed Lord, who affirms us*, that unbelief is the cause of condemnation. Lastly, if Christ died not for all, then is it certain that he cannot claim dominion over all in consequence of his death.\n\n† Rom. xiv. and resurrection; but S. Paul says expressly†, that \"to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived,\" that he might be the Lord both of the dead and living.\" The Arminians acknowledge, that though Christ died for all, there are many who will not be saved; for, say they†, the death of Christ did not literally pay the debts incurred by sinners, but only obtained for them the gracious covenant of the gospel, by which all who believe in him, and sincerely endeavour to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, are entitled to forgiveness of sins and eternal life.\n\nSuch is the state of this controversy as it was agitated between the Calvinists and Arminians of the 17th century; but the present leaders of this latter school are of opinion, that it never could have been started, had not both parties mistaken the purpose for which Christ died. It is not conceivable, say they, that anything for which the eternal Son of God took upon him human nature, and in that nature suffered a cruel and ignominious death, shall not be fully accomplished; and therefore, if in the divine intention he died to make atonement for the sins of man actual as well as original, we must of necessity conclude, that those for whom he died shall certainly be saved. Yet we learn from scripture that many shall go away into everlasting punishment, though the same scripture repeatedly assures us that Christ gave his life a ransom for all, and that he is the propitiation for the whole world. To reconcile these different passages of scripture is impossible, if we suppose that he laid down his life to atone for the actual transgressions of men; but if the direct purpose of the Godhead in forming this stupendous plan of redemption was, that the death of Christ should be the ransom of all from the grave or utter extinction, every difficulty is removed; for we know that all, the wicked as well as the righteous, shall through him be raised to life at the last day. That this was the purpose for which he died, they think apparent from the very words quoted by the Calvinists to prove that redemption was not universal; for he declares that it was his Father's will, \"that of all which had been given him he should lose nothing;\" not that he should save it all from future punishment, but only that he \"should raise it up at the last day.\"\n\nWhen St John calls him a propitiation for our sins, which, as we have seen, the divines whose doctrine we are now stating hold him to be indirectly, he does not add, as in our translation, for the sins of the whole world, but παντὸς ἀνθρώπου τοῦ κόσμου, for the whole world, which, by his death, he redeemed from that vanity and corruption under which, according to St Paul, it had groaned from the fall till the preaching of the gospel. Hence it is that our blessed Lord calls himself \"the resurrection and the life,\" and always promises to those who should believe in him that though they were dead, yet should they live, and that he would raise them up at the last day.\n\nAmong these various opinions respecting the destination of the death of Christ, it belongs not to us to decide. The serious reader, divesting himself of prejudice in favour of the system in which he has been educated, more particularly Christian, will search the scriptures, and adopt the theory which he shall find most explicitly taught in that sacred volume; but as in every system it is admitted, that one purpose for which Christ died was to redeem mankind from the everlasting power of the grave, and bring to pole for light life and immortality, it is of the utmost importance which to know whether that purpose has been fully attained, as Death we see still triumphing over all the generations born to of men; and as the scriptures give us no hopes of being light life rescued from its dominion but through the medium of a immortal resurrection, some sensible evidence seems necessary to evince that a general resurrection shall actually take place. This we are promised as one great benefit purchased for us by the sufferings of Christ sacrificed on the cross. And since the price has been paid, and paid thus visibly, the nature of the covenant requires that the benefit should be as visibly enjoyed by the person whose sufferings obtained it for his brethren. \"If the Redeemer himself had not been seen to enjoy the fruits of the redemption procured, what hopes could have remained for the rest of mankind? Would not the natural conclusion have been, that the expedient of redemption, by the death and sacrifice of Jesus, had proved ineffectual?\" This is the conclusion which St Paul himself draws: \"If Christ be not risen (says he*), then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also, who are fallen asleep in Christ, are perished—ἀπώλονται—are lost, as if they had never existed. But now (adds he) is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead: For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\"—So necessarily connected, in the opinion of the apostle, is the resurrection of Christ with the very essence of Christianity†.\n\nWe have in another place (see RESURRECTION, No 50.) stated such arguments for the truth of this fundamental article of our common faith, as must carry conviction to every mind capable of estimating the force of evidence; we shall not here relume the subject.\n\nArchbishop King has supposed†, that the human will is a faculty distinct from the understanding and the appetites; that activity is essential to it; and that previous to an election formed, it is equally indifferent to all objects. He thence infers, that a man may choose, and even take delight in, what is not naturally agreeable to any of his appetites; because when the choice is made, a relation is formed between the will and the object of choice, which, from being originally indifferent, now becomes a favourite object. But neither his Grace, nor any other adherer of human liberty, has ever affirmed or supposed, that any man or body of men could deliberately choose evil for its own sake, or enter zealously upon a tedious and difficult enterprise, from which no good could possibly arise, and from which unmixed misery was clearly foreseen as the necessary result of every step of the progress. Such, however, must have been the choice and the conduct of the apostles, when they resolved to preach a new religion founded on the resurrection of Jesus, if they did not certainly know that Jesus had risen from the dead. And this conduct must have been adopted, and, in opposition to every motive which can influence the human mind, have been perfected.\nvered in by a great number of men and women, without the smallest contradiction having ever appeared in the various testimonies, which at different times, and under the cruellest tortures, they all gave to a variety of circumstances, of which not one had its foundation in truth. He who can admit this supposition, will not surely object to the incredibility of miracles. The resurrection of a man from the dead is an event so different indeed from the common course of things, that nothing but the most complete evidence can make it an object of rational belief; but as the resurrection of Jesus has always been said to have had God for its Author, it is an effect which does not exceed the power of the cause assigned, and is therefore an event possible in itself and capable of proof. It is a deviation from the laws of nature, but it is not contradictory to any one of those laws.\n\nThat a great number of men and women should deliberately form a plan of ruin and misery to themselves, without a prospect of the smallest advantage either in this world or in the next, is as different from the common course of things as the resurrection from the dead; and therefore in itself at least as great a miracle: but that they should persist in prosecuting this plan in the midst of torments; that they should spread themselves over the whole world, and everywhere publish a number of falsehoods, without any one of them contradicting the rest; that truth should never escape them either in an unguarded moment, or when lingering on the rack, and yet that all their lies should be in perfect agreement with each other; that they should every one of them court sufferings for a person whom they knew to be an impostor; that not one of the number—not even a single woman—should have so much compassion for a fellow-creature, as to refuse him from the flames by confessing a truth which could injure nobody—not even the suffering deceivers themselves—all this is not only different from the common course of things, but directly contrary to the most known laws of nature, and is therefore not miraculous, but may be pronounced impossible. Yet this impossibility we must admit, or acknowledge, that as Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures, and was buried; so he rose again the third day according to the Scriptures; that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve; after that of above five hundred brethren at once; after that of James; then of all the apostles; and that he was last of all seen of St Paul *, who was converted by the vision to preach the faith which till then he had persecuted.\n\nThus are we assured, that \"those who have fallen asleep in Christ are not lost, since he is risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the first-fruits, afterwards they that are Christ's at his coming; for all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation +.\"\n\nOur blessed Lord having conversed familiarly with the eleven apostles for forty days after his resurrection, instructing them in the things pertaining to the kingdom of God; having extended their authority as his ministers, by giving them a commission to teach all nations, and make them his disciples, by baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; and having promised them power from on high to enable them to discharge the duties of so laborious an office—led them out as far as Bethany, that they might be witnesses of his ascension into heaven. \"When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? And he said, it is not for you to know the times and the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth. But tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high; and he lift up his hands and blessed them; and it came to pass while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly towards heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; who also said, ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. And they worshipping him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy *.\"\n\nThat our blessed Lord ascended into heaven, will proofs scarcely be denied in the present age by any one who Christ's ascension admits that he rose from the dead. The ascension was indeed the natural consequence of the resurrection; for we cannot suppose that a man would be called back from the grave to live for ever in a world where all other men fall in succession a prey to death. The purpose for which he died was to recover for the descendants of Adam every privilege which they had forfeited through his transgression; and if, as has been generally believed, mankind were by the terms of the first covenant to enjoy eternal life in heaven, some proof was necessary that Christ by his death and resurrection had opened the kingdom of heaven to all faithful observers of the terms of the second. Hence it was prophesied + Ps. lxviii. of the Messiah, in whom all the nations of the earth 18. cx. ii. were to be blest, that \"he should ascend on high, Micah ii. lead captivity captive, and sit on the right hand of God 15: until his enemies should be made his footstool.\" It was therefore of the greatest importance to the apostles to have sufficient proof of their Master's exaltation to the right hand of the Majesty on high; for otherwise they could neither have looked for an entrance into heaven themselves, by a new and living way, as the author of the epistle to the Hebrews expresses it, nor have preached Jesus as the Messiah promised to their fathers, since they could not have known that in him these prophecies were fulfilled. But the proof vouchsafed them was the most complete that the nature of the thing would bear. The spectators of the ascension were many; for, according to the history of St Luke †, those who returned Acts i., from the Mount of Olives to Jerusalem, and prepared 12—16. themselves for the coming of the Holy Ghost, were in number about five score; and to such a cloud of witnesses the evangelist would not have appealed, had not the fact he was recording been very generally known. Yet these were perhaps but part of the witnesses; for since\nTheology since Christ had told to his disciples that he was to ascend to his Father and their Father, to his God and their God, and that he was going to prepare a place for them, that where he is there they might be likewise; we can hardly doubt but that all who believed in him as the Redeemer of the world would take care to be present, not only to view their Master's triumph over all his enemies, but also to have a sight of that glory which awaited themselves. It was on this occasion probably that he was seen after his resurrection by above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part were alive at the writing of St Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians.\n\nBut though such multitudes of people saw Jesus lifted up from the mount, and gradually vanish out of their sight, some other evidence seemed necessary to certify them of the place to which he had gone. Two angels therefore appear, and attest what human eyes could not see, but what was indeed the consequence of what they had seen. They attest that Christ had ascended to heaven, not to descend again till the last day; and surely, with respect to this point, the citizens of heaven were the most unexceptionable witnesses. We must therefore acknowledge and confess, against all the wild heresies of old (K), that Jesus Christ the Son of God, who died and rose again, did with the same body and soul with which he had lived upon earth ascend up into heaven, there to appear in the presence of God for us.*\n\nHaving in the outward tabernacle of this world once offered up himself a pure and perfect sacrifice for the expiation of our sins, he entered within the veil into the most holy place, there to present his blood before God himself, in order to obtain mercy for us, and therefore to the Divine favour. So that, \"if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, who is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world; and he is able to save to the uttermost those that come to God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for us.\" Seeing then that we have a great high-priest, who is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, we may through him come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\"\n\nBut it is not the office of a priest only that our Lord discharges in heaven; he is represented as sitting on the right hand of God, to denote that regal authority with which he is now vested; \"angels, and authorities, and powers, being made subject to him.\" Hence it is, that after his resurrection, he said of himself†, \"all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth;\" for, as St Paul informs us§, \"because he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, therefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth. And this submission is due to him, because \"God raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principalities and powers, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church.\"* Eph. As God, Christ possessed a kingdom, which, as it had no beginning, can never have an end: but the dominion, of which the apostle is here treating, was confined upon him as the mediator of the new covenant, and will no longer continue than till his enemies shall be subdued; for we are told, that \"he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet; and that the last enemy which shall be destroyed is death.\"† He will ransom his subjects from the power of the grave; he will redeem them from death. O death, he will be thy plague; O grave, he will be thy destruction.§\n\nThe trumpet shall sound, the graves shall be opened, all the sons and daughters of Adam shall return to life, and death shall be swallowed up in victory. Then cometh the end, when the office of mediator ceasing, he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For when all things shall be subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.†\n\nThe first conspicuous proof which our blessed Lord gave of being veiled with supreme power, and made head over all things to the church, was on the day of Pentecost. He had told the apostles that he would pray the Father to give them another comforter, who should abide with them for ever, even the Spirit of truth, which should teach them all things, and bring all things to their remembrance which he had said unto them. He had assured them, that it was expedient for them that he himself should go away; \"for if I go not away (said he*), the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.\" At his last interview with them, just before his ascension, he had desired them to tarry at Jerusalem till they should be endued with power from on high, before they entered upon their great work of converting the nations. These promises were amply fulfilled; for \"when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling\n\n---\n\n(H) There was one Apelles in the primitive church, who was condemned as a heretic for teaching that Christ's body was dissolved in the air, and that he ascended to heaven without it. The opinions of this man and his followers are stated at large and controverted by Tertullian, Gregory Nazianzen, and Epiphanius; and the reader who thinks such ridiculous notions worthy of his notice, will find enough said of them in the Notes to the sixth article of Pearson's Exposition of the Creed. Perhaps it may be from a hint communicated in these Notes, that our great modern corrector of the evangelists has discovered, if it be indeed true that he pretends to have discovered, that Jesus Christ is still upon earth.\nTheology dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. And they were all amazed, and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these who speak Galileans? And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes and Arabians—we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?\n\nThat those who heard the apostles speak so many different languages were amazed, is what we should naturally suppose; but that a single individual among them remained unconvinced, is astonishing; for the gift of tongues on the day of Pentecost is one of the most palpable miracles that was ever wrought. It is likewise one of the best authenticated miracles; for the book entitled the Acts of the Apostles was written not more than 30 years after the event took place (see Scripture, No. 168); and it is not conceivable that, within so short a period, St Luke, or any man of common sense, would have appealed for the truth of what he recorded to so many inveterate enemies of the Christian name, had he not been aware that the miraculous gift of tongues was a fact incontrovertible. We all know how detestous the Jewish rulers were to stop the progress of the faith, by whatever means; but if this miracle was not really performed, they had now an opportunity of doing it effectually by means to which truth and honour would give their approbation. Thousands must have been alive in the city of Jerusalem who were men and women at the time when the apostles were said to have been thus suddenly inspired with the tongues of the Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, &c.; and as these foreigners were themselves either Jews by descent, or at least proselytes to the Jewish religion, surely the chief-priests would have found multitudes ready, both at home and abroad, to contradict this confident appeal of St Luke's if contradiction had been possible. We read however of no objection whatever being made to this miracle. Some of the audience, indeed, when the apostles addressed people of so many nations in all their respective languages, not understanding what was said, and taking it for jargon which had no meaning, concluded, not unnaturally, that the speakers were full of new wine, and mocked them for being drunk so early in the day; but this is a circumstance which, so far from rendering the miracle doubtful, adds much to the credit of the historian, as it would hardly have occurred to the writer of a narrative wholly false, and would certainly not have been mentioned, had he known that the apostles really attempted to impose on the multitude unmeaning sounds for foreign languages.\n\nAs it is thus certain that the apostles were miraculously furnished with the gift of tongues, so the elegance and propriety of that miracle to attest the real descent of the Spirit of truth, who was to teach them all things, and endue them with power from on high to convert the nations, can never be enough admired by the pious Christian; for words being the vehicle of knowledge, an ability to speak the different languages of the earth, more peculiarly necessary to enable those who had been originally fishermen to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. Yet there have been writers*, who, though unable to call in question the reality of the gift of tongues on the day of Pentecost, have contended, that it was a gift \"not lasting, but instantaneous and transitory; not bestowed upon them for the constant work of the ministry, but as an occasional sign only, that the person endowed with it was a chosen minister of the gospel; which sign, according to them, ceased and totally vanished as soon as it had served that particular purpose.\" The chief argument upon which this opinion is attempted to be built, is Objections drawn from the scripture Greek, which is said to be \"utterly rude and barbarous, and abounding with every fault which can possibly deform a language; whereas we should naturally expect to find an inspired language pure, clear, noble, and affecting, even beyond the force of common speech; since nothing can come from God but what is perfect in its kind. In short, we should expect, says the objector, the purity of Plato and the eloquence of Cicero.\"\n\nIn reply to this objection, it has been well observed†, that it supposes what is called the purity, elegance, and sublimity, of language, to be something natural and essential to human speech, and inherent in the constitution of things. \"But the matter is far otherwise. These qualities are accidental and arbitrary, and depend on custom and fashion; modes of humanity as various as Anfwered, the differing climes of the earth; and as inconstant as the tempers, genius, and circumstances, of its inhabitants. For what is purity, but the use of such terms and their combinations as the caprice of a writer or speaker of authority hath preferred to their equals? what is elegance, but such a turn of idiom as a fashionable fancy hath brought into credit? and what is sublimity, but the application of such images as arbitrary and casual connections, rather than their own native grandeur, have dignified and ennobled? The consequence of this is, that the mode of composition which is a model of perfection to one nation or people, has always appeared either extravagant or mean to another. Asiatic and Indian eloquence was esteemed hyperbolical and unnatural by the Greeks and Romans, and is so esteemed by us; whilst the Greek and Roman eloquence in its turn appeared cold and inipid to the warm inhabitants of the east; and ours would appear perhaps still colder. But the New Testament was designed for the rule of life to all mankind. Such a rule required inspiration; and inspiration, say the objectors, implies the most perfect eloquence. What human model then was the Holy Ghost to follow? for a human model it must have been, because there was no other; and if there had, no other would have answered the purpose, which was to make a due impression on the mind and affections. Should the eastern eloquence have been employed? But it would have been too swelling and animated for the west. Should the western? This would have been too stiff and inactive for the east. Or suppose us only solicitous for what we best understand; which species of this latter genus should the sacred writers have preferred? The dissolute softness of the Asiatic Greeks, or the dry conciseness of the Spartans? The flowing exuberances\nTheology\n\nuberances of Attic eloquence, or the grave severity of the Roman?\n\n\"But are there not some general principles of eloquence in common to all the species? There are. Why then should not these have been employed to credit the apostolic inspiration? Because the end even of these (replies our author), is to mislead reason, and inflame the passions; which being abhorrent to the truth and purity of our holy religion, were very fitly rejected by the inspired penman. Besides, it might easily be known to have been the purpose of Providence, though such purpose had not been expressly declared, that the gospel should bear all possible marks of its divine original, as well in the course of its progress as in the circumstances of its promulgation. To this end, the human instruments of its conveyance were mean and illiterate, and chosen from among the lowest of the people, that when the world saw itself converted by the foolishness of preaching, as the only learned apostle thinks fit to call it, unbelievers might have no pretence to ascribe its success to the parts, or stations, or authority, of the preachers. Now had the language inspired into these illiterate men been the eloquence of Plato or Tully, Providence would have appeared to counteract its own measures, and to defeat the purpose best calculated to advance its glory. But God is wise, though man is a fool. The course of Providence was uniform and constant: it not only chose the weakest instruments, but carefully kept out of their hands that powerful weapon of words which their adversaries might so easily have wrested to the dishonour of the gospel. Common sense tells us, that the style of an universal law should retain what is common to all languages, and neglect what is peculiar to each. It should retain nothing but clearness and precision, by which the mind and sentiments of the writer are intelligibly conveyed to the reader. This quality is essential, invariably the same, and independent of custom and fashion. It is the consequence of syntax, the very thing in language which is least positive, being formed on the principles of philosophy and logic: whereas all besides, from the very power of the elements and signification of the terms to the tropes and figures in composition, are arbitrary; and, as deviating from these principles, frequently vicious. But this quality of clearness and precision eminently distinguishes the writings of the New Testament; inasmuch that it may be easily shown, that whatever difficulties occur in the sacred books do not arise from any imperfect information caused by this local or nominal barbarity of style; but either from the sublime or obscure nature of the things treated of, or from the intentional conciseness of the writers; who, in the casual mention of anything not essential to the dispensation, always observe a studied brevity.\"\n\nAfter much ingenious and found reasoning on the nature of language in general, our author concludes, that the style of the New Testament, even on the truth of what has been said to its discredit, is so far from proving the language not to be divinely inspired, that it bears one certain mark of that original. \"Every language consists of two distinct parts, the single terms, and the phrases and idioms. Suppose now a foreign language to be instantaneously introduced into the minds of illiterate men like the apostles; the impression must be made either by fixing in the memory the terms and single words only with their signification, as, for instance, Greek words corresponding to such or such Syriac or Hebrew words; or else, together with that simple impression, by enriching the mind with all the phrases and idioms of the language so inspired. But to enrich the mind with the peculiar phrases and idiom of a foreign language, would require a previous impression to be made of the manners, notions, fashions, and opinions, of the people to whom that language is native; because the idiom and phrases arise from and are dependent on these manners. But this would be a waste of miracles without sufficient cause or occasion; for the Syriac or Hebrew idiom, to which the Jews were of themselves enabled to adapt the Greek or any other words, abundantly served the useful purposes of the gift of tongues, which all centered in those tongues, being so spoken and written as to be clearly understood. Hence it follows, that if the style of the New Testament were indeed derived from that language which was miraculously impressed upon the apostles on the day of Pentecost, it must be just such a one as in reality we find it to be; that is, it must consist of Greek words in the Syriac or Hebrew idiom.\"\n\nThe immediate author of this gift, so necessary to the Divinity propagation of the gospel, was the Spirit of truth, or of the Holy Ghost, who is the Holy Ghost and the third person in the blest Trinity. That there are three persons in the one Godhead, has been shewn at large in a former section of this article; and that the Holy Ghost is one of these three, might be safely concluded from the form of baptism instituted by Christ himself. But as more plausible objections have been urged against his divinity than any that we have met with against the divinity of Christ, it may not be improper to consider these before we proceed to give an account of the graces which he imparted to the infant church, and of the apostles preaching under his influence. By the Arians the Holy Ghost is considered as a creature; by the Socinians and modern Unitarians, as they call themselves, the words Holy Ghost are supposed to express, not a person or spiritual subsistence, but merely an energy or operation, a quality or power, of the Father, whom alone they acknowledge to be God. If this doctrine can be confuted, the Arian hypothesis will fall to the ground of itself; for it is not conceivable than any inspired teacher should command his followers to be baptized in the name of the self-existent God and two creatures.\n\nIt is admitted by the Socinians themselves, that in the Scriptures many things are spoken of the Holy Ghost which can be properly predicated only of a person; but the inference drawn from this conception they endeavour to invalidate by observing, that in scripture there are likewise expressions in which things are predicated of abstract virtues, which can be literally true only of such persons as practice these virtues. Thus when St Paul says*, that \"charity suffereth long and is kind, charity envieth not, charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, &c.\" we cannot suppose his meaning to be, that these actions are performed by charity in the abstract, but that every charitable person, in consequence of that one Christian grace, suffereth long and is kind, envieth not, vaunteth not himself, and is not puffed up, &c. In like manner, say they, personal actions are attributed to the Holy Ghost, which itself is\nno person, but only the virtue, power, or efficacy, of God the Father; because God the Father, who is a person, performs such actions by that power, virtue, or efficacy, in himself, which is denominated the Holy Ghost. Thus when we read * that \"the Spirit said unto Peter, Behold three men seek thee; arise therefore and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing, for I have sent them;\" we must understand that God the Father was the person who spoke these words and sent the three men; but because he did so by that virtue in him which is called the Spirit, therefore the Spirit is said to have spoken the words and sent the men.\n\nAgain, when \"the Holy Ghost said + to those at Antioch, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them;\" we are to conceive that it was God the Father who commanded the two apostles to be separated for the work to which he had called them; but because he had done all this by that power within him which is called the Holy Ghost, therefore his words and actions are attributed to the Holy Ghost, just as long-suffering in men is attributed to charity.\n\nThis reasoning has a plausible appearance, and would be of much force were all the actions which in scripture are attributed to the Holy Ghost of such a nature as that they could be supposed to have proceeded from the person of God the Father in consequence of any particular power or virtue in him; but this is far from being the case. Thus \"Spirit is said + to make intercession for us;\" but with whom can we suppose God the Father, the fountain of divinity, to intercede? Our Saviour assured his disciples, that the Father would, in his name, send to them the Holy Ghost, who is the Comforter; that he would himself send the Comforter unto them from the Father; that the Comforter should not speak of himself, but speak only what he should hear; and that he should receive of Christ's, and shew it unto them. But we cannot, without blasphemy and absurdity, suppose that the Father would, in the name of Christ, send himself; that the Son would send the Father from the Father; and the Father would not speak of himself, but speak only what he heard; or that either the Father in person, or a quality of the Father, should receive any thing of Christ to shew unto the apostles.\n\nThe sagacity of Socinus perceived the force of such objections as these to his notion of the Holy Ghost, being nothing more than the power of the Father personified; and therefore he invented another propriety to serve his purpose in the interpretation of those texts to which this one cannot be applied. \"The Spirit of God (says he ||) may be considered either as a property or power in God, or as the things on which that power is working. When taken in the former sense, the Spirit, where any personal attribute is given to it, means God the Father; when taken in the latter sense, it means the man on whom the power of the Father is working; who, as long as he is affected by that power, is therefore called the Spirit of God;\" and he quotes, we think most absurdly, the tenth verse of the second chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians, as a text in which by the Spirit is meant an inspired man who could teach all things, yea, even the deep things of God.\n\nHow his modern followers, who deny the plenary inspiration even of Christ, will relish such a degree of inspiration as this, which raises mere men to a temporary equality with God, we know not; but leaving them to settle the dispute with their matter, we shall produce one or two passages in which personal attributes are given to the Spirit of God, when it is impossible to conceive that Spirit, either as a power inherent in the Divine Father, or as the person on whom that power is operating. We need not bring new texts into view, as some of those already quoted will serve our purpose. When our Saviour promises that the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, should be sent by the Father and the Son to the apostles, we have seen, that by this Spirit he could not mean the Father or a property of the Father; neither could he possibly mean the apostles themselves, unless we are to suppose that the Father and the Son sent St Peter to St Peter, and that St Peter, so sent, came to St Peter! Again, when Christ faith of the Holy Ghost, \"he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you,\" he could not, for the reason already assigned, mean by the Holy Ghost the Father or the power of the Father; and surely his meaning was not, that the apostles, under the influence of the power of the Father, should receive something and shew it each to himself! The Holy Ghost therefore is unquestionably a person; for though there are many passages of scripture in which the gifts of the Holy Ghost are called the Holy Ghost, they are so called by a very common figure of speech, in which the effect receives the name of its cause: and since this person is joined with the Father and the Son in the formula of Christian baptism; since they who lied to the Holy Ghost are said * to have lied unto God; since blasphemy Acts v. against him is a more heinous offence than the same sin against even the Father or the Son +; and since it was Mark iii., by the operation of the Holy Ghost that Jesus Christ 28, 29, was conceived of the Virgin Mary, and even on that account called the + Son of God—it follows that the Holy Ghost is God, of the same habitude with the Father and Son.\n\nIt was this Divine Spirit which, on the day of Pentecost, inspired the apostles with the knowledge of different languages; and as these were given only to enable them to preach the gospel to every creature, it can admit of no doubt but that he, who so amply provided the means of preaching, would take care that the gospel should be preached in purity. Our Saviour had told his apostles, that the Comforter would guide them into all the truth (οὕτως ἐγὼ ὑμῖν ἐδίδαξα), and bring all things to their remembrance, whatsoever he had said unto them; but if they had not comprehended the meaning of what he said, the bare remembrance of his sayings would have been of little importance. That before this miraculous shedding abroad of the Spirit they had but a very imperfect knowledge of his doctrines, and of the purpose for which he had come into the world, is apparent from that unseasonable question which they put to him when assembled to witness his glorious ascension; \"Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?\"\n\nTheir minds still cherished with fondness the vain prospect of temporal power; but after the day of Pentecost they were directed to nobler objects. From the such infame Spirit they received diversities of gifts besides that function of language; for we are assured by St Paul *, when * 1 Cor. speaking of the early converts to Christianity in gene.xii. 8—12.\nTheology ral, that \"to one was given by the Spirit the word of more peculiar wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues.\" And these gifts, which were generally divided either among private Christians or among the inferior orders of ministers in the church, we have reason to believe were all bestowed in a greater or less degree upon each of the apostles.\n\nMen thus endowed were well qualified to declare unto the world all the council of God. By the word of wisdom they communicated to the Gentile nations a pure system of what is called natural religion; turning them from the vanity of idols to the worship of the living God; by the word of knowledge, they preached the great doctrines of revelation both to Jews and Gentiles, shewing them that there is none other name under heaven given unto men whereby they may be saved than the name of Jesus Christ (i.e.) and by their gifts of healing and of miracles, &c.; they were enabled to prove unanswerably, that their doctrines were divine. They taught everywhere the unity of God, the creation of the world, the fall of man, the necessity of redemption, the divinity of the Redeemer, his sacrifice on the cross to restore mankind to their forfeited immortality, and the terms of the new covenant into which they had through him been graciously admitted by God.\n\nSuch a view as our limits would admit of we have given of all these doctrines, except that which respects the terms of the gospel covenant; but these being explicitly stated only by St. Paul and St. James, we could not till now investigate them, without violating the historical order into which, for the sake of perspicuity, we have digested the several parts of this short system. Our Saviour himself has indeed taught with great plainness the necessity of faith and baptism to the salvation of those who have an opportunity of hearing the gospel preached with power (see Baptism) and in his sermon on the mount, which is such a lecture of ethics founded on religion as the Son of God only could have delivered, we learn, that \"unless our righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, we shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven; that not everyone who faith unto Christ, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he who doth the will of the Father who is in heaven; and that many will say to him at the day of judgement, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name done many wonderful works?\" which could not be done without faith; Theology to whom he will, notwithstanding, say, \"Depart from me, ye that work iniquity.\" St. Paul, however, seems to attribute our justification to the bare act of believing; for he repeatedly affirms us, \"that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law;\" while St. James, on the other hand, affirms, \"that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.\" This apparent difference in the language of the two apostles, has produced among divines opinions really different respecting the justification of Christians; and the principal of these opinions it is our duty to state.\n\nBetween pardon of sin and justification there is so close a connection, that many writers seem to consider the two terms as synonymous, and to infer, that he who is pardoned is also justified. That every Christian, who shall be pardoned at the judgement of the great day, will likewise be justified, is indeed true; but in propriety of speech, justification is a word of very different import from pardon, and will entitle the Christian to what mere pardon could not lead him to expect. An innocent person, when falsely accused and acquitted, is justified but not pardoned; and a criminal may be pardoned, though he cannot be justified or declared innocent. A man whose sins are pardoned is free from punishment; but the justified Christian is entitled to everlasting life, happiness, and glory. If we were only pardoned through Christ, we should indeed escape the pains of hell, but could have no claim to the enjoyments of heaven; for these, being more than the most perfect human virtue can merit, must be, what in the scriptures they are always said to be, \"the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" Hence it is that St. Paul, distinguishing, as we have done upon his authority, between mere remission of sins and justification of life, declares, that \"Jesus our Lord was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification.\"\n\nThe word justification, as used both by St. Paul and St. James, has been very generally considered as a forensic term expressing the sentence of a judge. The most eminent reformed divines of all denominations, and even many of the Romanists themselves, have strenuously contended, that this is its genuine sense, when it is distinguished from mere remission of sins, regeneration, and sanctification; and if so, it will signify God's pronouncing a person just, either as being perfectly blameless, or as having fulfilled certain conditions required of him in the Christian covenant. But that \"there is not a just man upon earth, who doth good and finneth not,\" is made known to us by the most complete evidence possible, the joint dictates of our own consciences and of divine.\n\n(L.) It is not perhaps easy to determine what is here meant by the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge, as distinguished from each other. By the former (λόγος σοφίας), Bishop Warburton understands all the great principles of natural religion. \"The ancients (says he) used the word σοφία in this peculiar sense; it is used in the same sense by St. Paul in Col. iv. 5; and we can hardly give it any other in the place before us, where we see the word of wisdom distinguished from the word of knowledge (λόγος γνώσεως), which evidently means all the great principles of revelation; the term γνώσις being as peculiarly applied by Christian writers to revealed religion as σοφία is by the Gentiles to the natural. St. Paul uses the word in this sense in 2 Cor. xi. 6, where he says, ἐν τῇ ἀπόστολος τῷ κυρίῳ ἀληθῶς τὸ γνώσις; and St. Peter in his first epistle, chap. iii. verse 7. Hence those early heretics who too much deformed the simplicity and purity of the Christian faith by visionary pretences to superior knowledge of revelation, took from this word the name of Gnostics.\" See Warburton's Sermon on the Office and Operation of the Holy Ghost.\nTheology\n\nmore peculiarly Christian.\n\nIt is a forensic term.\n\nThis scheme (continues he) is wrong; for the law is not relaxed, nor any of its severities abated; Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill it; and therefore it requires the same holy, just, and good things, as ever. Nor is the gospel a new law. There is nothing in it (he says) which looks like a law; for it has no commands in it, but all promises, being a pure declaration of grace and salvation by Christ; nor are faith, repentance, and a new obedience, required by it as conditions of man's acceptance with God. Faith and repentance are gospel doctrines, and parts of the gospel ministry; they are graces, and not terms required to be performed by men of themselves. Faith is the gift of God, and repentance is a grant from him. It is not true (continues our author) that God will accept of an imperfect righteousness in the room of a perfect one; nor can anything more highly reflect upon the justice and truth of God, who is the judge of all the earth, than to suppose that he can ever account that as a righteousness which is not one.\"\n\nHaving thus proved by arguments which were almost in the same words stated long before by Bishop Beveridge *, that the gospel is no relaxation of the law, he proceeds to lay down his own notions of justification, of which (he says) \"the sole matter, or that for the fake of which a sinner is justified before God, is the righteousness of Christ—that which he did and suffered on earth, in our nature, in our stead, and as our representative. This is commonly called his active and passive obedience; and when the purity and holiness of his own nature was added to it, the whole made up the righteousness of the law, which was fulfilled by him as the head and representative of his people; for whatever the law required is necessary to a sinner's justification before God, and it required of sinners more than it did of man in innocence. Man was created with a pure and holy nature, conformable to the pure and holy law of God; and it was incumbent on him to continue so, and to yield in it perfect and inflexible obedience, in the failure whereof he was threatened with death. Man did fail, by which his nature was vitiated and corrupted, and his obedience became faulty and imperfect. He therefore became liable to the penalty of the law, and still perfect obedience was required of him. To the justification of a sinner therefore is required the most complete obedience, active and passive; or, in other words, purity of nature, perfect obedience, and the sufferings of death; all which meet in Christ, the representative of his people, in whom they are justified. There are indeed some divines (continues our author) who exclude the active obedience of Christ from being any part of the righteousness by which men are justified. They allow it to have been a condition requisite in him as a Mediator, qualifying him for his office; but deny that it is the matter of justification, or reckoned for righteousness to man. But without the active obedience of Christ the law would not be satisfied; the language of which is, Do and live; and unless its precepts be obeyed, as well as its penalty endured, it cannot be satisfied; and unless it be satisfied, there can be no justification. If therefore men are justified by the righteousness of Christ, it must be by his active obedience imputed and made over to them, so as to become their's, even as David declared the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works. That this is really the way in which men are justified, our author thinks evident,\n\n---\n\n* Rom. iii. 24, 25.\n\n† Body of Divinity, vol. ii. book iii. chap. 8. § 5.\n\n‡ Rom. viii. 4.\n\n§ Rom. iv.\nevident, because they must be justified either by an inherent or by an imputed righteousness; but they cannot be justified by their own inherent righteousness, for that is imperfect, and therefore not justifying. Hence the apostle counts all things but dung, that he may win Christ and be found in him; not having his own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.* But by such a righteousness as this a man cannot be justified in any other way than by an imputation of it to him. Whence it follows, that \"as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners by imputation, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous, by having that obedience placed to their own account.\"\n\nAs this author properly considers justification as the act of God, he does not approve of the language in which faith is called the instrument either of conferring or receiving it. \"Faith (says he) is merely the evidence of justification to the person justified; for faith is the evidence of things not seen.\" The righteousness of God, of the God-man and Mediator Jesus Christ, is revealed from faith to faith in the everlasting gospel; and therefore must be before it is revealed, and before the faith to which it is revealed. Faith is that grace whereby a soul, having seen its want of righteousness, beholds in the light of the Divine Spirit a complete righteousness in Christ, renounces its own, lays hold on that, puts it on as a garment, rejoices in it, and glories of it; the Spirit of God witnessing to his spirit that he is a justified person; and so he is evidently and declaratively \"justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.\" Faith adds nothing to the effect, only to the bene effe of justification; which is a complete act in the eternal mind of God, without the being or consideration of faith, or any foresight of it. In the account of God, a man is as much justified before his faith as after it; and after he does believe, his justification depends not on his acts of faith, for though we believe not, yet God abides faithful to his covenant engagements with his Son, by whose suretyship-righteousness the elect are justified; but by faith men have a comfortable sense, perception, and apprehension, of their justification, and enjoy that peace of soul which results from it. It is by that only, under the testimony of the Divine Spirit, that they know their interest in it, and can claim it, and so have the comfort of it.\"\n\nThough this language differs from that of the Westminster Confession, the author seems not to teach a different doctrine; for if faith be that grace by which a soul renounces its own righteousness, and lays hold of Christ's, which it puts on as a garment, it must be that very thing which the compilers of the Confession meant by their definition of faith receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness, when they called it \"the alone instrument of justification.\" Accordingly our author elsewhere* teaches, that \"true faith in sensible sinners afflicts to Christ and embraces him, not merely as a Saviour of man in general, but as a special suitable Saviour for them in particular. It proceeds upon Christ's being revealed in them as well as to them, by the spirit of wisdom and revelation, in the knowledge of him as a Saviour that becomes them. It comes not merely through external teachings by the hearing of the word from men; for no man, faith our blessed Lord, can come to me except the Father draw him; but such souls as are thus drawn, having heard and learned of the Father, believe not only in the doctrine of Christ, but also in himself, trusting in him alone for everlasting life and salvation.\"\n\nWere it not that this author, in every thing that he writes, has an eye to the doctrine of election and reprobation, which he carries to a greater height than almost any other divine with whose works we are acquainted, he would differ little in his notions of justification from the more moderate Arminians. \"Justification (says Limborch) is the merciful and gracious act of God, whereby he fully absolves from all guilt the truly penitent and believing soul, through and for the sake of Christ apprehended by a true faith; or gratuitously remits sins upon the account of faith in Jesus Christ, and graciously imputes that faith for righteousness.\" Here indeed the imputation of Christ's righteousness is expressly denied; but Dr Waterland, who can hardly be considered as a Calvinist, seems to contend for the imputation of that righteousness to the sinner, as well as for faith being the instrument by which it is received.\n\n\"It cannot be for nothing (says that able writer*) that St Paul so often and so emphatically speaks of man's view of being justified by faith, or through faith in Christ's blood; and that he particularly notes it of Abraham, that he believed, and that his faith was counted to him for justification, when he might as easily have said that Abraham, to whom the gospel was preached, was justified by gospel-faith and obedience, had he thought faith and obedience equally instruments of justification. Besides, it is on all hands allowed, that though St Paul did not directly oppose faith to evangelical works, yet he comprehended the works of the moral law under those which he excluded from the office of justifying, in his sense of the word justification. He even used such arguments as extended to all kinds of works; for Abraham's works were excluded, though they were undoubtedly evangelical. To prove that he interprets the apostle's doctrine fairly, our author quotes, from the genuine epistle of Clemens of Rome, a passage, in which it appears beyond a doubt that this fellow-labourer of St Paul so understood the doctrine of justifying faith as to oppose it even to evangelical works, however exalted. It is true (continues our author), Clemens elsewhere, and St Paul almost everywhere, insists upon true holiness of heart and obedience of life as indispensible conditions of salvation or justification; and of that, one would think, there could be no question among men of any judgment or probity. But the question about conditions is very distinct from the other question about instruments; and therefore both parts may be true, viz. that faith and obedience are equally conditions, and equally indispensable where opportunities permit; and yet faith over and above is emphatically the instrument both of receiving and holding justification, or a title to salvation.\n\n\"To explain this matter more distinctly, let it be remembered, that God may be considered either as a party contracting with man on very gracious terms, or as a Judge to pronounce sentence on him. Man can enter into the covenant, supposing him adult, only by attending to it, and accepting it, to have and to hold it on such kind of tenure as God proposes: that is to say, upon a self-denying tenure, considering himself as a guilty man standing in need of pardon, and of borrowed merits, and at length resting upon mercy. So here, the previous question is, Whether a person shall consent to hold a privilege upon this submissive kind of tenure or not?\"\nTheology not? Such assent or consent, if he comes into it, is the very thing which St Paul and St Clemens call faith. And this previous and general question is the question which both of them determine against any proud claimants who would hold by a more self-admiring tenure.\n\n\"Or if we next consider God as fitting in judgement, and man before the tribunal going to plead his cause; here the question is, What kind of plea shall a man resolve to trust his salvation upon? Shall he stand upon his innocence, and rest upon strict law? or shall he plead guilty, and rest in an act of grace? If he chooses the former, he is proud, and sure to be cast: if he chooses the latter, he is safe so far in throwing himself upon an act of grace. Now this question also, which St Paul has decided, is previous to the question, What conditions even the act of grace itself finally inflicts upon? A question which St James, in particular, and the general tenure of the whole Scripture, has abundantly satisfied; and which could never have been made a question by any considerate or impartial Christian. None of our works are good enough to stand by themselves before him who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. Christ only is pure enough for it at first hand, and they that are Christ's at second hand in and through him. Now because it is by faith that we thus interpose, as it were, Christ between God and us, in order to gain acceptance by him; therefore faith is emphatically the instrument whereby we receive the grant of justification. Obedience is equally a condition or qualification, but not an instrument, not being that act of the mind whereby we look up to God and Christ, and whereby we embrace the promises.\"\n\nBut though our author contends that faith is the instrument of justification, he does not, like the Antinomians, teach that it will save men without works. \"The covenant of grace (says he) has conditions annexed to it of great importance, for without them no instruments can avail. These are faith and obedience, as St James hath particularly maintained. St Paul had before determined the general and previous question respecting the plea by which we ought to abide; and when some libertines, as is probable, had perverted his doctrine of faith and grace, St James showed that the very faith which rests in a covenant of grace implies a cordial submission to the conditions of that covenant, otherwise it would be nothing but an empty ceremony. The perfect agreement between St Paul and St James in the article of justification, appears very clear and certain. St Paul declares, that in order to come to justification, it is necessary to stand upon grace, not upon merit; which St James does not deny, but rather confirms, in what he says of the perfect law of liberty (James i. 25, ii. 12). St Paul makes faith the instrument of receiving that grace; which St James does not dispute, but approves by what he says of Abraham (ii. 23); only he maintains also, that, in the conditionate sense, justification depends equally upon faith and good works; which St Paul also teaches and inculcates in effect, or, in other words, through all his writings. If St Paul had had precisely the same question before him which St James happened to have, he would have decided just as St James did; and if St James had had precisely the same question before him which St Paul had, he would have determined just as St Paul did. Their principles were exactly the same, but the questions were diverse; and they had different adversaries to deal with, and opposite extremes to encounter, which is a common case.\n\n\"It may be noted, that that faith which is here called a condition, is of much wider compass than that particular kind of faith which is precisely the instrument of justification. For faith as a condition means the whole complex of Christian belief, as expressed in the creeds; while faith as an instrument means only the laying hold on grace, and resting in Christ's merits in opposition to our own deservings: though this also, if it is a vital and operative principle (and if it is not, it is nothing worth), must of course draw after it an hearty submission to, and observance of, all the necessary conditions of that covenant of grace wherein we repose our whole trust and confidence. So that St Paul might well say, 'Do we then make void the law (the moral law) through faith?' God forbid: Yea, we establish the law.\" We exempt no man from religious duties; which are duties still, though they do not merit nor are practicable to such a degree as to be above the need of pardon: they are necessary conditions in their measure of justification, though not sufficient in themselves to justify, nor perfect enough to stand before God or to abide trial: therefore Christ's merits must be taken in to supply their defects: and so our resting in Christ's atonement by an humble self-denying faith is our last resort, our anchor of salvation both sure and steadfast, after we have otherwise done our utmost towards the fulfilling of God's sacred laws, towards the performing of all the conditions required.\n\n\"That good works, internal and external, are according as opportunities offer and circumstances permit, conditions properly so called, is clear from the whole tenor of Scripture, as hath been often and abundantly proved by our own divines (m), and is admitted by the most judicious among the foreign Reformed (n). Yet some have been very scrupulous as to this innocent name, even while they allow the absolute necessity of good works as indispensible qualifications for future blessedness. Why not conditions therefore as well as qualifications? Perhaps because that name might appear to strike at absolute predetermination, or unconditional election; and there may lie the scruple: otherwise the difference appears to lie rather in words than in things.\n\n\"Some will have them called not conditions, but fruits or consequents of justification. If they mean by justification the same as the grace of the Holy Spirit, and the first grace of faith springing from it, they say true; and then there is nothing more in it than an improper use of the word justification, except that from abuse of words very frequently arises some corruption of doctrine. If they mean only, that outward acts of righteousness are fruits of inward habits or dispositions; that\n\n(m) Bull. Op. Latin. p. 412, 414, 415, 430, 434, 514, 516, 544, 583, 645, 668.

But if they mean that justification is ordinarily given to adults, without any preparative or previous conditions of faith and repentance, that indeed is very new doctrine and dangerous, and opens a wide door to carnal security and to all ungodliness.\"\n\nSuch is the doctrine of Christian justification as it has been taught by the followers of Calvin, and by some of the most eminent Arminians who flourished in the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century. They appear not, from this view of their opinions, to differ so widely as some of them have wished the world to believe. It is evident that Dr Waterland, though he rejects some of the distinguishing tenets of Calvinism, lays greater stress upon faith in his scheme of justification than Dr Gill himself; and that they both confide in it as the instrument by which the adult Christian must receive the imputed righteousness of Christ. The greater part of modern Arminians, however, exclaim against the imputation of Christ's righteousness, as a doctrine false in itself, and fraught with the most pernicious consequences; and they would be ready to tell Dr Gill, in his own words, that of his scheme every article is wrong. It is not true (say they) that God exacts of man, or ever did exact of him, an obedience absolutely perfect; for under every dispensation man was in a state of discipline, and had habits of virtue and piety to acquire; and it is probable that his progress in piety, virtue, and wisdom, will continue for ever, as none but God is perfect and stationary, and incapable of deviating from the line of rectitude. Most of them, after Bishop Bull, dislike the use of such unscriptural phrases as the instrument of justification, applied either to faith or to works; and think, that by considering God as the sole justifier of man, upon certain conditions, they can more precisely ascertain the distinct provinces of faith and obedience in the scheme of justification, than either their brethren of the old school of Arminius, or their rivals of the school of Calvin.\n\nBy the very constitution of man, piety and virtue are duties which, if he do not sincerely perform, i.e., must of course forfeit the favour of his Maker; but the most perfect performance of his natural duties would not entitle him to a supernatural and eternal reward. Eternal life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ; and it is surely unreasonable that we should acknowledge it to be so, and not claim it as a debt due to our merits. The pious and virtuous man has a natural claim to more happiness than misery during the period of his existence, a claim founded on the attributes of that God who called him into being; but he has no natural claim to a future life, and still less to a perpetuity of existence. This is a truth not more clearly taught in the holy scripture than consonant to the soundest philosophy: and yet, by not attending to it, have St Paul and St James been set at variance, and the most opposite doctrines taught respecting the justification of Christians.\n\nBecause faith in Christ cannot entitle a wicked man to eternal happiness, one class of divines seem to infer that such faith is not necessary to Christian justification, and that \"his faith cannot be wrong whose life is in the right.\" They proceed upon the supposition that man is naturally immortal; that piety and virtue are entitled to reward; and that therefore the pious and virtuous man, whatever be his belief, must undoubtedly inherit an eternal reward. But this is very fallacious reasoning. That piety and virtue are through the divine justice and benevolence entitled to reward, is indeed a truth incontrovertible; but that man who is of yesterday is naturally immortal; that a being who began to exist by the mere good will of his Maker, has in himself a principle of perpetual existence independent of that will—is a direct contradiction. Whatever began to be, can be continued in being only by the power, and according to the pleasure, of the infinite Creator; but it pleaded the Creator of his free grace at first to promise mankind eternal life, on the single condition of their first father's observing one positive precept. That precept was violated, and the free gift lost: but the covenant was renewed in Christ, who \"by his death hath abolished death, and by his resurrection hath brought to light life and immortality.\" The condition annexed to the gift of eternal life thus restored was faith; for \"being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.\" Faith therefore in the Son of God and Saviour of the world, is not only a condition, but the sole condition, of that justification which is peculiarly Christian; for since Christ, without any co-operation of ours, hath purchased for us the free gift of eternal life, we shall be guilty of the grossest ingratitude to our Divine Benefactor, and impiously claim an independence on God, if we look upon that gift either as a right inherent in our nature, or as a debt due to our meritorious deeds.\n\nBut though faith be the condition of justification, as but not of that implies the inheritance of eternal life, there are obtaining other conditions to be performed before a man can be put in possession of eternal felicity. By a law long prior to the promulgation of the gospel—a law interwoven with our very being—no man can enjoy the favour of his Maker, who does not make it his constant endeavour \"to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with his God.\" This law was in force before man fell; it continues to be in force now that he is redeemed; and it will not be abrogated even at that period when faith shall give place to vision, and hope to enjoyment. By the grace of the Christian covenant, all mankind are rendered immortal in consequence of the death and resurrection of Christ, who is the Lamb slain, in the divine decree, from the foundation of the world; but to obtain eternal happiness, they must observe the conditions both of natural and of revealed religion, which are repentance from dead works, and faith in Christ the Redeemer. The former is that condition upon which alone we can retain the Divine favour, and of course enjoy either present or future happiness; the latter is a most equitable acknowledgement required of us, that perpetual conscious existence is neither a right inherent in our nature, nor a debt due to our virtuous obedience, but merely the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n\"To make the distinct provinces of faith and works in the business of justification clear, let us suppose (says Bishop Warburton), that, at the publication of the gospel, all to whom the glad tidings of immortality were...\"\nwere offered on the condition of faith in Jesus had been moral or virtuous men, and on that account entitled (as natural religion teacheth) to the favour of God and an abundant reward; is it not self-evident, that faith alone, exclusive of the condition of good works, would, in that case, have been the very thing which justified or entitled them to life everlasting? But are good works, therefore, of no use in the Christian system? So far from it, that those only who serve God in sincerity and in truth are capable of the justification which faith alone embraces; for, to illustrate this matter by a familiar instance, suppose a British monarch to bestow, in free gift, a certain portion of his own domains, to which immortality may well be compared, upon such of his subjects as should perform a certain service to which they were not obliged by the laws of the kingdom; it is evident that the performance of this last service only would be the thing which entitled them to the free gift. Yet it is obvious that obedience to the laws, which gave them a claim to protection as subjects, in the enjoyment of their own property (to which the reward offered by natural religion may be compared), would be a previous and necessary qualification to their enjoyment of their new possession; since it is absurd to suppose that such a gift could be intended for rebels and traitors, or indeed for any but good and faithful servants of their king and country.\" Well therefore might the apostle reprove the ignorance or licentiousness of certain of his converts at Rome, in his question—\"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid! yea, we establish the law,\" obedience to it being the previous qualification of all who are entitled to the fruits of justifying faith—LIFE AND IMMORTALITY.\n\nHad proper attention been paid to this distinction, which St Paul everywhere makes between such duties as are common to all religions that are true, and those which are peculiar to the Christian revelation, many useless controversies might have been avoided respecting the instrument of justification and the conditions of the Christian covenant. By not attending to it, the divines of one school, who perceive that the mere belief of any truth whatever cannot entitle a man to eternal felicity, have almost dropt faith from their system of Christianity, and taught moral duties like pagan philosophers; whilst another party, who err almost as far in their interpretations of scripture, finding eternal life represented as the gift of God, and faith in Christ as the instrument or means by which that gift must be accepted, have extinguished from their system the necessity of good works, forgetting surely that wicked believers, like believing devils, may be doomed to an eternity of torments. But the sum of Christianity, as we are taught by the beloved disciple, is comprehended in this one commandment of God, \"that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another as He gave us commandment.\" In perfect harmony with him, the great apostle of the Gentiles affirms us, that \"in Christ Jesus nothing can avail to our eternal happiness but faith which worketh by love;\" and he informs Titus, that it \"is a true saying, and what he wills to be constantly affirmed, that they who have believed in God be careful to maintain good works.\"\n\nIndeed no man can have complete faith in Christ, who believes not the promises of the gospel; but all those promises, except the single one of a resurrection from the dead to perpetual conscious existence, are made to us upon the express condition that we obey the law of the gospel; \"for God will render to every man according to his deeds: to them that are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath; tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doth evil, of the Jew first and also of the Gentile; but glory, honour, and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first and also to the Gentile.\"*\n\nSuch are the notions of justification entertained by those who in the present age have been considered as the leaders† of the feet of Arminians. How far they are just, the reader must decide for himself; but under every view of this doctrine which we have taken, the Christian covenant appears much more gracious than that into which Adam was admitted in paradise: since the Christian affords room for repentance, even to that man, who sin may be so unhappy as to be drawn for a time into apostacy from the terms of the covenant. Whether the actual death of Christ therefore was a direct atonement for the actual sins of men, or only operated as such indirectly by procuring for them repeated opportunities of repentance, it is an undoubted truth, that \"if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.\" And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgement was of one offence to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offence to justification.\"\n\nThus graciously has the divine goodness displayed itself in the restoration of our lost inheritance. But it stood not here. The same bountiful Lord of life, for its further security, imparts to every true believer the strength and light of his holy spirit to support faith in working out our own salvation. Our blessed Saviour promised, before he left this world, to send to his followers the Holy Ghost or Comforter to abide with them for ever, to guide them into all truth, to bring all things to their remembrance whatsoever he had said unto them, and, as we learn from other passages of scripture, to \"work in them both to will and to do of his good pleasure.\" How amply this promise was fulfilled to the apostles, we have already seen; but we are not to suppose that it was restricted to them. As man is designed for a supernatural state in heaven, he stands in need of supernatural direction to guide him to that state. \"No man (says our Lord the Holy Saviour) can come to me except the Father draw him; for as no man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him, even so none knoweth the things of God but the Spirit of God.\" This omniscient Spirit indeed, \"searcheth all things, yea even the deep things of God,\" and revealeth them to the sons of men, to enlighten their understandings and purify their hearts. The grace which he sheds abroad is either external and general, or internal and particular. The former has been extended to the whole church of God under the patriarchal, Mosaic, and Christian dispensations, in such a revelation of the divine will as was sufficient to instruct men unto eternal life, whether they had a clear view or not of that stupendous plan of redemption, by which the kingdom of heaven was opened to them after the forfeiture of the terrestrial paradise; for there have been \"holy prophets ever since the world began;\"\nTheology began; and prophecy came not at any time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.* Hence it is that all scripture was given by inspiration of God to teach us every thing which it is necessary for us to know and believe; and the scripture is that work of the spirit which is extended to the universal church.\n\nBut the same spirit which thus generally reveals the object of faith to the church, does likewise particularly illuminate the minds of individual believers, working in them an assent to that which is taught them from the written word. It was thus that \"the Lord opened the heart of Lydia;\"† that the attended to the things which were spoken by Paul;‡ it is thus that \"the word preached doth not profit if it be not mixed with faith in them who hear it;\"§ and it is thus that \"God deals to every man the measure of faith;\"|| \"by grace are we saved through faith, which is not of ourselves; it is the gift of God.\"¶ This illumination of the Spirit was conveyed to the apostles \"in a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind,\" because it was meant to testify to the world that they were chosen ministers of the gospel; but the ordinary Christian receives it \"in the still small voice,\" because it is conveyed to him only to \"open his understanding that he may understand the scriptures.\"\n\nAnother operation of the Spirit on the minds of believers is that which is scripture is called regeneration; for \"according to his mercy God saveth us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost,\" which he sheds on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Lord.* To those who believe that we derive from Adam a corrupted nature, this particular grace must appear to absolutely necessary, that without it we could have no relish for heaven or heavenly things.¶ The natural man (we are told) receiveth not the things of the spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. Indeed whatever be the powers of our moral faculties, when compared with those of our first father, it is so long before they be completely developed, that we should infallibly be lost, if we were not blest by a supernatural guide, when reason is incapable of directing our conduct. Our passions and appetites are in their full strength before experience has furnished the mind with materials, by means of which motives may be weighed; and therefore it would be impossible, during the giddy period of youth, to keep them in due subjection, or to prevent vicious habits from being formed, were we not influenced by divine grace.\n\nSo true is it, that \"except a man be born again of water and of the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\" This change in our dispositions, from an immoderate attachment to earth to a relish for the things of heaven, is in scripture called \"a renewing of our minds, a new creation, a new man;\" in opposition to our natural disposition, which is called \"the old man, corrupted according to the deceitful lusts.\" The ancient fathers of the church, as well as some very eminent modern divines,† generally speak of baptism as the and Water-instrument in God's hand of man's regeneration; and for the truth of their opinion they appeal to John iii. 3, 5. Ephes. v. 25, 26. and 1 Cor. vi. 11. in which great itself is certainly laid on the washing of water, as well as on sanctification by the word.\n\nA third office of the Holy Spirit is to lead, direct, and govern us through all the periods of our lives. Without such a leader and guide, the temptations with which we are surrounded would certainly overcome us, and we should faint long before we arrive at the end of our journey. By the very constitution of our nature we guides are subjected in some degree to the influence of sense, through which the objects are present, whilst the enjoyments of heaven are future, and seem, as at a distance, only by the eye of faith; but \"the law of the Spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath made us free from the law of sin and death;\" for God worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure; and as many as are thus led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God; and while they walk in the Spirit, they do not fulfil the lusts of the flesh. Without the aid of the same Spirit, we could not even make our prayers acceptable; for since \"our confidence in God is, that he heareth us only when we ask anything according to his will; and since we know not what we should pray for as we ought, the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.* Romans viii.\n\nA fourth operation of the Holy Ghost, as he is the sanctifier of Christians, is to join them to Christ, and make them members of that one body of which he is the head. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body; and as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many are one body, so also is Christ. Hereby we unite them that God abideth in us, by the Spirit which he to Christ, hath given us; and as, in the ordinary course of his dealings with Christians, this Spirit is first given in baptism, so it is continued to the faithful by the instrumentality of the Lord's supper. That ordinance we have elsewhere (see Supper of the Lord) proved to be a federal rite; and surely no time can be supposed to highly sanctified for the reception of the graces of the Holy Spirit, as that in which we renew our federal union with our Lord and Master in the communion of his body and blood.\n\nIt is likewise the office of the Holy Ghost to give us an earnest of our everlasting inheritance, to create in us a sense of the paternal love of God, and thereby to assure us of the adoption of sons. As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God; and because we are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his Son into our hearts. For we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but we have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father; the Spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God! Gal. iv. 6.\n\nAs the gifts of grace are generally annexed to means to the proper use of the word and sacraments, it is a fifth office of the same Spirit to sanctify such persons as are regularly set apart for the work of the ministry, and ordained to offer up the public prayers of the people; to bless them in the name of God; to teach the doctrines and sanctify of the gospel; to administer the sacraments instituted by Christ; and to perform all things necessary for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, ministers for the edifying of the body of Christ. The same Spirit which illuminated the apostles, and endowed them with power from above to perform personally their apostolic functions, fitted them also for sending others, as they were sent by their Divine Master; and for establishing...\nnot conceivable that a particular providence can be ad-\nministered without the influence of the Deity on the\nminds of men. That the poets and philosophers of the\nheathen world derived these notions from primeval tra-\ndition, cannot, we think, be questioned; but if they\nwere absurd in themselves, or apparently contradictory\nto the laws of nature, they would not surely have been so\nuniversally embraced; for it will scarcely be denied,\nthat Socrates and Cicero were men of as great natural\nlagacity as Pelagius or any of his followers. It is in-\ndeed so far from being incredible that the Father of\nspirits occasionally directs the thoughts and actions of\nmen, that we believe there are very few who have made\nobservations on themselves and their own affairs, who\nhave not found, on reflection, many instances in which\ntheir usual judgement and sense of things were over-\nruled, they know not how or why; and that the ac-\ntions which they performed in those circumstances have\nhad consequences very remarkable in their general hi-\nstory. See PROVIDENCE, No 18, 19.\n\nThis being the case, why should the pride of Chri-\nstians make them hesitate to admit, on the authority of\ndivine revelation, what Socrates, and Plutarch, and Ci-\ncero, and all the virtuous and wise men of antiquity, ad-\nmitted in effect, on no better evidence than that of\noral tradition, supported by their own meditations on\ntheir own thoughts, and the principles of their own\nconduct? Is it that they see not such beneficial effects\nof Christianity as to induce them to believe the profes-\nsors of that religion to be indeed \"chosen to salvation\nthrough the sanctification of the Spirit + ?\" Let them\nstudy the practical precepts of the gospel, consider the\nconsequences which they have had on the peace and\nhappiness of society, and compare the general conduct\nof Christians with that of the Jews, Pagans, and Maho-\nmetans (see RELIGION), and they will doubtless find\nreason to alter their opinion; and let those who em-\nbrace the truth, remember, that as they are the temple\nof God, if the Spirit of God dwell in them, \"it is their\nindispensable duty to cleanse themselves from all filthi-\nness of the flesh and spirit; to follow peace with all men,\nand holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord;\nand to work out their own salvation with fear and trem-\nbling, since it is God who worketh in them both to will\nand to do of his good pleasure.\"\n\nFrom this short view of the several dispensations of\nthe revealed religion, it is evident that the gospel is not on the last rea-\nson but the last gift of the kind which man has rea-\nson to expect from his Maker; that the scheme of re-\nvelation is completed; and that the pretences of Mahomet\nand of more modern enthusiasts to divine inspiration are\nnot only false, but fraught with contradictions. All\nthese men admit the divine origin of the Mosaic and\nChristian religions; but it appears from the scriptures,\nin which those religions are taught, that the system of\nrevealed truths which constitute the Patriarchal, Mo-\nsaic, and Christian revelations, commenced with the fall\nof man, and that it must therefore necessarily end with\nhis restoration to life and immortality by the sacrifice of\nChrist upon the cross. A new revelation therefore like-\nthat of Mahomet cannot be admitted without rejecting\nthe whole Bible, though the impostor himself every-\nwhere acknowledges the inspiration of Abraham, of\nMoses, and of Christ. Nor is greater regard due to\nthe claims of Christian enthusiasts. Such as pretend to\nhave\nTHEOPHRASTA, a genus of plants belonging to the class pentandria. See Botany Index.\n\nTHEOPHRASTUS, the philosopher, was born about 371 years before Christ, and was successively the disciple of Plato and of Aristotle. He succeeded Aristotle in the Peripatetic school, and conducted the charge with such high reputation that he had about 2000 scholars. He is highly celebrated for his industry, learning, and eloquence; and for his generosity and public spirit. He is said to have twice freed his country from the oppression of tyrants. He contributed liberally towards defraying the expense attending the public meetings of philosophers; which were held, not for the sake of show, but for learned and ingenious conversation. In the public schools he commonly appeared, as Aristotle had done, in an elegant dress, and was very attentive to the graces of elocution. He lived to the advanced age of 85: some say of 107. Towards the close of his life, he grew exceedingly infirm, and was carried to the school on a couch. He expressed great regret on account of the shortness of life; and complained that nature had given long life to stags and crows, to whom it is of so little value, and had denied it to man, who, in a longer duration, might have been able to attain the summit of science; but now, as soon as he arrives within sight of it, is taken away. His last advice to his disciples was, that, since it is the lot of man to die as soon as he begins to live, they would take more pains to enjoy life as it passes, than to acquire posthumous fame. His funeral was attended by a large body of Athenians. He wrote many valuable works, of which all that remain are, several treatises on the Natural History of Plants and Fossils; Of Winds, Of Fire, &c. a rhetorical work entitled \"Characters,\" and a few Metaphysical Fragments.\n\nTo Theophrastus we are indebted for preserving the works of Aristotle. See Aristotle.\n\nTHEOPOMPUS, a celebrated Greek orator and historian, was born in the island Chios, and flourished in the reign of Alexander the Great. He was one of the most famous of all the disciples of Isocrates, and won the prize from all the panegyrists whom Artemisia invited to praise Mausolus. He wrote several works, which are lost.\n\nTHEOREM, a proposition which terminates in theory, and which considers the properties of things already made or done; or it is a speculative proposition deduced from comparing together several definitions. A theorem is something to be proved, and a problem something to be done.\n\nTHEORETIC, something relating to theory, or that terminates in speculation.\n\nTHEORY, in general, denotes any doctrine which terminates in speculation, without considering the practical uses or application thereof.\n\nTHEOSOPHISTS, a sect of men who pretend to derive all their knowledge from divine illumination. They boast that, by means of this celestial light, they are not only admitted to the intimate knowledge of God, and of all divine truth, but have access to the most sublime secrets of nature. They ascribe it to the singular manifestation of divine benevolence, that they are able to make such use of the element of fire, in the chemical art, as enables them to discover the essential principles of bodies, and to disclose stupendous mysteries in the physical world. They even pretend to an acquaintance with those celestial beings which form the medium of intercourse between God and man, and to a power of obtaining from them, by the aid of magic, astrology, and other similar arts, various kinds of information and assistance.\n\nTo this class belonged Paracelsus, Robert Fludd, Jacob Boehmen, Van Helmont, Peter Poiret, and the Rosicrucians. They are also called Fire-Philosophers.\n\nTHERAPEUTÆ, a term applied to those that are wholly in the service of religion. This general term has been applied to particular sects of men, concerning whom there have been great disputes among the learned.\n\nTHERAPEUTICS, that part of medicine which acquaints us with the rules that are to be observed, and the medicines to be employed, in the cure of diseases.\n\nTHERMÆ, hot baths or bagnios. Luxury and extravagance were in nothing carried to such heights as in the thermae of the Roman emperors. Ammian complains, that they were built to such an extent as to equal whole provinces; from which Valerius would abate, by reading pefine instead of province. And yet after all, the remains of some still standing are sufficient testimonies for Ammian's censure; and the accounts transmitted of their ornaments and furniture, such as being laid with precious stones (Seneca), set round with seats of solid silver (Pliny), with pipes and cisterns of the same metal (Statius), add to, rather than take from, the censure. The most remarkable bagnios were those of Diocletian and Caracalla at Rome, great part of which remains at this day; the lofty arches, flatly pillars, variety of foreign marble, curious vaulting of the roofs, great number of spacious apartments, all attract the curiosity of...\nof the traveller. They had also their summer and winter baths.\n\nTHERMOMETER, an instrument for measuring the degree of heat or cold in any body.\n\nThe thermometer was invented about the beginning of the 17th century; but, like many other useful inventions, it has been found impossible to ascertain to whom the honour of it belongs. Boerhaave* attributes it to Cornelius Drebbel of Alcmar, his own countryman. Fulgenzius† attributes it to his master Paul Sarpi, the great oracle of the Venetian republic; and Viviani gives the honour of it to Galileo‡. But all these are posthumous claims. Sanctorio|| claims this honour to himself; and his assertion is corroborated by Borelli§ and Malpighi ‡ of the Florentine academy, whose partiality is not to be suspected in favour of a member of the Patavian school.\n\nPerhaps the best way to reconcile these different claims would be, to suppose that the thermometer was really invented by different persons about the same time. We know that there are certain periods in the progress of the arts when the stream of human genius runs in the same direction, and moves towards the same object. That part of the current which reaches the object first may possess the title; but the other parts follow so rapidly and arrive too soon after, that it is impossible for a spectator to decide which is first in point of time.\n\nThe first form of this instrument for measuring the degrees of heat and cold, was the air-thermometer. It is a well known fact that air expands with heat so as to occupy more space than it does when cold, and that it is condensed by cold so as to occupy less space than when warmed, and that this expansion and condensation is greater or less according to the degree of heat or cold applied. The principle then on which the air-thermometer was constructed is very simple. The air was confined in a tube by means of some coloured liquor; the liquor rose or fell according as the air became expanded or condensed. What the first form of the tube was, cannot now perhaps be well known; but the following description of the air-thermometer will fully explain its nature.\n\nThe air-thermometer consists of a glass tube BE, connected at one end with a large glass ball A, and at the other end immersed in an open vessel, or terminating in a ball DE, with a narrow orifice at D; which vessel, or ball, contains any coloured liquor that will not easily freeze. Aquafortis tinged of a fine blue colour with a solution of vitriol or copper, or spirit of wine tinged with cochineal, will answer this purpose. But the ball A must be first moderately warmed so that a part of the air contained in it may be expelled through the orifice D; and then the liquor pressed by the weight of the atmosphere will enter the ball DE, and rise, for example, to the middle of the tube at C, at a mean temperature of the weather; and in this state the liquor by its weight, and the air included in the ball A, &c., by its elasticity, will counterbalance the weight of the atmosphere. As the surrounding air becomes warmer, the air in the ball and upper part of the tube, expanding by heat, will drive the liquor into the lower ball, and consequently its surface will descend; on the contrary, as the ambient air becomes colder, that in the ball is condensed, and the liquor pressed by the weight of the atmosphere will ascend: so that the liquor in the tube will ascend or descend more or less according to the state of the air contiguous to the instrument. To the tube is affixed a scale of the same length, divided upwards and downwards from the middle C into 100 equal parts, by means of which the ascent and descent of the liquor in the tube, and consequently the variations in the cold or heat of the atmosphere, may be observed.\n\nThis instrument was extremely defective; for the air in the tube was not only affected by the heat and cold of the atmosphere, but also by its weight.\n\nThe air being found improper for measuring with accuracy the variations of heat and cold according to the form of the thermometer which was first adopted, another fluid was proposed about the middle of the 17th century by the Florentine academy. This fluid was spirit of wine, or alcohol, as it is now generally named. The alcohol being coloured, was inclosed in a very fine cylindrical glass tube previously exhausted of its air, having a hollow ball at one end A, and hermetically sealed at the other end D. The ball and tube are filled with rectified spirit of wine to a convenient height, as to C, when the weather is of a mean temperature, which may be done by inverting the tube into a vessel of flagrant coloured spirit, under a receiver of the air-pump, or in any other way. When the thermometer is properly filled, the end D is heated red hot by a lamp, and then hermetically sealed, leaving the included air of about one-third of its natural density, to prevent the air which is in the spirit from dividing it in its expansion. To the tube is applied a scale, divided from the middle, into 100 equal parts, upwards and downwards.\n\nAs spirit of wine is capable of a very considerable degree of rarefaction and condensation by heat and cold, when the heat of the atmosphere increases the spirit dilutes, and consequently rises in the tube; and when the heat decreases, the spirit descends, and the degree or quantity of the motion is shown by a scale.\n\nThe spirit of wine thermometer was not subject to its defects, some of the inconveniences which attended the air thermometer. In particular, it was not affected by variations in the weight of the atmosphere: accordingly it soon came into general use among philosophers. It was, Martinez at an early period, introduced into Britain by Mr Boyle. Ephys.\n\nTo this instrument, as then used, there are, however, many objections. The liquor was of different degrees of strength, and therefore different tubes filled with it, when exposed to the same degree of heat, would not correspond. There was also another defect: the scale which was adjusted to the thermometer did not commence at any fixed point. The highest term was adjusted to the great sunshine heats of Florence, which are too variable and undetermined; and frequently the workman formed the scale according to his own fancy. While the thermometer laboured under such disadvantages it could not be of general use.\n\nTo obtain some fixed unalterable point by which a determined scale might be discovered, to which all thermometers might be accurately adjusted, was the subject propounded by which next drew the attention of philosophers. Mr Boyle, who seems at an early period to have studied this subject with much anxiety, propounded the freezing of the essential oil of anniseeds as a convenient point for graduating thermometers; but this opinion he soon laid aside. Dr Halley next proposed that thermometers should\nshould be graduated in a deep pit under ground, where the temperature both in winter and summer is pretty uniform; and that the point to which the spirit of wine should rise in such a subterraneous place should be the point from which the scale should commence. But this proposal was evidently attended with such inconveniences that it was soon abandoned. He made experiments on the boiling point of water, of mercury, and of spirit of wine; and he seems rather to give a preference to the spirit of wine*. He objected to the freezing of water as a fixed point, because he thought that it admitted considerable latitude.\n\nIt seems to have been referred to the all-conquering genius of Sir Isaac Newton to determine this important point, on which the accuracy and value of the thermometer depends. He chose, as fixed, those points at which water freezes and boils; the very points which the experiments of succeeding philosophers have determined to be the most fixed and convenient. Sensible of the disadvantages of spirit of wine, he tried another liquor which was homogeneous enough, capable of a considerable rarefaction, about 15 times greater than spirit of wine. This was linseed oil. It has not been observed to freeze even in very great colds, and it bears a heat about four times that of water before it boils. With these advantages it was made use of by Sir Isaac Newton, who discovered by it the comparative degree of heat for boiling water, melting wax, boiling spirit of wine, and melting tin; beyond which it does not appear that this thermometer was applied. The method he used for adjusting the scale of this oil thermometer was as follows: Supposing the bulb, when immersed in thawing snow, to contain 10,000 parts, he found the oil expand by the heat of the human body so as to take up \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)th more space, or 10,256 such parts; and by the heat of water boiling strongly 10,725; and by the heat of melting tin 11,516. So that reckoning the freezing point as a common limit between heat and cold, he began his scale there, marking it 0, and the heat of the human body he made 12°; and consequently, the degrees of heat being proportional to the degrees of rarefaction, or \\( 256 : 725 :: 12 : 34 \\), this number 34 will express the heat of boiling water; and by the same rule, 72 that of melting tin†. This thermometer was constructed in 1701.\n\nTo the application of oil as a measure of heat and cold, there are insuperable objections. It is so viscous, that it adheres too strongly to the sides of the tube. On this account it ascends and descends too slowly in case of a sudden heat or cold. In a sudden cold, so great a portion remains adhering to the sides of the tube after the rest has subsided, that the surface appears lower than the corresponding temperature of the air requires. An oil thermometer is therefore not a proper measure of heat and cold.\n\nAll the thermometers hitherto proposed were liable to many inconveniences, and could not be considered as exact standards for pointing out the various degrees of temperature. This led Reaumur to attempt a new one, an account of which was published in the year 1730 in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences. This thermometer was made with spirit of wine. He took a large ball and tube, the dimensions and capacities of which were known; he then graduated the tube, so that the space from one division to another might contain 1000th part of the liquor; the liquor containing 1000 parts when it stood at the freezing point. He adjusted the thermometer to the freezing point by an artificial congelation of water: then putting the ball of spirit of wine into boiling water, he observed whether it rose 80 divisions; if it exceeded these, he changed his liquor, and by adding water lowered it, till upon trial it should just rise 80 divisions; or if the liquor, being too low, fell short of 80 divisions, he raised it by adding rectified spirit to it. The liquor thus prepared suited his purpose, and served for making a thermometer of any size, whose scale would agree with his standard.\n\nThis thermometer was far from being perfect. As its defects, the bulbs were three or four inches in diameter, the surrounding ice would be melted before its temperature could be propagated to the whole spirits in the bulb, and consequently the freezing point would be marked higher than it should be. Dr Martine accordingly found, that instead of coinciding with the 32nd degree of Fahrenheit, it corresponded with the 34th, or a point a little above it. Reaumur committed a mistake also respecting the boiling point; for he thought that the spirit of wine, whether weak or strong, when immersed in boiling water, received the same degree of heat with the boiling water. But it is well known that highly rectified spirit of wine cannot be heated much beyond the 173rd degree of Fahrenheit, while boiling water raises the quicksilver 37 degrees higher. There is another thermometer that goes by the name of Reaumur's, which shall be afterwards described.\n\nAt length a different fluid was proposed, by which Mercurial thermometers could be made free from most of the defects hitherto mentioned. This fluid was mercury, and seems first to have occurred to Dr Halley in the last century; but was not adopted by him on account of its having a smaller degree of expansibility than the other fluids used at that time*. Boerhaave says that the mercurial thermometer was first constructed by Olaus Roemer; but the honour of this invention is generally given to Fahrenheit of Amsterdam, who presented an account of it to the Royal Society of London in 1724.\n\nThat we may judge the more accurately of the propriety of employing mercury, we will compare its qualities with those of the fluids already mentioned, air, alcohol, and oil.\n\nAir is the most expandable fluid, but it does not receive nor part with its heat so quickly as mercury. Alcohol does not expand much by heat. In its ordinary state it does not bear a much greater heat than 173° of Fahrenheit; but when highly rectified it can bear a greater degree of cold than any other liquor hitherto employed as a measure of temperature. At Hudson's Bay, Mr Macnab, by a mixture of vitriolic acid and snow, made it to descend to 69 below 0 of Fahrenheit. This is an inconvenience, however, attending the use of this liquor; it is not possible to get it always of the same degree of strength. As to oil, its expansion is about 15 times greater than that of alcohol; it sustains a heat of 600°, and its freezing point is so low that it has not been determined; but its viscosity renders it useless.\n\nMercury is superior to alcohol and oil, and is much more manageable than air. 1. As far as the experiments of mercury,\nments already made can determine, it is of all the fluids hitherto employed in the construction of thermometers, that which measures most exactly equal differences of heat by equal differences of its bulk: its dilatations are in fact very nearly proportional to the augmentations of heat applied to it (A). 2. Of all liquids it is the most easily freed from air. 3. It is fitted to measure high degrees of heat and cold. It sustains a heat of 60° of Fahrenheit's scale, and does not congeal till it fall 30 or 40 degrees below 0°. 4. It is the most sensible of any fluid to heat and cold, even air not excepted. Count Rumford found that mercury was heated from the freezing to the boiling point in 8 seconds, while water took two minutes 13 seconds, and common air 10 minutes and 17 seconds. 5. Mercury is a homogeneous fluid, and every portion of it is equally dilated or contracted by equal variations of heat. Any one thermometer made of pure mercury is, cæteris paribus, possessed of the same properties with every other thermometer made of pure mercury. Its power of expansion is indeed about six times less than that of spirit of wine, but it is great enough to answer most of the purposes for which a thermometer is wanted.\n\nThe fixed points which are now universally chosen for adjusting thermometers to a scale, and to one another, are the boiling and freezing water points. The boiling water point, it is well known, is not an invariable point, but varies some degrees according to the weight and temperature of the atmosphere. In an exhausted receiver, water will boil with a heat of 98° or 100°; whereas in Papin's digester it will require a heat of 412°. Hence it appears that water will boil at a lower point, according to its height in the atmosphere, or to the weight of the column of air which presses upon it. In order to ensure uniformity therefore in the construction of thermometers, it is now agreed that the bulb of the tube be plunged in the water when it boils violently, the barometer standing at 30 English inches (which is its mean height round London), and the temperature of the atmosphere 55°. A thermometer made in this way, with its boiling point at 212°, is called by Dr Horsley Bird's Fahrenheit, because Mr Bird was the first person who attended to the state of the barometer in constructing thermometers.\n\nAs artists may be often obliged to adjust thermometers' rules for under very different pressures of the atmosphere, philo-adapting sophers have been at pains to discover a general rule which might be applied on all occasions. M. de Luc, in his \"Recherches sur les Mod. de l'Atmosphère\" from a series of experiments, has given an equation for the allowance on account of this difference, in Paris measure, which has been verified by Sir George Shuckburgh *; also * Phil. Trans. for Dr Horsley, Dr Mackelyne, and Sir George Shuckburgh, have adapted the equation and rules to English and measures, and have reduced the allowances into tables, for the use of the artist. Dr Horsley's rule, deduced from De Luc's, is this:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{99}{8990000} \\log_{10} x - 92.804 = h.\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) denotes the height of a thermometer plunged in boiling water, above the point of melting ice, in degrees of Bird's Fahrenheit, and \\( x \\) the height of the barometer in 10ths of an inch. From this rule he has computed the following table, for finding the heights, to which a good Bird's Fahrenheit will rise when plunged in boiling water, in all states of the barometer, from 27 to 31 English inches; which will serve, among other uses, to direct instrument-makers in making a true allowance for the effect of the variation of the barometer, if they should be obliged to finish a thermometer at a time when the barometer is above or below 30 inches; though it is best to fix the boiling point when the barometer is at that height.\n\n---\n\n(A) We have affirmed that the expansions of the bulk of quicksilver by heat are nearly (for they are not strictly so) in a regular arithmetical progression, according to the quantity of heat it is exposed to; and such seems to be the case according to the Table published by Mr de Luc, at page 309 of his first volume on the Modifications of the Atmosphere. The following extract of this table shows these variations: and the first and second differences are added, in order to render these irregularities more sensible. They are such as can hardly be conceived from the nature of any substance, without the influence of extraneous and accidental causes, which may have escaped the eye, vol. ii. attention of the observer; neither have they been found exactly true by Dr Crawford. Mr de Luc supposes the whole heat from melting ice to that of boiling water to be divided into 80 parts; by the fractional subdivisions of which he expresses the absolute quantities of heat, answering to each 5 or 10 degrees of Reaumur's thermometer (22.5 of Fahrenheit's scale); so that the whole sum of these fractions amounts exactly to the assumed number 80. They are as follow:\n\n| Degrees | Reaumur's Thermometer | Fahrenheit's Thermometer | Quantities of heat | First differences | Second differences |\n|---------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 80      |                       |                          |                   |                  |                  |\n| 70      |                       |                          |                   |                  |                  |\n| 60      |                       |                          |                   |                  |                  |\n| 50      |                       |                          |                   |                  |                  |\n| 40      |                       |                          |                   |                  |                  |\n| 30      |                       |                          |                   |                  |                  |\n| 20      |                       |                          |                   |                  |                  |\n| 10      |                       |                          |                   |                  |                  |\n| 0       |                       |                          |                   |                  |                  |\n\n---\n\n*Phil.
