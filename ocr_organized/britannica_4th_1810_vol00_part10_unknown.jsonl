In which sense the word stands opposed to immaterial. See MATTER and METAPHYSICS.\n\nMATERIALISTS, a sect in the ancient church, composed of persons who, being prepossessed with that maxim in the ancient philosophy, *Ex nihilo nihil fit*, \"Out of nothing nothing can arise,\" had recourse to an internal matter, on which they supposed God wrought in the creation; instead of admitting God alone as the sole cause of the existence of all things. Tertullian vigorously opposes the doctrine of the materialists in his treatise against Hermogenes, who was one of their number.\n\nMaterialists is also a name given to those who maintain that the soul of man is material; or that the principle of perception and thought is not a substance distinct from the body, but the result of corporeal organization: See METAPHYSICS. There are others, called by this name, who have maintained that there is nothing but matter in the universe; and that the Deity himself is material. See SPINOZA.\n\nMATHEMATICS.\n\nMathematics is divided into two kinds, pure and mixed. In pure mathematics magnitude is considered in the abstract; and as they are founded on the simplest notions of quantity, the conclusions to which they lead have the same evidence and certainty as the elementary principles from which these conclusions are deduced. This branch of mathematics comprehends; 1. Arithmetic, which treats of the properties of numbers. 2. Geometry, which treats of extension as endowed with three dimensions, length, breadth, and thickness, without considering the physical qualities inseparable from bodies in their natural state. 3. Algebra, sometimes called universal arithmetic, which compares together all kinds of quantities, whatever be their value. 4. The direct and inverse method of Fluxions (called on the continent, the differential and integral calculus), which consider magnitudes as divided into two kinds, constant and variable, the variable magnitudes being generated by motion; and which determines the value of quantities from the velocities of the motions with which they are generated. Mixed Mathematics is the application of pure mathematics to certain established physical principles, and comprehends all the phycico-mathematical sciences, namely, 1. Mechanics; 2. Hydrodynamics; 3. Optics; 4. Astronomy; 5. Acoustics; 6. Electricity, and 7. Magnetism. The history of these various branches of science having been given at full length, we shall at present direct the attention of the reader to the origin and progress of pure mathematics.\n\nIn attempting to discover the origin of arithmetic and geometry, it would be a fruitless task to conduct the reader into those ages of fable which preceded the records of authentic history. Our means of information upon this subject are extremely limited and imperfect; and it would but ill accord with the dignity of a science whose principles and conclusions are alike irresistible, to found its history upon conjecture and fable. But notwithstanding this obscurity in which the early history of the sciences is enveloped, one thing appears certain that arithmetic and geometry, and some branches of the physical sciences, had made considerable progress in Egypt, when the mysteries and the theology of that favoured kingdom were transplanted into Greece. It is highly probable that much natural and moral knowledge was taught in the Eleusinian and Dionysian mysteries, which the Greeks borrowed from the Egyptians, and that several of the Grecian philosophers were induced by this circumstance to travel into Egypt, in search of those higher degrees of knowledge, which an acquaintance with the Egyptian mysteries had taught them to anticipate. We accordingly find Thales and Pythagoras successively under the tuition of the Egyptian priests, and returning into Greece loaded with the intellectual treasures of Egypt. By the establishment of the Ionian school at Miletus, Thales instructed his countrymen in the knowledge which he had received, and gave birth to that spirit of investigation and discovery with which his followers were inspired. He taught them the method of ascertaining the height of the pyramids of Memphis by the length of their shadows; and there is reason to believe that he was the first\nfirst who employed the circumference of a circle for the\nmenfuration of angles. That he was the author of\ngreater discoveries, which have been either lost or a-\nscribed to others, there can be little doubt; but these\nare the only facts in the history of Thales which time\nhas spared.\n\n3. The science of arithmetic was one of the chief\nbranches of the Pythagorean discipline. Pythagoras\nattached several mysterious virtues to certain combina-\ntions of numbers. He swore by four, which he regard-\ned as the chief of numbers. In the number three he\nsupposed many wonderful properties to exist; and he\nregarded a knowledge of arithmetic as the chief good.\nBut of all Pythagoras's discoveries in arithmetic, none\nhave reached our times but his multiplication table. In\ngeometry, however, the philosopher of Samos seems to\nhave been more successful. The discovery of the ce-\nlebrated proposition which forms the 47th of the first\nbook of Euclid's Elements, that in every right-angled\ntriangle the square of the side subtending the right\nangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other\ntwo sides, has immortalized his name; and whether we\nconsider the inherent beauty of the proposition, or the\nextent of its application in the mathematical sciences,\nwe cannot fail to class it among the most important\ntruths in geometry. From this proposition its author\nconcluded that the diagonal of a square is incommen-\nsurate to its side; and thus gave occasion to the dis-\ncovery of several general properties of other incom-\nmensurate lines and numbers.\n\n4. In the time which elapsed between the birth of Py-\nthagoras and the destruction of the Alexandrian school,\nthe mathematical sciences were cultivated with great\nardour and success. Many of the elementary propositions\nof geometry were discovered during this period; but hi-\nstory does not enable us to refer each discovery to its\nproper author. The method of letting fall a perpendi-\ncular upon a right line from a given point (Euclid, B.\n1, prop. xi.)—of dividing an angle into two equal parts,\n(Euclid, B.I. prop. ix.)—and of making an angle equal\nto a given angle, (Euclid B. I. prop. xxiii.) were in-\nvented by Oenopides of Chios. About the same time\nZenodorus, some of whose writings have been preserved\nby Theon in his commentary on Ptolemy, demonstrated,\nin opposition to the opinion then entertained, that iso-\nperimetric figures have equal areas. Coeval with this\ndiscovery was the theory of regular bodies, for which\nwe are indebted to the Pythagorean school.\n\n5. About this time the celebrated problem of the du-\nplication of the cube began to occupy the attention of\nthe Greek geometers. In this problem it was required\nto construct a cube whose solid content should be\ndouble that of a given cube; and the assistance of no\nother instrument but the rule and compasses was to be\nemployed. The origin of this problem has been as-\ncribed by tradition to a demand of one of the Grecian\ndeities. The Athenians having offered some affront to\nApollo, were afflicted with a dreadful pestilence; and\nupon consulting the oracle at Delos, received for an-\nswer, Double the altar of Apollo. The altar alluded to\nhappened to be cubical; and the problem, supposed to\nbe of divine origin, was investigated with ardour by the\nGreek geometers, though it afterwards baffled all their\nattempts. The solution of this difficulty was attempt-\ned by Hippocrates of Chios. He discovered, that if\ntwo mean proportionals could be found between the\nside of the given cube, and the double of that side, the\nfirst of these proportionals would be the side of the\ncube sought. In order to effect this, Plato invented an\ninstrument composed of two rules, one of which moved\nin grooves cut in two arms at right angles to the\nother, so as always to continue parallel with it; but as\nthis method was mechanical, and likewise supposed\nthe description of a curve of the third order, it did not\nsatisfy the ancient geometers. The doctrine of conic\nsections, which was at this time introduced into geo-\nmetry by Plato, and which was so widely extended as\nto receive the name of the higher geometry, was success-\nfully employed in the problem of doubling the cube.\nMenechmus found that the two mean proportionals men-\ntioned by Hippocrates, might be considered as the ordi-\nnates of two conic sections, which being constructed ac-\ncording to the conditions of the problem, would intersect\none another in two points proper for the solution of the\nproblem. The question having assumed this form, gave\nrise to the theory of geometrical loci, of which so many\nimportant applications have been made. In doubling\nthe cube, therefore, we have only to employ the instru-\nments which have been invented for describing the\nconic sections by one continued motion. It was after-\nwards found, that instead of employing two conic sec-\ntions, the problem could be solved by the intersection of\nthe circle of the parabola. Succeeding geometers em-\nployed other curves for this purpose, such as the con-\nchoid of Nicomedes and the cissoid of Diocles, &c. A.C. 280.\nAn ingenious method of finding the two mean propor-\ntionals, without the aid of the conic sections, was after-\nwards given by Pappus in his mathematical collections.\n\n6. Another celebrated problem, to trisect an angle, was agitated in the school of Plato. It was found that this division of an angle\ndepended upon principles analogous to those of the duplication of the cube, and that it could be con-\nstructed either by the intersection of two conic sections,\nor by the intersection of a circle with a parabola.\nWithout the aid of the conic sections, it was reduced to\nthis simple proposition:—To draw a line to a semicircle\nfrom a given point, which line shall cut its circumference,\nand the prolongation of the diameter that forms its base, so that the part of the line comprehended be-\ntween the two points of intersection shall be equal to\nthe radius. From this proposition several easy construc-\ntions may be derived. Dinostratus of the Platonic\nschool, and the contemporary of Menechmus, invented\na curve by which the preceding problem might be solved.\nIt had the advantage also of giving the multiplication of\nan angle, and the quadrature of the circle, from which it\nderived the name of quadratrix.\n\n7. While Hippocrates of Chios was paving the way for Hippo-\ncrates's method of doubling the cube, which was afterwards given by Pappus, he distinguished himself by the qua-\ndrature of the lunule of the circle; and had from this circumstantial honour of being the first who found a curvilinear area equal to a space bounded by right lines. He was likewise the author of Elements of Geo-\nmetry, a work, which, though highly approved of by his contemporaries, has shared the same fate with some of the most valuable productions of antiquity.\n\n8. After the conic sections had been introduced into geometry by Plato, they received many important ad-\nditions from Eudoxus, Menechmus, and Aristotle. The latter\nlatter of these philosophers wrote five books on conic sections, which, unfortunately for science, have not reached our times.\n\n9. About this time appeared Euclid's Elements of Geometry, a work which has been employed for 2000 years in teaching the principles of mathematics, and which is still reckoned the most complete work upon the subject. Peter Ramus has ascribed to Theon both the propositions and the demonstrations in Euclid. It has been the opinion of others that the propositions belong to Euclid, and the demonstrations to Theon, while others have given to Euclid the honour of both. It seems most probable, however, that Euclid merely collected and arranged the geometrical knowledge of the ancients, and that he supplied many new propositions in order to form that chain of reasoning which runs through his elements. This great work of the Greek geometer consists of fifteen books: the eleven first books contain the elements of pure geometry, and the rest contain the general theory of ratios, and the leading properties of commensurate and incommensurate numbers.\n\n10. Archimedes, the greatest geometer among the ancients, flourished about half a century after Euclid. He was the first who found the ratio between the diameter of a circle and its circumference; and, by a method of approximation, he determined this ratio to be as 7 to 22. This result was obtained by taking an arithmetical mean between the perimeters of the inscribed and circumscribed polygon, and is sufficiently accurate for every practical purpose. Many attempts have since been made to assign the precise ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter; but in the present state of geometry this problem does not seem to admit of a solution. The limits of this article will not permit us to enlarge upon the discoveries of the philosopher of Syracuse. We can only state, that he discovered the superficies of a sphere to be equal to the convex surface of the circumscribed cylinder, or to the area of four of its great circles, and that the solidity of the sphere is to that of the cylinder as 3 to 2. He discovered that the solidity of the paraboloid is one half that of the circumscribed cylinder, and that the area of the parabola is two thirds that of the circumscribed rectangle; and he was the first who pointed out the method of drawing tangents and forming spirals. These discoveries are contained in his works on the dimension of the circle, on the sphere and cylinder, on conoids and spheroids, and on spiral lines. Archimedes was so fond of his discovery of the proportion between the solidity of the sphere and that of the cylinder, that he ordered to be placed upon his tomb a sphere inscribed in a cylinder, and likewise the numbers which express the ratio of these solids.\n\n11. While geometry was thus advancing with such rapid steps, Apollonius Pergaeus, so called from being born at Perga in Pamphylia, followed in the steps of Archimedes, and widely extended the boundaries of the science. In addition to several mathematical works, which are now lost, Apollonius wrote a treatise on the theory of the conic sections, which contains all their properties with relation to their axes, their diameters, and their tangents. He demonstrated the celebrated theorem, that the parallelogram described about the two conjugate diameters of an ellipse or hyperbola is equal to the rectangle described round the two axes, and that the sum or difference of the squares of the two conjugate diameters are equal to the sum or difference of the squares of the two axes. In his fifth book he determines the greatest and the least lines that can be drawn to the circumferences of the conic sections from a given point, whether this point is situated in or cut off the axis. This work, which contains everywhere the deepest marks of an inventive genius, procured for its author the appellation of the Great Geometer.\n\n12. There is some reason to believe, that the Egyptians Menelaus were a little acquainted with plane trigonometry; and writers on there can be no doubt that it was known to the Greeks, spherical trigonometry, which is a more difficult part of geometry, does not seem to have made any progress till the time of Menelaus, an excellent geometrician and astronomer. In his work on spherical triangles, he gives the method of constructing them, and of resolving most of the cases which were necessary in the ancient astronomy. An introduction to spherical trigonometry had already been given to the world by Theodorus in his Sphaerics, where he examines the relative properties of different circles formed by cutting a sphere in all directions.\n\n13. Though the Greeks had made great progress in the science of geometry, they do not seem to have hitherto considered quantity in its general or abstract state. In the writings of Plato we can discover something like traces of geometrical analysis; and in the seventh proposition of Archimedes's work on the sphere and the cylinder, these traces are more distinctly marked. He reasons about unknown magnitudes as if they were known, and he finally arrives at an analogy, which, when put into the language of algebra, gives an equation of the third degree, which leads to the solution of the problem.\n\n14. It was reserved, however, for Diophantus to lay the foundation of the modern analysis, by his invention of the analysis of indeterminate problems; for the method which he employed in the resolution of these problems has a striking analogy to the present mode of resolving Diophantine equations of the 1st and 2nd degrees. He was likewise the author of thirteen books on arithmetic, several of A.D. 350, which are now lost. The works of Diophantus were honoured with a commentary by the beautiful and learned Hypatia, the daughter of Theon. The same fanaticism which led to the murder of this accomplished female was probably the cause that her works have not descended to posterity.\n\n15. Near the end of the fourth century of the Christian era, Pappus of Alexandria published his mathematical collections, a work which, besides many new propositions of his own, contains the most valuable productions of ancient geometry. Out of the eight books of which this work consisted, two have been lost; the rest are occupied with questions in geometry, astronomy and mechanics.\n\n16. Diocles, whom we have already had occasion to mention as the inventor of the cissoid, discovered the solution of a problem proposed by Archimedes, viz., to cut a sphere by a plane in a given ratio. The solution of Diocles has been conveyed to us by Eutocius, who wrote commentaries on some of the works of Archimedes and Apollonius, A.D. 520. About the time\nof Diocles flourished Serenus, who wrote two books on the cylinder and cone, which have been published at the end of Halley's edition of Apollonius.\n\n17. Geometry was likewise indebted to Proclus, the head of the Platonic school at Athens, not only for his patronage of men of science, but his commentary on the first book of Euclid. Mathematics were also cultivated by Marinus, the author of the Introduction to Euclid's Data;—by Isidorus of Miletus, who was a disciple of Proclus, and by Hero the younger, whose work, entitled Geodecia, contains the method of determining the area of a triangle from its three sides.\n\n18. While the mathematical sciences were thus flourishing in Greece, and were so successfully cultivated by the philosophers of the Alexandrian school, their very existence was threatened by one of those great revolutions with which the world has been convulsed. The dreadful ravages which were committed by the successors of Mahomet in Egypt, Persia, and Syria, the destruction of the Alexandrian library by the caliph Omar, and the dispersion of a number of those illustrious men who had flocked to Alexandria as the cultivators of science, gave a deadly blow to the progress of geometry. When the fanaticism of the Mahometan religion, however, had subsided, and the termination of war had turned the minds of the Arabs to the pursuits of peace, the arts and sciences engaged their attention, and they began to kindle those very intellectual lights which they had so gallantly endeavoured to extinguish. The works of the Greek geometers were studied with care; and the arts and sciences reviving under the auspices of the Arabs, were communicated in a more advanced condition to the other nations of the world.\n\n19. The system of arithmetical notation at present adopted in every civilized country, had its origin among the Arabs. Their system of arithmetic was made known to Europe by the famous Gerbert, afterwards Pope Sylvester II., who travelled into Spain when it was under the dominion of that nation.\n\n20. The invention of algebra has been ascribed to the Arabs by Cardan and Wallis, from the circumstance of their using the words square, cube, quadrato-quadratum, &c. instead of the 2d, 3d, 4th, &c. powers as employed by Diophantus. But whatever truth there may be in this supposition, it appears that they were able to resolve cubic, and even biquadratic equations, as there is in the Leyden library, an Arabic MS. entitled \"The Algebra of Cubic Equations, or the Solution of Solid Problems.\"\n\n21. The various works of the Greek geometers were translated by the Arabs, and it is through the medium of an Arabic version, that the fifth and sixth books of Apollonius have descended to our times. Mahomet Ben Mufa, the author of a work on Plane and Spherical Figures, and Geber Ben Aphiha, who wrote a commentary on Plato, gave a new form to the plane and spherical trigonometry of the ancients. By reducing the theory of triangles to a few propositions, and by substituting, instead of the chords of double arcs, the sines of the arcs themselves, they simplified this important branch of geometry, and contributed greatly to the abridgement of astronomical calculation. A treatise on the art of surveying was likewise written by Mahomet of Bagdad.\n\n22. After the destruction of the Alexandrian school founded by Lagus, one of the successors of Alexander, the dispersed Greeks continued for a while to cultivate their favourite sciences, and exhibited some marks of that genius which had inspired their forefathers. The magic squares were invented by Moebius, a disco-square very more remarkable for its ingenuity than for its practical use. The same subject was afterwards treated by Cornelius Agrippa in his work on occult philosophy; by Bachel de Meziriac, a learned algebrist, about the beginning of the 17th century, and in later times by Frencile de Belli, M. Poignard of Bruxels, De la Hire, and Sauveur.\n\n23. The science of pure mathematics advanced with a doubtful pace during the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries. The algebra of the Arabians was introduced into Italy by Leonard of Pisa, who, in the course of his commercial speculations in the east, had considerable intercourse with the Arabs. A work on the Planisphere, and ten books on arithmetic, were written by Jordanus Nemorarius. The elements of Euclid were translated by Campanus of Novara. A work on algebra, entitled Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proporzione et Proportionalitate, was published by Lucas Paciolii; and about the same time appeared Regiomontanus's treatise on trigonometry, which contains the method of resolving spherical triangles in general, when the three angles or three sides are known.\n\n24. During the 16th century, algebra and geometry advanced with rapidity, and received many new discoveries from the Italian philosophers. The formula for the solution of equations of the third degree was discovered by Scipio Ferri professor of mathematics at Bologna, and perhaps by Nicholas Tartalea of Brescia; and equations of the fourth order were resolved by Lewis Ferrari, the disciple of Hieronymus Cardan of Bononia. This last mathematician published nine books of arithmetic in 1539; and in 1545 he added a tenth, containing the doctrine of cubic equations which he had received in secrecy from Tartalea, but which he had so improved as to render them in some measure his own. The common rule for solving cubic equations still goes by the name of Cardan's Rule.\n\n25. The irreducible case in cubic equations was successfully illustrated by Raphael Bombelli of Bologna. He has shown in his algebra, what was then considered as a paradox, that the parts of the formula which represents each root in the irreducible case, form, when taken together, a real result; but the paradox vanished when it was seen from the demonstration of Bombelli that the imaginary quantities contained in the two numbers of the formula necessarily destroyed each other by their opposite signs. About this time Maurolycus, a Sicilian mathematician, discovered the method of summing up several series of numbers, such as the series 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.; 1, 4, 9, 16, &c. and the series of triangular numbers, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, &c.\n\n26. The science of analysis is under great obligations to Francis Vieta, a native of France. He introduced the present mode of notation, called literal, by employing the letters of the alphabet to represent indefinite given quantities; and we are also indebted to him for the method of transforming one equation into another, whole roots are greater or less than those of the original equation by a given quantity; for the method of multiplying or dividing their roots by any given number.\nMathematics.\n\n27. While analysis was making such progress on the continent, Baron Napier of Merchiston in Scotland was bringing to perfection his illustrious discovery of the logarithms, a set of artificial numbers, by which the most tedious operations in multiplication and division may be performed merely by addition and subtraction. This discovery was published at Edinburgh in 1614 in his work entitled Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio, seu Arithmetica Supputationum Mirabilis Abbreviatio. It is well known that there is such a correspondence between every arithmetical and geometrical progression, viz. \\( \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\) that any terms of the geometrical progression may be multiplied or divided by merely adding or subtracting the corresponding terms of the arithmetical progression, thus the product of four and eight may be found by taking the sum of the corresponding terms in the arithmetical progression, viz. 2 and 3, for their sum 5 points out 32 as the product of 4 and 8. The numbers \\( \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\) are therefore the logarithms of \\( \\{1, 2, 4, 8\\} \\), &c. The choice of the two progressions being altogether arbitrary, Baron Napier took the arithmetical progression which we have given above, and made the term 0 correspond with the unit of the geometrical progression, which he regulated in such a manner that when its terms are represented by the abscissae of an equilateral hyperbola in which the first abscissa and the first ordinate are each equal to 1, the logarithms are represented by the hyperbolic spaces. In consequence, however, of the inconvenience of this geometrical progression, Baron Napier, after consulting upon the subject with Henry Briggs of Gresham College, substituted the decuple progression \\( \\{1, 10, 100, 1000\\} \\), of which \\( \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\) are the logarithms. Nothing now remained but to construct tables of logarithms, by finding the logarithms of the intermediate numbers between the terms of the decuple progression. Napier, however, died before he was able to calculate these tables; but his loss was in some measure supplied by Mr Briggs, who applied himself with zeal to this arduous task, and published in 1618 a table of the logarithms of all numbers from 1 to 1000. In 1624 he published another table containing the logarithms from 1000 to 20,000, and from 90,000 to 100,000. The defects in Briggs's tables were filled up by his friends Gellibrand and Hadrian Vlacq, who also published new tables containing the logarithms of sines, tangents, &c., for 90 degrees.\n\n28. During the time when Napier and Briggs were doing honour to their country by completing the system of logarithms, algebra was making great progress in the hands of our countryman Harriot. His Artis analytice Prae, which appeared in 1620, contains along with the discoveries of its author, a complete view of the state of algebra. He simplified the notation by substituting small letters instead of the capitals introduced by Vieta; and he was the first who showed that every equation beyond the first degree may be considered as produced by the multiplication of as many simple equations as there are units in the exponent of the highest power of the unknown quantity. From this he deduced the relation which exists between the roots of any equation, and the coefficients of the terms of which it consists.\n\n29. About the same time, a foreign author named Ferminel, physician to King Henry II. of France, had the merit of being the first who gave the measure of the measure of earth. By reckoning the number of turns made by a coach wheel from Amiens to Paris, till the altitude of the pole star was increased one degree, he estimated the length of a degree of the meridian to be 56746 toises, which is wonderfully near the truth. He also wrote a work on mathematics, entitled De Proportionibus. Metius About this time it was shown by Peter Metius, a German mathematician, that if the diameter of a circle be 115, its circumference will be 355. This result, so very near the truth, and expressed in so few figures, has preserved the name of its author.\n\n30. The next author, whose labours claim our attention, is the illustrious Descartes. We do not allude to those wild and ingenious speculations by which this philosopher endeavoured to explain the celestial phenomena in algebra, but to those great discoveries with which he enriched the kindred sciences of algebra and geometry. He introduced the present method of marking the powers of any quantity by numerical exponents. He first explained the use of negative roots in equations, and showed that they are as real and useful as positive roots, the only difference between them being founded on the different manner in which the corresponding quantities are considered. He pointed out the method of finding the number of positive and negative roots in any equation where the roots are real; and developed the method of indeterminates which Vieta had obscurely hinted at.\n\n31. Though Regiomontanus, Tartalea, and Bombelli, had solved several geometrical problems by means of algebra, yet the general method of applying geometry to algebra was first given by Vieta. It is to Descartes, however, that we are indebted for the beautiful and extensive use which he made of his discovery. His method of representing the nature of curve lines by equations, and of arranging them in different orders according to the equations which distinguished them, opened a vast field of inquiry to subsequent mathematicians; and his methods of constructing curves of double curvature, and of drawing tangents to curve lines, have contributed much to the progress of geometry. The inverse method of tangents, which it was reserved for the fluxionary calculus to bring to perfection, originated at this time in a problem which Florimundus de Beaune proposed to Descartes. It was required to construct a curve in which the ratio of the ordinate and subtangent should be the same as that of a given line to the portion of the ordinate included between the curve and a line inclined at a given angle. The curve was constructed by Descartes, and several of its properties detected, but he was unable to accomplish the complete solution of the problem. These discoveries of Descartes were studied and improved by his successors, among whom...\nwhom we may number the celebrated Huddie, who published in Schooten's commentary on the geometry of Descartes, an excellent method of determining if an equation of any order contains several equal roots, and of discovering the roots which it contains.\n\n32. The celebrated Pascal, who was equally distinguished by his literary and his scientific acquirements, extended the boundaries of analysis by the invention of his arithmetical triangle. By means of arbitrary numbers placed at the vertex of the triangle, he forms all the figurate numbers in succession, and determines the ratios between the numbers of any two cases, and the various sums resulting from the addition of all the numbers of one rank taken in any possible direction. This ingenious invention gave rise to the calculation of probabilities in the theory of games of chance, and formed the foundation of an excellent treatise of Huygens, entitled De Ratiorum in Ludo Alae, published in 1657.\n\n33. Several curious properties of numbers were at the same time discovered by Fermat at Toulouse. In the theory of prime numbers, particularly, which had first been considered by Eratosthenes, Fermat made great discoveries; and in the doctrine of indeterminate problems, he seems to have been deeply versed, having republished the arithmetic of Diophantus, and enriched it with many valuable notes of his own. He invented the method of discovering the maxima and minima of variable quantities, which serves to determine the tangents of geometrical curves, and paved the way for the invention of the fluxionary calculus.\n\n34. Another step towards the discovery of fluxions was at this time made by Cavalieri in his geometry of indivisibles. In this work, which was published in 1635, its author supposes every plane surface to consist of an infinite number of planes; and he lays it down as an axiom, that these infinite sums of lines and surfaces have the same ratio when compared with the unit in each case as the superficies and solids to be measured. This ingenious method was employed by Cavalieri in the quadrature of the conic sections, and in the curvature of solids generated by their revolution, and in order to prove the accuracy of his theory, he deduced the same results from different principles.\n\n35. Problems of a similar kind had been solved by Fermat and Descartes, and now occupied the attention of Roberval. The latter of these mathematicians began his investigation of this subject about a year before the publication of Cavalieri's work, and the methods which both of them employed were so far the same as to be founded on the principles of indivisibles. In the mode, however, which Roberval adopted, planes and solids were considered as composed of an infinite number of rectangles, whose altitudes and the thickness of their sections were infinitely small.—By means of this method, Roberval determined the area of the cycloid, the centre of gravity of this area, and the solids formed by its revolution on its axis and base. He also invented a general method for tangents, similar in metaphysical principles to that of fluxions, and applicable both to mechanical and geometrical curves. By means of this, he determined the tangents of the cycloid; but there were some curves which resisted its application. Considering every curve to be generated by the motion of a point, Roberval regarded this point as acted upon at every instant with two velocities ascertained from the nature of the curve. He constructed a parallelogram having its sides in the same ratio as the two velocities; and he assumes as a principle, that the direction of the tangent must fall on the diagonal, the position of which being ascertained, gives the position of the tangent.\n\n36. In 1644, solutions of the cycloidal problems for Labour of merit resolved by Roberval were published by Torricelli as invented by himself. The demonstrations of Roberval had been transmitted to Galileo the preceptor of Torricelli, and had also been published in 1637 in Mercenius's Universal Harmony. The Italian philosopher was consequently accused of plagiarism by Roberval, and the charge so deeply affected his mind as to bring him prematurely to the grave. It is obvious, however, from the demonstrations of Torricelli, that he had never seen those of Roberval, and that he was far from meriting that cruel accusation which deprived science of one of its brightest ornaments.\n\n37. The cycloid having attracted the notice of geometers from the number and singularity of its properties, copies of the celebrated Pascal proposed to them a variety of new problems relative to this curve, and offered prizes for their solution. These problems required the area of any cycloidal segment, the centre of gravity of that segment, the solids, and the centres of gravity of the solids, which are generated either by a whole revolution, a half or a quarter of a revolution of this segment round an abscissa or an ordinate. The resolution of these problems was attempted by Huygens, Sluze, Sir Christopher Wren, Fermat, and Roberval. Sluze discovered an ingenious method of finding the area of the curve. Huygens squared the segment comprised between the vertex, and as far as a fourth of the diameter of the generating circle; and Sir Christopher Wren ascertained the length of the cycloidal arc included between the vertex and the ordinate, the centre of gravity of this arc, and the surfaces of the solids generated during its revolution. These attempts were not considered by their authors as solutions of Pascal's problems, and therefore they did not lay claims to his prize. Our countryman Wallis, however, and Lalouere a Jesuit, gave in a solution of all the problems, and thought themselves entitled to the proffered reward. In the methods employed by these mathematicians, Pascal detected several sources of error; and it was referred for that great genius to furnish a complete solution of his own problems. Extending his investigations to curtate and prolate cycloids, he proved that the length of these curves depends on the rectification of the ellipse, and assigned in each case the axis of the ellipse. From this method he deduced this curious theorem, that if two cycloids, the one curtate and the other prolate, be such, that the base of the one is equal to the circumference of the circle by which the other is generated, the length of these two cycloids will be equal.\n\n38. While these discoveries were making on the continent, the friends of science in Britain were actively employed in promoting its advancement. In 1655 Wallis published his Arithmetica Infinitorum, a work of great genius. He attempted to determine by the summation of infinite series, the quadrature of curves, and the curvature of solids, subjects which were afterwards investigated in a different manner by Ishmael Bullialdus. By Wallis's method, curves were squared when their ordinates are expressed by one term, and when their\ntheir ordinates were complex quantities raised to entire and positive powers, these ordinates were resolved into series, of which each term is a monomial. Wallis attempted to extend his theory to curves whose ordinates were complex and radical, by attempting to interpolate the series of the former kind with a new series; but he was unsuccessful.\n\n39. It was left to Newton to remove this difficulty. He solved the problem in a more direct and simple manner by the aid of his new formula for expanding into an infinite series any power of a binomial, whether its exponent was positive or negative, an integer or a fraction. Algebra is also indebted to this illustrious mathematician for a simple and extensive method of resolving an equation into commensurable factors; for a method of summing up the powers of the roots of an equation, of extracting the roots of quantities partly commensurable, and partly incommensurable, and of finding by approximation the roots of literal and numerical equations of all orders.\n\n40. About this time, William Lord Brouncker, in attempting to demonstrate an expression of Wallis on the magnitude of the circle, discovered the theory of continued fractions. When an irreducible fraction is expressed by numbers too great and complicated to be easily employed by the analyst, the method of Lord Brouncker enables us to substitute an expression much more simple and nearly equivalent. This theory, which enables us to find a very accurate relation between the diameter and circumference of the circle, was employed by Huygens* in the calculation of his planetary automaton, for representing the motions of the solar system, and was enlarged and improved by other celebrated geometers. Lord Brouncker had likewise the merit of discovering an infinite series to represent the area of the hyperbola. The same discovery was made by Nicholas Mercator, who published it in his Logarithmotechnia in 1668.\n\n41. The subject of infinite series received considerable addition from Mr James Gregory. He was the first who gave the tangent and secant in terms of the arc, and, inversely, the arc in terms of the tangent and secant. He constructed series for finding directly the logarithm of the tangent and secant from the value of the arc, and the logarithm of the arc from that of the tangent and secant; and he applied this theory of infinite series to the rectification of the ellipse and hyperbola.\n\n42. The differential triangle invented by the learned Dr Barrow, for drawing tangents to curves, may be regarded as another contribution towards the invention of fluxions. This triangle has for its sides the element of the curve and those of the absciss and ordinate, and those sides are treated as quantities infinitely small.\n\n43. The doctrine of evolutes had been slightly touched upon by Apollonius. It remained, however, for the illustrious Huygens to bring it to perfection. His theory of evolutes is contained in his Horologium Oscillatorium, published in 1673, and may be regarded as one of the finest discoveries in geometry. When any curve is given, Huygens has pointed out the method of constructing a second curve, by drawing a series of perpendiculars to the first, which are tangents to the second; and of finding the first curve from the second. From this principle he deduces several theorems on the rectification of curves; and that remarkable property of the cycloid, in which an equal and similar cycloid is produced by evolution.\n\n44. In contemplating the progress of analysis from the beginning of the 17th century, to the invention of the differential calculus, we cannot fail to perceive the principles of fluxions. The human mind seemed to advance with rapidity towards that great discovery; and it is by no means unlikely that it would soon have arrived at the doctrine of fluxions, even if the superior genius of Newton had not accelerated its progress. In Cavalieri's Geometria Indivisibilibus, we perceive the germ of the infinitesimal calculus; and the method of Roberval for finding the tangents of curves, bears a striking analogy to the metaphysics of the fluxionary calculus. It was the glory of Newton, however, to invent and illustrate the method of fluxions; and the obscure hints which he received from preceding mathematicians, do not in the least detract from the merit of our illustrious countryman.\n\n45. On the claims of Leibnitz as a second inventor of General fluxions, and the illiberal violence with which they have been urged by foreign mathematicians, we would with it speak with delicacy and moderation. Who that Newton can appreciate the discoveries of that celebrated mathematician, or is acquainted with that penetrating genius of Leibnitz, which threw light on every department of human knowledge, would willingly stain his memory with an ungracious imputation? The accusation of plagiarism is one of those charges which it is difficult either to substantiate or repel, and when directed against a great man, ought never, without the clearest evidence, to be wantonly preferred or willingly received. If charitable sentiments are ever to be entertained towards others,—to what class of beings should they be more cheerfully extended than to those who have been the ornaments of human nature? If society has agreed to regard as sacred the failings and eccentricities of genius,—when ought that reverence to be more strongly excited than when we are passing judgement on its mightiest efforts? Inquiries into the motives and actions of the learned ought never to be wantonly indulged. When the honour of our country, or the character of an individual, requires such an investigation, a regard to truth, and a contempt of national prejudice, should guide the inquiry.—We should proceed with delicacy and forbearance.—We should tread lightly even on the ashes of genius. It is not uncommon to witness the indulgence of malicious pleasure, in detracting from the merits of a distinguished character. The assailant raises himself for a while to the level of his enemy, and acquires glory by his fall. But let him remember that the laurels thus won cannot flourish long. The same public opinion which conferred them will tear them from his brow, and consign the accuser to that infamy from which the brightest abilities will be insufficient to raise him. The consequences of such conduct have been seen in the fall of Torricelli. It was the charges of plagiarism, preferred by Roberval, that hurried this young and accomplished philosopher to an early grave.\n\n46. We have been led into these observations by studying the dispute between the followers of Newton and Leibnitz. The claims of the British, as well as those of the...\nthe foreign mathematicians, have undoubtedly been too high; and victory rather than truth seems to have been the object of contest. Even the name of Newton has not escaped from serious imputations. The immensity of the stake for which the different parties contended, may perhaps justify the commencement of the dispute; and the brilliancy of the talents that were called into action, may leave us no cause to regret its continuance: But nothing can reconcile us to those personal animosities in which the good sense and temper of philosophy are lost, and that violence of literary warfare where science can gain nothing in the combat.—In giving an account, therefore, of that interesting dispute, we shall merely give a brief view of the facts that relate to the discovery of the higher calculus, and make a few observations on the conclusions to which they lead.\n\n47. In the year 1669, a paper of Sir Isaac Newton's, entitled De Analyst per equationes numero terminorum infinitas, was communicated by Dr Barrow to Mr Collins, one of the secretaries of the Royal Society. In this paper the author points out a new method of squaring curves, both when the expression of the ordinate is a rational quantity, and when it contains complex radicals, by evolving the expression of the ordinate into an infinite number of simple terms by means of the binomial theorem. In a letter from Newton to Collins, dated December 10, 1672, there is contained a method of drawing tangents to curve lines, without being obstructed by radicals; and in both these works, an account of which was circulated on the continent by the secretaries of the Royal Society, the principles of the fluxional calculus are plainly exhibited; and it is the opinion of all the disputants, that those works at least prove, that Newton must have been acquainted with the method of fluxions when he composed them.\n\n48. Leibnitz came to London in 1673, and though there is no direct evidence that he saw Newton's paper De Analyst per Equationes, &c., yet it is certain that he had seen Sir Isaac's letter to Collins of 1672; and it is highly improbable that such a man as Leibnitz should have been ignorant of a paper of Newton's which had been four years in the possession of the public, and which contained discoveries at that time interesting to every mathematician.\n\n49. A letter from Newton to Oldenburg, one of the secretaries of the Royal Society, dated October 24, 1676, was communicated to Leibnitz. This letter contains several theorems without the demonstrations, which are founded on the method of fluxions, and merely states that they result from the solution of a general problem. The enunciation of this problem he expresses in a cypher, the meaning of which was, An equation containing any number of flowing quantities being given, to find the fluxions, and inversely. In reply to this communication, Leibnitz transmitted a letter to Oldenburg, dated June 21, 1677, where he explains the nature of the differential calculus, and affirms, that he had long employed it for drawing tangents to curve lines.\n\n50. The correspondence between Leibnitz and Oldenburg having been broken off by the death of the latter, Leibnitz published in the Acta Eruditi, Lipsi, for October 1684, the principles of the new analysis, under the title of Nova Methodus pro maximis et minimis, itemque tangentibus, quae nec fractas, nec irrationales quantitates moratur, et singulare pro illis calculatur. This paper contains the method of differencing simple, fractional, and radical quantities, and the application of the calculus to the solution of some physical and geometrical problems. In 1685, he likewise published two small pamphlets on the quadrature of curves, containing the principles of the Calculus Summatorius, or the Inverse Method of Fluxions; and in 1686 there appeared another tract by the same author, On the Recondite Geometry, and the Analysis of Indivisibles and Infinites, containing the fundamental rule of the integral calculus.\n\n51. Towards the close of the year 1686, Sir Isaac Newton gave to the world his illustrious work entitled Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. Some of the most difficult problems in this work are founded on the fluxional calculus; and it is allowed by Boissut, one of the defenders of Leibnitz, \"that mathematicians did Newton the justice to acknowledge, that at the period when his Principia was published, he was master of the method of fluxions to a high degree, at least with respect to that part which concerns the quadrature of curves.\" The claim of Leibnitz, as a separate inventor of the differential calculus, is evidently allowed by Newton himself, when he observes, that Leibnitz had communicated to him a method similar to his own for drawing tangents, &c., and differing from it only in the enunciation and notation.\n\n52. About this time, it became fashionable among geometers to perplex each other by the proposal of new problems and difficult problems, a practice which powerfully contributed to the progress of mathematics. The difference in which Leibnitz was engaged with the Cartesians respecting the measure of active forces, which the former supposed to be as the simple velocity, while the latter affirmed, that they were as the square of the velocity, led him to propose the problem of the isochronous curve, or \"to find the curve which a heavy body must describe equally, in order to approach or recede from a horizontal plane in equal times.\" This curve was found by Huygens to be the second cubic parabola; but he gave only its properties and construction without the demonstration. The same solution, along with the demonstration, was given by Leibnitz in 1689, who, at the same time, proposed to geometers to find the paracentric isochronal curve, or the curve in which a body would equally approach or recede from a given point in equal times.\n\n53. It was at this time that the two brothers, James and John Bernoulli, began to display their talents from which the physical and mathematical sciences received such immense improvements. James was born in 1654, and died in 1705; and John, who was his pupil, was born in 1667, and lived to the advanced age of 68 years. In 1690, James Bernoulli gave the same solution of the isochronous curve that had been given by Huygens and Leibnitz; and proposed the celebrated problem of the catenary curve, which had formerly perplexed the ingenuity of Galileo. In two memoirs, published in 1691, he determined, by means of the inverse method of fluxions, the tangents of the parabolic spiral, the logarithmic spiral, and the loxodromic curve, and likewise the quadratures of their areas.\n\n54. The problem of the catenary curve having occupied other analysts, the attention of geometers, was received by Huygens, Leibnitz, and others.\nLeibnitz, and John Bernouilli. In these solutions, however, the gravity of the catenary curve was supposed to be uniform; but James Bernouilli extended the solution to cases where the weight of the curve varies from one point to another, according to a given law. From this problem he was also conducted to the determination of the curvature of a bended bow, and that of an elastic bar fixed at one extremity, and loaded at the other with a given weight. In the hopes of contributing to the progress of navigation, the same mathematician considered the form of a sail swollen with the wind. When the wind, after striking the sail, is not prevented from escaping, the curvature of the sail is that of the common catenarian curve; but when the sail is supposed perfectly flexible, and filled with a fluid pressing downwards on itself, as water presses on the sides of a vessel, the curve which it forms is one of those denominated lineairies, which is expressed by the same equation as the common elastic curve, where the extensions are reckoned proportional to the forces applied at each point.—The same problem was solved in the Journal des Savans for 1692, by John Bernouilli; but there is satisfactory evidence that it was chiefly borrowed from his brother James.\n\n55. The attention of James Bernouilli was now directed to the theory of curves produced by the revolution of one curve upon another. He considers one curve rolling upon a given curve, equal to the first, and immovable. He determines the evolute and the caustic of the epicycloid, described by a point of the moving circle, and he deduces from it other two curves, denominated the antievolute and periecaustic. He found also that the logarithmic spiral was its own evolute, caustic, antievolute, and periecaustic; and that an analogous property belonged to the cycloid.\n\n56. About this time Viviani, an Italian geometer, distinguished as the restorer of Archimedes's conic sections, required the solution of the following problem, that there existed a temple of a hemispherical form, pierced with four equal windows, with such skill, that the remainder of the hemisphere might be perfectly squared. With the aid of the new analysis, Leibnitz and James Bernouilli immediately found a solution, while that of Viviani was founded on the ancient geometry. He proved that the problem might be solved, by placing, parallel to the base of the hemisphere, two right cylinders, the axes of which should pass through the centres of two radii, forming a diameter of the circle of the base, and piercing the dome each way.\n\n57. Prior to some of these discussions, the curves called caustic, and sometimes Tschirnhausenian, were discovered by Tschirnhausen. These curves are formed by the crooking of the rays of light, when reflected from a curved surface, or refracted through a lens so as not to meet in a single point. With the assistance of the common geometry, Tschirnhausen discovered, that they are equal to straight lines when they are formed by geometrical curves, and found out several other curious properties. By the aid of the higher calculus, James Bernouilli extended these researches, and added greatly to the theory of caustics produced by refraction.\n\n58. The problem of the paracentric isochronal curve, proposed by Leibnitz in 1689, was solved by James Bernouilli, who took for ordinates parallel straight lines, and for abscissas the chords of an infinite number of concentric circles described about the given point. In this way he obtained a separate equation, constructed at first by the rectification of the elastic curve, and afterwards by the rectification of an algebraic curve. The same problem was solved by John Bernouilli and Leibnitz.\n\n59. In 1694, a branch of the new analysis, called the exponential calculus, was invented separately by John Bernouilli and Leibnitz. It consists in differentiating and integrating exponential quantities or powers with variable exponents. To Leibnitz, the priority in point of invention certainly belongs; but John Bernouilli was Bernouilli, the first who published the rules and uses of the calculus.\n\n60. The marquis l'Hôpital, who, in 1695, had solved the problem about the curve of equilibration in drawing the bridges, and shewn it to be an epicycloid, published in the following year his Analysis of Infinites for the understanding of curve lines. In this celebrated work, infinites, the differential calculus, or the direct method of fluxions, was fully explained and illustrated; and as the knowledge of the higher geometry had been hitherto confined to a few, it was now destined to enlighten the different nations of Europe.\n\n61. The methods which were employed by Descartes, Newton, Fermat, &c., for finding the maxima and minima of quantities, yielded in point of simplicity and generality resistance to that which was derived from the doctrine of fluxions. Another class of problems, however, of the same kind, but more complicated, from their requiring the inverse method of fluxions, began now to exercise the ingenuity of mathematicians. A problem of this class for finding the solid of least resistance, was solved by Newton in the 34th proposition of the 2d book of his Principia. After having determined the truncated right cone, which being moved in a fluid by the smallest base (which is unknown), experiences the least resistance, he gave without any demonstration the ratio from which might be derived the differential equation of the curve that generates by a revolution of its axis the solid of least resistance. A general solution, however, was still wanting, till the attention of geometers was directed to the subject by John Bernouilli, who proposed, in 1697, the celebrated problem of the Brachistochronon, or the curve along the concave side of which if a heavy body descend, it will pass in the least time possible from one point to another, the two points not being in the same vertical line. This problem was resolved by Leibnitz, Newton, the marquis de l'Hôpital, and James Bernouilli, who demonstrated that the curve of quickest descent is a cycloid reversed. This result will appear at first surprising, when we consider a line to be the shortest distance between two points; but the surprise will cease when we reflect, that in a concave curve lying between the two given points the moving body descends at first in a more vertical direction, and therefore acquires a greater velocity than when it rolls down an inclined plane. This addition to its velocity, consequently, at the commencement of its path may balance the increase of space through which it has to move.\n\n62. At the close of this discussion commenced that celebrated dispute about isoperimetrical problems, between James and John Bernouilli, in which the qualities of isoperimetrical figures were more conspicuous than those of the tricuspid heart.\nheart. These illustrious characters, connected by the strongest ties of affinity, were, at the commencement of their distinguished career, united by the warmest affection. John was initiated by his elder brother into the mathematical sciences; and a generous emulation, softened by friendship in the one, and gratitude in the other, continued for some years to direct their studies, and accelerate their progress. There are few men, however, who can support at the same time the character of a rival and a friend. The success of the one party is apt to awaken the envy of the other, and success itself is often the parent of presumption. A foundation is thus laid for future diffusion; and it is a melancholy fact in the history of learning, that the most ardent friendships have been sacrificed on the altar of literary ambition. Such was the case between the two Bernoullis. As soon as John was settled as professor of mathematics at Groningen, all friendly intercourse between the two brothers was at an end. Regarding John as the aggressor, and provoked at the ingratitude which he exhibited, his brother James challenged him by name to solve the following problems: 1. \"To find among all the isoperimetric curves between given limits, such a curve, that constructing a second curve, the ordinates of which shall be the functions of the ordinates or arcs of the former, the area of the second curve shall be a maximum or a minimum.\"—2. \"To find among all the cycloids which a heavy body may describe in its descent from a point to a line, the position of which is given, that cycloid which is described in the least possible time.\"—A prize of 50 florins was promised to John Bernoulli, if, within three months, he engaged to solve these problems, and publish within a year legitimate solutions of them.\n\n63. In a short time John Bernoulli produced his solution and demanded the prize. He succeeded in constructing the problem of swiftest descent; but his solution of the other problem was radically defective. This failure mortified that vanity with which he gloried in his apparent success. He acknowledged the mistake in his solution, and, with the same imperious tone, transmitted a new result, and redemanded the prize. This new solution, which was still defective, drew down the wit and ridicule of James Bernoulli, which his brother attempted to repel by a torrent of coarse invective.\n\n64. Leibnitz, Newton, and the marquis l'Hospital, being appointed arbiters in this dispute, James Bernoulli published, in 1700, the formulae of the isoperimetric problem, without any demonstration; and John transmitted his solution to the French academy in February 1701, on condition that it should not be opened till his brother's demonstrations were published. In consequence of this, James Bernoulli published his solution in May 1701, in the Acta Eruditorum, under the following title, Analysis magni Problematis Isoperimetrii, and gained great honour from the skill which it displayed. For five years John Bernoulli was silent upon the subject; but his brother dying in 1705, he published his solution in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1706. About 13 years afterwards, John Bernoulli having perceived the source of his error, confessed his mistake, and published a new solution, not very different from that of his brother, in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1718.\n\n65. In the problem relative to the cycloid of swiftest descent, John Bernoulli obtained a result similar to that of his brother, by a very ingenious method, which extended the bounds of the new analysis. In his investigations he employed the synchronous curve, or that function which cuts a series of similar curves placed in similar positions, so that the arcs of the latter included between a given point and the synchronous curve, shall be described by a heavy body in equal times. He demonstrated, that of all the cycloids thus intersected, that which is cut perpendicularly is described in less time than any other terminating equally at the synchronous curve. But being unable to give a general solution of the problem, he applied to Leibnitz, who easily resolved it, and at that time invented the method of differencing de curva in curvam.\n\n66. About a month after the death of the marquis de l'Hospital, John Bernoulli declared himself the author of a rule given by the marquis in his Analysis of Infinites, for finding the value of a fraction, whose numerator and denominator should vanish at the same instant, when the variable quantity that enters into it has a certain given value. The defence made by the marquis's friends only induced John Bernoulli to make greater demands, till he claimed as his own the most important parts of the Analysis of Infinites: But it does not appear, from an examination of the subject, that there is any foundation for his claims.\n\n67. Towards the close of 1704, Sir Isaac Newton published, at the end of his Optics, his Enumeratio linearum tertiae ordinis, and his treatise De Quadratura Curvarum. The first of these papers displays great ability; but is founded only on the common algebra, and the doctrine of series which Newton had brought to such perfection. His treatise, De Quadratura Curvarum, contains the resolution of fluxional formulae, with one variable quantity which leads to the quadrature of curves. By means of certain series he obtains the resolution of several complicated formulae, by referring them to such as are more simple; and these series being interrupted in particular cases, give the fluents in finite terms. From this several interesting propositions are deduced, among which is the method of resolving rational fractions. In 1711 Newton published his Method of Fluxions. The object of this work is to determine, by simple algebra, the linear coefficients of an equation that satisfies as many conditions as there are coefficients, and to construct a curve of the parabolic kind passing through any number of given points. Hence arises a simple method of finding the approximate quadrature of curves, in which a certain number of ordinates are determinable. It has been the opinion of some able mathematicians, that this treatise contains the first principles of the integral calculus with finite differences, afterwards invented by Dr Taylor. A posthumous work of Newton's, entitled the Method of Fluxions, and of Infinite Series, was published by Dr Pemberton about nine years after the death of its author; but it does not contain any new investigations which accelerated the progress of the new analysis.\n\n68. The mathematical sciences were at this time indebted to the labours of Manfredi, Parent, and Saurin. Manfredi, Parent, and Saurin, the former of these geometers published a very able work, De Constructione Equationum differentialium primi gradus. To Parent we are indebted for the problem by which\nwhich we obtain the ratio between the velocity of the power, and the weight for finding the maximum effect of machines; but his reputation was much injured by the obscurity of his writings. Saurii was celebrated for his theoretical and practical knowledge of watchmaking, and was the first who elucidated the theory of tangents to the multiple points of curves.\n\n69. While the science of analysis was thus advancing with rapidity, the dispute between Newton and Leibnitz began to be agitated among the mathematicians of Europe. These illustrious rivals seemed to have been hitherto contented with sharing the honour of having invented the fluxional calculus. But as soon as the priority of invention was attributed to Newton, the friends of Leibnitz came forward with eagerness to support the claims of their master.\n\n70. In a small work on the curve of swiftest descent, and the fold of least resistance, published in 1699, Nicholas Facio de Duillier, an eminent Geneoese, attributed to Newton the first invention of fluxions, and hinted, that Leibnitz, as the second inventor, had borrowed from the English philosopher. Exasperated at this improper infirmation, Leibnitz came forward in his own defence, and appeals to the admission of Newton in his Principia, that neither had borrowed from the other. He expressed his conviction, that Facio de Duillier was not authorised by Sir Isaac, to prefer such a charge, and threw himself upon the testimony and candour of the English geometer.\n\n71. The discussion rested in this situation for several years, till our celebrated countryman, Dr Keill, instigated by an attack upon Newton in the Leipzic Journal, repeated the same charge against Leibnitz. The German philosopher made the same reply as he did to his former opponent, and treated Dr Keill as a young man incapable of judging upon the subject. In 1711, Dr Keill addressed a letter to Sir Hans Sloane, secretary to the Royal Society, and accused Leibnitz of having adopted the differential notation, in order to have it believed, that he did not borrow his calculus from the writings of Newton.\n\n72. Leibnitz was with reason irritated at this accusation, and called upon the Royal Society to interfere in his behalf. A committee of that learned body was accordingly appointed to investigate the subject, and their report was published in 1712, under the title of Commercium Epistolicum de Analytici promota. In this report the committee maintain that Leibnitz was not the first inventor, and absolve Dr Keill from all blame in giving the priority of invention to Newton. They were cautious, however, in stating their opinion upon that part of the charge in which Leibnitz was accused of plagiarism.\n\n73. In answer to the arguments advanced in the Commercium Epistolicum, John Bernouilli, the particular friend of Leibnitz, published a letter, in which he has the assurance to state, that the method of fluxions did not precede the differential calculus, but that it might have taken its rise from it. The reason which he assigns for this strange assertion is, that the differential calculus was published before Newton had introduced an uniform algorithm into the method of fluxions. But it may as well be maintained that Newton did not discover the theory of universal gravitation, because the attractive force of mountains and of smaller portions of matter was not ascertained till the time of Maskelyne and Cavendish. The principles of fluxions are allowed to have been discovered before those of the differential calculus, and yet the former originated from the latter, because the fluxional notation was not given at the same time!\n\n74. Notwithstanding the ridiculous assertion of John Bernouilli, it has been admitted by all the foreign mathematicians, that Newton was the first inventor of the method of fluxions. The point at issue therefore is merely this—did Leibnitz see any of the writings of Newton that contained the principles of fluxions before he published in 1684 his Nova Methodus pro maximis et minimis? The friends of Leibnitz have adduced some presumptive proofs, that he had never seen the treatise of Newton, de Analytici, nor the letter to Collins, in both of which the principles of the new calculus were to be found; and in order to strengthen their argument, they have not scrupled to assert, that the writings already mentioned contained but a vague and obscure indication of the method of fluxions, and that Leibnitz might have perused them without having discovered it. This subsidiary argument, however, rests upon the opinion of individuals; and the only way of repelling it is to give the opinion of an impartial judge. M. Montucla, the celebrated historian of the mathematics, who being a Frenchman, cannot be suspected of partiality to the English, has admitted that Newton in his treatise de Analytici \"has disclosed in a very concise and obscure manner his principles of fluxions,\" and \"that the suspicion of Leibnitz having seen this work is not destitute of probability, for Leibnitz admitted, that in his interview with Collins he had seen a part of the epistolary correspondence between Newton and that gentleman.\" It is evident therefore that Leibnitz had opportunities of being acquainted with the doctrine of fluxions, before he had thought of the differential calculus; and as he was in London where Newton's treatise was published, and in company with the very men to whom the new analysis had been communicated, it is very likely that he then acquired some knowledge of the subject. In favour of Leibnitz, however, it is but justice to say, that the transition from the method of tangents by Dr Barrow to the differential calculus is so simple, that Leibnitz might very easily have perceived it; and that the notation of his analysis, the numerous applications which he made of it, and the perfection to which he carried the integral calculus, are considerable proofs that he was innocent of the charge which the English have attempted to fix upon his memory.\n\n75. In 1708, Remond de Montmort published a curious work entitled the Analysis of Games of Chance, in which the common algebra was applied to the computation of probabilities, and the estimation of chances. Though this work did not contain any great discovery, yet it gave extent to the theory of series, and admirably illustrated the doctrine of combinations. The same subject was afterwards discussed by M. de Moivre, a French protestant residing in England, in a small treatise entitled Measuring Sortis, in which are given the elements of the theory of recurrent series, and some very ingenious applications of it. Another edition was published in English in 1738, under the title of the Doctrine of Chances.\n76. A short time before his death, Leibnitz proposed to the English geometers the celebrated problem of orthogonal trajectories, which was to find the curve that cuts a series of given curves at a constant angle, or at an angle varying according to a given law. This problem was put into the hands of Sir Isaac Newton when he returned to dinner greatly fatigued, and he brought it to an equation before he went to rest. Leibnitz being recently dead, John Bernoulli assumed his place, and maintained, that nothing was easier than to bring the problem to an equation, and that the solution of the problem was not complete till the differential equation of the trajectory was resolved. Nicholas Bernoulli, the son of John resolved the particular case in which the intersected curves are hyperbolas with the same centre and the same vertex. James Hermann and Nicholas Bernoulli, the nephew of John, treated the subject by more general methods, which applied to the cases in which the intersected curves were geometrical. The most complete solution, however, was given by Dr Taylor in the Philosophical Transactions for 1717, though it was not sufficiently general, and could not apply to some cases capable of resolution. This defect was supplied by John Bernoulli, who, in the Leipzig Transactions for 1718, published a very simple solution, embracing all the geometrical curves, and a great number of the mechanical ones.\n\n77. During these discussions, several difficult problems on the integration of rational fractions were proposed by Dr Taylor, and solved by John Bernoulli. This subject, however, had been first discussed by Roger Cotes, professor of mathematics at Cambridge, who died in 1716. In his posthumous work entitled Harmonia Mensurarum, published in 1716, he gave general and convenient formulae for the integration of rational fractions; and we are indebted to this young geometer for his method of eliminating errors in mixed mathematics, for his remarks on the differential method of Newton, and for his celebrated theorem for resolving certain equations.\n\n78. In 1715, Dr Taylor published his learned work entitled Methodus incrementorum directa et inversa. In this work the doctor gives the name of increments or decrements of variable quantities to the differences, whether finite or infinitely small, of two consecutive terms in a series formed after a given law. When the differences are infinitely small, their calculus belongs to fluxions; but when they are finite, the method of finding their relation to the quantities by which they are produced forms a new calculus, called the integral calculus of finite differences. In consequence of this work, Dr Taylor was attacked anonymously by John Bernoulli, who lavished upon the English geometer all that dull abuse, and angry ridicule, which he had formerly heaped upon his brother.\n\n79. The problem of reciprocal trajectories was at this time proposed by the Bernoullis. This problem required the curves which, being constructed in two opposite directions in one axis, given in position, and then moving parallel to one another with unequal velocities, should perpetually intersect each other at a given angle. It was long discussed between John Bernoulli and an anonymous writer, who proved to be Dr Pemberton. It was by an elegant solution of this problem that the celebrated Euler began to be distinguished among mathematicians. He was the pupil of John Bernoulli, and continued through the whole of his life, the friend and rival of his son Daniel. The great object of his labours was to extend the boundaries of analysis; and before he had reached his 21st year, he published a new and general method of resolving differential equations of the second order, subjected to certain conditions.\n\n80. The common algebra had been applied by Leibnitz and John Bernoulli to determine arcs of the parabola, the difference of which is an algebraic quantity, imagining that such problems in the case of the ellipse and hyperbola justified the application of the new analysis. The Count de Fagnani, however, applied the integral calculus to the arcs of the ellipse and hyperbola, and had the honour of explaining this new branch of geometry.\n\n81. In the various problems depending on the analysis of infinites, the great difficulty is to resolve the differential equation to which the problems are reduced. Count James Riccati having been puzzled with a differential equation of the first order, with two variable quantities, proposed it to mathematicians in the Leipzig Acts for 1725. This question baffled the skill of the most celebrated analysts, who were merely able to point out a number of cases in which the indeterminate can be separated, and the equation resolved by the quadrature of curves.\n\n82. Another problem suggested by that of Viviani was proposed in 1718 by Ernst von Offenburg. It was required to pierce a hemispherical vault with any number of elliptical windows, so that their circumferences should be expressed by algebraic quantities;—or in other words, to determine on the surface of a sphere, curves algebraically rectifiable. In a paper on the rectification of spherical epicycloids, Herman * imagined that these curves were algebraically rectifiable, and therefore satisfied the question of Offenburg; but John Bernoulli (Mem. Acad. Par. 1732.) demonstrated, that 1726, as the rectification of these curves depended on the quadrature of the hyperbola, they were only rectifiable in certain cases, and gave the general method of determining the curves that are algebraically rectifiable on the surface of a sphere.\n\n83. The same subject was also discussed by Nicole and Labours of Clairaut, (Mem. Acad. 1734.). The latter of these Clairaut, mathematicians had already acquired fame by his Recherches sur les Courbes à double Courbure, published in 1730, before he was 21 years of age; but his reputation was extended by a method of finding curves whose property consists in a certain relation between these branches expressed by a given equation. In this research, Clairaut pointed out a species of paradox in the integral calculus, which led to the celebrated theory of particular integrals which was afterwards fully illustrated by Euler and other geometers.\n\n84. The celebrated problem of isochronous curves began at this time to be reanimated among mathematicians. The object of this problem is to find such a curve that a heavy body descending along its concavity shall always reach the lowest point in the same time, from whatever point of the curve it begins to descend. Huygens had already shown that the cycloid was the isochronous curve in vacuo. Newton had demonstrated the same curve to be isochronous when the descending body experiences from the air a resistance proportional to its velocity,\nMathematics.\n\nMemoirs locity; and Euler * and John Bernouilli †, had separately found the isochronous curve when the resistance was as the square of the velocity. These three cases, and even a fourth in which the resistance was as the square of the velocity added to the product of the velocity by a constant coefficient, were all resolved by Fontaine, by means of an ingenious and original method; and it is very remarkable that the isochronous curve is the same in the third and fourth cases.—The method of Fontaine was illustrated by Euler, who solved a fifth case, including all the other four, when the resistance is composed of three terms, the square of the velocity, the product of the velocity by a given coefficient, and a constant quantity. He found also an expression of the time which the body employs to descend through any arc of the curve.\n\n85. The application of analytical formulæ to the physico-mathematical sciences was much facilitated by the algebra of fines and cofines with which Frederick Christian Mayer, and Euler, enriched geometry. By the combination of arcs, fines, and cofines, formulas are obtained which frequently yield to the method of resolution, and enable us to solve a number of problems which the ordinary use of arcs, fines, and cofines, would render tedious and complicated.\n\n86. About this time a great discovery in the theory of differential equations of the first order was made separately by Euler, Fontaine, and Clairaut. Hitherto geometers had no direct method of ascertaining if any differential equation were resolvable in the state in which it was presented, or if it required some preparation prior to its resolution. For every differential equation a particular method was employed, and their resolution was often effected by a kind of tentative process, which displayed the ingenuity of its author, without being applicable to other equations. The conditions under which differential equations of the first order are resolvable were discovered by the three mathematicians whom we have mentioned. Euler made the discovery in 1736, but did not publish it till 1740. Fontaine and Clairaut lighted upon it in 1739. Euler afterwards extended the discovery to equations of higher orders.\n\n87. The first traces of the integral calculus with partial differences appeared in a paper of Euler's in the Peterburgh Transactions for 1734; but d'Alambert, in his work Sur les Vents, has given clearer notions of it, and was the first who employed it in solution of the problem of vibrating cords proposed by Dr Taylor, and investigated by Euler and Daniel Bernouilli. The object of this calculus is to find a function of several variable quantities, when we have the relation of the coefficients which affect the differentials of the variable quantities of which this function is composed. Euler exhibited it in various points of view, and shewed its application to a number of physical problems; and he afterwards, in his paper entitled Investigatio Functionum ex data Differentiatione conditione *, completely explained the nature, and gave the algorithm of the calculus.\n\n88. While the analysis of infinites was making such rapid progress on the continent, it was attacked in England by the celebrated Dr Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne, in a work called the Analyst, or a discourse addressed to an Infidel Mathematician, wherein it is examined whether the principles of fluxions attacked by Dr Berkeley, 1734.\n\nobject, principles, and inferences of the modern analysis, are more distinctly conceived than Religious Mysteries and Points of Faith. In this work the doctor admits the truth of the conclusions, but maintains that the principles of fluxions are not founded upon reasoning strictly logical and conclusive. This attack called forth Robins and Maclaurin. The former proved that the principles of fluxions were consistent with the strictest reasoning, while Maclaurin, in his Treatise of Fluxions, gave a hypothetical demonstration of the principles of the calculus after the manner of the ancient geometers, and establishes it with such clearness and satisfaction that no intelligent man could refuse his assent. The differential calculus had been attacked at an earlier period by Nieuwentiet and Rolle, but the weapons wielded by these adversaries were contemptible when compared with the ingenuity of Dr Berkeley.\n\n89. Notwithstanding this attack upon the principles of Works of the new analysis, the science of geometry made rapid advances in England in the hands of Thomas Simpson, Landen and Waring. In 1740, Mr Simpson published his Treatise on Fluxions, which, besides many original researches, contains a convenient method of resolving differential equations by approximation, and various means of halting the convergency of slowly converging series. We are indebted to the same geometer for several general theorems for summing different series, whether they are susceptible of an absolute or an approximate summation. His Mathematical Disquisitions, published in 1743, his Essays on several Subjects in Mathematics, published in 1749, and his Select Exercises for Young Proficients in the Mathematics, published in 1752, contain ingenious and original researches which contributed to the progress of geometry.\n\n90. In his Mathematical Lucubrations, published in The residue 1755, Mr Landen has given several ingenious theorems invented for the summation of series; and the Philosophical Transactions for 1775 contain his curious discovery of the rectification of a hyperbolic arc, by means of two arcs of an ellipse, which was afterwards more firmly demonstrated by Legendre. His invention of a new calculus, called the residual analysis, and in some respects subsidiary to the method of fluxions, has immortalized his name. It was announced and explained in a small pamphlet published in 1715, entitled a Discourse concerning the Residual Analysis.\n\n91. The progress of geometry in England was accelerated by the labours of Mr Edward Waring, professor Waring, of mathematics at Cambridge. His two works entitled Phil. Trans. Meditaciones Analytice, published in 1769, and Meditae-1784, and tiones Algebraicae, and his papers in the Philosophical Trans. Tractions on the summation of forces, are filled with original and profound researches into various branches of the common algebra, and the higher analysis.\n\n92. It was from the genius of Lagrange, however, Discoveries that the higher calculus has received the most brilliant improvements. This great man was born in Piedmont, where he still resides. In addition to many improvements upon the integral analysis, he has enriched geometry with his method a new calculus called the method of variations. The object of variation of this calculus is, when there is given an expression or function of two or more variable quantities whose relation is expressed by a certain law, to find what this function becomes when that law suffers any variation infinitely small...\nsmall, occasioned by the variation of one or more of the terms which express it. This calculus is as much superior to the integral calculus, as the integral calculus is above the common algebra. It is the only means by which we can resolve an immense number of problems de maximis et minimis, and is necessary for the solution of the most interesting problems in mechanics.\n\nHis theory of analytical functions is one of the most brilliant specimens of human genius. In the Memoirs of Berlin for 1772 he had touched upon this interesting subject, but the theory was completely developed in 1797 in his work entitled \"Theorie des fonctions analytiques, contenant les principes du calcul différentiel, dégagés de toute considération d'infiniments petits, ou évanouissants, ou des limites, ou des fluxions ; et réduit à l'analyse algébrique des quantités finies.\" In a great number of memoirs which are to be found in the Memoirs of the Academy of Paris, in those of the Academy of Berlin, and in those of the French Academy, Lagrange has thrown light on every branch both of the common algebra and the new analysis.\n\n93. The new geometry has likewise been much indebted to the celebrated Laplace. His various papers in the Mémoires des Sciences Étrangères* and the Memoirs of the French Academy, have added greatly to the higher calculi, while his application of analysis to the celestial phenomena, as exhibited in the Mécanique Céleste, and his various discoveries in physical astronomy, entitle him to a high rank among the promoters of science.\n\n94. Among the celebrated French mathematicians of the last and present century, we cannot omit the names of Cousin, Lacroix, and Bollett; all of whom have written large works on the differential and integral calculi, and illustrated the new analysis by their discoveries. The Éléments de Géométrie by Legendre is one of the best and most original works upon elementary geometry, and his papers in the Memoirs of the Academy contain several improvements upon the new analysis.\n\n95. In Italy the mathematical sciences were destined to be improved and explained by a celebrated female. Donna Maria Gaetana Agnelli was professor of mathematics in the university of Bologna, and published a learned work entitled Analytical Institutions, containing the common analysis, and the differential and integral calculi. It has been translated into English by Professor Colton, and was published at the expense of Baron Maleré. A few years ago several curious properties of the circle have been discovered by Macheroni, another Italian mathematician, who has published them in his interesting work sur le Géométrie du Compas.\n\n96. In England the mathematical sciences have been successfully cultivated by Emerson, Baron Maleré, Dr M. Young, Dr Hutton, Professor Vince, and Professor Robertson of Oxford. The Doctrine of Fluxions by Emerson, and his Method of Increments, are good introductions to the higher geometry. The Scriptores Logarithmici of Baron Maleré; his Treatise on the Resolution of Equations; his Principles of Life Annuities; and his other mathematical papers, do the highest honour to his talents as a mathematician; while his zeal for the promotion of the mathematical sciences, and his generous attention to those who cultivate them, entitle him to the noble appellation of the friend and patron of genius. Dr Mathew Young, bishop of Clonfert, has given a synthetical demonstration of Newton's rule for young the quadrature of simple curves; and has written on the extraction of cubic and other roots. Dr Hutton and Dr Vince have each published several elementary treatises on mathematics, and have invented ingenious methods for the summation of series. Mr Robertson of Oxford is the author of an excellent treatise on conic sections.\n\n97. The ancient geometry was assiduously cultivated in Scotland by Dr Robert Simson and Dr Matthew Stewart. Dr Simson's edition of Euclid and his treatise on conic sections have been much admired. The Treatise Physical and Mathematical of Dr Matthew Stewart, Dr Simson, and his Propositiones Geometricae more veterum demonstratae, contain fine specimens of mathematical genius. In the present day the names of Professor Playfair and Professor Leslie of the university of Edinburgh, Mr Wallace and Mr Ivory now of the Royal Military College at Great Marlow, are well known to mathematicians. Mr Playfair's Elements of Geometry, and his papers on the Arithmetic of Impossible Quantities and on Porisms, are proofs of his great talents as a mathematician and a philosopher. Mr Leslie, well known for his great discoveries on heat, has found a very simple principle, capable of extensive application, by which the complicated expressions in the solution of indeterminate problems may be easily resolved. Mr Wallace's papers on Geometrical Porisms, Mr Wallace in the 4th vol. of the Edinburgh Transactions, display much genius; and Mr Ivory's Treatises in the last vol. of Baron Maleré's Scriptores Logarithmici, and his paper on A New Series for the Rectification of the Ellipsis, Edin. Trans. vol. 4th, entitle him to a high rank among modern mathematicians.\n\n---\n\nMATHEMATICAL, any thing belonging to the science of mathematics.\n\nMATHEMATICAL Instruments, such instruments as are usually employed by mathematicians, as compasses, scales, quadrants, &c.\n\nMachine for dividing MATHEMATICAL Instruments.

It is an extensive straggling village, built in a very romantic style, on the steep side of a mountain, rising irregularly from the bottom to nearly the summit. Near the bath are several small houses, whose situation is on the little natural horizontal\nMatra's tal parts of the mountain, a few yards above the road, and in some places the roofs of some almost touch the floors of others. There are excellent accommodations for company who resort to the bath; and the poorer inhabitants are supported by the sale of petrifactions, crytals, &c., and notwithstanding the rockiness of the soil, the cliffs produce an immense number of trees, whose foliage adds greatly to the beauty of the place.\n\nMATRASS, CUCURBIT, or BOLTHEAD, among chemists.

These are, the black, white, blue, red, and yellow or root colour.\n\nMATRIX, or matrices, used by the letter-founders, are those little pieces of copper or brass, at one end whereof are engraven, dentwife, or en creux, the several characters used in the composing of books. Each character, virgula, and even each point in a discourse, has its several matrix; and of consequence its several punchen to strike it. They are the engravers on metal that cut or grave the matrices.\n\nWhen types are to be cast, the matrix is fastened to the end of a mould, so disposed as that when the metal is poured on it, it may fall into the creux or cavity of the matrix, and take the figure and impression thereof. See Letter Foundry.\n\nMATRICES, used in coining, are pieces of steel in form of dies, whereon are engraven the several figures, arms, characters, legends, &c., wherewith the species are to be stamped. The engraving is performed with several punchens, which being formed in relievo, or prominent, when struck on the metal, make an indented impression, which the French call en creux.\n\nMATRICULA, a register kept of the admission of officers and persons entered into any body or society whereof a list is made. Hence those who are admitted into our universities are said to be matriculated. Among ecclesiastical authors, we find mention made of two kinds of matricula; the one containing a list of the ecclesiastics, called matricula clericae; the other of the poor subsidized at the expense of the church, called matricula pauperum.\n\nMATRICULA was also applied to a kind of almshouse, where the poor were provided for.

So, if a woman is convicted of a capital offence, and, being condemned to suffer death, pleads in stay of execution, that she is pregnant, a jury of matrons is impannelled to inquire into the truth of the allegation; and, if they find it true, the convict is respited till after her delivery.\n\nMATRONA, in Ancient Geography, a river separating Gallia Celtica from the Belgica (Cesar).

Authors vary in their accounts of the cause of his quitting his first occupation, and attaching himself to the art of painting. Some affirm, that the first unfolding of his genius was occasioned by the sight of a print which accidentally was shown to him by a friend who came to pay him a visit while he was in a declining state of health from the labour of his former employment, and that by his copying the print with some degree of success, he was animated with a desire to learn the art of painting. Others say, he fell in love with a young woman of great beauty, the daughter of a painter, and they allege that love alone wrought the miracle, as he could have no prospect of obtaining her except by a distinguished merit in the profession of painting: for which reason he applied himself with incessant labour to study and practise the art, till he became so eminent as to be entitled to demand her in marriage, and he succeeded. Whatever truth may be in either of these accounts, it is certain that he appeared to have an uncommon genius; his manner was singular, not resembling the manner of any other master; and his pictures were strongly coloured and carefully finished, but yet they are somewhat dry and hard. By many competent...\ntent judges it was believed, when they observed the strength of expression in some of his compositions, that if he had studied in Italy to acquire some knowledge of the antiques and the great masters of the Roman school, he would have proved one of the most eminent painters of the Low Countries. But he only imitated ordinary life; and seemed more inclined, or at least more qualified, to imitate the defects than the beauties of nature. Some historical compositions of this master deserve commendation; particularly a Decent from the Cross, which is in the cathedral at Antwerp; and it is justly admired for the spirit, skill, and delicacy of the whole. But the most remarkable and best known picture of Matys, is that of the Two Mifers in the gallery at Windsor. He died in 1529.\n\nMATT, in a ship, is a name given to rope-yarn, junk, &c. beat flat and interwoven; used in order to preserve the yards from galling or rubbing, in hoisting or lowering them.\n\nMATTER, in common language, is a word of the same import with body, and denotes that which is tangible, visible, and extended; but among philosophers it signifies that substance of which all bodies are composed; and in this sense it is synonymous with the word ELEMENT.\n\nIt is only by the senses that we have any communication with the external world; but the immediate objects of sense, philosophers have in general agreed to term qualities, which they conceive as inhering in something which is called their subject or substratum. It is this substratum of sensible qualities which, in the language of philosophy, is denominated matter; so that matter is not that which we immediately see or handle, but the concealed subject or support of visible and tangible qualities. What the moderns term qualities, was by Aristotle and his followers called form; but so far as the two doctrines are intelligible, there appears to be no essential difference between them. From the moderns we learn, that body consists of matter and qualities; and the Peripatetics taught the same thing, when they said that body is composed of matter and form.\n\nHow philosophers were led to analyze body into matter and form, or, to use modern language, into matter and qualities; what kind of existence they attribute to each; and whether matter must be conceived as self-existent or created—are questions which shall be considered afterwards (See METAPHYSICS). It is sufficient here to have defined the term.\n\nMATTHEW, or Gospel of St Matthew, a canonical book of the New Testament.\n\nSt Matthew wrote his gospel in Judea, at the request of those he had converted; and it is thought he began in the year 41, eight years after Christ's resurrection. It was written, according to the testimony of all the ancients, in the Hebrew or Syriac language; but the Greek version, which now passes for the original, is as old as the apostolic times.\n\nSt Matthew the Evangelist's Day, a festival of the Christian church, observed on September 21st.\n\nSt Matthew, the son of Alpheus, was also called Levi. He was of Jewish origin, as both his names discover, and probably a Galilean. Before his call to the apostolate, he was a publican or toll-gatherer to the Romans; an office of bad repute among the Jews, on account of the covetousness and exactness of Matthew, who managed it; St Matthew's office particularly consisting in gathering the customs of all merchandise that came by the sea of Galilee, and the tribute that passengers were to pay who went by water. And here it was that Matthew sat at the receipt of customs, when our Saviour called him to be a disciple. It is probable, that, living at Capernaum, the place of Christ's usual residence, he might have some knowledge of him before he was called. Matthew immediately expressed his satisfaction in being called to this high dignity, by entertaining our Saviour and his disciples at a great dinner at his own house, whither he invited all his friends, especially those of his own profession, hoping, probably, that they might be influenced by the company and conversation of Christ. St Matthew continued with the rest of the apostles till after our Lord's ascension. For the first eight years afterwards, he preached in Judea. Then he betook himself to propagating the gospel among the Gentiles, and chose Ethiopia as the scene of his apostolic ministry; where it is said he suffered martyrdom, but by what kind of death is altogether uncertain. It is pretended, but without any foundation, that Hyrtacus, king of Ethiopia, desiring to marry Iphigenia, the daughter of his brother and predecessor Agrippus, and the apostle having represented to him that he could not lawfully do it, the enraged prince ordered his head immediately to be cut off. Baronius tells us, the body of St Matthew was transported from Ethiopia to Bithynia, and from thence was carried to Salerno in the kingdom of Naples in the year 954, where it was found in 1080, and where Duke Robert built a church bearing his name.\n\nSt MATTHIEU, a town of Spain, in the kingdom of Aragon, seated in a pleasant plain, and in a very fertile country watered with many springs.

St Matthias was an apostle of Jesus Christ, but not of the number of the twelve chosen by Christ himself. He obtained this high honour upon a vacancy made in the college of the apostles by the treason and death of Judas Iscariot. The choice fell on Matthias by lot; his competitor being Joseph called Bar-Jesus, and surnamed Justus. Matthias was qualified for the apostleship, by having been a constant attendant upon our Saviour all the time of his ministry. He was, probably, one of the 70 disciples. After our Lord's resurrection, he preached the gospel first in Judea. Afterwards\nAfterwards it is probable he travelled eastwards, his residence being principally near the irruption of the river Apollus and the haven Hythus. The barbarous people treated him with great rudeness and inhumanity; and, after many labours and sufferings in converting great numbers to Christianity, he obtained the crown of martyrdom; but by what kind of death, is uncertain.—They pretend to show the relics of St Matthias at Rome; and the famous abbey of St Matthias near Trieres boasts of the same advantage: but doubtless both without any foundation. There was a gospel ascribed to St Matthias; but it was universally rejected as spurious.\n\n**MATTIACÆ AQUÆ**, or **MATTIACI FONTES**, in Ancient Geography, now Wildbad, opposite to Mentz, in Wetterau.

He was the son of a clergyman, and was originally intended for the church; but in consequence of some mortifications his father met with from the synod, on account of the peculiar sentiments he entertained about the doctrine of the Trinity, turned his thoughts to physic. He took his degree of M.D. at Leyden; and in 1740 came to settle in England, his father having determined to quit Holland for ever. In order to make himself known, he began in 1749 to publish in French an account of the productions of the English press, printed at the Hague under the name of the *Journal Britannique*. This journal, which continues to hold its rank amongst the best of those which have appeared since the time of Bayle, answered the chief end he intended by it, and introduced him to the acquaintance of some of the most respectable literary characters of the country he had made his own. It was to their active and uninterrupted friendship he owed the places he afterwards possessed. In 1758 he was chosen fellow, and in 1765, on the resignation of Dr Birch, who died a few months after, and had made him his executor, secretary to the Royal Society. He had been appointed one of the under librarians of the British museum at its first institution in 1753, and became principal librarian at the death of Dr Knight in 1772. Useful in all these situations, he promised to be eminently so in the last, when he was seized with a languishing disorder, which in 1776 put an end to a life which had been uniformly devoted to the pursuit of science and the offices of humanity. He was an early and active advocate for inoculation; and when there was a doubt entertained that one might have the smallpox this way a second time, tried it upon himself unknown to his family. He was a member of the medical club (with the Drs Parsons, Templeman, Fothergill, Watson and others), which met every fortnight in St Paul's Churchyard. He was twice married, viz. the first-time to Mrs Elizabeth Bolfragon; and the second to Mrs Mary Deners. He left a son and three daughters. He had nearly finished the Memoirs of the earl of Chesterfield; which were completed by his son-in-law Mr Jullamond, and prefixed to that nobleman's Miscellaneous Works, 1777; 2 vols. 4to.\n\n**Maty**, Paul Henry, M.A., F.R.S., son of the former, was educated at Westminster and Trinity college Cambridge, and had their travelling fellowship for three years. He was afterwards chaplain to Lord Stormont at Paris in 17—, and soon after vacated his next fellowship by marrying one of the three daughters of Joseph Clerk, Esq., fitter of the late Captain Charles Clerk (who succeeded to the command on the death of Captain Cook). On his father's death in 1776, he was appointed to the office of one of the under librarians of the British museum, and was afterwards preferred to a superior department, having the care of the antiquities, for which he was eminently qualified. In 1776 he also succeeded his father in the office of secretary to the Royal Society. On the disputes respecting the reinstatement of Dr Hutton in the department of secretary for foreign correspondence in 1784, Mr Maty took a warm and distinguished part, and resigned the office of secretary; after which he undertook to assist gentlemen or ladies in perfecting their knowledge of the Greek, Latin, French, and Italian classics. Mr Maty was a thinking conscientious man; and having conceived some doubts about the articles he had subscribed in early life, he never could be prevailed upon to place himself in the way of ecclesiastical preferment, though his connexions were amongst those who could have served him essentially in this point; and soon after his father's death he withdrew himself from ministering in the established church, his reasons for which he published in the 47th volume of the Gent. Magazine, p. 466. His whole life was thenceforwards taken up in literary pursuits. He received 100l. from the duke of Marlborough, with a copy of that beautiful work, the *Gemmae Marlburiae*, of which only 100 copies were worked off for presents; and of which Mr Maty wrote the French account, as Mr Bryant did the Latin. In January 1782 he set on foot a Review of publications, principally foreign, which he carried on, with great credit to himself and satisfaction to the public, for near five years, when he was obliged to discontinue it from ill health. He had long laboured under an asthmatic complaint, which at times made great ravages in his constitution, and at last put a period to his life in Jan. 1787, at the age of 42; leaving behind him one son.—Mr Maty was eminently acquainted with ancient and modern literature, and particularly conversant in critical researches. The purity and probity of his nature were unquestionable; and his humanity was as exquisite as it would have been extensive, had it been seconded by his fortune.\n\n**MAUBEUGE**, a town of the Netherlands, in Hainault, with an illustrious abbey of canonesses, who must be noble both by the father and mother's side.

He soon discovered a passion for mathematical studies, and particularly for geometry. He likewise practised instrumental music in his early years with great success; but fixed on no profession till he was 20, when he entered into the army. He first served in the Grey Musketeers; but in the year 1720, his father purchased for him a company of cavalry in the regiment of La Rochegeuyon. He remained but five years in the army, during which time he pursued his mathematical studies with great vigour; and it was soon remarked by M. Freret and other academicians, that nothing but geometry could satisfy his active soul and unbounded thirst for knowledge. In the year 1723, he was received into the Royal Academy of Sciences, and read his first performance, which was a memoir upon the construction and form of musical instruments, November 15, 1724. During the first years of his admission, he did not wholly confine his attention to mathematics; he dived into natural philosophy, and discovered great knowledge and dexterity in observations and experiments upon animals. If the custom of travelling into remote climates, like the sages of antiquity, in order to be initiated into the learned mysteries of those times, had still subsisted, no one would have conformed to it with greater eagerness than M. de Maupertuis. His first gratification of this passion was to visit the country which had given birth to Newton; and during his residence at London he became as zealous an admirer and follower of that philosopher as any one of his own countrymen. His next excursion was to Basil in Switzerland, where he formed a friendship with the famous John Bernoulli and his family, which continued to his death. At his return to Paris, he applied himself to his favourite studies with greater zeal than ever: —And how well he fulfilled the duties of an academician, may be gathered by running over the memoirs of the academy from the year 1724 to 1736; where it appears that he was neither idle nor occupied by objects of small importance. The most sublime questions in geometry and the relative sciences received from his hands that elegance, clearness, and precision, so remarkable in all his writings. In the year 1736, he was sent by the king of France to the polar circle, to measure a degree, in order to ascertain the figure of the earth, accompanied by Messrs Clairaut, Camus, Le Monnier, l'Abbe Outhier, and Celsius the celebrated professor of astronomy at Upsal. This distinction rendered him so famous, that at his return he was admitted a member of almost every academy in Europe.\n\nIn the year 1740 Maupertuis had an invitation from the king of Prussia to go to Berlin; which was too flattering to be refused. His rank among men of letters had not wholly effaced his love for his first profession, namely, that of arms. He followed his Prussian majesty into the field, and was a witness of the dispositions and operations that preceded the battle of Molwitz; but was deprived of the glory of being present, when victory declared in favour of his royal patron, by a singular kind of adventure. His horse, during the heat of the action, running away with him fell into the hands of the enemy; and was at first but roughly treated by the Austrian soldiers, to whom he could not make himself known for want of language; but being carried prisoner to Vienna, he received such honours from their Imperial majesties as were never effaced from his memory. From Vienna he returned to Berlin; but as the reform of the academy which the king of Prussia then meditated was not yet mature, he went again to Paris, where his affairs called him, and was chosen in 1742 director of the Academy of Sciences. In 1743 he was received into the French academy; which was the first instance of the same person being a member of both the academies at Paris at the same time. M. de Maupertuis again assumed the soldier at the siege of Fribourg, and was pitched upon by Marshal Cogny and the Count d'Argenson to carry the news to the French king of the surrender of that citadel.\n\nHe returned to Berlin in the year 1744, when a marriage was negotiated and brought about by the good offices of the queen-mother, between our author and Mademoiselle de Boreck, a lady of great beauty and merit, and nearly related to M. de Boreck at that time minister of state. This determined him to settle at Berlin, as he was extremely attached to his new spouse, and regarded this alliance as the most fortunate circumstance of his life.\n\nIn the year 1746, M. de Maupertuis was declared by his Prussian majesty president of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and soon after by the same prince was honoured with the order of Merit: However, all these accumulated honours and advantages, so far from lessening his ardour for the sciences, seemed to furnish new allurements to labour and application. Not a day passed but he produced some new project or essay for the advancement of knowledge. Nor did he confine himself to mathematical studies only: metaphysics, chemistry, botany, polite literature, all shared his attention, and contributed to his fame. At the same time, he had, it seems, a strange inquietude of spirit, with a morose temper, which rendered him miserable amidst honours and pleasures.—Such a temperament did not promise a very peaceful life; and he was engaged in several quarrels. He had\nMaupertuis, a quarrel with Koenig the professor of philosophy at Franeker, and another more terrible with Voltaire. Maupertuis had inferred into the volume of Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin for 1746, a discourse upon the laws of motion; which Koenig was not content with attacking, but attributed to Leibnitz. Maupertuis, flung with the imputation of plagiarism, engaged the academy of Berlin to call upon him for his proof; which Koenig failing to produce, he was struck out of the academy, of which he was a member. Several pamphlets were the consequence of this; and Voltaire, for some reason or other, engaged against Maupertuis. We say, for some reason or other; because Maupertuis and Voltaire were apparently upon the most amicable terms; and the latter respected the former as his master in the mathematics. Voltaire, however, exerted all his wit and satire against him; and on the whole was so much transported beyond what was thought right, that he found it expedient in 1753 to quit the court of Prussia.\n\nOur philosopher's constitution had long been considerably impaired by the great fatigues of various kinds in which his active mind had involved him; though from the amazing hardships he had undergone in his northern expedition, most of his future bodily sufferings may be traced. The intense sharpness of the air could only be supported by means of strong liquors, which served to increase his disorder, and bring on a spitting of blood, which began at least 12 years before he died. Yet still his mind seemed to enjoy the greatest vigour; for the best of his writings were produced, and most sublime ideas developed, during the time of his confinement by sickness, when he was unable to occupy his presidial chair at the academy. He took several journeys to St Malo, during the last years of his life, for the recovery of his health. And though he always received benefit by breathing his native air, yet still, upon his return to Berlin, his disorder likewise returned with greater violence.—His last journey into France was undertaken in the year 1757; when he was obliged, soon after his arrival there, to quit his favourite retreat at St Malo, on account of the danger and confusion which that town was thrown into by the arrival of the English in its neighbourhood. From thence he went to Bordeaux, hoping there to meet with a neutral ship to carry him to Hamburg, in his way back to Berlin; but being disappointed in that hope, he went to Toulouse, where he remained seven months. He had then thoughts of going to Italy, in hopes a milder climate would restore him to health; but finding himself grow worse, he rather inclined towards Germany, and went to Neufchatel, where for three months he enjoyed the conversation of Lord Marischal, with whom he had formerly been much connected. At length he arrived at Basle, October 16, 1758, where he was received by his friend Bernouilli and his family with the utmost tenderness and affection. He at first found himself much better here than he had been at Neufchatel; but this amendment was of short duration; for as the winter approached, his disorder returned, accompanied by new and more alarming symptoms. He languished here many months, during which he was attended by M.de la Condamine; and died in 1759.\n\nHe wrote in French, 1. The figure of the earth determined. 2. The measure of a degree of the meridian. 3. A discourse on the parallax of the moon. 4. A discourse on the figure of the stars. 5. The elements of geography. 6. Nautical astronomy. 7. Elements of astronomy. 8. A physical dissertation on a white inhabitant of Africa. 9. An essay on cosmography. 10. Reflections on the origin of languages. 11. An essay on moral philosophy. 12. A letter on the progress of the sciences. 13. An essay on the formation of bodies. 14. An eulogy on M.de Montesquieu. 15. Letters, and other works.\n\nMAUR, Sr., was a celebrated disciple of St Benedict. If we can believe a life of St Maur ascribed to Faustus his companion, he was sent by Benedict on a mission to France. But this life is considered as apocryphal. In rejecting it, however, as well as the circumstances of the mission, we must beware of denying the mission itself. It is certain that it was believed in France as early as the 9th century; and notwithstanding the silence of Bede, Gregory of Tours, and others, there are several documents which prove this, or at least render it extremely probable. A celebrated society of Benedictines, took the name of St Maur in the beginning of the last century, and received the sanction of Pope Gregory XV. in 1621. This society was early distinguished by the virtue and the knowledge of its members, and it still supports the character. There are perhaps fewer eminent men in it than formerly; but this must be ascribed to the levity of the age, and partly to the little encouragement for the researches of learned men. The chief persons of ingenuity which this society has produced are, the Fathers Menard, d'Acheri, Mabillon, Ruinart, Germain, Lami, Mouttacon, Martin, Vaillant, le Nourri, Martianay, Martenne, Massuet, &c., &c. See L'Histoire Litteraire de la Congregation de St Maur, published at Paris under the title of Bruffels, in 4to, 1779, by Dom. Taffin.\n\nMAURICEAU, Francis, a French surgeon, who applied himself with great success and reputation to the theory and practice of his art for several years at Paris. Afterwards he confined himself to the disorders of pregnant and lying-in women, and was at the head of all the operators in this way. His Observations sur la grossesse et sur l'accouchement des femmes, sur leurs maladies, et celles des enfants nouveaux, 1694, in 4to, is reckoned an excellent work, and has been translated into several languages, German, Flemish, Italian, English; and the author himself translated it into Latin. It is illustrated with cuts. He published another piece or two, by way of supplement, on the same subject; and died at Paris in 1709.\n\nMAURICE, Sr., commander of the Theban legion, was a Christian, together with the officers and soldiers of that legion, amounting to 6600 men.—This legion received its name from the city Thebes in Egypt, where it was raised. It was sent by Diocletian to check the Bagaudae, who had excited some disturbances in Gaul. Maurice having carried his troops over the Alps, the emperor Maximilian commanded him to employ his utmost exertions to extirpate Christianity. This proposal was received with horror both by the commander and by the soldiers. The emperor, enraged at their opposition, commanded the legion to be decimated; and when they still declared\nMaurice declared that they would sooner die than do anything prejudicial to the Christian faith; every tenth man of those who remained was put to death. Their perseverance excited the emperor to still greater cruelty; for when he saw that nothing could make them relinquish their religion, he commanded his troops to surround them, and cut them to pieces. Maurice, the commander of these Christian heroes, and Exuperus and Candidus, officers of the legion, who had chiefly instigated the soldiers to this noble resistance, signalized themselves by their patience and their attachment to the doctrines of the Christian religion. They were massacred, it is believed, at Agaune, in Chablais, the 22nd of September 286.\n\nNotwithstanding many proofs which support this transaction, Dubordier, Hottinger, Moyle, Burnet, and Mothein, are disposed to deny the fact. It is defended, on the other hand, by Hickes an English writer, and by Dom Joseph de Lisle a Benedictine monk de la congregation de Saint Vannes, in a work of his, entitled Defence de la Verité du Martyre de la Legion Thebaine, 1737. In defense of the same fact, the reader may consult Historia di S. Mauritius, by P. Rosignole a Jesuit, and the Acta Sanctorum for the month of September. The martyrdom of this legion, written by St Eucherius bishop of Lyons, was transmitted to posterity in a very imperfect manner by Surius, P. Chiflet a Jesuit, discovered, and gave to the public, an exact copy of this work. Don Ruinart maintains, that it has every mark of authenticity. St Maurice is the patron of a celebrated order in the king of Sardinia's dominions, created by Emmanuel Philibert duke of Savoy, to reward military merit, and approved by Gregory XIII. in 1572. The commander of the Theban legion must not be confounded with another St Maurice, mentioned by Theodoret, who suffered martyrdom at Apamea in Syria.\n\nMaurice (Mauritius Tiberius), was born at Arasibissus in Cappadocia, A.D. 539. He was descended from an ancient and honourable Roman family. After he had filled several offices in the court of Tiberius Constantine, he obtained the command of his armies against the Persians. His gallantry was so conspicuous that the emperor gave him his daughter Constantina in marriage, and invested him with the purple the 13th August 582. The Persians still continued to make incursions on the Roman territories, and Maurice sent Philippicus, his brother-in-law, against them. This general conducted the war with various success. At first he gained several splendid victories, but he did not continue to have a decided superiority. As there was a great use for soldiers in these unfortunate times, the emperor issued a mandate in 592, forbidding any soldier to become a monk till he had accomplished the term of his military service. Maurice acquired much glory in restoring Chosroes II. king of Persia, to the throne, after he had been deposed by his subjects. The empire was in his reign harassed by the frequent incursions of the Arabian tribes. He purchased peace from them, by granting them a pension nearly equal to 100,000 crowns; but these barbarians took frequent opportunities to renew the war. In different engagements the Romans destroyed 50,000, and took 17,000 prisoners. These were destroyed, on condition that the king of the Abari should return all the Roman captives in his dominions. Maurice, regardless of his promise, he demanded a ransom of 10,000 crowns. Maurice, full of indignation, refused the sum; and the barbarian, equally enraged, put the captives to the sword. While the emperor, to revenge this cruelty, was making preparations against the Abari, Phocas, who from the rank of centurion had attained the highest military preferment, assumed the purple, and was declared emperor. He pursued Maurice to Chalcedon, took him prisoner, and condemned him to die. The five sons of this unfortunate prince were massacred before his eyes, and Maurice, humbling himself under the hand of God, was heard to exclaim, Thou art just, O Lord, and thy judgments are without partiality. He was beheaded on the 26th November 602, in the 63rd year of his age and 20th of his reign. Many writers have estimated the character of this prince by his misfortunes instead of his actions. They believed him guilty without evidence, and condemned him without reason. It cannot be denied, however, that he allowed Italy to be harassed; but he was father to the rest of the empire. He restored the military discipline, humbled the pride of his enemies, supported the Christian religion by his laws, and piety by his example. He loved the sciences, and was the patron of learned men.\n\nMaurice, elector of Saxony, son of Henry le Pieux, was born A.D. 1521. He was early remarkable for his courage, and during his whole life he was engaged in warlike pursuits. He served under the emperor Charles V. in the campaign of 1544 against France; and in the year following against the league of Smalkalde; with which, although a Protestant, he would have no manner of connexion. The emperor, as a reward for his services, in the year 1547, made him elector of Saxony, having deprived his cousin John Frederick of that electorate. Ambition had led him to second the views of Charles, in the hope of being elector, and ambition again detached him from that prince. In 1551 he entered into a league against the emperor, together with the elector of Brandenburg, the Count Palatine, the duke of Wurtemberg, and many other princes. This league, encouraged by the young and enterprising Henry II. of France, was more dangerous than that of Smalkalde. The pretext for the association was the deliverance of the landgrave of Hesse, whom the emperor kept prisoner. Maurice and the confederates marched, in 1552, to the defiles of Tyrol, and put to flight the Imperial troops who guarded them. The emperor and his brother Ferdinand narrowly escaped, and fled from the conquerors in great disorder. Charles having retired into Pfaffau, where he had collected an army, brought the princes of the league to terms of accommodation. By the famous peace of Pfaffau, which was finally ratified the 12th of August 1552, the emperor granted an amnesty without exception to all those who had carried arms against him from the year 1546. The Protestants not only obtained the free exercise of their religion, but they were admitted into the imperial chamber, from which they had been excluded since the victory of Mulberg. Maurice soon after united himself with the emperor against the margrave of Brandenburg, who laid waste the German provinces. He engaged him in 1553, gain-\nMaurice died at the battle of Siverhausen, and died of the wounds he had received in the engagement two days after. He was one of the greatest protectors of the Lutherans in Germany, and a prince equally brave and politic. After he had profited by the fruits of John Frederick, the chief of the Protestants, he became himself the leader of the party, and by these means maintained the balance of power against the emperor in Germany.\n\nMaurice de Nassau, prince of Orange, succeeded to the government of the Low Countries after the death of his father William, who was killed in 1584 by the fanatic Gerard. The young prince was then only eighteen years of age, but his courage and abilities were above his years. He was appointed captain general of the United Provinces, and he reared that edifice of liberty which his father had laid the foundation. Breda submitted to him in 1590; Zutphen, Deventer, Hulst, Nimeguen. He gained several important advantages in 1592, and in the year following he made himself master of Geertruidenburg. When he had performed these splendid services, he returned to the Low Countries by the way of Zealand. His fleet was attacked by a dreadful tempest, in which he lost forty vessels, and he himself had very nearly perished. His death would have been considered by the Hollanders as a much greater calamity than the loss of their vessels. They watched over his safety with exceeding care. In 1594, one of his guards was accused of an intention to take away his life; and it was generally believed that he was bribed to this service by the enemies of the republic. He fell a sacrifice at Bruges, either to his own fanaticism or to the jealous anxiety of the friends of Maurice. The prince of Orange, increasing in reputation, defeated the troops of the archduke Albert in 1597, and drove the Spaniards entirely out of Holland. In 1600 he was obliged to raise the siege of Dunkirk; but he took ample vengeance on Albert, whom he again defeated in a pitched battle near Nieuport. Before the action, this great general sent back the ships which had brought his troops into Flanders: My Brethren (said he to his army), we must conquer the enemy or drink up the waters of the sea. Determine for yourselves; I have determined I shall either conquer by your bravery, or I shall never survive the disgrace of being conquered by men in every respect our inferiors. This speech elevated the soldiers to the highest pitch of enthusiasm, and the victory was complete. Rhinberg, Grave, and Ecluse, cities in Flanders, submitted to the conqueror the following year. Maurice, however, not only laboured for the commonwealth, but also for himself. He coveted the sovereignty of Holland, and was opposed in the prosecution of his design by the pensioner Barneveldt. The zeal and activity of this wise republican cost him his life. He was an Arminian; and at this time Maurice defended Gomar against Arminius.—Taking advantage of the general odium under which the Arminians lay, he found means to get Barneveldt condemned in 1610. His death, wholly owing to the cruel ambition of the prince of Orange, made a deep impression on the minds of the Hollanders. The truce with Spain being expired, Spinola laid siege to Breda in 1624, and in six months, by the proper direction of his great talents, though with great slaughter of his troops, he took the place. The prince of Maurice, Orange, unsuccessful in every attempt to raise the Mauritania siege, died of vexation in 1625, aged 55 years, with the reputation of the greatest warrior of his time.\n\nThe life of this stadtholder (says the abbe Raymond) was almost an uninterrupted series of battles, of sieges, and of victories. Of moderate abilities in everything else, he shone conspicuous in his military capacity. His camp was the school of Europe; and those who received their military education in his armies augmented, perhaps, the glory of their master. Like Montecucculi, he discovered inimitable skill in his marches and encampments; like Vauban, he possessed the talent of fortifying places, and of rendering them impregnable; like Eugene, the address of finding subsistence for great armies in countries barren by nature, or ravaged by war; like Vendome, the happy talent of calling forth, in the moment they became necessary, greater exertions from his soldiers than could reasonably be expected; like Condé, that infallible quickness of eye which decides the fortune of battles; like Charles XII., the art of rendering his troops almost invincible to cold, hunger, and fatigue; like Turenne, the secret of making war with the least possible expense of human blood.\" The Chevalier Polard maintains, that Maurice was the greatest commander of infantry since the time of the Romans. He studied the military art of the ancients, and applied their rules with great exactness in the various occurrences of war. He not only took advantage of the inventions of others, but he enriched the science of war with several improvements. Telegraphs were first used by him for a military purpose; and, besides a kind of gallery in conducting a siege, and the plan of blockading a strong place, which were of his invention, he greatly improved the whole art by his method of pushing an attack with great vigour, and of defending, for the greatest length of time, and in the best manner, a place besieged. In short, the many useful things which he practised or invented, placed him in the highest rank among men of a military character. On one occasion, a lady of quality asked him, Who was the first general of the age? Spinola (replied he) is the second. It was his constant practice, during sleep, to have two guards placed by his bedside, not only to defend him in case of danger, but to awake him if there should be the least occasion. The war between Spain and Holland was never carried on with greater keenness and animosity than during his administration.\n\nThe Grand Signior, hearing of the vast torrents of blood shed in this contest, thought that a great empire must depend on the decision. The object of so many battles was pointed out to him on a map, and he said coldly, If it were my business, I would send my pioneers, and order them to cast this little corner of earth into the sea. Maurice, like many great men, was impatient under contradiction, and too much devoted to women. He was succeeded by Frederick Henry his brother.\n\nMAURITANIA, an ancient kingdom of Africa, bounded on the west by the Atlantic ocean, on the south by Getulia or Libya Interior, and on the north by the Mediterranean; comprehending the greater part of the kingdoms of Fez and Morocco—Its ancient limits are not exactly mentioned by any historian; neither\nMauritania; neither can they now be ascertained by any modern observations, these kingdoms being but little known to Europeans.\n\nThis country was originally inhabited by a people called Mauri, concerning the etymology of which name authors are not agreed. It is probable, however, that this country, or at least a great part of it, was first called Phut, since it appears from Pliny, Ptolemy, and St Jerome, that a river and territory not far from Mount Atlas went by that name. From the Jerusalem Targum it likewise appears, that part of the Mauri may be deemed the offspring of Lud the son of Mizraim, since his descendants, mentioned Genesis x. are there called Μαυρος, Mauri, or Mauritani. It is certain, that this region, as well as the others to the eastward of it, had many colonies planted in it by the Phoenicians. Procopius tells us, that in his time two pillars of white stone were to be seen there, with the following inscription in the Phoenician language and character upon them: \"We are the Canaanites, that fled from Joshua the son of Nun, that notorious robber.\"\n\nIbn Ruchie, or Ibn Raguzi, an African writer cited by Leo, together with Evagrius and Nicephorus Callistus, affirms the same thing.\n\nThe Mauritians, according to Ptolemy, were divided into several cantons or tribes. The Metagonites were seated near the straits of Hercules, now those of Gibraltar. The Saccophi, or Cocophi, occupied the coast of the Iberian sea. Under these two petty nations the Malices, Verones, and Verbiae or Verviae, were settled. The Salisae or Salinse, were situated lower, towards the ocean; and, still more to the south, the Volubiliani. The Maurenfi and Herpiditani possessed the eastern part of this country, which was terminated by the Mulucha. The Angaucaei, or Jangaucaeani, Nestiberei, Zogrenfi, Banideae, and Vaconia, extended themselves from the southern foot of Ptolemy's Atlas Minor to his Atlas Major. Pliny mentions the Banture, whom Father Hardouin takes to be Ptolemy's Banubae; and Mela the Atlantes, whom he represents as possessed of the western parts of this district.\n\nThe earliest prince of Mauritania mentioned in history is Neptune; and next to him were Atlas and Antaeus his two sons, both famous in the Grecian fables on account of their wars with Hercules. Antaeus, in his contention with that hero, seems to have behaved with great bravery and resolution. Having received large reinforcements of Libyan troops, he cut off great numbers of Hercules's men. But that celebrated commander, having at last intercepted a strong body of Libyans sent to the relief of Antaeus, gave him a total overthrow, wherein both he and the best part of his forces were put to the sword. This decisive action put Hercules in possession of Libya and Mauritania, and consequently of the riches of all these kingdoms. Hence came the fable, that Hercules, finding Antaeus, a giant of an enormous size with whom he was engaged in single combat, to receive fresh strength as often as he touched his mother earth when thrown upon her, at last lifted him up in the air and squeezed him to death. Hence likewise may be deduced the fable intimating that Hercules took the globe from Atlas upon his own shoulders, overcame the dragon that guarded the orchards of the Hesperides, and made himself master of all the gold-Mauritania, en fruit there. Bochart thinks that the fable alluded clithely to naval engagements, wherein Hercules, for the most part, was victorious; though Antaeus from time to time received succours by sea. But at last Hercules, coming up with one of his squadrons which had a strong reinforcement on board, made himself master of it, and thus rendered Antaeus incapable for the future of making head against him. The same author likewise intimates, that the notion of Antaeus's gigantic stature prevailing for so many centuries amongst the Tingitanians, pointed out the size of the vessels of which his fleets and squadrons were composed. As for the golden apples so frequently mentioned by the old mythologists, they were the treasures that fell into Hercules's hands upon the defeat of Antaeus; the Greeks giving the oriental word ἀνά, richer, the signification affixed to their own term ἀπόλεια, apples.\n\nWith regard to the age in which Atlas and Antaeus lived, the most probable supposition seems to be that of Sir Isaac Newton. According to that illustrious author, Ammon the father of Sefac was the first king of Libya, or that vast tract extending from the borders of Egypt to the Atlantic ocean; the conquest of which country was effected by Sefac in his father's lifetime. Neptune afterwards excited the Libyans to a rebellion against Sefac, and slew him; and then invaded Egypt under the command of Atlas or Antaeus, the son of Neptune, Sefac's brother and admiral. Not long after, Hercules, the general of Thebais and Ethiopia for the gods or great men of Egypt, reduced a second time the whole continent of Libya, having overthrown and slain Antaeus near a town in Thebais, from that event called Antea or Anteopolis: this, we say, is the notion advanced by Sir Isaac Newton, who endeavours to prove, that the first reduction of Libya, by Sefac, happened a little above a thousand years before the birth of Christ, as the last, by Hercules, did some few years after. Now, though we do not pretend to adopt every particular circumstance of Sir Isaac Newton's system, yet we cannot forbear observing, that it appears undeniably plain from Scripture, that neither the western extremity of Libya, nor even the other parts of that region, could possibly have been so well peopled before the time of David or Solomon, as to have sent a numerous army to invade Egypt. For Egypt and Phoenicia, from whence the greatest part of the ancestors of the Libyans came, and which were much nearer the place from whence the first dispersion of mankind was made, could not themselves have been greatly overstocked with inhabitants any considerable time before the reign of Saul. And that such an invasion happened in the reign of Neptune, or at least of his son Antaeus, has been most fully evinced by this most excellent chronologer.\n\nFrom the defeat of Antaeus, nothing remarkable occurs in the history of Mauritania till the times of the Romans, who at last brought the whole kingdom under their jurisdiction; for which see the article Rome. 1 With regard to the customs, &c. of this people, it would seem from what Hyginus intimates, that they fought only with clubs, till one Belus, the son of Neptune, as that author calls him, taught them...\nMauritania: them the use of the sword. Sir Isaac Newton makes this Belus to have been the same person with Seloofris king of Egypt, who overran a great part of the then known world. 2. All persons of distinction in Mauritania went richly attired, wearing much gold and silver in their clothes. They took great pains in cleansing their teeth, and curled their hair in a curious and elegant manner. They combed their beards, which were very long, and always had their nails pared extremely close. When they walked out in any numbers, they never touched one another, for fear of disconcerting the curls into which their hair had been formed. 3. The Mauritanian infantry, in time of action, used shields made of elephants' skins, being clad in those of lions, leopards, and bears, which they kept on both night and day. 4. The cavalry of this nation was armed with broad short lances, and carried targets or bucklers, made likewise of the skins of wild beasts. They used no saddles. Their horses were small and swift, had wooden collars about their necks, and were so much under the command of their riders, that they would follow them like dogs. The habit of these horsemen was not much different from that of the foot above mentioned, they constantly wearing a large tunic of the skins of wild beasts. The Phutei, of whom the Mauritanians were a branch, were eminent for their shields, and the excellent use they made of them, as we learn from Homer, Xenophon, Herodotus, and Scripture. Nay, Herodotus seems to intimate, that the shield and helmet came from them to the Greeks. 5. Notwithstanding the fertility of their soil, the poorer sort of the Mauritanians never took care to manure the ground, being strangers to the art of husbandry; but roved about the country in a wild savage manner, like the ancient Scythians or Arabes Scenitei. They had tents, or mapalia, so extremely small, that they could scarce breathe in them. Their food was corn, herbage, &c. which they frequently did eat green, without any manner of preparation, being destitute of wine, oil, and all the elegancies as well as many necessaries of life. Their habit was the same both in summer and winter, consisting chiefly of an old tattered, though thick garment, and over it a coarse rough tunic; which answered probably to that of their neighbours the Numidians. Most of them lay every night upon the bare ground; though some of them strewed their garments thereon, not unlike the present African Kabyles and Arabs, who, according to Dr Shaw, use their hykes for a bed and covering in the night. 6. If the most approved reading of Horace may be admitted, the Mauritanians shot poisoned arrows; which clearly intimates, that they had some skill in the art of preparing poisons, and were excellent dartmen. This last observation is countenanced by Herodian and Aelian, who entirely come into it, affirming them to have been in such continual danger of being devoured by wild beasts, that they durst not stir out of their tents or mapalia without their darts. Such perpetual exercise must render them exceedingly skilful in hurling that weapon. 7. The Mauritanians sacrificed human victims to their deities, as the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, &c. did.\n\nThe country people were extremely rude and barbarous; but those inhabiting cities must undoubtedly have had at least some smattering in the literature of the several nations they deduced their origin from. That Mauritius, the Mauritanians had some knowledge in naval affairs, seems probable, not only from the intercourse they had with the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, as well as the situation of their country; but likewise from Orpheus, or Onomacritus, who affirms them to have made a settlement at the entrance into Colchis, to which place they came by sea. Magic, sorcery, divination, &c. they appear to have applied themselves to in very early times. Cicero and Pliny say, that Atlas was the inventor of astrology, and the doctrine of the sphere, i.e. he first introduced them into Mauritania. This, according to Diodorus Siculus, gave rise to the fable of Atlas's bearing the heavens upon his shoulders. The same author relates, that Atlas instructed Hercules in the doctrine of the sphere and astrology, or rather astronomy, who afterwards brought those sciences into Greece.\n\nMAURITIA, the Ginkgo, or Maidenhair tree: A genus of plants belonging to the natural order of palmes. See BOTANY Index.\n\nMAURITIUS, or Maurice, an island of Africa, about 400 miles east of Madagascar, lying in the latitude of 20 and 21 degrees south. It is about 150 miles in circumference. In the beginning of the 16th century it was discovered by the Portuguese, who knowing that Pliny and other ancient writers had mentioned the island of Cerne in these seas, took it for granted that this must be it; and accordingly we find it styled Cerne or Sirne, in their maps: but notwithstanding this, they did not think fit to settle it; and indeed their force was so small, in comparison of the vast dominions they grasped, that it was very excusable. However, according to their laudable custom, they put some hogs, goats, and other cattle, upon it, that in case any of their ships either going to the Indies or returning to Portugal should be obliged to touch there, they might meet with refreshments. The Dutch, in the second voyage they made to the East Indies under their admiral James Cornelius Vanneck, came together with five ships on the 15th of September 1688; anchored in a commodious port, to which they gave the name of Warwick Haven; and gave a very good account of the place in their journals. Captain Samuel Cafferton, in the Pearl, an English East India ship, arrived there on the 27th of March 1612; and taking it to be an island undiscovered before, bestowed upon it the name of England's Folly, though others of his crew called it Pearl Island; and in the account of their voyage, written by John Tatton the master of the ship, celebrated it as a place very convenient for stopping, either outward or homeward bound, to refresh at. This they sometimes accordingly did, and brought some cargoes of ebony, and rich wood from thence, but without fixing any settlement.\n\nAt length, in 1638, the Dutch seated themselves here: and it is highly remarkable, that at the very time they were employed in making their first settlement, the French sent a vessel to take possession of it, who found the Dutch beforehand with them, and refused the assistance of an English Indianan, wooing and watering in another port of the island, who very frankly offered it, to drive the Dutch from their half-settled posts. They continued for some time in quiet possession.\npossession of the places they fortified in this island, to which they gave the name of Mauritius, in honour of Prince Maurice their stadtholder. But having engaged the French, who were settled on Madagascar, to steal 50 of the natives, and sell them for slaves, for the improvement of the Dutch settlements here, this proved the ruin of both colonies; for the negroes surprized and massacred the French in Madagascar; and the slaves in Mauritius fled into the centre of the island; from whence they so much and so incessantly molested those who had been formerly their masters, that they chose to quit a country where they could no longer remain in any tolerable degree of safety. The East India Company, however, from motives of convenience, and a very imperfect notion of its value, disapproved this measure, and therefore ordered it to be resettled; which was accordingly done, and three forts erected at the principal havens. Things now went on somewhat better than they did before; but they were still very much disturbed by the revolted negroes in the heart of the isle, whom they could never subdue. One principal use that the company made of this place, was to send thither state prisoners, who, as they were not men of the best morals, quickly corrupted the rest of the inhabitants, and rendered them such a race of outrageous smugglers, the situation of the place concurring with their bad disposition, that, after various ineffectual attempts made to reform them, orders were at length given to abandon Mauritius a second time, which, after some delays, were put in execution in the year 1710.\n\nTwo years after this, the French took possession of it, and named it the île de France. This name has obtained among themselves, but the Europeans in general continue to call it Mauritius. It lies in S. Lat. 20. 15. E. Long. 6. 15. The inconveniences arising from the want of a port at the island of Bourbon, induced the French to take possession of Mauritius, it having two very good harbours, to fortify which no expense has been spared. That on the north-west is called Port Louis, that on the south-east side of the island is called Port Bourbon. The trade-wind from the south-east in these latitudes blows all the year round, excepting for a few days at the summer solstice, when it is interrupted by hard gales and hurricanes from the north. The ease with which this wind enables ships to enter the port of Bourbon, caused the French, when they first took possession of this spot, to esteem it the best port in the island; but experience pointing out to them, that the same wind often rendered the passage out of the harbour so difficult, that a ship was sometimes obliged to wait a considerable time before the weather admitted of her putting to sea, this harbour is in a great measure abandoned, and the principal town and seat of government is now fixed at Port Louis, which is nearly in the middle of the north side of the island, and its entrance is through a channel formed by two shoals, which advance about two miles into the sea. When a ship arrives opposite to this channel, the south-east wind hinders her from entering the port under sail, and she must either warp in with cables or be towed in with boats. The necessity of this operation, joined to the extreme narrowness of the channel, which does not admit of two ships abreast of each other entering at the same time, is one of the best defences the harbour has against an attack by sea; for, Mauritius, from these obstacles, an enemy would find it a matter of the greatest difficulty to force the port; and in addition to this natural strength, they have built two forts and as many batteries, which are mounted with heavy cannon, and entirely command the approach to the harbour, should ships presume to force an entry under sail. This port is capable of containing 100 sail of ships, and is well provided with every requisite for repairing and even building of ships. This port has proved of the greatest advantage to France in the several wars which have been carried on between Great Britain and her; and has proved of great utility to the French East India Company's commerce; for here their ships and crews were sure to meet with all necessary refreshment after a long voyage. The port of Bourbon is also fortified; and an army landed here would find it an extremely difficult task to pass the mountains to the different parts of the island. There are several places between the north-east extremity and Port Louis where boats may land, but all these are defended by batteries; and the country behind them is a continued thicket: The rest of the coast is inaccessible. In the north-eastern quarter is a plain extending about 10 miles from east to west, and in some places five miles inland from the northern coast. All the rest of the island is full of high and steep mountains, lying so near to one another, and the intervals between them so narrow, that, instead of valleys, they rather resemble the beds of torrents; and these are choked with huge fragments of rocks which have fallen from the steep sides of the impending mountains. On the summits of the mountains ice is frequently to be found, and they are covered with forests of ebony and other large trees. The ground they thence produces herbage, shrubs, and plants of various sorts, from the common grass to the strongest thorn, and that in such profusion, that they form a thicket so closely interwoven, that no progress can be made but by means of a hatchet. Notwithstanding these difficulties, plantations have been formed on these mountains, and very considerable progress has been made in the plains; but the productions, although mostly of the same kind, are not only in less quantity, but of an inferior quality to those produced at Bourbon island.\n\nIn a course of years, however, the settlement cools so much, and was considered in every light worth so little, that it had been more than once under deliberation, whether, after the example of the Dutch, they should not leave it again to its old negro inhabitants; which sooner or later in all likelihood would have been its fate, if, in 1735, the famous M. de la Bourdonnais had not been sent thither with the title of governor general of the French islands.\n\nHe found this isle in the worst state possible, thinly inhabited by a set of lazy people, who equally hated industry and peace, and who were continually flattering this man to his face, and betraying him wherever and as far as they durst. He gave himself no trouble about this, having once found the means to make himself obeyed; he saw the vast importance of the island; he conceived that it might be settled to great advantage; and, without too much as expecting the thanks of those for whom he laboured, he began to execute this great design. His first step was to bring over\nMauritius black boys from Madagascar, whom he carefully trained up in good principles, and in continual exercise; by which he rendered them so good soldiers, that he very quickly obliged the Morones, or wild negroes, either to submit or to quit the island; he taught the planters to cultivate their lands to advantage; he, by an aqueduct, brought fresh water to the sea side; and whereas they had not so much as a boat at his coming thither, he made a very fine dock, where he not only built floops and large vessels, but even a ship of the burden of 500 tons. However incredible it may seem, yet it is certainly fact, that in the space of five years he converted this country into a paradise, that had been a mere wilderness for 5000; and this in spite of the inhabitants, and of the company, who being originally prejudiced by them, behaved ill to him at his return. He soon made the cardinal de Fleury, however, sensible of the true state of things; and compelled the company to acknowledge, though they did not reward, his services. He afterwards returned into the Indies, and perfected the work he had begun, and to him it is owing that the isle of France was rendered one of the finest and most important spots upon the globe. Here no coffee is raised; but by the indefatigable industry of M. de Bourdonnais, sugar, indigo, pepper, and cotton (which are not at Bourbon), came to be cultivated with success. Since the departure of that most excellent governor, the plantations have been neglected, and are fallen off; but if a proper spirit of activity was raised among the inhabitants, they might soon be made to resume their flourishing appearance.\n\nMines of iron have been discovered in the mountains near the great plain, in the north-east part of the island; and these mountains affording in great abundance the necessary fuel, forges have been erected; but the iron produced is of a very inferior quality, it being brittle, and only fit for making cannon-balls and bomb-shells. Black cattle, sheep, and goats, are preserved with difficulty; the first generally die before they have been a year in the island, and this occasions frequent importations of them from Madagascar and other parts. Common domestic poultry breed in great plenty; and, with fish and turtle, furnish a great part of the food of the European inhabitants.\n\nThe approach to the island is extremely dangerous, it being surrounded with ledges of rocks, and many of them covered by the sea. The shore abounds with coral and shells. This island is said to contain 60 rivers; some are considerable streams, and most of them have their sources from lakes, of which there are several in the middle part of the island. The rivers afford plenty of various kinds of fish, particularly eels. These are of an enormous size, some having been found that were six feet long, and six inches in circumference, and so extremely voracious, that it is dangerous to bathe in those parts of the river where they lie, as they will seize a man without fear, and have strength sufficient to keep him under water till he is drowned. Here is a great variety of birds, and bats as large as a young kitten: the inhabitants esteem them a delicate morsel. The air is both hot and moist, but not unwholesome. The place abounds with insects, which are very troublesome; but there are no serpents. It has been discovered, that off Port Louis the south-east wind generally blows with least strength about sunrise; and it also happens, on four or five days, at Mauritius intervals, in the course of a month, that early in the morning the wind ceases in the northern part of the island for an hour or two, when a breeze rises, although but faintly, from the north-west; during which, a ship stationed at the entrance of the channel to avail herself of this breeze, may enter the harbour and attack the forts.\n\nThis island, during the period of the French revolution, did not entirely escape from the storm which then agitated the parent country. In the year 1799, a conspiracy was formed, and broke out, for the purpose of resisting the government which had been established under the authority of the republic. It was, however, soon suppressed by the activity of the municipality and governor-general, supported by the majority of the inhabitants, and order and tranquillity were again restored.\n\nThe population of this island in 1799 amounted to 65,000, viz., 55,000 slaves, and 10,000 whites and mulattoes. The following is a state of the produce of this island in 1800:\n\n- Coffee, 6000 bales, of 100 lbs. French.\n- Indigo, 300,000 lbs. from 2s. to 8s. per lb.\n- Cotton, 2000 bales, of 250 lbs.\n- Raw sugar, 20,000,000 lbs.\n- Cloves, 20,000 lbs.\n\nMAURUA, one of the Society islands in the South Sea. It is a small island, entirely surrounded with a ridge of rocks, and without any harbour for shipping. It is inhabited, and its productions are the same with those of the neighbouring islands. A high round hill rises in the middle of it, which may be seen at the distance of 10 or 12 leagues. W Long. 15° 32'. S. Lat. 16° 25'.\n\nMAUSOLEUM, a magnificent tomb or sepulchral monument. The word is derived from Mausolus king of Caria, to whom Artemisia his widow erected a most stately monument, esteemed one of the wonders of the world, and called it, from his own name, Mausoleum.\n\nSt. AWEs, a town of Cornwall, in England, seated on the east side of Falmouth haven, in W. Long. 4° 56' N. Lat. 50° 6'. Though but a hamlet of the parish of St Jull, two miles off, without a minister, or either church, chapel, or meeting-house, it has sent members to parliament ever since 1562 who are returned by its mayor or portreeve. It consists but of one street, under a hill, and fronting the sea, and its inhabitants subsist purely by fishing. K. Henry VIII. built a castle here, opposite to Pendennis, for the better security of Falmouth haven. It has a governor, a deputy, and two gunners, with a platform of guns. Here is a fair the Friday after St Luke's day.\n\nMAXENTIUS, MARCUS AURELIUS VALERIUS, a son of the emperor Maximianus Hercules, was, by the voluntary abdication of Diocletian, and of his father, raised to the empire A.D. 306. He afterwards incited his father to reassume his imperial authority; and in a perfidious manner destroyed Severus, who had delivered himself into his hands, and relied upon his honour for the safety of his life. His victories and successes were impeded by Galerius Maximianus, who opposed him with a powerful force. The defeat\nand voluntary death of Galerius soon restored peace to Italy; and Maxentius passed into Africa, where he rendered himself odious by his cruelty and oppression. He soon after returned to Rome, and was informed that Constantine was come to dethrone him. He gave his adversary battle near Rome, and, after he had lost the victory, he fell back to the city. The bridge over which he crossed the Tiber was in a decayed situation, and he fell into the river, and was drowned, A.D. 312. The cowardice and luxuries of Maxentius were as conspicuous as his cruelties. He oppressed his subjects with heavy taxes, to gratify the cravings of his pleasures, or the avarice of his favourites. He was debauched in his manners, and neither virtue nor innocence were safe whenever he was inclined to voluptuous pursuits. His body was deformed and unwieldy. To visit a pleasure ground, or to exercise himself under a marble portico, or walk on a shady terrace, was to him a Herculean labour, which required the greatest exertions of strength and resolution.\n\nMAXILLA, the Jaw. See Anatomy, No. 20—26.\n\nMAXIM, an established proposition or principle; in which sense it denotes much the same with axiom.\n\nMAXIMILIAN I., emperor of Germany, signified himself against the French while he was king of the Romans, and after he was emperor entered into the army of Henry VIII. of England as a volunteer against that nation: he was a protector of learned men, and abolished an iniquitous tribunal, styled judicium occultum Wolfshalic; he composed some poems, and the memoirs of his own life. He died in 1519, aged 60.\n\nMAXIMUM, in Mathematics, denotes the greatest quantity attainable in any given case.\n\nIf a quantity conceived to be generated by motion increases or decreases till it arrives at a certain magnitude or position, and then, on the contrary, grows greater or lesser, and it be required to determine the said magnitude or position, the question is called a problem de maximis et minimis.\n\nMAXIMUS, a celebrated Cynic philosopher, and magician, of Ephesus. He instructed the emperor Julian in magic; and, according to the opinion of some historians, it was in the conversation and company of Maximus that the apostasy of Julian originated. The emperor not only visited the philosopher, but he even submitted his writings to his inspection and censure. Maximus refused to live in the court of Julian; and the emperor, now dissatisfied with the refusal, appointed him high pontiff in the province of Lydia, an office which he discharged with the greatest moderation and justice. When Julian went into the east, the philosopher promised him success, and even said that his conquests would be more numerous and extensive than those of the son of Philip. He persuaded his imperial pupil, that, according to the doctrine of metempsychosis, his body was animated by the soul which once animated the hero whose greatness and victories he was going to eclipse. After the death of Julian, Maximus was almost sacrificed to the fury of the soldiers; but the interposition of his friends saved his life, and he retired to Constantinople. He was soon after accused of magical practices, before the emperor Valens, and beheaded at Ephesus, A.D. 366. Maximus wrote some philosophical and rhetorical treatises, some of which were dedicated to Julian. They are all now lost.\n\nMAXIMUS of Tyre, a Platonic philosopher, went to Rome in 146, and acquired such reputation there, that the emperor Marcus Aurelius became his scholar, and gave him frequent proofs of his esteem. This philosopher is thought to have lived till the reign of the emperor Commodus. There are still extant 41 of his dissertations; a good edition of which was printed by Daniel Heinlius, in 1624, in Greek and Latin, with notes.\n\nMAXIMUS MARIUS. See Marius.\n\nMAY, the fifth month in the year, reckoning from our first, or January; and the third, counting the year to begin with March, as the Romans anciently did. It was called Maius by Romulus, in respect to the senators and nobles of his city, who were named magiores; as the following month was called Junius, in honour of the youth of Rome, in honorem juniorum, who served him in the war; though some will have it to have been thus called from Maia, the mother of Mercury, to whom they offered sacrifice on the first day of it; and Papius derives it from Madius, eo quod tunc terra madeat. In this month the sun enters Gemini, and the plants of the earth in general begin to flower. The month of May has ever been esteemed favourable to love; and yet the ancients, as well as many of the moderns, look on it as an unhappy month for marriage. The original reason may perhaps be referred to the feast of the Lemures, which was held in it. Ovid alludes to this in the fifth of his Fasti, when he says,\n\nNec vidua te dixit eadem, nec virginis opta\nTempora; quae nupsit, non diuturna fuit;\nHac quoque de causa, si te proverbia tangant,\nMenfe malum Maio nubere vulgus att.\n\nMay-dew. See Dew.\n\nMay-duke, a species of cherry. See Prunus, Botany Index.\n\nMay, Isle of, a small island at the mouth of the firth of Forth, in Scotland, about a mile and a half in circumference, and seven miles from the coast of Fife, almost opposite to the rock called the Bass. It formerly belonged to the priory of Pittenweem; and was dedicated to St Adrian, supposed to have been martyred in this place by the Danes; and hither, in times of Popish superstition, barren women used to come and worship at his shrine, in hopes of being cured of their sterility. Here is a tower and lighthouse built by Mr Cunningham of Barns, to whom King Charles I. granted the island in fee, with power to exact twopence per ton from every ship that passes, for the maintenance of a lighthouse. In the middle of it there is a fresh-water spring, and a small lake. The soil produces pasturage for 100 sheep and 20 black cattle. On the west side the steep rocks render it inaccessible; but to the east there are four landing places and good riding. It was here that the French squadron, having the chevalier de St George on board, anchored in the year 1708, when the vigilance of Sir George Byng obliged him to relinquish his design, and bear away for Dunkirk. The shores all round\nround the island abound with fish, and the cliffs with water fowl.\n\nMay, Thomas, an eminent English poet and historian in the 17th century, was born of an ancient but decayed family in Sussex, educated at Cambridge, and afterwards removed to London, where he contracted a friendship with several eminent persons, and particularly with Endymion Porter, Esq. one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber to King Charles I. While he resided at court, he wrote the five plays now extant under his name. In 1622, he published a translation of Virgil's Georgics, with annotations; and in 1635 a poem on King Edward III. and a translation of Lucan's Pharsalia; which poem he continued down to the death of Julius Caesar, both in Latin and English verse. Upon the breaking out of the civil wars he adhered to the parliament; and in 1647, he published, \"The history of the parliament of England, which began November the third, MDCXL. With a short and accurate view of some precedent years.\" In 1649, he published, Historia Parliamenti Anglici Breviarium, in three parts; which he afterwards translated into English. He wrote the History of Henry II. in English verse. He died in 1642. He went well to rest over night, after a cheerful bottle as usual, and died in his sleep before morning: upon which his death was imputed to his tying his nightcap too close under his fat cheeks and chin, which caused his suffocation; but the facetious Andrew Marvel has written a poem of 100 lines, to make him a martyr of Bacchus, and die by the force of good wine. He was interred near Camden in Westminster Abbey; which caused Dr Fuller to say, that \"if he were a blasted and partial writer, yet he lieth buried near a good and true historian indeed.\" Soon after the restoration, his body, with those of several others, was dug up, and buried in a pit in St Margaret's churchyard; and his monument, which was erected by the appointment of parliament, was taken down and thrown aside.\n\nMayer, Tobias, one of the greatest astronomers and mechanics the 18th century produced, was born at Maspach, in the duchy of Wurtemberg 1723. He taught himself mathematics, and at the age of fourteen designed machines and instruments with the greatest dexterity and justness. These pursuits did not hinder him from cultivating the belles lettres. He acquired the Latin tongue, and wrote it with elegance. In 1750, the university of Gottingen chose him for their mathematical professor; and every year of his short life was thenceforward marked with some considerable discoveries in geometry and astronomy. He published several works in this way, which are all reckoned excellent; and some are inserted in the second volume of the \"Memoirs of the university of Gottingen.\" His labours seem to have exhausted him; for he died worn out in 1762.\n\nMayerne, Sir Theodore de, baron of Aubone, was the son of Lewis de Mayerne, the celebrated author of the General History of Spain, and of the Monarchie arylo-democratique, dedicated to the states-general. He was born in 1573, and had for his godfather Theodore Beza. He studied physic at Montpelier, and was made physician in ordinary to Henry IV. who promised to do great things for him, provided he would change his religion. James I. of England invited him over, and made him first physician to himself and his queen, in which office he served the whole royal family to the time of his death in 1655. His works were printed at London in 1700, and make a large folio, divided into two books; the first containing his Consilia, Epistolae, et Observationes; the second his Pharmacopoeia variaeque medicamentorum formule.\n\nMayhem. See Maim.\n\nMayne, Jasper, an eminent English poet and divine in the 17th century, who was bred at Oxford, and entered into holy orders. While his majesty resided at Oxford, he was one of the divines appointed to preach before him. He published in 1647 a piece entitled OXOMAXIA, or The people's war examined according to the principles of reason and scripture, by Jasper Mayne. In 1648 he was deprived of his studentship at Christ church, and two livings he had; but was restored with the king, who made him his chaplain and archdeacon of Chichester; all which he held till he died. Dr Mayne was held in very high esteem both for his natural parts and his acquired accomplishments. He was an orthodox preacher, and a man of severe virtue and exemplary behaviour; yet of a ready and facetious wit, and a very singular turn of humour. From some stories that are related of him, he seems to have borne some degree of resemblance in his manner to the celebrated Dr Swift; but if he did not possess those very brilliant parts that distinguished the Dean, he probably was less subject to that capricious and those unaccountable whimsies which at times so greatly eclipsed the abilities of the latter. Yet there is one anecdote related of him, which, although it reflects no great honour on his memory, as it seems to carry some degree of cruelty with it, yet is it a strong mark of his resemblance to the Dean, and a proof that his propensity for drollery and joke did not quit him even in his latest moments. The story is this: The Doctor had an old servant, who had lived with him some years, to whom he had bequeathed an old trunk, in which he told him he would find something that would make him drink after his death. The servant, full of expectation that his master, under this familiar expression, had left him somewhat that would be a reward for the assiduity of his past services, as soon as decency would permit, flew to the trunk; when, behold, to his great disappointment, the boasted legacy proved to be a red herring. The doctor, however, bequeathed many legacies by will to pious uses; particularly 50 pounds towards the rebuilding of St Paul's cathedral, and 200 pounds to be distributed to the poor of the parishes of Callington and Pyrton, near Wattington, of both which places he had been vicar. In his younger years he had an attachment to poetry; and wrote two plays, the latter of which may be seen in the tenth volume of Dodley's Collection, viz. 1. Amorous war, a tragicomedy. 2. The city-match, a comedy. He published a poem upon the naval victory by the duke of York over the Dutch, printed in 1665. He also translated into English from the Greek part of Lucian's Dialogues.\n\nMaynooth,\nMAYNOOTH, or Manooth, a post town in the county of Kildare, and province of Leinster, in Ireland, near 12 miles from Dublin. Though not very large, it is regularly laid out, and consists of good houses. Here is a charter school, which was opened 27th July 1759.\n\nMAYNWARING, Arthur, an eminent political writer in the beginning of the 18th century, studied several years at Oxford, and then went to Cheshire, where he lived some time with his uncle Mr Francis Cholmondeley, a very honest gentleman, but extremely averse to the government of King William III., to whom he refused the oaths. Here he prosecuted his studies in polite literature with great vigour; and coming up to London, applied to the study of the law. He was hitherto very zealous in antirevolutionary principles, and wrote several pieces in favour of King James II.; but upon being introduced to the duke of Somerset and the earls of Dorset and Burlington, began to entertain very different notions in politics. His father left him an estate of near 800l. a year, but so encumbered, that the interest money amounted to almost as much as the revenue. Upon the conclusion of the peace he went to Paris, where he became acquainted with Mr Boileau. After his return he was made one of the commissioners of the customs, in which post he distinguished himself by his skill and industry. He was a member of the Kit-cat club, and was looked upon as one of the chief supports of it by his pleasantry and wit. In the beginning of Queen Anne's reign, the lord treasurer Godolphin engaged Mr Donne to quit the office of auditor of the imprests, and made Maynwaring a present of a patent for that office worth about 200l. a-year in a time of business. He had a considerable share in the Medley, and was author of several other pieces. The Examiner, his antagonist in politics, allowed that he wrote with tolerable spirit, and in a masterly style. Sir Richard Steele dedicated the first volume of the Tatler to him.\n\nMAYO, one of the Cape de Verd islands, lying in the Atlantic ocean, near 300 miles from Cape Verde in Africa, about 17 miles in circumference. The soil in general is very barren, and water scarce; however, they have some corn, yams, potatoes, and plantains, with plenty of beesves, goats, and asses. What trees there are, grow on the sides of the hills, and they have some figs and water melons. The sea round about the island abounds with fish. The chief commodity is salt, with which many English ships are loaded in the summer time. The principal town is Pinofa, inhabited by negroes, who speak the Portuguese language, and are stout, lusty, and fleathy. They are not above 200 in number, and many of them go quite naked. W.

Lat. 15. 1C.\n\nMAYO, a county of Ireland, in the province of Connaught, having Sligo and the sea on the north, Roscommon on the south, Leitrim and Roscommon on the east, and the Atlantic ocean on the west. It contains 724,640 Irish plantation acres, 75 parishes, nine baronies, and one borough. It gives title of earl to the family of Bourke. This county takes its name from an ancient city, built in 664; the ruins of the cathedral, and some traces of the stone walls which encompassed the city, yet remain on the plains of Mayo. It was a university, founded for the education of such of the Saxon youths as were converted to the Christian faith: it was situated a little to the south of Lough Conn; and is to this day frequently called Mayo of the Saxons, being celebrated for giving education to Alfred the Great king of England. As this town has gone to decay, Balbriggan is reckoned the chief town. The county by the sea is mountainous; but inland has good pastures, lakes, and rivers. It is about 62 miles long, and 52 broad. Castlebar is the affixed town.—Mayo was formerly a bishop's see, which is now united to Tuam.\n\nMAYOR, the chief magistrate of a city or town, chosen annually out of the aldermen. The word, anciently wrote meyr, comes from the British miri, i.e. eycyldfure, or from the old English miret, viz. poteflar, and not from the Latin major. King Richard I. in 1189, changed the bailiff of London into a mayor, and from that example King John made the bailiff of King's Lynn a mayor anno 1204. Though the famous city of Norwich obtained not this title for its chief magistrate till the seventh year of King Henry V. anno 1419; since which there are few towns of note but have had a mayor appointed for government.\n\nMayors of corporations are justices of peace pro tempore, and they are mentioned in several statutes; but no person shall bear any office of magistracy concerning the government of any town, corporation, &c., who hath not received the sacrament according to the church of England within one year before his election, and who shall not take the oaths of supremacy, &c.\n\nIf any person intrudes into the office of mayor, a quo warranto lies against him, upon which he shall not only be ousted, but fined. And no mayor, or person holding an annual office in a corporation for one year, is to be elected into the same office for the next; in this case, persons obstructing the choice of a successor are subject to real penalty. Where the mayor of a corporation is not chosen on the day appointed by charter, the next officer in place shall the day after hold a court and elect one; and if there be a default or omission that way, the electors may be compelled to choose a mayor, by a writ of mandamus out of the king's bench. Mayors, or other magistrates of a corporation, who shall voluntarily absent themselves on the day of election, are liable to be imprisoned, and disqualified from holding any office in the corporation.\n\nMayor's Courts. To the lord mayor and city of London belong several courts of judicature. The highest and most ancient is that called the hustings, defined to secure the laws, rights, franchises, and customs of the city. The second is a court of request, or of conscience; of which before. The third is the court of the lord mayor and aldermen, where also the sheriffs sit; to which may be added two courts of sheriffs, and the court of the city orphans, whereof the lord mayor and aldermen have the custody. Also the court of common council, which is a court or assembly, wherein are made all by-laws which bind the citizens of London. It consists, like the parliament, of two houses: an upper, consisting of the lord mayor and aldermen; and a lower, of a number of common council men, chose by the several wards as representatives.\nMaza tatives of the body of the citizens. In the court of common council are made laws for the advancement of trade, and committees yearly appointed, &c. But acts made by them are to have the assent of the lord mayor and aldermen, by stat. 11 Geo. I. Also the chamberlain's court, where every thing relating to the rents and revenues of the city, as also the affairs of servants, &c. are transacted. Lastly, To the lord mayor belong the courts of coroner and of echeator; another court for the conservation of the river Thames; another of goal-delivery, held usually eight times a-year, at the Old Bailey, for the trial of criminals, whereof the lord mayor is himself the chief judge. There are other courts called wardmotes or meetings of the wards; and courts of halymote or assemblies of the several guilds and fraternities.\n\nMAZA, among the Athenians, was a fort of cake made of flour boiled with water and oil, and set, as the common fare, before such as were entertained at the public expence in the common hall or Prytaneum.\n\nMAZAGAN, a strong place of Africa in the kingdom of Morocco, and on the frontiers of the province of Daguela. It was fortified by the Portuguese, and besieged by the king of Morocco with 200,000 men in 1562, but to no purpose. It is situated near the sea. W. Long. 8. 15. N.

Lat. 37. 53.\n\nMAZARINE, Julius, a famous cardinal and prime minister of France, was born at Picina in the province of Abruzzo, in Naples, in 1602. After having finished his studies in Italy and Spain, he entered into the service of Cardinal Sachez, and became well skilled in politics, and in the interests of the princes at war in Italy; by which means he was enabled to bring affairs to an accommodation, and the peace of Queiras was shortly concluded. Cardinal Richlieu being taken with his conduct, did from thenceforward highly esteem him; as did also Cardinal Antonio, and Louis XIII. who procured him a cardinal's hat in 1641. Richlieu made him one of the executors of his will; and during the minority of Louis XIV. he had the charge of affairs. At last he became the envy of the nobility, which occasioned a civil war; whereupon Mazarine was formed to retire, a price was set on his head, and his library sold. Notwithstanding, he afterwards returned to the court in more glory than ever; concluded a peace with Spain, and a marriage treaty betwixt the king and the infanta. This treaty of peace passed for the masterpiece of Cardinal de Mazarine's politics, and procured him the French king's most intimate confidence; but at last his continual application to business threw him into a disease, of which he died at Vincennes in 1661.—Cardinal Mazarine was of a mild and affable temper. One of his greatest talents was his knowing mankind, and his being able to adapt himself, and to assume a character conformable to the circumstances of affairs. He possessed at one and the same time the bishopric of Metz, and the abbeys of St Arnauld, St Clement, and St Vincent, in the same city; that of St Dennis, Clagny, and Victor, of Marseilles; of St Marzuch, Michel at Soifors, and a great number of others. He founded Mazarine college at Paris; which is also called the college of the four nations. There has been published a collection of his letters, the most copious edition of which is that of 1745, in 2 vols. duodecimo.\n\nMAZZUOLI. See Parmigiano.\n\nMEAD, a wholesome, agreeable liquor, prepared with honey and water.\n\nOne of the best methods of preparing mead is as follows: Into twelve gallons of water put the whites of six eggs; mixing these well together, and to the mixture adding twenty pounds of honey. Let the liquor boil an hour, and when boiled, add cinnamon, ginger, cloves, mace, and rosemary. As soon as it is cold, put a spoonful of yeast to it, and turn it up, keeping the vessel filled as it works; when it has done working, stop it up close; and, when fine, bottle it off for use.\n\nThorley says, that mead not inferior to the best of foreign wines may be made in the following manner: Put three pounds of the finest honey to one gallon of water, and two lemon peels to each gallon; boil it half an hour, well scummed; then put in, while boiling, lemon peel: work it with yeast; then put it in your vessel with the peel, to stand five or six months, and bottle it off for use. If it is to be kept for several years, put four pounds to a gallon of water.\n\nThe author of the Dictionary of Chemistry directs to choose the whitest, purest, and best tasted honey, and to put it into a kettle with more than its weight of water: a part of this liquor must be evaporated by boiling, and the liquor scummed, till its consistence is such, that a fresh egg shall be supported on its surface without sinking more than half its thickness into the liquor; then the liquor is to be strained, and poured through a funnel into a barrel; this barrel, which ought to be nearly full, must be exposed to a heat as equable as possible, from 20 to 27 or 28 degrees of Mr Reaumur's thermometer, taking care that the bung-hole be slightly covered, but not closed. The phenomena of the spirituous fermentation will appear in this liquor, and will subsist during two or three months, according to the degree of heat; after which they will diminish and cease. During this fermentation, the barrel must be filled up occasionally with more of the same kind of liquor of honey, some of which ought to be kept apart, on purpose to replace the liquor which flows out of the barrel in froth. When the fermentation ceases, and the liquor has become very vinous, the barrel is then to be put into a cellar, and well closed; a year afterwards the mead will be fit to be put into bottles.\n\nMead is a liquor of very ancient use in Britain. See Feast.\n\nMEAD, Dr Richard, a celebrated English physician, was born at Stepney near London, where his father, the Reverend Mr Matthew Mead, had been one of the two ministers of that parish; but in 1662 was ejected for nonconformity, but continued to preach at Stepney till his death. As Mr Mead had a handsome fortune, he bestowed a liberal education upon 13 children, of whom Richard was the eleventh; and for that purpose kept a private tutor in his house, who\nMEAD\n\nMead, who taught him the Latin tongue. At 16 years of age Richard was sent to Utrecht, where he studied three years under the famous Gravius; and then choosing the profession of physic, he went to Leyden, where he attended the lectures of the famous Pitcairn on the theory and practice of medicine, and Herman's botanical courses. Having also spent three years in these studies, he went with his brother and two other gentlemen to visit Italy, and at Padua took his degree of doctor of philosophy and physic in 1695. Afterwards he spent some time at Naples and at Rome; and returning home the next year, settled at Stepney, where he married, and practiced physic, with a success that laid the foundation of his future greatness.\n\nIn 1703, Dr Mead having communicated to the Royal Society an analysis of Dr Bonomo's discoveries relating to the cutaneous worms that generate the itch, which they inferred in the Philosophical Transactions; this, with his account of poisons, procured him a place in the Royal Society, of which Sir Isaac Newton was then president. The same year he was elected physician of St Thomas's hospital, and was also employed by the surgeons to read anatomical lectures in their hall, which obliged him to remove into the city. In 1707 his Paduan diploma for doctor of physic was confirmed by the university of Oxford; and being patronized by Dr Radcliffe, on the death of that famous physician he succeeded him in his house at Bloomsbury-square, and in the greatest part of his business. In 1727 he was made physician to King George II. whom he had also served in that capacity while he was prince of Wales; and he had afterwards the pleasure of seeing his two sons-in-law, Dr Nichols and Dr Wilmot, his coadjutors in that eminent station.\n\nDr Mead was not more to be admired for the qualities of the head than he was to be loved for those of his heart. Though he was himself a hearty whig, yet, uninfluenced by party principles, he was a friend to all men of merit, by whatever denomination they might happen to be distinguished. Thus he was intimate with Garth, with Arbuthnot, and with Freund; and long kept up a constant correspondence with the great Boerhaave, who had been his fellow student at Leyden: they communicated to each other their observations and projects, and never loved each other less for being of different sentiments. In the mean time, intent as Dr Mead was on the duties of his profession, he had a greatness of mind that extended itself to all kinds of literature, which he spared neither pains nor money to promote. He caused the beautiful and splendid edition of Thuanus's history to be published in 1713, in seven volumes folio: and by his interposition and assiduity, Mr Sutton's invention of drawing foul air from ships and other close places was carried into execution, and all the ships in his majesty's navy provided with this useful machine. Nothing pleased him more than to call hidden talents into light; to give encouragement to the greatest projects, and to see them executed under his own eye. During almost half a century he was at the head of his business, which brought him one year above seven thousand pounds, and for several years between five and six thousand; yet clergymen, and in general all men of learning, were welcome to his advice. His library consisted Meadow, of 15,000 volumes, of which his Latin, Greek, and oriental manuscripts, made no inconsiderable part. He had a gallery for his pictures and antiquities, which cost him great sums. His reputation, not only as a physician, but as a scholar, was so universally established, that he corresponded with all the principal literati in Europe: even the king of Naples sent to desire a complete collection of his works; and in return made him a present of the two first volumes of Signor Bajardi, which may be considered as an introduction to the collection of the antiquities of Herculaneum. At the same time that prince invited him to his palace, that he might have an opportunity of showing him those valuable monuments of antiquity; and nothing but his great age prevented his undertaking a journey so suited to his taste. No foreigner of learning ever came to London without being introduced to Dr Mead; and on these occasions his table was always open, and the magnificence of princes was united with the pleasures of philosophers. It was principally to him that the several counties of England and our colonies abroad applied for the choice of their physicians, and he was likewise consulted by foreign physicians from Russia, Prussia, Denmark, &c. He wrote, besides the above works, 1. A Treatise on the Scurvy, 2. De variolis et morbillis dissertatio. 3. Medica sacra: five de Morbis insignioribus, qui in Biblis memorantur, Commentarius. 4. Monita et Praecepta medica. 5. A Discourse concerning pestilential contagion, and the methods to be used to prevent it. The works he wrote and published in Latin were translated into English, under the Doctor's inspection, by Thomas Stack, M. D. and F. R. S. This great physician, naturalist, and antiquarian, died on the 16th of February 1754.\n\nMEADOW, in its general signification, means pasture or grass lands, annually mown for hay; but it is more particularly applied to lands that are so low as to be too moist for cattle to graze upon them in winter without spoiling the sward. For the management and watering of meadows, see AGRICULTURE, p. 435.\n\nMEAL, the flour of grain. The meal or flour of Britain is the finest and whitest in the world. The French is usually browner, and the German browner than that. Our flour keeps well with us; but in carrying abroad it often contracts damp, and becomes bad. All flour is subject to breed worms; there are white in the white flour, and brown in that which is brown; they are therefore not always distinguishable to the eye: but when the flour feels damp, and smells rank and musty, it may be conjectured that they are there in great abundance.\n\nThe colour and the weight are the two things which denote the value of meal or flour; the whiter and the heavier it is, others things being alike, the better it always is. Pliny mentions these two characters as the marks of good flour; and tells us, that Italy in his time produced the finest in the world. This country indeed was famous before his time for this produce; and the Greeks have celebrated it; and Sophocles in particular says, that no flour is so white or so good as that of Italy. The corn of this country has, however, lost much of its reputation since that time;\nMEAN, in general, denotes the middle between two extremes: thus we say the mean distance, mean proportion, &c.\n\n**Mean, Arithmetical**, is half the sum of the two extremes, as 4 is the arithmetical mean between 2 and 6; for \\[ \\frac{2+6}{2} = 4 \\]\n\n**Mean, Geometrical**, is the square root of the rectangle, or product of the two extremes: thus,\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{1 \\times 9} = \\sqrt{2} = 3 \\]\n\nTo find two mean proportionals between two extremes: multiply each extreme by the square of the other, then extract the cube root out of each product, and the two roots will be the mean proportionals required.\n\nRequired two proportionals between 2 and 16,\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 \\times 16 = 64, \\text{ and } \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4. \\]\n\nAgain,\n\n\\[ \\sqrt[3]{2 \\times 16^2} = \\sqrt[3]{512} = 8. \\]\n\n4 and 8 therefore are the two proportionals sought.\n\n**MEARNSSHIRE**, a county of Scotland. See Kincardineshire.\n\n**MEASLES**, a cutaneous disease attended with a fever, in which there is an appearance of eruptions that do not tend to a suppuration. See Medicine Index.\n\n**Measure of an angle**, is an arch described from the vertex in any place between its legs. Hence angles are distinguished by the ratio of the arches, described from the vertex between the legs to the peripheries. Angles then are distinguished by those arches; and the arches are distinguished by their ratio to the periphery. Thus an angle is said to be so many degrees as there are in the said arch.\n\n**Measure of a solid**, is a cube whose side is an inch, a foot, or a yard, or any other determinate length. In geometry it is a cubic perch, divided into cubic feet, digits, &c.\n\n**Measure of velocity**, in Mechanic, is the space passed over by a moving body in a given time. To measure a velocity, therefore, the space must be divided into as many equal parts as the time is conceived to be divided into; the quantity of space answering to such a part of time is the measure of the velocity.\n\n**Measure, in Geometry**, denotes any quantity assumed as one, or unity, to which the ratio of the other homogeneous or similar quantities is expressed.\n\n**Measure**, in a legal and commercial sense, denotes a certain quantity or proportion of any thing bought, sold, valued, or the like.\n\nIt is necessary, for the convenience of commerce, that an uniformity should be observed in weights and measures, and regulated by proper standards. A foot-rule may be used as a standard for measures of length, a bushel for measures of capacity, and a pound for weights. There should be only one authentic standard of each kind, formed of the most durable materials, and kept with all possible care. A sufficient number of copies, exactly corresponding to the principal standard, may be distributed for adjusting the weights and measures that are made for common use. There are several standards of this kind both in England.\nIf any one of the standards above mentioned be justly preserved, it will serve as a foundation for the others, by which they may be corrected if inaccurate, or restored if entirely lost. For instance, if we have a standard foot, we can easily obtain an inch, and can make a box which shall contain a cubical inch, and may serve as a standard for measures of capacity. If it be known that a pint contains 102 cubical inches, we may make a vessel five inches square, and four inches deep, which will contain a pint. If the standard is required in any other form, we may fill this vessel with water, and regulate another to contain an equal quantity. Standards for weights may be obtained from the same foundation; for if we know how many inches of water it takes to weigh a pound, we have only to measure that quantity, and the weight which balances it may be assumed as the standard of a pound.\n\nAgain, if the standard of a pound be given, the measure of an inch may be obtained from it; for we may weigh a cubical inch of water, and pour it into a regular vessel; and having noticed how far it is filled, we may make another vessel of like capacity in the form of a cube. The side of this vessel may be assumed as the standard for an inch; and standards for a foot, a pint, or a bushel, may be obtained from it. Water is the most proper substance for regulating standards; for all other bodies differ in weight from others of the same kind; whereas it is found by experience that spring and river water, rain, and melted snow, and all other kinds, have the same weight; and this uniformly holds in all countries when the water is pure, alike warm, and free from salt and minerals.\n\nThus, any one standard is sufficient for restoring all the rest. It may further be desired to hit on some expedient, if possible, for restoring the standards, in case that all of them should ever fall into disorder, or should be forgotten, through the length of time, and the vicissitudes of human affairs. This seems difficult, as no words can convey a precise idea of a foot-rule, or a pound weight. Measures, affixed from the dimensions of the human body, as a foot, a hand-breadth, or a pace, must nearly be the same in all ages, unless the size of the human race undergo some change; and therefore, if we know how many square feet a Roman acre contained, we may form some judgement of the nature of the law which restricted the property of a Roman citizen to seven acres; and this is sufficient to render history intelligible; but it is too inaccurate to regulate measures for commercial purposes. The same may be said of standards, deduced from the measure of a barley-corn, or the weight of a grain of wheat. If the distance of two mountains be accurately measured and recorded, the nature of the measure used will be preserved in a more permanent manner than by any standard; for if ever that measure fall into disuse, and another be substituted in its place, the distance may be measured again, and the proportion of the standards may be ascertained by comparing the new and ancient distances.\n\nBut the most accurate and unchangeable manner of establishing standards is, by comparing them with the length of pendulums. The longer a pendulum is, it vibrates the slower; and it must have one precise length measure, in order to vibrate in a second. The slightest difference in length will occasion a difference in the time; which will become abundantly sensible after a number of vibrations, and will be easily observed if the pendulum be applied to regulate the motion of a clock. The length of a pendulum which vibrates seconds in London is about 39 inches, is constantly the same at the same place, but it varies a little with the latitude of the place, being shorter as the latitude is less. Therefore, though all standards of weights and measures were lost, the length of a second pendulum might be found by repeated trials; and if the pendulum be properly divided, the just measure of an inch will be obtained; and from this all other standards may be restored. See Whitehurst on Invariable Measures.\n\nMeasures are various, according to the various kinds and dimensions of the things measured.—Hence arise lineal or longitudinal measures, for lines or lengths; square measures, for areas or surfaces; and solid or cubic measures, for bodies and their capacities; all which again are very different in different countries and in different ages, and even many of them for different commodities. Whence arise other divisions of ancient and modern measures, domestic and foreign ones, dry measures, liquid measures, &c.\n\nI. Long Measures, or Measures of Application.\n\n1.] The English and Scotch Standards.\n\nThe English lineal standard is the yard, containing 3 English feet; equal to 3 Paris feet 1 inch and 7/8 of an inch, or 3/4 of a Paris ell. The use of this measure was established by Henry I. of England, and the standard taken from the length of his own arm. It is divided into 36 inches, and each inch is supposed equal to 3 barleycorns. When used for measuring cloth, it is divided into four quarters, and each quarter subdivided into 4 nails. The English ell is equal to a yard and a quarter, or 45 inches, and is used in measuring linens imported from Germany and the Low Countries.\n\nThe Scots ell was established by King David I. and divided into 37 inches. The standard is kept in the council chamber of Edinburgh, and being compared with the English yard, is found to measure 37 7/8 inches; and therefore the Scots inch and foot are larger than the English, in the proportion of 185 to 185; but this difference being so inconsiderable, is seldom attended to in practice. The Scots ell, though forbidden by law, is still used for measuring some coarse commodities, and is the foundation of the land measure of Scotland.\n\nItinerary measure is the same both in England and Scotland. The length of the chain is 4 poles, or 22 yards; 80 chains make a mile. The old Scots computed miles were generally about a mile and a half each.\n\nThe reel for yarn is 2 7/8 yards, or 10 quarters, in circuit; 120 threads make a cut, 12 cuts make a half or hank, and 4 hanks make a spindle.\n\n2.] The French standard was formerly the aune or ell, containing 3 Paris feet 7 inches 8 lines, or 1 yard 7/8 English; the Paris foot royal exceeding the English by 6/8 parts, as in one of the following tables. This\nThe French, however, have also formed an entirely new system of weights and measures, according to the following table.\n\n| Proportions of the meafures of each species to its principal meafure or unity. | First part of the name which indicates the proportion to the principal meafure or unity. | Length. | Capacity. | Weight. | Agrarian. | For firewood. |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 10,000 | Myria | Metre. | Litre. | Gramme. | Are. | Stere. |\n| 1,000 | Kilo |\n| 100 | Hecto |\n| 10 | Deca |\n| 1 | |\n| 0.1 | Deci |\n| 0.01 | Centi |\n| 0.001 | Milli |\n\nProportion of the principal meafures between themselves and the length of the meridian.\n\n| Proportion of the principal meafures between themselves and the length of the meridian. | A decimetre cube. | Weight of a centimetre cube of distilled water. | 100 square metres. | One cubic metre. |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 10,000,000th part of the distance from the pole to the equator. |\n\nValue of the principal meafures in the ancient French meafures.\n\n| Value of the principal meafures in the ancient French meafures. | 3 feet 11 lines and ½ nearly. | 1 pint and ¼ or 1 litre and ¼ nearly. | 18 grains and 841,000 parts. | Two square perches des eaux et forêt. | 1 demi-voie, or ¼ of a cord des eaux et forêt. |\n\nValue in English meafures.\n\n| Value in English meafures. | Inches 39.383 inches, which is more than the wine, and less than the beer quart. | 22,966 grains. | 11.968 square yards. |\n\nThe English avoirdupois pound weighs troy grains 7004; whence the avoirdupois ounce, whereof 16 make a pound, is found equal to 437.75 troy grains. —And it follows that the troy pound is to the avoirdupois pound as 88 to 107 nearly; for as 88 to 107, so is 5760 to 7003.636: that the troy ounce is to the avoirdupois ounce, as 80 to 73 nearly; for as 80 to 73, so is 480 to 438. And, laftly, That the avoirdupois pound and ounce is to the Paris two marc weight and ounce, as 63 to 68 nearly; for as 63 to 68, so is 7004 to 7559.873. See Weight. The Paris foot exprefled in decimals, is equal to 1.0654 of the English foot, or contains 12.785 English inches. See Foot.\n\n3.] The standard in Holland, Flanders, Sweden, a good part of Germany, many of what were formerly called the Hans-towns, as Danzick and Hamburg, and at Geneva, Franckfort, &c. is likewife the ell; but the ell, in all these places, differs from the Paris ell. In Holland, it contains one Paris foot eleven lines, or four-sevenths of the Paris ell. The Flanders ell contains two feet one inch five lines and half a line; or seven-twelfths of the Paris ell. The ell of Germany, Brabant, &c. is equal to that of Flanders.\n\n4.] The Italian meafure is the branchio, brace, or fathom. This obtains in the states of Modena, Venice, Florence, Lucca, Milan, Mantua, Bologna, &c. but is of different lengths. At Venice, it contains one Paris foot eleven inches three lines, or eight fifteenths of the Paris ell. At Bologna, Modena, and Mantua, the brace is the fame as at Venice. At Lucca it contains one Paris foot nine inches ten lines, or half a Paris ell. At Florence, it contains one foot nine inches four lines, or forty-nine hundredths of a Paris ell. At Milan, the brace for measuring of silks is one Paris foot seven inches four lines, or four-ninths of a Paris ell; that for woollen cloths is the same with the ell of Holland. Laftly, at Bergama, the brace is one foot seven inches six lines, or five-ninths of a Paris ell. The ufual meafure at Naples, however, is the canna, containing fix feet ten inches and two lines, or one Paris ell and fifteen seventeenths.\n\n5.] The Spanish meafure is the vara or yard, in fome places called the barra; containing leventeen twenty-fourths of the Paris ell. But the meafure in Castile and Valencia is the pan, span, or palm; which is ufed, together with the canna, at Genoa. In Aragon, the vara is equal to a Paris ell and a half, or five feet five inches fix lines.\n\n6.] The Portuguese meafure is the cavedos, containing two feet eleven lines, or four-sevenths of a Paris ell; and the vara, an hundred and fix whereof make an hundred Paris ells.\n\n7.] The Piedmontese meafure is the ras, containing one\nMeasure one Paris foot nine inches ten lines, or half a Paris ell. In Sicily, their measure is the canna, the same with that of Naples.\n\n8.] The Maccovy measures are the cubit, equal to one Paris foot four inches two lines; and the arcin, two whereof are equal to three cubits.\n\n9.] The Turkish and Levant measures are the picq, containing two feet two inches and two lines, or three-fifths of the Paris ell. The Chinese measure, the cobre; ten whereof are equal to three Paris ells. In Persia, and some parts of the Indies, the gueze, whereof there are two kinds; the royal gueze, called also the gueze monkoffer, containing two Paris feet ten inches eleven lines, or four fifths of the Paris ell; and the shorter gueze, called simply gueze, only two thirds of the former. At Goa and Ormuz, the measure is the vara, the same with that of the Portuguese, having been introduced by them. In Pegg, and some other parts of the Indies, the cando or candi, equal to the ell of Venice. At Goa, and other parts, they use a larger cando, equal to seventeen Dutch ells; exceeding that of Babel and Balfora by \\( \\frac{7}{6} \\) per cent, and the vara by \\( \\frac{6}{5} \\). In Siam, they use the ken, short of three Paris feet by one inch. The ken contains two sok, the sok two keubs, the keub twelve niou or inches, the niou to be equal to eight grains of rice, i.e. to about nine lines. At Cambodia, they use the hafter; in Japan, the tatam; and the span on some of the coasts of Guinea.\n\n### Tables of Long Measure.\n\n#### 1.

Square, Superficial, or Land Measure.\n\n1. English square measures are raised from the yard of 36 inches multiplied into itself, and thus producing 1296 square inches in the square yard; the divisions of this are square feet and inches; and the multiples of poles, rods, and acres. Because the length of a pole is 5½ yards, the square of the same contains 30½ square yards. A square mile contains 640 square acres. In measuring fens and woodlands, 18 feet are generally allowed to the pole, and 21 feet in forest lands.\n\nA hide of land, frequently mentioned in the earlier part of the English history, contained about 100 arable acres; and 5 hides were esteemed a knight's fee. At the time of the Norman conquest, there were 243,600 hides in England.\n\n2. Scotch square or land measure is regulated by the Scotch ell: 36 square ells = 1 fall, 40 falls = 1 rood, 4 roods = 1 acre.—The proportion between the Scotch and English acre, supposing the feet in both measures alike, is as 1360 to 1089; or nearly as 5 to 4. If the difference of the feet be regarded, the proportion is as 10,000 to 7869. The length of the chain for measuring land in Scotland is 24 ells, or 74 feet.—A husband-land contains 6 acres of stock and scythe land, that is, of land that may be tilled with a plough or mown with a scythe; 13 acres of arable land make one ox-gang; and four ox-gangs make a pound-land of old extent.\n\n3. French square measures are regulated by 12 square lines in the inch square; 12 inches in the foot, 22 feet in the perch, and 100 perches in the arpent or acre.\nTABLES OF SQUARE MEASURE.\n\n1.

Grecian square measures were the plethron or acre, by some said to contain 1444, by others 10,000 square feet; and aroura, the half of the plethron. The aroura of the Egyptians was the square 100 cubits.\n\n3. Roman square measure reduced to English. The integer was the jugerum or acre, which the Romans divided like the libra or as: thus the jugerum contained\n\n| Square feet | Samples | English rods | Square feet |\n|-------------|---------|--------------|-------------|\n| As          | 288     | 2            | 18          |\n| Deunx       | 264     | 2            | 10          |\n| Dextans     | 240     | 2            | 2           |\n| Dodrans     | 216     | 1            | 34          |\n| Bes         | 192     | 1            | 25          |\n| Septunx     | 168     | 1            | 17          |\n| Semis       | 144     | 1            | 9           |\n| Quincunx    | 120     | 1            | 1           |\n| Triens      | 96      | 0            | 32          |\n| Quadrans    | 72      | 0            | 24          |\n| Sextans     | 48      | 0            | 16          |\n| Uncia       | 24      | 0            | 8           |\n\nNote. Actus major was 14,400 square feet, equal to a semis; ethra, 3600 square feet, equal to sescuncia; and actus minimus equal to a sextans.\n\nIII. CUBICAL MEASURES, OR MEASURES OF CAPACITY, FOR LIQUIDS.\n\n1. The English measures were originally raised from troy weight: it being enacted by several statutes, that eight pounds troy of wheat, gathered from the middle of the ear, and well dried, should weigh a gallon of wine measure, the divisions and multiples whereof were to form the other measures; at the same time it was also ordered, that there should be but one liquid measure in the kingdom: yet custom has prevailed; and there having been introduced a new weight, viz. the avoirdupois, we have now a second standard gallon adjusted thereto, and therefore exceeding the former in measure, the proportion of the avoirdupois weight to troy weight. From this latter standard are raised two several measures, the one for ale, the other for beer. The sealed gallon at Guildhall, which is the standard for wines, spirits, oils, &c. is supposed to contain 231 cubic inches; and on this supposition the other measures raised therefrom will contain as in the table underneath: yet, by actual experiment, made in 1688, before the lord mayor and the commissioners of excise, this gallon was found to contain only 224 cubic inches: it was, however, agreed to continue the common supposition contents of 231 cubic inches: so that all computations stand on their old footing. Hence, as 12 is to 231, so is 14½ to 281½ the cubic inches in the ale gallon: but in effect the ale quart contains 70½ cubic inches, on which principle the ale and beer gallon will be 282 cubic inches. The several divisions and multiples of these measures, and their proportions, are exhibited in the tables underneath.\n\nThe barrel for ale in London is 32 gallons, and the barrel for beer 36 gallons. In all other places of England, the barrel, both for ale and beer, is 34 gallons.\n\n2. Scotch liquid measure is founded on the pint. The Scotch pint was formerly regulated by a standard jug of calf metal, the custody of which was committed to the borough of Stirling. This jug was supposed to contain 105 cubic inches; and though, after several careful trials, it has been found to contain only about 103½ inches; yet, in compliance with established custom, founded on that opinion, the pint flours are still regulated to contain 105 inches, and the customary ale measures are about ¼ above that standard. It was enacted by James I. of Scotland, that the pint should contain 41 ounces troy weight of the clear water of Tay, and by James VI. that it should contain 55 Scots troy ounces of the clear water of Leith. This affords another method of regulating the pint, and also acquires the ancient standard of the troy weight. As the water of Tay and Leith are alike, the troy weight must have been to the Scots troy weight as 55 to 41; and therefore the pound troy must have contained about 21½ ounces Scots troy.\n\n4 gills = 1 muttonkin.\n2 muttonkins = 1 chopin.\n2 chopins = 1 pint.\n2 pints = 1 quart.\n4 quarts = 1 gallon.\n\nThe Scotch quart contains 210 inches; and is, therefore, about ¼ less than the English wine gallon, and about ¼ less than the ale gallon.\n\n3. As to the liquid measures of foreign nations, it is to be observed, that their several vessels for wine, vinegar, &c. have also various denominations according to their different sizes and the places wherein they are used. The wooders of Germany, for holding Rheinish and Moselle wines, are different in their gauges; some containing 14 aumes of Amsterdam measure, and others more or less. The aume is reckoned at Amsterdam for 8 fleckans, or 20 verges, or for ½ of a tun of 2 pipes, or 4 barrels, of French or Bordeaux, which ½ at this latter place is called tierce, because...\nbecause 3 of them make a pipe or 2 barrels, and 6 the said tun. The fleckan is fifteen mingles, or 32 pints; and the verge is, in respect of the said Rhenish and Moselle, and some other sorts of wine, 6 mingles; but, in measuring brandy it consists of 6½ mingles. The aume is divided into 4 ankers, and the ancker into 2 fleckans, or 32 mingles. The ancker is taken sometimes for ¼ of a tun, or 4 barrels; on which footing the Bourdeaux barrel ought to contain at Amsterdam (when the cask is made according to the jut gauge) 12½ fleckans, or 200 mingles, wine and less; or 12 fleckans, or 192 mingles, racked wine; so that the Bourdeaux tun of wine contains 50 fleckans, or 800 mingles, wine and lees; and 48 fleckans, or 768 mingles, of pure wine. The barrels or poinçons of Nantes and other places on the river Loire, contain only 12 fleckans, Amsterdam measure. The wine tun of Rochelle, Cognac, Charente, and the isle of Rhé, differs very little from the tun of Bourdeaux, and consequently from the barrels and pipes. A tun of wine of Chaloffe, Bayonne, and the neighbouring places, is reckoned 60 fleckans, and the barrel 15, Amsterdam measure.\n\nThe muid of Paris contains 150 quarts or 300 pints, wine and lees; or 280 pints clear wine; of which muids 3 make a tun, and the fractions are,\n\n| The muid | 36 setiers |\n|----------|-----------|\n| The fetier | 4 quarts |\n| The quart | 2 pints |\n| The pint | 2 chopins |\n| The chopin | 2 demi-setiers |\n| The demi-fetier | 2 poillons |\n\nThe muid is also composed of pipes or poinçons, quarteaux, queues, and demiqueves; those poinçons of Paris and Orleans contain about 15 fleckans Amsterdam measure, and ought to weigh with the cask 666 lb. a little more or less. In Provence they reckon by milleroles, and the millerole of Toulon contains 66 Paris pints, or 100 pints of Amsterdam nearly, and the Paris pint is nearly equal to the English wine quart (A).\n\nThe butts or pipes from Cadiz, Malaga, Alicante, Renecarlo, S. Ioe, and Mataro, and from the Canaries, from Lisbon, Oporto, and Fayal, are very different in their gauges, though in affreightments they are all reckoned two to the tun.\n\nVinegar is measured in the same manner as wine; but the measures for brandies are different: the spirits from France, Spain, Portugal, &c., are generally shipped in large casks called pipes, butts, and pieces, according to the places from whence they are imported, &c. In France, brandy is shipped in casks called pieces at Bourdeaux, and pipes at Rochelle, Cognac, the isle of Rhé, and other neighbouring places, which contain some more and some less, even from 60 to 90 Amsterdam verges or veertels, according to the capacity of the vessels, and the places they come from, which, being reduced into barrels, will stand as follows, viz.\n\nAt Rochelle, Cognac, the isle of Rhé, and the country of Aunis, 27 Veertels\nAt Nantes, and several places of Bretagne and Anjou, 29 Veertels\nAt Bourdeaux, and different parts of Guienne, 32 Verges\nAt Amsterdam, and other cities of Holland, 30 Veertels\nAt Hamburgh and Lubeck, 30 Verges\nAt Emelden, 27 Verges\n\nIn Provence and Languedoc, brandy is sold by the quintal, the casks included; and at Bruges in Flanders, the verges are called fêliers of 16 flops each, and the spirits is sold at so much per flop.\n\nOlive oil is also shipped in casks of various sizes, according to the custom of the places where it is embarked, and the conveniency of stowage. In England it is sold by the tun of 236 gallons; and at Amsterdam by the tun of 717 mingles, or 1434 pints. In Provence it is sold by milleroles of 66 Paris pints; from Spain and Portugal it is brought in pipes or butts, of different gauges; at the first place it is sold by roves, where 40 go to the butt; and at the latter place by almoudas, whereof 26 make a pipe.

Measures\nIV. Measures of Capacity for things Dry.\n\n1.] English dry or corn measure. The standard for measuring corn, salt, coals, and other dry goods, in England, is the Winchester gallon, which contains 27\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) cubic inches. The bushel contains 8 gallons, or 2178 inches. A cylindrical vessel, 18\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) inches diameter, and 8 inches deep, is appointed to be used as a bushel in levying the malt tax. A vessel of these dimensions is rather less than the Winchester bushel of 8 gallons, for it contains only 2150 inches; though probably there was no difference intended. The denominations of dry measure commonly used, are given in the first of the subjoined tables. Four quarters corn make a chaldron, 5 quarters make a wey or load, and 10 quarters make a ton. In measuring tea coal, 5 pecks make a bushel, 9 bushels make a quarter or watt, 4 quarters make a chaldron, and 21 chaldrons make a score.\n\n- 40 feet hewn timber make a load.\n- 50 feet unhewn timber make a load.\n- 32 gallons make a herring barrel.\n- 42 gallons make a salmon barrel.\n- 1 cwt. gunpowder makes a barrel.\n- 256 lbs. soap make a barrel.\n- 10 dozen candles make a barrel.\n- 12 barrels make a last.\n\n2.] Scotch dry measure. There was formerly only one measure of capacity in Scotland; and some commodities were heaped, others flanked, or measured exactly to the capacity of the standard. The method of heaping was afterwards forbidden as unequal, and a larger measure appointed for such commodities as that custom had been extended to.\n\nThe wheat firlot, used also for rye, peas, beans, salt, and grain seeds, contains 21 pints 1 muttonkin, measured by the Stirling jug. The barley firlot, used also for oats, fruit, and potatoes, contains 31 pints. A different method of regulating the firlot was appointed from the dimensions of a cylindrical vessel. The diameter for both measures was fixed at 19\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) inches, the depth 7\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) inches for the wheat firlot, and 10\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) for the barley firlot. A standard constructed by these measures is rather less than when regulated by the pint; and as it is difficult to make vessels exactly cylindrical, the regulation by the pint has prevailed, and the other method gone into disuse.\n\nIf the Stirling jug contains 103\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) inches, the wheat firlot will contain 2160 inches; which is more than 2 per cent. larger than the legal malt bushel of England, and about 1 per cent. larger than the Winchester bushel; and the barley firlot will contain 3208 inches. The barley boll is nearly equal to fix legal malt bushels.\n\nIn Stirlingshire, 17 pecks are reckoned to the boll; in Invernessshire, 18 pecks; in Ayrshire, the boll is the same as the English quarter. And the firlots, in many places, are larger than the Linlithgow standard.\n\n3.] French dry. are, the litron, bushel, minot, mine, septier, muid, and tun. The litron is divided into two demilitrons, and four quarter litrons, and contains 36 cubic inches of Paris. By ordonnance, the litron is to be three inches and a half high, and three inches 10 lines broad. The litron for salt is larger, and is divided into two halves, four quarters, eight demi-quartiers, and 16 muidettes. The French bushel is different in different jurisdictions. At Paris it is divided into demi-bushels; each demi-bushel into two quarts; the quart into two half quarts; and the half quart into two litrons; so that the bushel contains 16 litrons. By ordonnance the Paris bushel is to be eight inches two lines and a half high, and ten inches broad, or in diameter within-side. The minot consists of three bushels, the mine of two minots or five bushels, the septier of two mines or 12 bushels, and the muid of 12 septiers or 144 bushels. The bushel of oats is estimated double that of any other grain; so that there go 24 bushels to make the septier, and 288 to make the muid. It is divided into four picotins, the picotin containing two quarts, or four litrons. The bushel for salt is divided into two half bushels, four quarters, eight half quarters, and 16 litrons; four bushels make a minot, 16 a septier, and 192 a muid. The bushel for wood is divided into halves, quarters, and half quarters. Eight bushels make the minot, 16 a mine; 20 mines or 320 bushels, the muid. For plaster, 12 bushels make a sack, and 36 sacks a muid. For lime, three bushels make a minot, and 48 minots a muid. The minot is by ordonnance to be 11 inches 9 lines high, and 14 inches 8 lines in diameter. The minot is composed of three bushels, or 16 litrons; four minots make a septier, and 48 a muid. The French mine is no real vessel, but an estimation of several others. At Paris the mine contains six bushels, and 24 make the muid; at Rouen the mine is four bushels; and at Dieppe 18 mines make a Paris muid. The septier differs in different places: at Paris it contains two mines, or eight bushels, and 12 septiers the muid. At Rouen the septier contains two mines or 12 bushels. Twelve septiers make a muid at Rouen as well as at Paris; but 12 of the latter are equal to 14 of the former. At Toulon the septier contains a mine and a half; three of which mines make the septier of Paris. The muid or mui of Paris consists of 12 septiers; and is divided into mines, minots, bushels, &c. That for oats is double that for other grain, i.e. contains twice the number of bushels. At Orleans the muid is divided into mines, but those mines only contain two Paris septiers and a half. In some places they use the tun in lieu of the muid; particularly at Nantes, where it contains 10 septiers of 16 bushels each, and weighs between 2200 and 2250 pounds. Three of these tuns make 28 Paris septiers. At Rochelle, &c., the tun contains 42 bushels, and weighs two per cent. less than that of Nantes. At Brest it contains 20 bushels, is equal to 10 Paris septiers, and weighs about 2243 pounds. See Tun.\n\n4.] Dutch, Swedish, Polish, Prussian, and Muscovite. In these places, they estimate their dry things on the foot of the last, last, leeb, or leech; so called according to the various pronunciations of the people who use it. In Holland, the last is equal to 19 Paris septiers, or 38 Bordeaux bushels, and weighs about 4560 pounds; the last they divide into 27 mudes, and the mude into four scheppes. In Poland, the last is 40 Bordeaux bushels, and weighs about 4800 Paris pounds. In Prussia, the last is 133 Paris septiers. In Sweden and Muscovy they measure by the great and little last; the first containing 12 barrels, and the second half as many. See Last.\nMeasure. LAST. In Muscovy, they likewise use the chefford, which is different in various places: that of Archangel is equal to three Rouen bushels.\n\n5.] Italian. At Venice, Leghorn, and Lucca, they estimate their dry things on the foot of the staro or itaio; the staro of Leghorn weighs 54 pounds: 112 staros and seven-eighths are equal to the Amsterdam laft. At Lucca, 119 staros make the laft of Amsterdam. The Venetian staro weighs 128 Paris pounds: the staro is divided into four quarters. Thirty-five staros and one-fifth, or 140 quarters and four-fifths, make the laft of Amsterdam. At Naples and other parts, they use the tomolo or tomalo, equal to one-third of the Paris septier. Thirty-six tomoli and a half make the carro, and a carro and a half, or 54 tomoli, make the laft of Amsterdam. At Palermo, 16 tomoli make the salma, and four mondili the tomolo. Ten salmas and three-sevenths, or 171 tomoli and three sevenths, make the laft of Amsterdam.\n\n6.] Flemish. At Antwerp, &c. they measure by the viertel; 32 and one-half whereof make 19 Paris septiers. At Hamburgh, the schepel; 90 whereof make 19 Paris septiers.\n\n7.] Spanish and Portuguese. At Cadiz, Bilboa, and St Sebastian, they use the fanega; 23 whereof make the Nantes or Rochelle tun, or nine Paris septiers and a half: though the Bilboa fanega is somewhat larger, infomuch that 21 fanegas make a Nantes tun. At Seville, &c. they use the anagoras, containing a little more than the Paris mine; 36 anagoras make 19 Paris septiers. At Bayonne, &c. the concha; 30 whereof are equal to nine Paris septiers and a half. At Lisbon, the alquier, a very small measure, 240 whereof make 19 Paris septiers, 60 the Lisbon muid.\n\nTABLES of Dry Measure.\n\n1.

In describing the parts of plants, Tournefort introduced a geometrical scale, which many of his followers have retained. They measured every part of the plant; and the essence of the description consisted in an accurate mensuration of the whole.\n\nAs the parts of plants, however, are liable to variation in no circumstance so much as that of dimension, Linnaeus very rarely admits any other mensuration than that arising from the respective length and breadth of the parts compared together. In cases that require actual mensuration, the same author recommends, in lieu of Tournefort's artificial scale, the following natural scale of the human body, which he thinks is much more convenient, and equally accurate.\n\nThe scale in question consists of 11 degrees, which are as follow: 1. A hair's breadth, or the diameter of a hair, (capillus). 2. A line, (linea), the breadth of the crescent or white appearance at the root of the finger (not thumb), measured from the skin towards the body of the nail; a line is equal to 12 hair-breadths, and is the 12th part of a Parisian inch. 3. A nail (unguis), the length of a finger nail; equal to six lines, or half a Parisian inch. 4. A thumb (pollex), the length of the first or outermost joint of the thumb; equal to a Parisian inch. 5. A palm (palma), the breadth of the palm exclusive of the thumb; equal to three Parisian inches. 6. A span (spitamma) the distance between the extremity of the thumb and that of the first finger when extended; equal to seven Parisian inches. 7. A great span (dodrana), the distance between the extremity of the thumb and that of the little finger, when extended; equal to nine inches. 8. A foot (pes), measuring from the elbow to the base of the thumb; equal to 12 Parisian inches. 9. A cubit (cubitus), from the elbow to the extremity of the middle finger; equal to 17 inches. 10. An arm length (brachium), from the armpit to the extremity of the middle finger; equal to 24 Parisian inches, or two feet. 11. A fathom (orgua), the measure of the human stature; the distance between the extremities of the two middle fingers, when the arms are extended; equal, where greatest, to five feet.\n\nMeasure is also used to signify the cadence and time observed in poetry, dancing, and music, to render them regular and agreeable.\n\nThe different measures or metres in poetry, are the different.\nMeasure. different manners of ordering and combining the quantities, or the long and short syllables. Thus, hexameter, pentameter, iambic, sapphic verses, &c. consist of different measures.\n\nIn English verses, the measures are extremely various and arbitrary, every poet being at liberty to introduce any new form that he pleases. The most usual are the heroic, generally consisting of five long and five short syllables; and verses of four feet; and of three feet and a cæsura, or single syllable.\n\nThe ancients, by variously combining and transposing their quantities, made a vast variety of different measures. Of words, or rather feet of two syllables, they formed a spondee, consisting of two long syllables; a pyrrhic, of two short syllables; a trochee, of a long and a short syllable; and an iambic, of a short and a long syllable.\n\nOf their feet of three syllables they formed a molossus, consisting of three long syllables; a tribrach, of three short syllables; a dactyl, of one long and two short syllables; and an anapest, of two short and one long syllable. The Greek poets contrived 124 different combinations or measures, under as many different names, from feet of two syllables to those of six.\n\nMeasure, in Music, the interval or space of time which the person who beats time takes between the rising and falling of his hand or foot, in order to conduct the movement, sometimes quicker, and sometimes slower, according to the kind of music, or the subject that is sung or played.\n\nThe measure is that which regulates the time we are to dwell on each note. See Time.\n\nThe ordinary or common measure is one second, or 60th part of a minute, which is nearly the space between the beats of the pulse or heart; the syttole, or contraction of the heart, answering to the elevation of the hand; and its diafhole, or dilatation, to the letting it fall. The measure usually takes up the space that a pendulum of two feet and a half long employs in making a swing or vibration. The measure is regulated according to the different quality or value of the notes in the piece; by which the time that each note is to take up is expressed. The semibreve, for instance, holds one rise and one fall; and this is called the measure or whole measure, sometimes the measure note, or time note; the minim, one rise, or one fall; and the crotchet, half a rise, or half a fall, there being four crotchets in a full measure.\n\nMeasure Binary, or Double, is that wherein the rise and fall of the hand are equal.\n\nMeasure Ternary, or Triple, is that wherein the fall is double to the rise; or where two minims are played during a fall, and but one in the rise. To this purpose, the number 3 is placed at the beginning of the lines, when the measure is intended to be triple; and a C, when the measure is to be common or double. This rising and falling of the hands was called by the Greeks ἀγρίς and ἑταῖρος. St Augustine calls it plausus, and the Spaniards compas. See ARSIS and THESIS.\n\nPowder Measures in Artillery, are made of copper, and contain from an ounce to 12 pounds; these are very convenient in a siege, when guns or mortars are loaded with loose powder, especially in ricochet firing, Measuring, &c.\n\nMEASURING, or MENSURATION, is the using a certain known measure, and determining thereby the precise extent, quantity, or capacity of any thing.\n\nMeasuring, in general, includes the practical part of geometry. From the various subjects on which it is employed, it acquires various names, and constitutes various arts. See GEOMETRY, LEVELLING, MENSURATION, TRIGONOMETRY, &c.\n\nMEAT. See FOOD, DIET, DRINK, &c.\n\nAmongst the Jews, several kinds of animals were forbidden to be used as food. The flesh with the blood, and the blood without the flesh, were prohibited; the fat also of sacrificed animals was not to be eaten. Roast meat, boiled meat, and ragouts, were in use among the Hebrews, but we meet with no kind of seasoning except salt, bitter herbs, and honey.—They never mingled milk in any ragout or hash, and never ate at the same meal both meat and milk, butter, or cheese. The daily provision for Solomon's table was 30 measures of fine wheat flour, 60 of common flour, 10 fat oxen, 20 pasture oxen, 100 sheep, besides venison and wildfowl. See LUXURY.\n\nThe principal and most necessary food among the ancient Greeks, was bread, which they called αἰγές, and produced in a wicker basket called κύκλων. Their loaves were sometimes baked under the ashes, and sometimes in an oven. They also used a sort of bread called maza. Barley meal was used amongst the Greeks, which they called αἴρεις. They had a frequent dish called ἀγρίς, which was a composition of rice, cheese, eggs, and honey, wrapped in fig-leaves. The μυρτάδα was made of cheese, garlic, and eggs, beaten and mixed together. Their bread, and other substitutes for bread, were baked in the form of hollow plates, into which they poured a sauce. Garlic, onions, and figs, seem to have been a very common food amongst the poorer Athenians. The Greeks, especially in the heroic times, ate flesh roasted; boiled meat seldom was used. Fish seems not to have been used for food in the early ages of Greece. The young people only, amongst the Lacedemonians, ate animal food; the men and the old men were supported by a black soup called πρώτης ξυλαίας, which to people of other nations was always a disagreeable mess. Grasshoppers and the extremities or tender shoots of trees were frequently eaten by the poor among the Greeks. Eels dressed with beet root were esteemed a delicate dish, and they were fond of the jowl and belly of salt-fish. Neither were they without their sweet-meats; the dessert consisted frequently of fruits, almonds, nuts, figs, peaches, &c. In every kind of food we find salt to have been used.\n\nThe diet of the first Romans consisted wholly of milk, herbs, and roots, which they cultivated and dressed with their own hands; they also had a kind of gruel, or coarse groats pan, composed of meal and boiling water; this served for bread: And when they began to use bread, they had none for a great while but of unmixed rye. Barley-meal was eaten by them, which they called Polenta. When they began to eat animal food, it was esteemed a piece of luxury, and an indulgence not to be justified but by some particu-\nMEATH\n\nAfter animal food had grown into common use, the meat which they most frequently produced upon their tables was pork.\n\nMethod of Preserving Flesh-Meat without spices, and with very little salt. Jones, in his Miscellanea Curiosa, gives us the following description of the Moorish Elcholle, which is made of beef, mutton, or camel's flesh, but chiefly beef, which is cut in long slices, and laid for 24 hours in a pickle. They then remove it out of those jars or tubs into others with water; and when it has lain a night, they take it out, and put it on ropes in the sun and air to dry. When it is thoroughly dried and hard, they cut it into pieces of two or three inches long, and throw it into a pan or caldron, which is ready with boiling oil and fuel sufficient to hold it, where it boils till it be very clear and red when cut. After this they take it out, and set it to drain; and when all is thus done it stands to cool, and jars are prepared to put it up in, pouring upon it the liquor in which it was fried; and as soon as it is thoroughly cold, they stop it up close. It will keep two years; will be hard, and the hardest they look upon to be the best done. This they dish up cold, sometimes fried with eggs and garlic, sometimes stewed, and lemon squeezed on it. It is very good any way, either hot or cold.\n\nMEATH, commonly so called, or otherwise Eaft Meath, to distinguish it from the county called Wef Meath: A county of Ireland, in the province of Leinster, bounded by the counties of Cavan and Louth on the north, the Irish channel on the east, Kildare and Dublin on the south, and Wef Meath and Longford on the west. It is a fine campaign country, abounding with corn, and well inhabited. It returns 14 members to parliament; and gives title of earl to the family of Brabazon. It contains 326,480 Irish plantation acres, 139 parishes, 12 baronies, and five boroughs; chief town, Trim. This district being the most ancient settlement of the Belgians in Ireland, the inhabitants were esteemed the eldest and most honourable tribe: from which seniority their chieftains were elected monarchs of all the Belgae; a dignity that was continued in the Hy-n-Failian without intermission, until the arrival of the Caledonian colonies, under the name of Tuath de Danan, when Conor-Mor, chieftain of these people, obtained, or rather usurped, the monarchial throne, obliged Eochy Failloch, with several of his people, to cross the Shannon, and establish themselves in the present county of Roscommon, where Crothar founded the palace of Atha or Croghan, a circumstance which brought on a long and bloody war between the Belgian and Caledonian races, which was not finally terminated until the close of the 4th century, when the Belgian line was restored in the person of O'Nial the Great, and continued until Brian Boromh usurped the monarchial dignity, by deposing Malachy O'Malachlin, about the year 1001. Tuathal Teththomar, by a decree of the Tarah assembly, separated certain large tracts of land from each of the four provinces, where the borders joined together; whence under the notion of adopting this spot for demesne lands to support the royal household, he formed the county or kingdom of Meath, which afterwards became the peculiar inheritance of the monarchs of Ireland. In each of the portions thus separated from the four provinces, Tuathal caused palaces to be erected, which might adorn them, and commemorate the name in which they had been added to the royal domain. In the tract taken out of Munster, he built the palace called Fictctaga, where the sacred fire, so called, was kindled, and where all the priests and druids annually met on the last day of October; on the evening of which day it was enacted, that no other fire should be used throughout the kingdom, in order that all the fires might be derived from this, which being lighted up as a fire of sacrifice, their superstition led them to believe would render all the rest propitious and holy; and for this privilege every family was to pay threepence, by way of acknowledgment to the king of Munster. The second royal palace was erected in the proportion taken out of Connaught, and was built for the assembly called the convocation of Vifneach, at which all the inhabitants were summoned to appear on the 1st day of May, to offer sacrifice to Beal, or Bel, the god of fire, in whose honour two large fires being kindled, the natives used to drive their cattle between them, which was supposed to be a preservative for them against accidents and distempers, and this was called Beal-Tinne, or Bel-Tine, or the festival of the god of fire. The king of Connaught at this meeting claimed a horse and arms from every lord of a manor or chieftain, as an acknowledgement for the lands taken from that province, to add to the territory of Meath. The third was that which Tailtean erected in the part taken from Ulster, where the fair of that name was held, which was remarkable for this particular circumstance, that the inhabitants brought their children thither, males and females, and contracted them in marriage, where the parents having agreed upon articles, the young people were joined accordingly; every couple contracted at this meeting paid the king of Ulster an ounce of silver by way of acknowledgement. The royal mansion of Tarah, formerly destroyed by fire, being rebuilt by Tuathal, on the lands originally belonging to the king of Leinster, was reckoned as the fourth of these palaces; but as a fabric of that name had stood there before, we do not find that any acknowledgement was made for it to the king of Leinster.\n\nMeath, with Clonmacnois, is a bishop's see, valued in the king's books at £73 l. 7s. 0½d. sterling, by an extent returned anno 28th Elizabeth; but, by a former extent taken anno 30th Henry VIII., the valuation amounts to £73 l. 12s. which being the largest and most profitable for the king, is the measure of the first fruits at this day. This see is reputed to be worth annually £400. There were formerly many Episcopal fees in Meath, as Clonard, Duleek, Kells, Trim, Ardbraccan, Donaghclon, Slaine, and Four, besides others of less note; all these, except Duleek and Kells, were consolidated, and their common fee was fixed at Clonard, before the year 1152; at which time the divisions of the bishoprics in Ireland were made by John Paparo, cardinal priest, entitled Cardinal of St Lawrence in Damask, then legate from Pope Eugene III. to the Irish. This division was made in a synod held on the 6th of March in the abbey of Melifont, or, as some say, at Kells; and the two fees of Duleek and Kells afterwards submitted to the same fate. The constitution of this diocese is singular, hav-\nMEATH\n\ning no dean nor chapter, cathedral, or economy.—Under the bishop, the archdeacon is the head officer, to whom, and to the clergy in general, the congé d'élire is issued while bishops were elective. The affairs of the diocese are transacted by a synod, in the nature of a chapter, who have a common seal, which is annually lodged in the hands of one of the body, by the appointment and vote of the majority. The diocese is divided into twelve rural deaneries.\n\nOf Clonmacnois, now annexed to Meath: There is no valuation of this fee in the king's books; but it is supposed to be included in the extent of the see of Meath, taken anno 30th Henry VIII. The chapter of this fee consisted anciently of dean, chanter, chancellor, treasurer, archdeacon, and twelve prebendaries, but most of their possessions have fallen into lay hands. At present the deanery is the only part of the chapter which subsists, to which the prebend of Cloghran is annexed, and he hath a seat of office, which appears to have been the ancient episcopal seat of this fee. This fee was founded by St Kieran, or Ciaran, the younger, in 548 or 549; and Dermot, the son of Ceremon, king of Ireland, granted the site on which the church was built.\n\nWest Meath.

See ANATOMY, No 144.\n\nMEAUX, an ancient town of France, in the department of the Seine and Marne, with a bishop's see, seated in a place abounding in corn and cattle, on the river Marne, which divides it into two parts; and its trade consists in corn, wool, and cheese. It sustained a siege of three months against the English in 1421.\n\nE. Long. 2. 58. N. Lat. 48. 58.\n\nMECAENAS, or MECOENAS, C CILNIUS, a celebrated Roman knight, descended from the kings of Etruria. He has rendered himself immortal by his liberal patronage of learned men and of letters; and to his prudence and advice Augustus acknowledged himself indebted for the security he enjoyed. His fondness for pleasure removed him from the reach of ambition; and he preferred dying, as he was born, a Roman knight, to all the honours and dignities which either the friendship of Augustus or his own popularity could heap upon him. To the interference of Mecenas, Virgil owed the retribution of his lands; and Horace was proud to boast that his learned friend had obtained his forgiveness from the emperor, for joining the cause of Brutus at the battle of Philippi. Mecenas was himself fond of literature: and, according to the most received opinion, he wrote a history of animals, a journal of the life of Augustus, a treatise on the different natures and kinds of precious stones, besides the two tragedies of Orestes and Prometheus, and other things, all now lost. He died eight years before Christ; and on his deathbed he particularly recommended his poetical friend Horace to the care and confidence of Augustus. Seneca, who has liberally commended the genius and abilities of Mecenas, has not withheld his censure from his dissipation, indolence, and effeminate luxury. From the patronage and encouragement which the princes of heroic and lyric poetry among the Latins received from the favourite of Augustus, all patrons of literature have ever since been called Mecenates. Virgil dedicated to him his Georgics, and Horace his Odes.\n\nMECCA, an ancient and very famous town of Asia, Mecca, in Arabia Felix; seated on a barren spot, in a valley surrounded with little hills, about a day's journey from the Red sea. It is a place of no strength, having neither walls nor gates; and the buildings are very mean. That which supports it is the resort of a great many thousand pilgrims annually, for the shops are scarcely open all the year besides. The inhabitants are poor, very thin, lean, and warty. The hills about the town are very numerous; and consist of a blackish rock, some of them half a mile in circumference. On the top of one of them is a cave, where they pretend Mahomet usually retired to perform his devotions, and hither they affirm the greatest part of the Alcoran was brought him by the angel Gabriel. The town has plenty of water, and yet little garden-fruit; but there are several sorts of good fruits to be had, such as grapes, melons, water melons, and cucumbers. There are also plenty of sheep brought thither to the fold to the pilgrims. It stands in a very hot climate; and the inhabitants usually sleep on the tops of their houses for the sake of coolness. In order to protect themselves from the heat through the day, they carefully shut the windows, and water the streets to refresh the air. There have been instances of persons suffocated in the middle of the town by the burning wind called Simoom.\n\nAs a great number of the people of distinction in the province of Hedsjas stay in the city, it is better built than any other in Arabia. Amongst the beautiful edifices it contains, the most remarkable is the famous Kaba or Caaba, \"The house of God,\" which was held in great veneration by the Arabs even before Mahomet's time.\n\nNo Christian dare go to Mecca; not that the approach to it is prohibited by any express law, or that the sensible part of the Mahometans have anything to object to it; but on account of the prejudices of the people, who regarding this ground as sacred, think Christians unworthy of setting their foot on it; it would be profaned, in the opinion of the superstitious, if it was trod upon by infidels. The people even believe, that Christians are prevented from approaching by some supernatural power; and they tell the story of an infidel, who having got so far as the hills that surround Mecca, all the dogs of the city came out, and fell upon him; and who, being struck with this miracle, and the august appearance of the Kaba, immediately became a Mahometan. It is therefore to be presumed that all the Europeans who describe Mecca as eye-witnesses, have been renegades escaped from Turkey. A recent example confirms this supposition. On the promise of being allowed to preserve his religion, a French surgeon was prevailed on to accompany the Emir Hadji to Mecca, in quality of physician; but at the very first station, he was forced to submit to circumcision, and then he was permitted to continue his journey.\n\nAlthough the Mahometans do not allow Europeans to go to Mecca, they do not refuse to give them descriptions of the Kaba, and information with regard to that building; and there are persons who gain their bread by making designs and little pictures of the Kaba, and selling them to pilgrims. See CAABA.\n\nThe Mahometans have so high an opinion of the sanctity...\nsanctity of Mecca, that they extend it to the places in the neighbourhood. The territory of that city is held sacred to certain distances, which are indicated by particular marks. Every caravan finds in its road a familiar mark, which gives notice to the pilgrims when they are to put on the modest garb in which they must appear in those sacred regions. Every Muslim is obliged to go once in his life, at least, to Mecca, to perform his devotions there. If that law was rigorously enforced, the concourse of pilgrims would be prodigious, and the city would never be able to contain the multitudes from all the countries where the Mahometan religion prevails. We must therefore, suppose, that devotees alone perform this duty, and that the others can easily dispense with it. Those whose circumstances do not permit a long absence, have the liberty of going to Mecca by a substitute.\n\nA hired pilgrim, however, cannot go for more than one person at a time; and he must, to prevent frauds, bring an attestation in proper form, from an Imam of Mecca, that he has performed the requisite devotions on behalf of such a person, either alive or dead; for, after the decease of a person who has not obeyed the law during his life, he is still obliged to perform the journey by proxy.\n\nThe caravans, which are not numerous, when we consider the immense multitude of the faithful, are composed of many people who do not make the journey from purposes of devotion. These are merchants, who think they can transport their merchandises with more safety, and dispose of them more easily; and contractors of every kind, who furnish the pilgrims and the soldiers who escort the caravans, with necessaries. Thus it happens, that many people have gone often to Mecca, solely from views of interest. The most considerable of those caravans is that of Syria, commanded by the pasha of Damascus. It joins at some distance the second from Egypt, which is conducted by a bey, who takes the title of Emir Hadsji. One comes from Yemen, and another, less numerous, from the country of Lachia. Some scattered pilgrims arrived by the Red Sea from the Indies, and from the Arabian establishments on the coasts of Africa. The Persians come in that which departs from Bagdad; the place of conductor to this last is bestowed by the pasha, and is very lucrative, for he receives the ransoms of the heretical Persians.\n\nIt is of consequence to a pilgrim to arrive early at the holy places. Without having been present from the beginning at all the ceremonies, and without having performed every particular act of devotion, a man cannot acquire the title of Hadsji: this is an honour very much coveted by the Turks, for it confers real advantages, and makes those who attain it be much respected. Its infrequency, however, in the Mahometan dominions, shows how much the observation of the law commanding pilgrimages is neglected. A similar custom prevails among the Oriental Christians, who are also exceedingly emulous of the title of Hadsji, or Mokdafi, which is given to pilgrims of their communion. In order to acquire this title, it is not sufficient that the person has made the journey to Jerusalem; he must also have kept the pallower in that city, and have assisted at all the ceremonies of the holy weeks.\n\nAfter all the essential ceremonies are over, the pilgrims next morning move to a place where they lay Abraham went to offer up his son Isaac, which is about two or three miles from Mecca: here they pitch their tents, and then throw seven small stones against a little square stone building. This, as they affirm, is performed in defiance of the devil. Every one then purchases a sheep, which is brought for that purpose, eating some of it themselves, and giving the rest to the poor people who attend upon that occasion. Indeed these are miserable objects, and such starved creatures, that they seem ready to devour each other. After all, one would imagine that this was a very sanctified place; and yet a renegade who went in pilgrimage thither, affirms there is as much debauchery practised here as in any part of the Turkish dominions. It is 25 miles from Jodda, the sea port town of Mecca, and 220 south-east of Medina. E. Long. 40° 55'. N.

See the articles Power, Cause, &c.\n\nThe mechanical philosophy is the same with what is otherwise called corporeal philosophy, which explains the phenomena of nature, and the operations of corporeal things, on the principles of mechanics, viz.; the motion, gravity, arrangement, disposition, greatness or smallness, of the parts which compose natural bodies. See Corporeal.\n\nThis manner of reasoning is much used in medicine; and, according to Dr Quincy, is the result of a thorough acquaintance with the structure of animal bodies: for considering an animal body as a composition out of the same matter from which all other bodies are formed, and to have all those properties which concern a physician's regard, only by virtue of its peculiar construction; it naturally leads a person to consider the several parts, according to their figures, contexture, and use, either as wheels, pulleys, wedges, levers, screws, cords, canals, strainers &c. For which purpose, continues he, it is frequently found helpful to design in diagrams, whatsoever of that kind is under consideration, as is customary in geometrical demonstrations.\n\nFor the application of this doctrine to the human body, see the article Medicine.\n\nMechanical, in mathematics, denotes a construction of some problem, by the assistance of instruments, as the duplication of the cube and quadrature of the circle, in contradiction to that which is done in an accurate and geometrical manner.\n\nMechanical Curve, is a curve, according to Descartes, which cannot be defined by any algebraic equation; and so stands contradistinguished from algebraic or geometrical curves.\n\nLeibnitz and others call these mechanical curves transcendental, and differ from Descartes, in excluding them out of geometry. Leibnitz found a new kind of transcendental equations, whereby these curves are defined: but they do not continue constantly the same in all points of the curve, as algebraic ones do. See the article Transcendental.\n\nMechanical Solution of a problem is either when the thing is done by repeated trials, or when lines used in\nMechanical Powers, are certain simple machines, which are used for raising greater weights, or overcoming greater resistances, than could be effected by the natural strength without them. See Mechanics.\n\nMECHANICS.\n\nDefinition. 1. Mechanics is the science which enquires into the laws of the equilibrium and motion of solid bodies; into the forces by which bodies, whether animate or inanimate, may be made to act upon one another; and into the means by which these may be increased so as to overcome such as are more powerful.—The term mechanics was originally applied to the doctrine of equilibrium. It has by some late writers been extended to the motion and equilibrium of all bodies, whether solid, fluid, or aeriform; and has been employed to comprehend the sciences of hydrodynamics and pneumatics.\n\nHISTORY.\n\n2. As the science of mechanics is intimately connected with the arts of life, and particularly with those which exist even in the rudest ages of society, the construction of machines must have arrived at considerable perfection before the theory of equilibrium, or the simplest properties of the mechanical powers, had engaged the attention of philosophers. We accordingly find that the lever, the pulley, the crane, the capstan, and other simple machines, were employed by the ancient architects in elevating the materials of their buildings, long before the dawn of mechanical science; and the military engines of the Greeks and Romans, such as the catapultae and ballista, exhibit an extensive acquaintance with the construction of compound machinery. In the splendid remains of Egyptian architecture, which in every age have excited the admiration of the world, we perceive the most surprising marks of mechanical genius. The elevation of immense masses of stone to the tops of their stupendous fabrics must have required an accumulation of mechanical power which is not in the possession of modern architects.\n\n3. The earliest traces of anything like the theory of mechanics are to be found in the writings of Aristotle. In some of his works we discover a few erroneous and obscure opinions, respecting the doctrine of motion, and the nature of equilibrium; and in his 28th mechanical question he has given some vague observations on the force of impulse, tending to point out the difference between impulse and pressure. He maintained that there cannot be two circular motions opposite to one another; that heavy bodies descend to the centre of the universe, and that the velocities of their descent were proportional to their weights.\n\n4. The notions of Aristotle, however, were so confused and erroneous, that the honour of laying the foundation of theoretical mechanics is exclusively due to the celebrated Archimedes, who, in addition to his inventions in geometry, discovered the general principles of hydrostatics. In his two books, De Equiponderantibus, he has demonstrated that when a balance with unequal arms, is in equilibrium, by means of two weights in its opposite scales, these weights must be reciprocally proportional to the arms of the balance. From this general principle, all the other properties of the lever, and of machines referable to the lever, might have been deduced as corollaries; but Archimedes did not follow the discovery through all its consequences. In demonstrating the leading property of the lever, he lays it down as an axiom, that if the two arms of the balance are equal, the two weights must also be equal when an equilibrium takes place; and then shows that if one of the arms be increased, and the equilibrium still continue, the weight appended to that arm must be proportionally diminished. This important discovery conducted the Syracusan philosopher to another equally useful in mechanics. Reflecting on the construction of his balance, which moved upon a fulcrum, he perceived that the two weights exerted the same pressure on the fulcrum as if they had both rested upon it. He then considered the sum of these two weights as combined with a third, and the sum of these three as combined with a fourth; and saw that in every such combination the fulcrum must support their united weight, and therefore that there is in every combination of bodies, and in every single body which may be conceived as made up of a number of lesser bodies, a centre of pressure or gravity. This discovery Archimedes applied to particular cases, and pointed out the method of finding the centre of gravity of plane surfaces, whether bounded by a parallelogram, a triangle, a trapezium or a parabola. The theory of the inclined plane, the pulley, the axis in peritrochio, the screw, and the wedge, which was first published in the eighth book of Pappus's mathematical collections, is generally attributed to Archimedes. It appears also from Plutarch and other ancient authors, that a greater number of machines which have not reached our times was invented by this philosopher. The military engines which he employed in the siege of Syracuse against those of the Roman engineer Apollonius, are said to have displayed the greatest mechanical genius, and to have retarded the capture of his native city.\n\n5. Among the various inventions which we have received from antiquity, that of water mills is entitled to the highest place, whether we consider the ingenuity mills and which they display, or the useful purposes to which they are subservient. In the infancy of the Roman republic the corn was ground by hand-mills consisting of two millstones, one of which was moveable, and the other at rest. The upper millstone was made to revolve either by the hand applied directly to a winch, or by means of a rope winding round a capstan. The precise time when the impulse or the weight of water was substituted in the place of animal labour, is not exactly known. From an epigram in the Anthologia Graeca there is reason to believe that water mills were invented during the reign of Augustus; but it is strange that in the\nthe description given of them by Vitruvius, who lived under that emperor, they are not mentioned as of recent origin. The invention of wind mills is of a later date. According to some authors, they were first used in France in the fifth century; while others maintain that they were brought to Europe in the time of the crusades, and that they had long been employed in the east, where the scarcity of water precluded the application of that agent to machinery.\n\n6. The science of mechanics seems to have been stationary till the end of the 16th century. In 1577 a treatise on mechanics was published by Guidus Ubaldis, but it contained merely the discoveries of Archimedes. Simon Stevinus, however, a Dutch mathematician, contributed greatly to the progress of the science. He discovered the parallelogram of forces; and has demonstrated in his Statics, published in 1586, that if a body is urged by two forces in the direction of the sides of a parallelogram, and proportional to these sides, the combined action of these two forces is equivalent to a third force acting in the direction of the diagonal of the parallelogram, and having its intensity proportional to that diagonal. This important discovery, which has been of such service in the different departments of physics, should have conferred upon its author a greater degree of celebrity than he has actually enjoyed. His name has scarcely been enrolled in the temple of fame, but justice may yet be done to the memory of such an ingenious man. He had likewise the merit of illustrating other parts of statics; and he appears to have been the first who, without the aid of the properties of the lever, discovered the laws of equilibrium in bodies placed on an inclined plane. His works were reprinted in the Dutch language in 1605. They were translated into Latin in 1608, and into French in 1634; and in these editions of his works his Statics were enlarged by an appendix, in which he treats of the rope machine, and on pulleys acting obliquely.\n\n7. The doctrine of the centre of gravity, which had been applied by Archimedes only to plane surfaces, was now extended by Lucas Valerius to solid bodies. In his work entitled De Centro Gravitatis Solidorum Liber, published at Bologna in 1661, he has discussed this subject with such ability, as to receive from Galileo the honourable appellation of the Novus nostrae Arithmetices.\n\n8. In the hands of Galileo the science of mechanics took a new form. In 1572 he wrote a small treatise on statics, which he reduced to this principle, that it requires an equal power to raise two different bodies to altitudes in the inverse ratio of their weights, or that the same power is requisite to raise 10 pounds to the height of 100 feet, and 20 pounds to the height of 50 feet. This fertile principle was not pursued by Galileo to its different consequences. It was left to Descartes to apply it to the determination of the equilibrium of machines, which he did in his explanation of machines and engines, without acknowledging his obligations to the Tuscan philosopher. In addition to this new principle, Galileo enriched mechanics with his theory of local motion. This great discovery has immortalized its author; and whether we consider its intrinsic value, or the change which it produced on the physical sciences, we are led to regard it as nearly of equally importance with the theory of universal gravitation, to which it paved the way. The first hints of this new theory were given in his Systema Cosmicum, Dialogus II. The subject was afterwards fully discussed in another, entitled Diversus et Demonstrations Mathematicae circa duas novas Scientias pertinentes ad Mechanicam et Motum Localem, and published in 1638. This work is divided into four dialogues; the first of which treats of the resistance of solid bodies before they are broken: the second points out the cause of the cohesion of solids. In the third he discusses his theory of local motions, comprehending those which are equable, and those which are uniformly accelerated. In the fourth he treats of violent motion, or the motion of projectiles; and in an appendix to the work he demonstrates several propositions relative to the centre of gravity of solid bodies. In the first of these dialogues he has founded his reasoning on principles which are far from being correct, but he has been more successful in the other three. In the third dialogue, which contains his celebrated theory, he discusses the doctrine of equable motions in five theorems, containing the different relations between the velocity of the moving body, the space which it describes, and the time employed in its description. In the second part of the dialogue, which treats of accelerated motion, he considers all bodies as heavy, and composed of a number of parts which are also heavy. Hence he concludes that the total weight of the body is proportional to the number of the material particles of which it is composed, and then reasons in the following manner. As the weight of a body is a power always the same in quantity, and as it constantly acts without interruption, the body must be continually receiving from it equal impulses in equal and successive instants of time. When the body is prevented from falling by being placed on a table, its weight is incessantly impelling it downwards, but these impulses are incessantly destroyed by the resistance of the table which prevents it from yielding to them. But where the body falls freely, the impulses which it perpetually receives are perpetually accumulating, and remain in the body unchanged in every respect excepting the diminution which they experience from the resistance of air. It therefore follows, that a body falling freely is uniformly accelerated, or receives equal increments of velocity in equal times. Having established this as a definition, he then demonstrates, that the time in which any space is described by a motion uniformly accelerated from rest, is equal to the time in which the same space would be described by an uniform equable motion with half the final velocity of the accelerated motion; and that in every motion uniformly accelerated from rest, the spaces described are in the duplicate ratio of the times of description. After having proved these theorems, he applies the doctrine with great success to the ascent and descent of bodies on inclined planes.\n\n9. The theory of Galileo was embraced by his pupil Torricelli, who illustrated and extended it in his excellent work entitled De motu gravius naturaliter accelerato, published in 1644. In his treatise De motu projectorum, published in the Florentine edition of his works, in 1664, he has added several new and important propositions to those which were given by his master on the motion of projectiles.\n\n10. It was about this time that steam began to be the steam employed engine.\nemployed as the first mover of machinery. This great discovery has been ascribed by the English to the marquis of Worcester, and to Papin by the French; but it is almost certain, that about 34 years before the date of the marquis's invention, and about 61 years before the construction of Papin's digester, steam was employed as the impelling power of a stamping engine by one Brancas an Italian, who published an account of his invention in 1629. It is extremely probable, however, that the marquis of Worcester had never seen the work of Brancas, and that the fire-engine which he mentions in his Century of Inventions was the result of his own ingenuity. The advantages of steam as an impelling power being thus known, the ingenious Captain Savary invented an engine which raised water by the expansion and condensation of steam. Several engines of this construction were actually erected in England and France, but they were incapable of raising water from depths which exceeded 35 feet. The steam-engine received great improvements from our countrymen Newcomen, Brighton, and Blakey; but it was brought to its present state of perfection by Mr. Watt of Birmingham, one of the most accomplished engineers of the present age. Hitherto it had been employed merely as a hydraulic machine for draining mines or raising water, but in consequence of Mr. Watt's improvements it has long been used as the impelling power of almost every species of machinery. It is a curious circumstance, that the steam-engine was not only invented, but has received all its improvements, in our own country.\n\n11. The success of Galileo in investigating the doctrine of rectilinear motion, induced the illustrious Huygens to turn his attention to curvilinear motion. In his celebrated work *De Horologio Oscillatorio*, published in 1673, he has shown that the velocity of a heavy body descending along any curve, is the same at every instant in the direction of the tangent, as it would have been if it had fallen through a height equal to the corresponding vertical abscissa; and from the application of this principle to the reversed cycloid with its axis vertical, he discovered the isochronism of the cycloid, or that a heavy body, from whatever part of the cycloid it begins to fall, always arrives at the lower point of the curve in the same space of time. By these discoveries, Huygens was gradually led to his beautiful theory of central forces in the circle. This theory may be applied to the motion of a body in any curve, by considering all curves as composed of an infinite number of small arcs of circles of different radii, which Huygens had already done in his theory of evolutes. The theorems of Huygens concerning the centrifugal force and circular motions, were published without demonstrations. They were first demonstrated by Dr. Keill at the end of his Introduction to Natural Philosophy. The demonstrations of Huygens, however, which were more prolix than those of the English philosopher, were afterwards given in his posthumous works.\n\n12. About this time the true laws of collision or percussion were separately discovered by Wallis, Huygens, and Sir Christopher Wren in 1661, without having the least communication with each other. They were transmitted to the Royal Society of London in 1668, and appeared in the 43rd and 46th numbers of their Transactions. The rules given by Wallis and Wren are published in No. 43, pp. 864 and 867, and those of Huygens in No. 46, p. 927. The foundation of all their solutions is, that in the mutual collision of bodies, the absolute quantity of motion of the centre of gravity is the same after impact as before it, and that when the bodies are elastic, the respective velocity is the same after as before the shock.—We are indebted likewise to Sir Christopher Wren for an ingenious method of demonstrating the laws of impulsion by experiment. He suspended the impinging bodies by threads of equal length, so that they might touch each other when at rest. When the two bodies were separated from one another, and then allowed to approach by their own gravity, they impinged against each other when they arrived at the positions which they had when at rest, and their velocities were proportional to the chords of the arches through which they had fallen. Their velocities after impact were also measured by the chords of the arches through which the stroke had forced them to ascend, and the results of the experiments coincided exactly with the deductions of theory. The laws of percussion were afterwards more fully investigated by Huygens, in his posthumous work *De Motu Corporum ex Percussione*, and by Wallis in his *Mechanica*, published in 1670.\n\n13. The attention of philosophers was at this time directed to the two mechanical problems proposed by Merenius in 1635. The first of these problems was proposed by Merenius to determine the centre of oscillation in a compound pendulum, and the second to find the centre of percussion of a single body, or a system of bodies turning round a fixed axis. The centre of oscillation is that point in a compound pendulum, or a system of bodies moving round a centre, in which, if a small body were placed and made to move round the same centre, it would perform its oscillations in the same time as the system of bodies. The centre of percussion, which is situated in the same point of the system as the centre of oscillation, is that point of a body revolving or vibrating about an axis, which being struck by an immovable obstacle, the whole of its motion is destroyed. These two problems were at first discussed by Descartes and Roberval, but the methods which they employed were far from being correct. The first solution of the problem on the centre of oscillation was given by Huygens. He assumed as a principle, that if several weights attached to a pendulum defended by the force of gravity, and if at any instant the bodies were detached from one another, and each ascended with the velocity it had acquired by its fall, they would rise to such a height that the centre of gravity of the system in that state would descend to the same height as that from which the centre of gravity of the pendulum had descended. The solution founded on this principle, which was not derived from the fundamental laws of mechanics, did not at first meet with the approbation of philosophers; but it was afterwards demonstrated in the clearest manner, and now forms the principle of the conservation of active forces.—The problem of the centre of percussion was not attended with such difficulties. Several incomplete solutions of it were given by different geometers; but it was at last resolved in an accurate and general manner by James Bernoulli by the principle of the lever.\n\n14. In 1666, a treatise *De Vi Percussione*, was published.\nMECHANICS.\n\nlished by J. Alphonso Borelli, and in 1686, another work, De Motions Naturalibus à Gravitate Pendentibus; but he added nothing to the science of mechanics. His ingenious work, De Motu Animalium, however, is entitled to great praise, for the beautiful application which it contains of the laws of statics to explain the various motions of living agents.\n\n15. The application of statics to the equilibrium of machines, was first made by Varignon in his Project of a new System of Mechanics, published in 1687. The subject was afterwards completely discussed in his Nouvelle Mécanique, a posthumous work published in 1725. In this work are given the first notions of the celebrated principle of virtual velocities, from a letter of John Bernoulli's to Varignon in 1717. The virtual velocity of a body is the infinitely small space, through which the body excited to move has a tendency to describe in one instant of time. This principle has been successfully applied by Varignon to the equilibrium of all the simple machines. The resistance of solids, which was first treated by Galileo, was discussed more correctly by Leibnitz in the Acta Eruditorum for 1687. In the Memoirs of the Academy for 1702, Varignon has taken up the subject, and rendered the theory much more universal.\n\n16. An important step in the construction of machinery was about this time made by Parent. He remarked in general that if the parts of a machine, so arranged, that the velocity of the impelling power becomes greater or less according as the weight put in motion becomes greater or less, there is a certain proportion between the velocity of the impelling power, and that of the weight to be moved, which renders the effect of the machine a maximum or a minimum. He then applies this principle to underwater wheels, and shows that a maximum effect will be produced when the velocity of the stream is equal to thrice the velocity of the wheel. In obtaining this conclusion, Parent supposed that the force of the current upon the wheel is in the duplicate ratio of the relative velocity, which is true only when a single floatboard is impelled by the water. But when more floatboards than one are acted upon at the same time, it is obvious that the momentum of the water is directly as the relative velocity; and by making this substitution in Parent's demonstration, it will be found that a maximum effect is produced when the velocity of the current is double that of the wheel. This result was first obtained by the Chevalier Borda, and has been amply confirmed by the experiments of Smeaton. (See Hydrodynamics, § 279, 280, 281)\n\nThe principle of Parent was also applied by him to the construction of windmills. It had been generally supposed that the most efficacious angle of weather was 45°; but it was demonstrated by the French philosopher that a maximum effect is produced when the sails are inclined 54° degrees to the axis of rotation, or, when the angle of weather is 35° degrees. This conclusion, however, is subject to modifications which will be pointed out in a subsequent part of this article.\n\n17. The Traité de Mécanique de De la Hire, published separately in 1695, and in the 9th volume of the Memoirs of the French Academy from 1666 to 1699, contains the general properties of the mechanical powers, and the description of several ingenious and useful machines. But it is chiefly remarkable for the Traité des Épicycloïdes, which is added to the edition published in the Memoirs of the Academy. In his interesting treatise, De la Hire considers the genesis and properties of exterior and interior epicycloids, and demonstrates, that when one wheel is employed to drive another, the one will move sometimes with greater and sometimes with less force, and the other will move sometimes with greater and sometimes with less velocity, unless the teeth of one or both of the wheels be parts of a curve generated like an epicycloid. The same truth is applicable to the formation of the teeth of rackwork, the arms of levers, the wipers of tampers, and the lifting cogs of forge hammers; and as the epicycloidal teeth when properly formed roll upon one another without much friction, the motion of the machine will be uniform and pleasant, its communicating parts will be prevented from wearing, and there will be no unnecessary waste of the impelling power. Although De la Hire was the first who published this important discovery, yet the honour of it is certainly due to Olaus Roemer, the celebrated Danish astronomer, who discovered the successive proportions of light. It is expressly stated by Leibnitz in his letters to John Bernoulli, that Roemer communicated to him the discovery 20 years before the publication of De la Hire's work; but still we have no ground for believing that De la Hire was guilty of plagiarism. Roemer's researches were not published; and from the complete discussion which the subject has received from the French philosopher, it is not unlikely that he had the merit of being the second inventor. Even Camus, who about 40 years afterwards gave a complete and accurate theory of the teeth of wheels, was unacquainted with the pretensions of Roemer, and attributes the discovery to De la Hire.\n\n18. The publication of Newton's Principia contributed greatly to the progress of mechanics. His discoveries concerning the curvilinear motion of bodies, combined with the theory of universal gravitation, enabled philosophers to apply the science of mechanics to the phenomena of the heavens, to ascertain the law of the force by which the planets are held in their orbits, and to compute the various irregularities in the solar system, which arise from the mutual action of the bodies which compose it. The Mécanique Céleste of La Place will be a standing monument of the extension which mechanics has received from the theory of gravity. The important mechanical principle of the conservation of the motion of the centre of gravity is also due to Newton. He has demonstrated in his Principia, that the state of the centre of gravity of several bodies, whether in a state of rest or motion, is not affected by the reciprocal action of these bodies, whatever it may be, so that the centre of gravity of the bodies which act upon one another, either by the intervention of levers, or by the laws of attraction, will either remain at rest, or move uniformly in a right line.\n\n19. We have already seen that the principle of the conservation of active forces was discovered by Huygens when he solved the problem of the centre of oscillation. The principle alluded to, consists in this that in all the actions of bodies upon each other, whether that action is caused by the percussion of elastic bodies, or is communicated from one body to another by threads or inflexible rods, the sums of the masses multiplied by the squares of the absolute velocities remain always the same.\nThis important law is easily deducible from two simpler laws admitted in mechanics. 1. That in the collision of elastic bodies, their respective velocities remain the same after impact as they were before it; and 2. That the quantity of action, or the product of the masses of the impinging bodies, multiplied by the velocity of their centre of gravity, is the same after as before impact.\n\nThe principle of the conservation of active forces, was regarded by its inventor only as a simple mechanical theorem. John Bernouilli, however, considered it as a general law of nature, and applied it to the solution of several problems which could not be resolved by direct methods; but his son Daniel deduced from it the laws of the motion of fluids from vessels, a subject which had been formerly treated in a very vague manner. He afterwards rendered the principle more general, and showed how it could be applied to the motion of bodies influenced by their mutual attractions, or solicited towards fixed centres by forces proportional to any function of the distance.\n\nAfter the parallelogram of forces had been introduced into statics by Stevinus, it was generally admitted upon the same demonstration which was given for the composition of motion. The first complete demonstration was given by Daniel Bernouilli in the Commentaries of Peterburgh for 1726, independent of the consideration of compound motion. This demonstration, which was both long and abstruse, was greatly simplified by D'Alembert in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1769. Fonfeneix and Riccati have given a very ingenious one in the Memoirs of the Academy of Turin for 1761. This was also improved by D'Alembert, who gave another in the same Memoirs, and a third in his Traité de Dynamique, published in 1743. Dr Robison has combined the demonstrations of Bernouilli and D'Alembert with one by Frifit, and produced one that is more expeditious and simple. La Place has likewise given a demonstration of the parallelogram of forces in his Mecanique Celeste.\n\nAbout the beginning of the 18th century, the celebrated dispute about the measure of active forces was keenly agitated among philosophers. The first spark of this war, which for 40 years England maintained single-handed against all the genius of the continent, was excited by Leibnitz. In the Leipzig acts for 1686, he asserted that Descartes was mistaken in making the force of bodies proportional to their simple velocity, and maintained that it followed the ratio of the square of the velocity. He showed, that a body, with a velocity of two feet, acquires the power of raising itself to a height four times as great as that to which a body could rise with a velocity of only one foot; and hence he concludes, that the force of that body is as the square of its velocity. The abbé de Cottillon, a zealous Cartelian, allowed the premises of Leibnitz, but denied his conclusion. The body, said he, which moves with a velocity of two feet, will certainly rise to quadruple the height of another body that has only the velocity of one foot; but it will take twice the time to rise to that height, and a quadruple effect, in a double time, is not a quadruple force, but only a double one. The theory of Leibnitz was supported by John Bernouilli, Herman, Gravetende, Muffchenbroeck, Poleni, Wolff, and Bulfinch; and the opinion of Descartes by Maclaurin, Stirling, Clarke, De- faguliers, and other English philosophers. The question was at last involved in metaphysical reasoning; and if the dispute did terminate in favour of either party, the English philosophers were certainly victorious. It appears, in the clearest manner, that the force of a moving body, indicated by the space which it describes, is as the simple velocity, if we consider the space as described in a determinate time; but it is as the square of the velocity, if we do not consider the time in which the space is described. The question, therefore, comes to be this: In estimating the forces of bodies in motion, ought we to take time into consideration? If, with the followers of Leibnitz, we reject this element, then we may maintain that the force of a child is equal to that of a man carrying a load, because the child is also capable of carrying the same load, though in small parts and in a greater length of time.\n\nIn 1743, D'Alembert published his Traité de D'Alembert's principles. This principle was first employed by James Bernouilli in his solution of the problem of the centre of oscillation; but D'Alembert had the honour of generalizing it, and giving it all that simplicity and fertility of which it was susceptible. He showed, that in whatever manner the bodies of one system act upon another, their motions may always be decomposed into two others at every instant, those of the one being destroyed the instant following, and those of the other retained, and that the motions retained are necessarily known from the conditions of equilibrium between those which are destroyed. This principle is evidently a consequence of the laws of motion and equilibrium, and has the advantage of reducing all the problems of dynamics to pure geometry and the principles of statics. By means of it D'Alembert has resolved a number of beautiful problems which had escaped his predecessors, and particularly that of the precession of the equinoxes, which had occupied the attention of Newton. In his Traité de Dynamique, D'Alembert has likewise reduced the whole of mechanics to three principles, the force of inertia, compound motion, and equilibrium; and has illustrated his views on this subject by that profound and luminous reasoning which characterizes all his writings.\n\nAnother general principle in dynamics was Euler, about this time discovered separately by Euler, Daniel Bernouilli, and the chevalier D'Arcy, and received the name of the conservation of the momentum of rotatory motion. According to the two first philosophers, the conservation principle may be thus defined: In the motion of several bodies round a fixed centre, the sum of the products of the mass of each body multiplied by the velocity of its motion round the centre, and by its distance from that centre, is always independent of the mutual action which the bodies may exert upon each other, and always preserves itself the same, provided the bodies are not influenced by any external cause. This principle was given by Daniel Bernouilli in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin for 1746; and in the same year by Euler in the first volume of his works. They were both led to the discovery, while investigating the motion of several bodies in a tube of a given form, and which can only turn round a fixed point. The principle discovered by the chevalier D'Arcy was given in a memoir dated 1746, and published in the Memoirs of\nthe Academy for 1747. He showed, that the sum of the products of the mass of each body by the area which its radius vector describes round a fixed point, is always proportional to the times. The identity of this principle, which is a generalisation of Newton's theorem about the areas described by the planetary bodies, with that of Euler and Bernouilli, will be easily perceived, if we consider that the element of the circular arc, divided by the element of the time, expresses the velocity of circulation, and that the element of the circular arc, multiplied by the distance from the centre, gives the element of the area described round that centre; so that the principle of Euler is only a differential expression of the principle of D'Arcy, which he afterwards expressed in this form, that the sum of the products of the masses of each body by their velocities, and by the perpendiculars drawn from the centre to their lines of direction, is a constant quantity.\n\n24. The principle of least action, which was first propounded by Maupertuis in 1744, consists in this, that when several bodies, acting upon one another, experience any change in their motion, this change is always such, that the quantity of action (or the product of the mass by the space and the velocity) employed by nature to produce it, is the least possible. From this principle Maupertuis deduced the laws of the reflection and refraction of light, and those of the collision of bodies*. He afterwards extended its application to the laws of motion, and made the principle to generalise as to comprehend the laws of equilibrium, the uniform motion of the centre of gravity in the percussion of bodies, and the conservation of active forces. This celebrated principle was attacked by Koenig, professor of mathematics at the Hague, in the Leipzig acts for 1751, who not only attempted to shew its fallacy, but asserted that Leibnitz had first described it in 1707 in a letter to Herman. The paper of Koenig gave rise to a long and violent dispute about the accuracy of the principle, and the authenticity of the letter of Leibnitz. The academy of Berlin interfered in behalf of their president, and gave importance to a controversy which was too personal to merit the attention which it received.\n\n25. In his Traité des Isoperimetries, printed at Lausanne in 1744, Euler extended the principle of least action, and showed, \"that in the trajectories described by means of central forces, the integral of the velocity multiplied by the element of the curve, is either a maximum or a minimum.\" This remarkable property, which Euler recognised only in the case of inflated bodies, was generalised by Lagrange into this new principle, \"that the sum of the products of the masses by the integrals of the velocities, multiplied by the elements of the spaces described, is always a maximum or a minimum.\" In the memoirs of Turin, Lagrange has employed this principle to resolve several difficult problems in dynamics; and he has shown†, that when it is combined with the conservation of active forces, and developed according to the rules of his method of variations, it furnishes directly all the equations necessary for the solution of each problem, and gives rise to a simple and general method of treating the various problems concerning the motion of bodies.\n\n26. An important discovery in rotatory motion, was at this time made by Professor Segner. In a paper, entitled Specimen Theoriae Turbinum, he demonstrated, History, that if a body of any form or magnitude, after it has received rotatory motions in all directions, be left entirely to itself, it will always have three principal axes of rotation; or, in other words, all the rotatory motions with which it is affected, may be reduced to three, which are performed round three axes, perpendicular to each, passing through the centre of gravity of the revolving body, and preserving the same position in absolute space, while the centre of gravity is either at rest or moving uniformly in a straight line.\n\n27. The force of torsion began at this time to be investigated by Coulomb, who published two ingenious papers on the subject, in the Memoirs of the French Academy. He has successfully employed this principle in several physical researches, but particularly in determining the law of magnetic action, and in finding the laws of the resistance of fluids when the motions are extremely slow*. It was by means of an elegant experiment on the principle of torsion that Mr Cavendish determined the mutual attraction of two masses of lead, tut. Nat. and thence deduced the mean density of the earth.—tom. iii. p. We are also indebted to Coulomb for a complete list of experiments on the nature and effects of friction. By employing large bodies and ponderous weights, and conducting his experiments on a large scale, he has corrected errors which necessarily arose from the limited experiments of preceding writers; he has brought to light many new and interesting facts, and confirmed others which had hitherto been partially established. The most curious result of these experiments is the effect of time in increasing the friction between two surfaces. In some cases the friction reaches its maximum after the rubbing surfaces have remained in contact for one minute; and in other cases five or six days were necessary before this effect was produced. The increase of friction, which is generated by prolonging the time of contact, is so great, that a body, weighing 1650 pounds, was moved with a force of 64 pounds when first laid upon the corresponding surface. After remaining in contact for the space of three seconds, 100 pounds were necessary to put it in motion; and when the time was prolonged to five days, it could scarcely be moved with a power of 62 pounds†.\n\n28. One of the most important treatises on the science of motion is the Mechanics of the celebrated Euler, published in 1736. It contains the whole theory Works on rectilinear and curvilinear motion in an insulated mechanics body, affected by any accelerating forces, either in vacuo or in a resisting medium. He uniformly uses the analytical method, and has employed the principle of the vis inertiae, and that of compound motion, for putting his problems into equations. By the vis inertiae, motion is at every moment of time rectilinear and Euler's motion uniform; and by the principle of compound motion, a changeless body, exposed to the action of any number of forces, tending to alter the quantity and the direction of its motion, will move in such a direction as to reach the very point at which it would have arrived, had it obeyed successively each of the forces which act upon it.—In the Mécanique Analytique of Lagrange, published in 1788, all the mechanical problems are reduced to general formulae, which, being developed, furnish us with the equations that are necessary for the solution of each problem; and the different principles which...\nMechanics.\n\nTheory which have been discovered for facilitating the solutions of mechanical questions, are brought under one point of view, and their connection and dependence clearly pointed out. The Architecture Hydraulique, by M. Prony, published in 1790, and the Mecanique Philosophique, of the same author, published in 1799, contains all the late improvements in mechanics, and a complete view both of the theory and application of that science. The first of these works is intended chiefly for the use of the engineer, though an extensive acquaintance with the higher geometry is necessary for perusing it with advantage. His Mecanique Philosophique is a profound work, in which, without the aid of a single diagram, he gives all the formulae, and the various theorems and problems which belong to the sciences of mechanics and hydrodynamics. Every alternate page contains a methodical table of the results obtained in the preceding page, the description of the symbols, and the theorems, problems, and formulæ which may have been obtained.—The Traité de Mecanique Elementaire, by M. Franceur, published in 1802 in one volume octavo, is an excellent abridgment of the works of Prony, and is intended as an introduction to the Mecanique Philosophique of that author, to the Mecanique Analytique of Lagrange, and to the Mecanique Celeste of Laplace.—None of these works have been translated into English; but their place is well supplied by a Treatise on Mechanics Theoretical, Practical, and Descriptive, by Olinthus Gregory, A.M. published in 1806, and containing a complete view of the latest improvements, both in the theory and practice of mechanics.\n\nPART I. THEORY OF MECHANICS.\n\n29. THE theory of mechanics properly comprehends, 1. Dynamics. 2. The motion of projectiles. 3. The theory of simple machines, or the mechanical powers. 4. The theory of compound machines, and their maximum effects. 5. The doctrine of the centre of gravity. 6. The centre of oscillation, gyration, &c. 7. The collision of bodies. 8. The theory of rotation. 9. The theory of torsion. 10. The strength of materials; and, 11. The equilibrium of arches, domes.—The subjects of Dynamics, Projectiles, Rotation, and Strength of Materials having been already ably treated by Dr Robison, under their respective heads, we shall now direct the attention of the reader to the other branches of theoretical mechanics.\n\nCHAP. I. On Simple Machines, or the Mechanical Powers.\n\n30. THE simple machines have been generally reckoned fixed in number. 1. The lever; 2. The wheel and axle, or axis in peritrochus; 3. The pulley; 4. The inclined plane; 5. The wedge; and, 6. The screw: to which some writers on mechanics have added the balance, and others the rope-machine. It is evident, however, that all these machines may be reduced to three, the lever, the inclined plane, and the rope-machine. The pulley, and the wheel and axle, are obviously composed of an assemblage of levers; the balance is a lever with equal arms; the wedge is composed of two inclined planes, with their bases in contact; and the screw is either a wedge or an inclined plane, wrapped round a cylinder.—Under the head of simple machines, therefore, we cannot, in strict propriety, include any of the mechanical powers, excepting the lever, the inclined plane, and the rope-machine.\n\nDEFINITIONS.\n\n31. DEF. 1. When two forces act against each other by the intervention of a machine, the one force is called the power, and the other the weight. The weight is the resistance to be overcome, or the effect to be produced. The power is the force, whether animate or inanimate, which is employed to overcome that resistance, or to produce the required effect.\n\n32. DEF. 2. The power and weight are said to balance each other, or to be in equilibrium, when the effort of the one to produce motion in one direction, is equal to the effort of the other to produce motion in the opposite direction—or when the weight opposes that degree of resistance which is precisely required to destroy the action of the power.\n\nSECT. I. On the Lever.\n\n33. DEFINITION. A lever is an inflexible bar or rod moving freely round a point called its fulcrum, or divided into three kinds.\n\nLevers have been generally divided into three kinds. In levers of the first kind the fulcrum is situated between the power and the weight, as in fleelyards, scissors, pincers, &c. Levers of the second kind have the weight between the power and the fulcrum, as in cutting knives fastened at the point of the blade, and in the oars of a boat where the water is regarded as the fulcrum. In levers of the third kind, the power is between the weight and the fulcrum, as in tongs, shears for sheep, &c. The bones of animals are generally considered as levers of the third kind, for the muscles, by the contraction of which the power or moving force is generated, are fixed much nearer to the joints or centres of motion than the centre of gravity of the weight to be raised. On this subject, see Paley's Natural Theology, chap. 7, 8. and Borelli de Motu Animalium.\n\nAXIOMS.\n\n34. AXIOM 1. Equal weights acting at the extremities of equal arms of a straight lever, and having the lines of the direction in which they act at equal angles to these arms, will exert the same effort to turn the lever round its fulcrum. This axiom has been generally restricted to the particular case when the weights act perpendicularly to the arms of the lever; but no reason can be assigned for such a limitation. The truth in the axiom is as self-evident when the angles formed by the arms of the lever and the direction of the forces are 80°, as when they are 90°, for in each case the two weights exert...\nTheory exert their influence upon the lever in precisely the same circumstances.\n\n35. Axiom 2. If two equal weights are placed at the extremities of a lever supported by two fulcrums; and if these fulcrums are at equal distances from the weights, or the extremities of the lever; the pressure upon the fulcrum will be equal to the sum of the weights, and the pressure upon each fulcrum will be equal to one of the weights. The lever being supposed devoid of weight, it is obvious, that as each fulcrum is similarly situated with respect to both the weights, the pressure upon each must be equal; and as the fulcrum supports both the equal weights, the pressure upon each must be equal to one of the weights.\n\nProposition I.\n\n36. If two weights or forces acting at equal angles upon a straight lever, devoid of weight, are in equilibrium, they are reciprocally proportional to their distances from the fulcrum.\n\n37. Case 1. When the weights act on contrary sides of the fulcrum.\n\nLet AB be a lever devoid of weight, and let it be supported upon the two fulcrums f, F, situated in such a manner that AF = fF = FB. Then if two equal weights C, D of one pound each are suspended at the extremities A, B, so as to act in directions AC, BD, making the angles CAB, DBA equal, the weights will be in equilibrium, for since AF = fF (Axiom 1.) the effort of the weight D to turn the lever round the fulcrum F, will be equal to the effort of the weight C to turn it round the fulcrum f. Now (Axiom 2.) the pressure upon the fulcrum f is equal to one pound, therefore if that fulcrum is removed, and a weight E of one pound be made to act upward at the point F, the weights C and D will continue in equilibrium. Then it is obvious that since FB = fF, the weight E of one pound acting upwards at the point f, so that the angle DF = DBA, will have the same effect as an equal weight acting downwards at B. By removing the weight E, therefore, and suspending its equal C at the extremity B, the equilibrium will still be preserved. But the weights D, C, suspended at B, are equal to two pounds, and the weight C is only one pound; and as FA is double of FB, it follows that a weight of two pounds, placed at the end of one arm of a lever, will be in equilibrium with a weight of one pound placed at twice the distance of the former from the fulcrum. But 2 : 1 = 2 FB or AF : FB, that is, when the distances are as 2 to 1, an equilibrium takes place if the weights are reciprocally proportional to these distances.\n\n38. Case 2. When the weights act on the same side of the fulcrum.\n\nLet AB be a lever in equilibrium upon the fulcrum F, and let FA be equal to FB, consequently (case 1.) we must have C = D = 1 pound. Now as the fulcrum F supports a weight equal to C + D = 2 pounds, the equilibrium will continue if a weight E of two pounds is made to act upwards at the point F, for in this case it supplies the place of the fulcrum. It is obvious also that a fulcrum placed at A or B will supply the place of the weights at these parts without affecting the equilibrium. Let, therefore, the weight D be removed, and let the extremity B rest upon a fulcrum; then since the lever is in equilibrium, we have a weight E = C + D = 2 pounds acting at F, and balancing a weight C of one pound acting at A. But 2 : 1 = AB : FB, consequently when there is an equilibrium between two weights C, D acting at the distances 2 and 1 from the fulcrum, and on the same side of the fulcrum, the weights are reciprocally proportional to these distances.\n\n39. Again, let AB be the same lever supported by Fig. 3. the fulcrums f, F, and let AF = fF = FB and fF = 2FB. Then if two weights C, D of one pound each be suspended at the extremities A, B, they will be in equilibrium as before. But since the fulcrum f supports a pressure of one pound (Axiom 2.), the equilibrium will still continue when that fulcrum is removed and a weight of one pound made to act in a contrary direction fP at the point f, so that the angle PfF may be equal to DBA. Now, (Axiom 1.) a weight E of one pound acting upward at f will be in equilibrium with a weight E' of one pound acting downwards at f'; fF' being equal to fP', and therefore by removing E from the point f and substituting E at the point f', an equilibrium will still obtain. But since fF' = 2FB a weight of one pound suspended from f will have the same influence in turning the lever round F as a weight of two pounds suspended at B (Case 2.). Let us remove, therefore, the weight E' from f', and substitute a weight G = 2E', so as to act at B. Then since the equilibrium is not destroyed, we have a weight C of one pound acting at the distance FA, and the weights D + G = 3 pounds acting at the distance FB. But FA = 3FB and D + G = 3C, consequently C : D + G = FB : FA: That is, when the distances from the fulcrum are as 3 to 1, and when an equilibrium exists, the weights are reciprocally proportional to these distances.\n\n40. By making FA in fig. 2. equal to 2FB it may be shewn, as in Case 2. that the weights are reciprocally proportional to their distances from the fulcrum, when they act on the same side of the fulcrum, and when the distances are as 3 to 1.\n\n41. In the same way the demonstration may be extended to any commensurable proportion of the arms, by making EA to FB in that proportion, and keeping fA always equal to FB. Hence we may conclude in general, that when two weights acting at equal angles upon a straight lever devoid of weight, are in equilibrium, they are reciprocally proportional to their distances from the centre of motion. Q. E. D.\n\n42. Cor. 1. If two weights acting at equal angles upon the arms of a straight lever devoid of weight are reciprocally proportional to their distances from the fulcrum, they will be in equilibrium.\n\nFor if an equilibrium does not take place, the proportion of the weights must be altered to procure an equilibrium, and then, contrary to the proposition, the weights would balance each other when they were not reciprocally proportional to their distances from the fulcrum.\n\n43. Cor. 2. If a weight W be supported by a horizontal lever resting on the fulcrums A, B, the pressure upon A is to the pressure upon B in the inverse ratio of their distances from the point where the weight is suspended, that is, as BF to FA.\n\nFor if we suppose B to be the fulcrum, and if removing the\nthe fulcrum A, we support the extremity A of the lever by a weight E equivalent to the weight sustained by the fulcrum A, and acting upwards over the pulley P, then the weight E or that sustained by A : W = BF : BA (Prop. I.) ; and if we conceive A to be the fulcrum, and support the extremity B by a weight F equal to that which was supported by the fulcrum B, we shall have the weight F or the weight sustained by B : W = AF : AB. Hence ex aequo the weight sustained by A is to the weight sustained by B as BF is to FA.\n\n44. Cor. 3. We may now call the two weights P and W, the power and the weight, as in fig. 5, and since P : W = FB : FA, we have (Geometry, Sect. iv. Theor. 8.) P × FA = W × FB, when an equilibrium takes place,\n\nconsequently \\( P = \\frac{W \\times FB}{FA} \\); \\( W = \\frac{P \\times FA}{FB} \\)\n\n\\( FA = \\frac{W \\times FB}{P} \\)\n\n\\( FB = \\frac{P \\times FA}{W} \\)\n\n45. Cor. 4. We have already seen (Axiom 2.) that when the power and the weight are on contrary sides of the fulcrum, the pressure upon the fulcrum is equal to P + W or the sum of the weights; but it is obvious that when they act on the same side of the fulcrum, the pressure which it supports will be P - W, or the difference of their weights.\n\n46. Cor. 5. If a weight P be shifted along the arm of a lever AD, the weight W, which it is capable of balancing at A, will be proportional to FA.\n\nWhen the weights are in equilibrium (Cor. 3.) W : P = FA : FB, or by alternation W : FA = P : FB, and if \\( w \\) be another value of W and \\( f \\) another value of FA, we shall also have \\( w : P = f : a \\) or \\( w : f = P : FB \\), consequently (Euclid, Book v. Prop. xi. and xvi.) \\( W : w = FA : f \\), that is, W varies as FA.\n\nCor. 6. It is obvious that the truths in the preceding proposition and corollaries, also hold when the lever has the form represented in figure 6, only the straight lines AF, FB are in that case the length of the arm.\n\n47. Cor. 7. Since by the last corollary FA : f = W : w, it follows that in the Roman, lateral or steelyard, which is merely a lever with a long and short arm, having a weight moveable upon the long one, the distances at which the constant weight must be hung are as the weights suspended from the shorter arm. The steelyard is represented in fig. 7, where AB is the lever with unequal arms AF, FB, and F the centre of motion. The body W, whose weight is to be found, is suspended at the extremity B of the lever, and the constant weight P is moved along the divided arm FB till an equilibrium takes place. As soon as this happens, the number placed at the point of suspension D, indicates the weight of the body. If the lever is devoid of weight, it is obvious that the scale EB will be a scale of equal parts of which EB is the unit, and that the weight of the body W will be always equal to the constant weight P multiplied by the number of divisions between P and F. Thus if the equilibrium takes place when P is pulled out to the 12 division, we shall have W = 12 P, and if P = 1 pound, W = 12 pounds. But when the gravity of the lever is considered, which must be done in the real steelyard, its arms are generally of unequal weight, and therefore the divisions of the scale must be determined by experiment. In order to do this, remove the weight P, and find the point C, at which a weight \\( P' \\) equal to P being suspended, will keep the unequal arms in equilibrium, C will then be the point at which the equal divisions must commence. For when W and P are placed upon the steelyard and are in equilibrium, W balances P along with a weight which, placed at D, would support P placed at C: Therefore \\( W \\times BF = P \\times DF + P \\times CF \\); but \\( P \\times DF + P \\times CF = P \\times DC \\), consequently \\( W \\times BF = P \\times DC \\), and (Geometry, Sect. iv. Theor. 8.) \\( W : DC = P : BF \\). By taking different values of the variable quantities W and DC as \\( w \\) and \\( d'c \\), we shall have \\( w : d'c = P : BF \\), consequently (Euclid, B. V. Prop. xi. and xvi.) \\( W : w = DC : d'c \\), that is, the weight of W varies as DC, and therefore the divisions must commence at C. If the arm BF had been heavier than FA, which, however, can scarcely happen in practice, the point C would have been on the other side of F. In constructing steelyards, it might be advisable to make the unequal arms balance each other by placing a weight M at the extremity of the lighter arm, in which case the scale will begin at F. In the Danish and Swedish steelyard the body to be weighed and the constant weight are fixed at the extremities of the steelyard, but the point of suspension or centre of motion F moves along the lever till the equilibrium takes place. The point F then indicates the weight of the body required.—There are some steelyards in which the constant weight is fixed to the shorter arm, while the body to be weighed moves upon the longer arm. The method of dividing this and the preceding steelyard may be seen in De la Hire's Traite de Mecanique, Prop. 36, 37, 38.\n\nProp. II.\n\n48. To find the condition of equilibrium on a straight lever when its gravity is taken into the account.\n\n49. Let us suppose the lever to be of uniform thickness and density, as AB, fig. 7, and let it be suspended by the points c, d to another lever ab, considered as without weight, so that \\( a = c = e = f = d = b \\). Then if \\( f \\) be the centre of motion or point of suspension, the cylinder AB will be in equilibrium; for the weight AB may be regarded as composed of a number of pairs of equal weights, equally distant from the centre of motion. For the same reason, if we conceive the cylinder to be cut through at F the equilibrium will continue, c, d being now the points at which the weights AF, FB act, and their distances \\( cF, dF \\) from the centre of motion being equal. Consequently the arms AF, FB have the same energy in turning the lever round \\( f \\) as if weights equal to AF, FB were suspended at the distance of their middle points \\( c, d \\) from the fulcrum.\n\nLet P therefore, in fig. 5, be the power, W the weight, m the weight of the arm AF, and n the weight of FB. Then when there is an equilibrium we shall have (Prop. I, Cor. 3.) \\( P \\times AF = m \\times \\frac{1}{2} AF = W \\times FB + n \\times \\frac{1}{2} FB \\); and since the weight m acting at half the distance AF is the same as half the weight m, acting at the\nMECHANICS:\n\nTheory. The whole distance AF, we may substitute \\( \\frac{1}{2} m \\times AF \\) instead of \\( m \\times \\frac{1}{2} AF \\), and the equation becomes\n\n\\[ P + \\frac{1}{2} m \\times AF = W + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times FB. \\]\n\nHence\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{W + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times FB}{AF - \\frac{1}{2} m}. \\]\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{P + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times AF}{FB - \\frac{1}{2} n}. \\]\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{W + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times 2FB}{AF - 2P}. \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{P + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times 2AF}{FB - 2W}. \\]\n\n\\[ AF = \\frac{W + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times FB}{P + \\frac{1}{2} m}. \\]\n\n\\[ FB = \\frac{P + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times AF}{W + \\frac{1}{2} m}. \\]\n\n50. Cor. If the arms of the lever are not of uniform density and thickness, instead of the distance of their middle points, we must take the distance of their centre of gravity from the fulcrum.\n\nProp. III.\n\n51. If two forces acting in any direction, and in the same plane, upon a lever of any form, are in equilibrium, they will be reciprocally proportional to the perpendiculars let fall from the fulcrum upon the directions in which they act.\n\n52. Let AFB be a lever of any form, F its fulcrum, A, B the points to which the forces, or the power P and weight W, are applied, and AE, BK the directions in which these forces act. Make AE to BK as P is to W, and they will therefore represent the forces applied at A and B. Draw AC perpendicular to AF and EC parallel to it, and complete the parallelogram ADEC. In the same way form the parallelogram BGKH. Produce EA and KB towards m and n if necessary, and let fall FM, FN perpendicular to AE, BK produced. Then P shall be to W as FN is to FM. By the resolution of forces (Dynamics, § 140.) the force AE is equivalent to forces represented by AD and AC, and acting in these directions. But as AD acts in the direction of the arm AF, it can have no influence in turning the lever round F, and therefore AC represents the portion of the force AD which contributes to produce an angular motion round F. In the same way it may be shewn that BG is the part of the force BK which tends to move the lever round F. Now suppose AF produced to B, FB being made equal to FB and B'G' = BG. Then by Prop. I. AC : B'G' = FB : FA; but by Axiom 1. the effort of BG to turn the lever round F is equal to the effort of the equal force B'G' to turn the lever round F; therefore AC : BG = FB : FA and AC × FA = BG × FB. Now the triangles ACE, AEm are similar, because the angles at E and M are both right, and on account of the parallels DF, AC, MAC = ADF; therefore AC : AE = FM : FA, and AC × FA = AE × FM. For the same reason in the similar triangles BGK, BFN we have BG : BK = FN : FB, and BK × FN = BG × FB.\n\nHence AE × FM = BK × FN, and AE : BK or P : W = FN : FM. Q.E.D.\n\nCor. 1. The forces P and W are reciprocally proportional to the sines of the angles which their directions make with the arms of the lever, for FM is evidently the fine of the angle FA m, and FN the fine of the angle FBn, FA, FB being made the radii; therefore P : W = Sin. FBn : Sin. FA m, or P : W = \\(\\frac{I}{\\text{Sin. FA m}} : \\frac{I}{\\text{Sin. FBn}}\\). Since FA : FM = Rad.; Sin. FA m, we have FM = \\(\\frac{FA \\times \\text{Sin. FA m}}{\\text{Rad.}}\\); and since FB : Fn = Rad. : Sin. FBn, we have FM = \\(\\frac{FB \\times \\text{Sin. FBn}}{\\text{Rad.}}\\); but in the case of an equilibrium P : W = FN : FM, consequently P : W = \\(\\frac{FB \\times \\text{Sin. FBn}}{\\text{Rad.}} : \\frac{FA \\times \\text{Sin. FA m}}{\\text{Rad.}}\\); and since magnitudes have the same ratio as their equimultiples, P : W = EB × Sin. EBn : FA × Sin. FA m.\n\nCor. 2. The energies of the forces P, W to turn the lever round the fulcrum F is the same at whatever point in the directions mE, nK they are applied, for the perpendiculars to which these energies are proportional remain the same.—The truth of this corollary has been assumed as an axiom by some writers on mechanics, who have very readily deduced from it the preceding proposition. But it is very obvious that the truth assumed as self-evident is nearly equivalent to the truth which it is employed to prove. Those who have adopted this mode of demonstration illustrate their axiom by the case of a solid body that is either pulled in one direction with a straight rod, or drawn by a cord; in both of which cases it is manifest that the effect of the force employed is the same, at whatever part of the rod or string it is applied: but these cases are completely different from that of a body moving round a fixed centre.\n\nCor. 3. If AE and BK the directions in which the forces P, W are exerted be produced till they meet at L; and if from the fulcrum E the line FS be drawn parallel to the direction AL of one force till it meets BL, the direction of the other; then LS, SF will represent the two forces. For as the sides of any triangle are as the fines of the opposite angles LS : SF = fin. LFS : fin. FLS; but on account of the parallels FS, AL the angle LFS = FLA, and FL being radius FM is the fine of FLA or LFS, and FN the fine of FLS, therefore by substitution LS : SF = FM : FN, that is as the force W : P.\n\nCor. 4. If several forces act upon a lever, and keep it in equilibrium, the sum of the products of the forces and the perpendiculars from the fulcrum to the direction of the different forces on one side is equal to the sum of the products on the other. For since the energy of each force to turn the lever is equal to the product of the force and the perpendicular from the fulcrum on the line of its direction; and since in the case of an equilibrium, the energy of all the forces on one side of the fulcrum must be equal to the energy of all the forces on the other side, the products proportional to their energies must also be equal.\n\nCor. 5. If two forces act in a parallel direction upon an angular lever whose fulcrum is its angular point,\npoint, these forces will be in equilibrium when a line drawn from the fulcrum upon the line which joins the two points where the forces are applied, and parallel to the direction of the forces, cuts it in such a manner that the two parts are reciprocally proportional to the forces applied.\n\nLet \\( \\text{AFB} \\) be the angular lever, whose fulcrum is \\( F \\), and let the forces \\( P, W \\) be applied at \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) in the parallel directions \\( Pm, Wn \\); then if the line \\( FD \\), parallel to \\( Pm \\) or \\( Wn \\), cut \\( AB \\) in such a manner that \\( DB : DA = P : W \\), the forces will be in equilibrium.\n\nDraw \\( Fm \\) perpendicular to \\( Pm \\), and produce it to \\( n \\); then since \\( Am, Bn \\) are parallel, \\( mn \\) will also be perpendicular to \\( Bn \\), and by the proposition (Art. 51.) \\( Fn : Fm = P : W \\). Now, if through \\( F \\), there be drawn \\( m'n' \\) parallel to \\( AB \\), the triangles \\( Fm'n' : Fn'm' \\) will be similar, and we shall have \\( Fn : W = Fm : Fm' \\), but on account of the parallels \\( AB, m'n' ; Fn : Fm' = DB : DA \\), therefore \\( DB : DA = P : W \\).\n\n58. Cor. 6. Let \\( CB \\) be a body moveable round its centre of gravity \\( F \\), and let two forces \\( P, W \\) act upon it at the points \\( A, B \\) in the plane \\( \\Delta FB \\), in the directions \\( AP, BW \\); then since this body may be regarded as a lever whole fulcrum is \\( F \\), the forces will be in equilibrium when \\( P : W = Fn : Fm \\); \\( Fm, Fn \\) being perpendiculars on the directions in which the forces act.\n\n59. Cor. 7. If \\( AB \\) be an inflexible rod moveable round \\( F \\) as a fulcrum, and acted upon by two forces \\( P, W \\) in the directions \\( Am, An \\), these forces will be in equilibrium when they are to one another as the perpendiculars \\( Fn, Fm \\).—For by cor. 2, the forces may be considered as applied at \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), and \\( mF \\) may be regarded as the lever; but by the proposition (Art. 51.) \\( P : W = Fn : Fm \\); \\( Fm, Fn \\) being perpendiculars upon \\( Am, An \\).\n\n60. Cor. 8. Let \\( DE \\) be a heavy wheel, and \\( FG \\) an obstacle over which it is to be moved, by a force \\( P \\), acting in the direction \\( AH \\). Join \\( AF \\) and draw \\( Fm, Fn \\) perpendicular to \\( CA \\) and \\( AH \\). The weight of the wheel is evidently the weight to be raised, and may be represented by \\( W \\) acting at the point \\( A \\) in the vertical direction \\( AC \\). We may now consider \\( AF \\) as a lever whose fulcrum is \\( F \\), and by cor. 7, there will be an equilibrium when \\( P : W = Fn : Fm \\). Since \\( Fm \\) represents the mechanical energy of the power \\( P \\) to turn the wheel round \\( F \\), it is obvious that when \\( FG \\) is equal to the radius of the wheel, the weight \\( P \\), however great, has no power to move it over the obstacle; for when \\( FG = AC, Fm = 0 \\), and \\( Fm \\times P = 0 \\).\n\n61. Cor. 9. If a man be placed in a pair of scales hung at the extremities of a lever, and is in equilibrium with a weight in the opposite scale, then if he presses against any point in the lever, except that point from which the scale is suspended, the equilibrium will be destroyed. Let \\( CB \\) be the lever in equilibrium, \\( F \\) its fulcrum, and let the scales be suspended from \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), \\( AP \\) being the scale in which the man is placed. Then if he presses with his hand or with a rod against \\( D \\), a point nearer the centre than \\( A \\), the scale will take the position \\( AP' \\), and the same effect will be produced as if \\( AD \\) were a solid mass acting upon the lever in the direction of gravity. Consequently if \\( P'p \\) be drawn perpendicular from the point \\( P' \\) to \\( FC \\), \\( Fp \\) will be the lever with which the man in the scale tends to turn the lever round the fulcrum; and as \\( Fp \\) is greater than \\( FA \\), the man will preponderate. In the same way it may be shown, that if the man in the scale \\( AP \\) presses upwards against a point \\( C \\), more remote from the fulcrum than \\( A \\), he will diminish his relative weight, and the scale \\( W \\) will preponderate, for in this case the scale affirms the position \\( AP'' \\), and \\( Fp' \\) becomes the lever by which it acts.\n\n62. Cor. 10. If a weight \\( W \\) be supported by an inclined lever resting on the fulcra \\( A, B \\), the pressure upon \\( A \\) is to that upon \\( B \\) inversely, as \\( Af \\) is to \\( fb \\), the sections of a horizontal line by the vertical direction of the weight \\( W \\).\n\nRemove the fulcrum \\( A \\), and support the extremity \\( A \\) by a weight \\( P \\), equal to the pressure upon \\( A \\); then \\( B \\) being the centre of motion, and \\( mn \\) being drawn through \\( F \\) perpendicular to the directions of the forces \\( Am, Bf \\), and consequently parallel to \\( Ab \\), we have (Art. 51.) \\( P : W = Fn : Fm = fb : fA \\), that is, the pressure upon \\( A \\) is to the pressure upon \\( B \\) inversely as \\( Af \\), is to \\( fb \\).\n\nScholium.\n\n63. Various attempts have been made by different writers on mechanics to give a complete and satisfactory demonstration of the fundamental property of the lever. The first of these attempts was made by Archimedes, who affirms as an axiom, that if two equal bodies be placed upon a lever, they will have the same influence in giving it a rotatory motion as if they were both placed in the middle part between them. This truth, however, is far from being self-evident, and on this account Mr Vince * has completed the demonstration by making this axiom a preliminary proposition. The demonstration of Galileo † is both simple and elegant, and does not seem to have attracted much notice, though in principle it is exactly the same as that of Archimedes completed by Mr Vince. Galileo supposes a solid cylinder or prism from a lever by several threads. When the lever is hung by its centre, the whole is in equilibrium. He then supposes the cylinder to be cut into two unequal parts, which from their mode of suspension still retain their position, and then imagines each part of the cylinder to be suspended by its centre from the lever. Here then we have two unequal weights hanging at unequal distances from the centre of suspension, and it follows from the construction, that these weights are in the reciprocal ratio of their distances from that centre. Mr Vince, on the other hand, employs a cylinder balanced on a fulcrum. He supposes this cylinder divided into unequal parts, and thus concludes from his preliminary proposition, that these unequal parts have the same effect in turning the lever as if the weight of these parts was placed in their centres; which is done by Galileo by suspending them from their centres. From this the fundamental property of the lever is easily deduced.—The next demonstration was given by Huygens, who affirms as an axiom, that if any weight placed upon a lever is removed to a greater distance from the fulcrum, its effort to turn the lever will be increased. This axiom he might have demonstrated thus, and his demonstration would have been completely satisfactory, though it applies only to cases where the arms of the lever are commensurable. Let \\( AB \\) be a lever with equal weights \\( C, D \\), supported on the fulcra \\( f, F \\), so that\n\n\\[ H \\quad Af = \\]\nMechanics.\n\nTheory. \\( A = FB \\); then, as was shown in Prop. I, the weights will be in equilibrium, and each fulcrum will support a weight equal to C or D. By removing the fulcrum \\( f \\), the weight C must descend, as the equilibrium is destroyed by a weight equal to C acting at \\( f \\); therefore the weight C, at the distance AF, has a greater effect in turning the lever than an equal weight D placed at a less distance FB. — In Sir Isaac Newton's demonstration, it is supposed that if a given weight act in any direction, and if several radii be drawn from the fulcrum to the line of direction, the effort of that weight to turn the lever will be the same to whatever of these radii it is applied. It appears, however, from Art. 54, that this principle is far from being self-evident, and therefore the demonstration which is founded upon it cannot be admitted as satisfactory. The demonstration given by MacLaurin * is simple and convincing, and has been highly approved by Dr T. Young, and other writers on mechanics, though it extends only to any commensurable proportion of the arms. He supposes the lever AB with equal arms to be in equilibrium upon the fulcrum F, by means of the equal forces P, W, in which case the fulcrum F will evidently be pressed down with a weight equal to \\( 2P + W \\). He then substitutes, instead of the weight P, a fixed obstacle O, which will not destroy the equilibrium, and considers the fulcrum as still loaded with a weight equal to \\( P + W \\).\n\nThe pressure on F being therefore equal to \\( 2P + W \\), a weight E equal to \\( 2P \\), and acting upwards, is substituted in the room of that pressure, so that the equilibrium will still continue. Here then we have a lever AB of the second kind, influenced by two forces E and W acting at different distances from the fulcrum A; and since \\( E = 2P = 2W \\), and \\( AB = 2AF \\), we have \\( E : W = AB : AF \\), which expresses the fundamental property of the lever. Without objecting to the circumstance that this demonstration applies only to the lever of the second kind, we may be allowed to observe, that it involves an axiom which cannot be called self-evident. It is certainly manifest that when P and W are in equilibrium, the pressure upon the fulcrum is \\( 2P + W \\); but it by no means follows that this pressure remains the same when the fixed obstacle O is substituted in the room of P. On the contrary, the axiom assumed is a result of the proposition which it is employed to prove, or rather it is the proposition itself. For if, when the extremity A bears against the obstacle O, the pressure upon F is equal to \\( 2W \\), the force W obviously produces a pressure \\( 2W \\) at half the distance AB, which is the property to be demonstrated.\n\nThe demonstrations given by Mr Landen and Dr Hamilton, the former in his Memoirs, and the latter in his Essays †, though in a great measure satisfactory, are long and tedious. In the demonstration of Dr Hamilton, he employs the following proposition; that when a body is at rest, and acted upon by three forces, they will be to one another as the three sides of a triangle parallel to the direction in which the forces act. When the three forces act on one point of a body, the proposition is true, but it is not applicable to the case of a lever where the forces are applied to three different points, and at all events the demonstration does not hold when any two of the forces act in parallel directions. The demonstration which we have given in Prop. I is new, and different from any that have been noticed. The truths on which it is founded are perfectly axiomatic; and the only objection to which it seems liable is, that the demonstration extends only to a commensurate proportion of the arms of the lever.\n\nAn analytical demonstration of the fundamental property of the lever was given by Foncenex in the Miscellanea. Jour. tom. ii. p. 321, which was afterwards improved by D'Alembert in the Mem. de l'Acad. 1769, p. 283.\n\nProp. IV.\n\n64. When several levers \\( AB, ab, a\\beta \\), whose fulcrums are \\( F, f, \\varphi \\), are so combined as to act perpendicularly upon each other, or at equal angles; and if the directions in which the power and weight are applied, be also perpendicular to the arms, or at the same angles with them as those at which the levers act upon each other, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W = BF \\times bf \\times \\beta \\varphi : AF \\times af \\times a\\varphi \\).\n\nLet M be the force which is exerted by the first lever \\( AB \\) upon the second \\( ab \\), and N the force which is exerted by the second lever \\( ab \\) upon the third \\( a\\beta \\), then by Prop.

Join AB, and produce it on both sides towards E and I. Produce also the lines YA, VB till they meet in H, and from H, through the fulcrum F, draw HF, dividing AB into two parts AF, BF. Let UM be a line given in position, and let \\( \\alpha, \\beta \\) represent the angles which the direction of the forces YA, VB make with that line. Let YA and VB likewise represent the intensity of the forces P, W, and let VA be resolved into AE and YF; and the force VB into BI and VI. — Then the lever cannot be in equilibrium till\n\nI. \\( EA \\times fA + IB \\times fB \\) is a maximum.\n\nII. Or putting \\( \\varphi \\) for the angles formed by the lines AR, UT, which the lever, when in equilibrium, makes with the line UM given in position, there cannot be an equilibrium till\n\n\\[\nTang. \\varphi \\times P \\times Af \\times Cof. z + Tang. \\varphi \\times W \\times Bf \\times Cof. \\varphi = W \\times Bf \\times Sin. \\varphi - P \\times Af \\times Sin. \\alpha.\n\\]\n\nIII.

Comment. Petropol.* tom. viii. p. 271.\n\n**Scholium.**\n\n66. This property of the lever was only considered by Epinus in the case of a rectilineal lever with equal arms; but was extended by J. H. Van Swinden. When the lever is rectilineal and with equal arms, we have \\(AF = FB = AF = BF\\), and also \\(m = n = 0\\), so that, if the last formula is suited to these conditions, we shall have the formula of Epinus.\n\n**Prop. VI.**\n\n67. If a power and weight acting upon the arms of any lever be in equilibrium, and if the whole be put in motion, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the weight is to the power.\n\nLet \\(AFB\\) be any lever whose fulcrum is \\(F\\), and let the power \\(P\\) and weight \\(W\\) be applied to its extremities \\(A, B\\), so as to be in equilibrium. Draw \\(FM, FN\\) perpendicular to \\(AD, BE\\) the direction of the forces \\(P, W\\). Then suppose an uniform angular motion to be given to the lever, so as to make it describe the small angle \\(AFA'\\), the position of the lever will now be \\(A'FB'\\), and the directions of the forces \\(P, W\\) will be \\(A'D', B'E'\\) parallel to \\(AD, BE\\) respectively, since the angle \\(AEF\\) is exceedingly small. Join \\(AA', BB'\\), and from \\(A'\\) and \\(B'\\) draw \\(A'x, B'z\\) perpendicular to \\(AD\\) and \\(BE\\). Now it is obvious, that though the point \\(A\\) has moved through the space \\(AA'\\) in the same time that the point \\(B\\) has described the space \\(BB'\\), yet \\(A \\times x\\) is the space described by \\(A\\) in the direction \\(AD\\), and \\(B \\times z\\) the space described by \\(B\\) in the direction \\(BE\\). For if we suppose a plane passing through \\(A\\) at right angles to \\(AD\\), and another through \\(P\\) parallel to the former plane, it is manifest that \\(A \\times x\\) measures the approach of the point \\(A\\) to the plane passing through \\(P\\); and for the same reason \\(B \\times z\\) measures the approach of the point \\(B\\) to a plane passing through \\(W\\) at right angles to \\(WB\\). Therefore \\(A \\times x, B \\times z\\) represent the spaces uniformly and simultaneously described by the points \\(A, B\\), and may therefore be taken to denote the velocities of these points (*Dynamics*, § 14); consequently the velocity of \\(A :\\) the velocity of \\(B = A \\times x : B \\times z\\).\n\nNow, in the triangles \\(A \\times x A', FM A\\), the exterior angle \\(x AF = AM F + m F, A'\\) (Euclid. B. I. Prop. 32.) and \\(A'AF = AM F\\), because \\(AFA'\\) is so exceedingly small that \\(A'A\\) is sensibly perpendicular to \\(AF\\); consequently \\(A \\times x A' = AE m\\); and as the angles at \\(x\\) and \\(m\\) are right, the triangles \\(A \\times x A', AM F\\) are similar (*Geometry*, XX. Sect. IV.).\n\nTherefore, \\(A \\times x A' = FM : FA\\), and in the similar triangles \\(AFA', BB' A A': BB' = FA : FB\\), and in the similar triangles \\(BB' z, BF n, BB' : B z = FB : Fn\\), therefore by composition we have \\(A \\times x : B z = FM : Fn\\).\n\nBut by Proposition II. \\(P : W = FM : Fn\\), consequently \\(A \\times x : B z = W : P\\), that is, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the weight is to the power. Q. E. D.\n\n68. Cor. Since \\(A \\times x : B z = W : P\\) we have \\(A \\times x \\times P = B z \\times W\\), that is, the momenta of the power and weight are equal.\n\n**Sect. II. On the Inclined Plane.**\n\n69. Definition. An inclined plane is a plane surface \\(AB\\), supported at any angle \\(ABC\\) formed with the horizontal plane \\(BC\\). The inclination of the plane is the angle which one line in the plane \\(AB\\) forms with another in the horizontal plane \\(BC\\), both these lines being at right angles to the common intersection of the two planes.—The line \\(BA\\) is called the length of the plane, \\(AC\\) its height, and \\(BC\\) the length of its base.\n\n70. In order to understand how the inclined plane acts as a mechanical power, let us suppose it necessary to elevate the weight \\(D\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(A\\). If this weight is lifted by the arms of a man to the point \\(A\\), he must support the whole of the load; but when it is rolled up the inclined plane, a considerable part of its weight is supported upon the plane, and therefore a much smaller force is capable of raising it to \\(A\\).\n\n**Prop. I.**\n\n71. When any weight \\(W\\) is kept in equilibrium upon an inclined plane by a power \\(P\\), the power is to the weight as the sine of the plane's inclination is to the sine of the angle which the direction of the power makes with a line at right angles to the plane.\n\nLet \\(MN\\) be the inclined plane, \\(NO\\) a horizontal line, and \\(MNO\\) the inclination of the plane, and let the weight \\(W\\) be sustained upon \\(MN\\) by means of the power \\(P\\) acting in the direction \\(AE\\). From the point \\(A\\), the centre of gravity of the weight, draw \\(AB\\) perpendicular to the horizontal plane \\(ND\\), and \\(AF\\) perpendicular to \\(MN\\); produce \\(EA\\) till it meets the plane in \\(C\\), and from the point \\(F\\) where the body touches the plane draw \\(FM\\) at right angles to \\(AC\\), and \\(FN\\) at right angles to \\(AB\\). Then, since the whole body may be considered as collected in the centre of gravity \\(A\\), \\(AB\\) will be the direction in which it tends to fall, or the direction of the weight, and \\(EA\\) is the direction of the power; but \\(AF\\) is a lever whose fulcrum is \\(F\\), and since it is acted upon by two forces which are in equilibrium, we shall have (Art. 59.) \\(P : W = FM : Fn\\), that is, as the perpendiculars drawn from the fulcrum to the direction in which the forces act. Now \\(FA\\) being radius, \\(Fn\\) is the fine of the angle \\(FAB\\), and \\(FM\\) is the fine of the angle \\(FAC\\); but \\(FAB\\) is equal to \\(MNO\\) the angle of the plane's inclination, on account of the right angles at \\(F\\) and \\(B\\) and the vertical angles at \\(D\\); and \\(FAC\\) is the angle which the direction of the power makes with a line perpendicular to the plane; therefore \\(P : W\\).\nMECHANICS.\n\nTheory.\n\nas the fine of the plane's inclination, is to the fine of the angle formed by the direction of the power with a line at right angles to the plane.\n\n72. Cor. 1. When the power acts parallel to the plane in the direction AE', P is to W as EA to En, that is, as radius is to the fine of the plane's inclination, or, on account of the similar triangles FA n, MNO, as the length of the plane is to its height. In this case the power acts to the greatest advantage.\n\n73. Cor. 2. When the power acts in a vertical line A t, F m becomes equal to or coincides with F n, and we have P : W = F n : F n, that is, the power in this case fulfils the whole weight.\n\n74. Cor. 3. When the power acts parallel to the base of the plane in the direction A e, P : W = F n : F f = F n : A n.\n\n75. Cor. 4. When the power acts in the direction AF' perpendicular to the plane, it has no power to resist the gravity of the weight; for the perpendicular from the fulcrum F, to which its energy is proportional, vanishes.\n\n76. Cor. 5. Since the body W acts upon the plane in a direction AF perpendicular to the plane's surface, (for its force downwards may be resolved into two, one parallel to the plane, and the other perpendicular to it), and since the reaction of the plane must also be perpendicular to its surface (Dynamics, § 149.), that is, in the direction FA, then, when the direction of the power is A c parallel to the horizon, the power, the weight, and the pressure upon the plane, will be respectively as the height, the base, and the length of the plane. The weight W is acted upon by three forces; by its own gravity in the direction A n, by the reaction of the plane in the direction AF, and by the power P in the direction AF'. Therefore, since these forces are in equilibrium, and since AF is parallel to n F, and F f to A n, the three sides AF, A f, F f, will represent the three forces (Dynamics, § 144.). But the triangle AF f is similar to A n F, that is, to MNO, for it was already shown that the angle n AF is equal to MNO, therefore, since in the triangle AF f, AF represents the pressure on the plane, A f the weight of the body, and F f the energy of the power, these magnitudes will also be represented in the similar triangle MNO by the sides MN, MO, NO.\n\n77. Cor. 6. If a power P and weight W are in equilibrium upon two inclined planes A B, AC; P : W = A B : A C. Let p be the power, which acting on the weight W in a direction parallel to the plane would keep it in equilibrium, then we have p : W = AD : AC; but since the string is equally stretched at every point, the same power p will also fulfil the power P, consequently P : p = A B : A D, and by composition P : W = A B : A C.\n\nPROP. II.\n\n78 If a spherical body is supported upon two inclined planes, the pressures upon these planes will be inversely as the fines of their inclination, while the absolute weight of the body is represented by the fine of the angle formed by the two planes.\n\nLet A C, BC be the two inclined planes, and F the spherical body which they support. The whole of its matter being supposed to be collected in its centre of gravity F, its tendency downwards will be in the vertical line FO. The reaction of the planes upon F is evidently in the direction MF, NF perpendicular to the surface of these planes, and therefore we may consider the body F as influenced by three forces acting in the directions FC, FM, FN; but these forces are represented by the sides of the triangle ABC perpendicular to their directions, (Dynamics, § 144.), consequently the absolute weight of the body F, the pressure upon the plane AC, and the pressure upon the plane BC, are respectively as AB, AC, and BC, that is, as the fines of the angles ACD, ABC, BAC, for in every triangle the sides are as the fines of the opposite angles, or, to express it in symbols, W being the absolute weight of the body, w the pressure on AC, and w' the pressure on BC,\n\n\\[ W : w : w' = AB : AC : BC, \\text{ or} \\]\n\n\\[ W : w : w' = \\sin ACB : \\sin ABC : \\sin BAC. \\]\n\nBut on account of the parallels AB, DF, the angle ABC = BCF, and BAC = ACD, therefore the pressures upon the planes are inversely as the fines of their inclination, the absolute weight of the body being represented by the fine of the angle formed by the surfaces of the two planes.\n\n79. Cor. 1. Since the two sides of a triangle are Corollaries greater than the third, the sum of the relative weights supported by the two planes is greater than the absolute weight of the body.\n\n80. Cor. 2. If the inclination of each plane is 60°, then ACB must also be 60°, and the triangle ABC equilateral, consequently the pressure upon each plane is equal to the absolute weight of the body.\n\n81. Cor. 3. When the inclination of each plane increases, the pressure which each sustains is also increased; and when their inclination diminishes till it almost vanishes, the pressure upon each plane is one half of the absolute weight of the body F.\n\nPROP. III.\n\n82. If a body is raised with an uniform motion along an inclined plane, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the weight is to the power.\n\nLet the weight W be drawn uniformly up the inclined plane AB, from B to D, by a power whose direction is parallel to DH. Upon DB describe the circle BFEDN, cutting BC in E, and having produced HD to F, join FP, FB, FE, and draw DC perpendicular to BD. Now the angles BFD, BED are right (Geometry, Sect. II. Theor. 17.), and therefore, though the power moves through a space equal to BD, yet its velocity in the direction DH is measured by the space FD uniformly described; and for the same reason, though the weight W describes the space BD, yet its velocity in the direction in which it acts, that is, in a vertical direction, is evidently measured by the space DE uniformly described. Then because the triangle DBE is equal to DFE, (Geometry, Sect. II. Theor. 15.) and DBE = DCH, (Geometry, Sect. IV. Theor. 23.) and FDE = DHC, (Geometry, Sect. I. Theor. 21.)\nMECHANICS.\n\nTheory. 21.) The triangles DFE, DHC are similar, and (Geometry, Sect. IV. Theor. 20.) DF : DE = DH : HC. But DH : HC = fin. DCH : fin. HDC, that is, (art. 71.) DF : DE, or the velocity of the power to the velocity of the weight, as W : P. Q. E. D.\n\nScholium.\n\n83. The inclined plane, when combined with other machinery, is often of great use in the elevation of weights. It has been the opinion of some writers, that the huge masses of stone which are found at great altitudes in the splendid remains of Egyptian architecture, were raised upon inclined planes of earth, with the aid of other mechanical powers. This supposition, however, is not probable, as the immense blocks of granite which compose the pyramids of Egypt could not possibly have been raised into their present situation by any combination of the mechanical powers with which we are acquainted.—The inclined plane has been very advantageously employed in the duke of Bridgewater's canal. After this canal has extended 40 miles on the same level, it is joined to a subterraneous navigation about 12 miles long by means of an inclined plane, and this subterraneous portion is again connected by an inclined plane with another subterraneous portion about 166 feet above it. This inclined plane is a stratum of stone which slopes one foot in four, and is about 453 feet long. The boats are conveyed from one portion of the canal to another by means of a windlass, so that a loaded boat descending along the plane turns the axis of the windlass, and raises an empty boat.—A pair of stairs, and a road that is not-level, may be regarded as inclined planes; and hence it is a matter of great importance in carrying a road to the top of a hill, to choose such a line that the declivity may be the least possible. The additional length, which, in order to effect this purpose must sometimes be given to the line of road is a trifling inconvenience, when compared with the advantages of a gentle declivity.\n\nSect. III. On the Rope Machine.\n\n84. Definition. When a body suspended by two or more ropes, is sustained by powers which act by the affiance of these ropes, this assemblage of ropes is called a rope machine.\n\nProp. I.\n\n85. If a weight is in equilibrium with two powers acting on a rope machine, these powers are inversely as the sines of the angles which the ropes form with the direction of the weight.\n\nLet the weight W be suspended from the point B, where the ropes A.B, BC are joined, and let the powers P, p acting at the other extremities of the ropes which pass over the pulleys A, C, keep this weight in equilibrium, we shall have P : p = fin. CBD : fin. ABD. Produce WB to F, and let BD represent the force exerted by W; then by drawing DE parallel to AB, the sides of the triangle BDE will represent the three forces by which the point B is solicited (Dynamics, §. 144), for AB, CB are the directions of the forces P and p. We have therefore P : p = DE : BE; but\n\nDE : BE = fin. DBE : fin. BDE, and on account of Theory, the parallels DE, AB, the angle BDE = ABD, consequently P : p = fin. DBE : fin. BDE.\n\n86. Cor. 1. When the line joining the pulleys is horizontal, as AC, then P : p = FC : FA, for FC and FA are evidently the sines of the angles DBE, BDE.\n\n87. Cor. 2. Any of the powers is to the weight, as the sine of the angle which the other makes with the direction of the weight, is to the sine of the angles which the power makes with one another. For since DB represents the weight, and BE the power P, we have BE : BD = fin. BDE : fin. BED; but on account of the parallels DE, AB, the angle DEB = ABC, the angle made by the direction of the powers, consequently BE : BD, that is, P : W = fin. ABF : fin. ABC. In the same way it may be shown that P : W = fin. CBF : fin. ABC. Hence we have P + p : W = fin. CBF + fin. ABF : fin. ABC, that is, the sum of the sines of the angles which the powers make with the direction of the weight is to the sine of the angle which the powers make with one another.\n\n88. Cor. 3. The two powers P, p, are also directly proportional to the secants of the angles formed by the direction of the powers with the direction of the weight. For since P : p = fin. DBE : fin. BDE, and by the principles of trigonometry, fin. DBE : fin. DBE = cofec. BDE : cofec. DBE, we have P : p = cofec. ABF : cofec. CBF. It is also obvious that P : p as the secants of the angles which these powers form with the horizon, since the angles which they make with the horizon are the complements of the angles which they form with the direction of the weight, and the secant of any angle is just the secant of its complement, therefore P : p = sec. BAF : sec. BCF.\n\nChap. II. On Compound Machines.\n\n89. Definition. Compound machines are those which are composed of two or more simple machines, either of the same or of different kinds. The number of compound machines is unlimited, but those which properly belong to this chapter, are, 1. The wheel and axle; 2. The pulley; 3. The wedge; 4. The screw; and 5. The balance.\n\nSect. I. On the Wheel and Axle.\n\n90. The wheel and axle, or the axis in peritrochion, Fig. 10, is represented in fig. 9, and consists of a wheel AB, and cylinder CD having the same axis, and moving upon pivots E, F placed at the extremity of the cylinder. The power P is most commonly applied to the circumference of the wheel, and acts in the direction of the tangent, while the weight W is elevated by a rope which coils round the cylinder CD in a plane perpendicular to its axis.—In this machine a winch or handle EH is sometimes substituted instead of the wheel, and sometimes the power is applied to the levers S, S fixed in the periphery of the wheel; but in all these forms the principle of the machine remains unaltered.—That the wheel and axle is an assemblage of levers will be obvious, by considering that the very same effect would be produced if a number of levers were to radiate.\nTheory. diate from the centre C, and if a rope carrying the power P were to pass over their extremities, and extricate itself from the defending levers when they come into a horizontal position.\n\n91. Axiom. The effect of the power to turn the cylinder round its axis, is the same at whatever point in the axle it is fixed.\n\nProp. I.\n\n92. In the wheel and axle the power and weight will be in equilibrium, when they are to one another reciprocally as the radii of the circles to which they are applied, or when the power is to the weight as the radius of the axle is to the radius of the wheel.\n\nLet AD be a section of the wheel, and BE a section of the axle or cylinder, and let the power P and weight W act in the directions AP, WP, tangents to the circumferences of the axle and wheel in the points A, B, by means of ropes winding round these circumferences. As the effect is the same according to the axiom, let the power and weight act in the same plane as they appear to do in the figure, then it is obvious that the effort of the power P and weight W will be the same as if they were suspended at the points A, B; consequently the machine may be regarded as a lever AFB, whose centre of motion is F. But since the directions of the power and weight make equal angles with the arms of the lever, we have (Art. 36.) \\( P : W = FB : FA \\), that is, the power is to the weight as the radius of the axle is to the radius of the wheel.\n\nCorollaries.\n\n93. Cor. 1. If the power and weight act obliquely to the arms of the lever in the directions Ap, Bw, draw Fn perpendicular to Ap and Bw, and as in the case of the lever (Art. 51.) there will be an equilibrium when \\( P : W = Fn : Fm \\). Hence the tangential direction is the most advantageous one in which the power can be applied, for FA is always greater than Fn, and the least advantageous direction in which the weight can be applied, for it then opposes the greatest resistance to the power.\n\n94. Cor. 2. If the plane of the wheel is inclined to the axle at any angle \\( x \\), there will be an equilibrium when \\( P : W = \\text{semidiameter of the axle} : \\sin x \\).\n\n95. Cor. 3. When the thickness of the rope is of a sensible magnitude, there will be an equilibrium when the power is to the weight as the sum of the radius of the axle, and half the thickness of its rope, is to the sum of the radius of the wheel and half the thickness of its rope; that is, if T be the thickness of the rope of the wheel, and t the thickness of the rope of the axle, there will be an equilibrium when \\( P : W = FB + \\frac{1}{2}t : FA + \\frac{1}{2}T \\).\n\n96. Cor. 4. If a number of wheels and axles are so combined that the periphery of the first axle may act on the periphery of the second wheel, either by means of a string or by teeth fixed in the peripheries of each, and the periphery of the second axle on the periphery of the third wheel, there will be an equilibrium when the power is to the weight as the product of the radii of all the axles is to the product of the radii of all the wheels. This corollary may be demonstrated by the same reasoning which is used in Art. 63. for the combination of Levers.\n\n97. Cor. 5. In a combination of wheels, where the motion is communicated by means of teeth, the axle is called the pinion. Since the teeth therefore must be nearly of the same size, both in the wheel and pinion, the number of teeth in each will be as their circumferences, or as their radii; and consequently in the combination mentioned in the preceding corollary, the power will be to the weight, in the case of an equilibrium, as the product of the number of teeth in all the pinions is to the product of the number of teeth in all the wheels.\n\nProp. II.\n\n98. In the wheel and axle the velocity of the weight is to the velocity of the power as the power is to the weight.\n\nIf the power is made to rise through a space equal to the circumference of the wheel, the weight will evidently describe a space equal to the circumference of the axle. Hence, calling V the velocity of the power, v that of the weight, C the circumference of the wheel, and c that of the axle, we have \\( V : v = C : c \\). But by the proposition \\( P : W = c : C \\), therefore \\( P : W = v : V \\).\n\nScholium.\n\n99. The construction of the main-spring box of the fusee of a watch round which the chain is coiled, is a beautiful illustration of the principle of the wheel and axle. The spring-box may be considered as the wheel, and the fusee the axle or pinion to which the chain communicates the motion of the box. The power resides in the spring wound round an axis in the centre of the box, and the weight is applied to the lower circumference of the fusee. As the force of the spring is greatest when it is newly wound up, and gradually decreases as it unwinds itself, it is necessary that the fusee should have different radii, so that the chain may act upon the smallest part of the fusee when its force is greatest, and upon the largest part of the fusee when its force is least, for the equable motion of the watch requires that the inequality in the action of the spring should be counteracted so as to produce an uniform effect. In order to accomplish this, the general outline of the surface of the fusee must be an Apollonian hyperbola in which the ordinates are inversely as their respective abscissae. For further information on this subject, see Recherches des Mathemat. par M. Parent, tom. ii. p. 678.; Traité d'Horlogerie, par M. Berthoud, tom. i. chap. 26.; and Traité de Mécanique, par M. de la Hire, prop. 72.\n\nSect. II. On the Pulley.\n\n100. Definition.—The pulley is a machine composed of a wheel with a groove in its circumference, pulley, and a rope which passes round this groove. The wheel moves on an axis whose extremities are supported on a kind of frame called the block, to which is generally suspended the weight to be raised. A system of pulleys is called a muffle, which is either fixed or moveable according as the block which contains the pulleys is fixed or moveable.\n**Proposition I.**\n\n101. In a single pulley, or system of pulleys where the different portions of the rope are parallel to each other, and where one extremity of it is fixed, there is an equilibrium when the power is to the weight as unity is to the number of the portions of the rope which support the weight.\n\n102. **Case 1.** In the single fixed pulley AA, let the power P and weight W be equal, and act against each other by means of the rope PBAW, passing over the pulley AA; then it is obvious that whatever force is exerted by P in the direction PBA, the same force must be exerted in the opposite direction WBA, consequently these equal and opposite forces must be in equilibrium; and as the weight is supported only by one rope, the proposition is demonstrated, for \\( P : W = 1 : 1 \\).\n\n103. **Case 2.** In the fixed moveable pulley, where the rope, fastened at H, goes beneath the moveable pulley D and over the fixed pulley C, the weight to be raised is suspended from the centre of the pulley D by the block P, and the power is applied at P' in the direction PE. Now it is evident that the portions CF, HGD of the rope sustain the weight W, and as they are equally stretched in every point, each must sustain one half of W; but (Case 1.) in the single pulley C the rope CEP sustains a weight equal to what the rope CF sustains; that is, it sustains one-half of W. Consequently \\( P = \\frac{1}{2} W \\), or \\( W = 2P \\), when there is an equilibrium; and since the weight W is supported by two strings, we have \\( P : W = 1 : 2 \\).\n\n104. **Case 3.** When the same rope passes round a number of pulleys, the ropes which support the weight W are evidently equally stretched in every part, and therefore each of them sustains the same weight. Consequently if there be ten ropes supporting the weight, each sustains \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) part of the weight, and therefore \\( P = \\frac{1}{10} W \\), or \\( W = 10P \\), which gives us \\( P : W = 1 : 10 \\).—The pulley in fig. 15, is the patent pulley invented by Mr White, in which the lateral friction and shaking motion is considerably removed.\n\n**Proposition II.**\n\n105. In a system of n moveable pulleys suspended by separate and parallel ropes, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W = 1 : 2^n \\); that is, if there are 4 pulleys \\( n = 4 \\), and \\( P : W = 1 : 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\), or \\( P : W = 1 : 16 \\).\n\nThis system is represented in fig. 17, where the rope which carries the power P passes over the fixed pulley M, and beneath the moveable pulley A, to the hook E where it is fixed. Another rope fixed at A passes over B and is fixed at F, and so on with the rest. Then by Art. 103.\n\n\\[\nP : \\text{the weight at } A = 1 : 2 \\\\\n\\text{The weight at } A : \\text{the weight at } B = 1 : 2 \\\\\n\\text{The weight at } B : \\text{the weight at } C = 1 : 2 \\\\\n\\text{The weight at } C : \\text{the weight at } D \\text{ or } W = 1 : 2 ; \\text{ and therefore by composition} \\\\\nP : W = 1 : 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\text{ or } P : W = 1 : 16. Q.E.D.\n\\]\n\n**Proposition III.**\n\n106. In a system of moveable pulleys whose number is n, suspended by separate and parallel ropes, whose extremities are fixed to the weight W, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W = 1 : 2^n \\). Fig. 18.\n\nIn this system of pulleys, the rope which sustains the power P passes over the pulley C, and is fixed to the weight at D. Another rope attached to the pulley C passes over the pulley B and is fixed to the weight at E, and a third rope fastened to B passes over A and is fixed at F. Then it is manifest that the rope CD sustains a weight equal to P; and since the pulley C is pulled downward with a weight equal to 2P, the rope BC must support a weight equal to 2P, and the rope B the same weight; consequently the rope AB sustains 4P. The whole weight therefore is \\( P + 2P + 4P \\), and hence \\( P : W = P : 2P + 4P \\), or \\( P : W = 1 : 1 + 2 + 4 \\&c. \\) to n terms, so that \\( P : W = 1 : 2^n - 1 \\).\n\n**Proposition IV.**\n\n107. In the system of pulleys represented in fig. 19, fig. 19, and called a Spanish barton, in which two pulleys are supported by one rope, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W = 1 : 4 \\).\n\nIn this combination of pulleys, the rope AB which supports the power P passes over the moveable pulley A, and beneath C towards H, where it is fixed. Another rope, attached to the pulley A, passes over the fixed pulley B, and is fastened at E to the pulley C, which supports the weight W. Then, since the rope AP supports 1 pound, the rope AC also supports 1 pound, and therefore the pulley A, or the rope BA, is pulled down with a force of 2 pounds. But the rope BDE is equally stretched with BA, consequently the pulley C to which DE is attached, is pulled upwards with a force of 2 pounds. Now the rope AC supporting 1 pound, the rope GH must likewise support 1 pound, consequently, since DE sustains 2 pounds, AC 1 pound, and HG 1 pound, they will together sustain W=4 pounds, and therefore \\( P : W = 1 : 4 \\).\n\n**Proposition V.**\n\n108. In the system of pulleys represented in fig. fig. 20, called a Spanish barton, where two pulleys are supported by one rope, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W = 1 : 5 \\).\n\nIn this system the rope PB passes over B round C, and is fixed at E. Another rope attached to B passes round AF and is fixed at I to the pulley CD, which carries the weight W. Now the rope BP being stretched with a force of 1 pound, the ropes BGC, CDE are also stretched with a force of 1 pound each, and the pulley CD is pulled upwards with a force of 2 pounds. But since the three ropes BP, ED, and GC, are each stretched with a force of 1 pound, the pulley B and the rope BA, upon which they all act in one direction, must be pulled down with a force of 3 pounds. Now the rope EI is equally stretched with BA, consequently it will draw the pulley CD upwards with a force of 3 pounds.\npounds, and since it is drawn upwards by the ropes CG, DF with a force of two pounds, the whole force will sustain W = 5 pounds; but this force of 5 pounds is by the hypothesis in equilibrium with P or 1 pound, consequently P : W = 1 : 5.\n\nProp. VI.\n\n109. When the ropes are not parallel, and when two powers are in equilibrium with a weight by means of a pulley, and have their directions at equal angles to the direction of the weight, each of these powers is to the weight as the radius of the pulley is to the chord of that portion of the pulley's circumference with which the rope is in contact.\n\nLet the weight W suspended from C be sustained in equilibrium by two powers P, p, which act by a rope PCFE, passing over the pulley CHEF, and touching the arch CFE of its circumference. Then since the angles PFD, pWD are equal, and the powers P, p in equilibrium, P must be equal to p; and making WA = WB, and drawing AI parallel to PW, and BI parallel to pW; WB, BI, WI will respectively represent the forces P, p, W or P : p : W = WB : BI : WI.\n\nDynamics Art. 144. Now the triangles WBI, CDE having their respective sides at right angles to each other, are similar; consequently WB : BI : WI = CD : DE : EC, that is, P : p : W = CD : DE : EC; but CD, DE are equal to radius, and EC is obviously the chord of the arch CFE, therefore P : W or p : W as radius is to the chord of the arch with which the rope is in contact.\n\n110. Cor. 1. Any of the powers is also to the weight as radius is to twice the cosine of the angle which either rope makes with the direction of the weight. For since CG is the cosine of DCG, and since CE is double of CG, CE is equal to 2 cosine DCG = 2 Cos PFD; but P : W = CD : CE, hence we have by substituting the preceding value of CE, P : W = CD or radius : 2 Cos PFD.\n\nScholium.\n\n111. By means of this proposition and corollary, the proportion between the powers and the weight in the various systems of pulleys, represented in figs. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, when the ropes are not parallel, may be easily found.\n\nProp. VII.\n\n112. In a system of moveable pulleys, where each has a separate rope, and where the ropes are not parallel, there is an equilibrium when the power is to the weight as radius is to the cosines of half the angles made by the rope of each pulley, multiplied into that power of 2 whose exponent is the number of pulleys.\n\nLet the power P sustain the weight W by means of the pulleys A, B, C; let P, p, π be the different powers which support the pulleys A, B, C, and let MAP, NBA, RCB be the angles formed by the ropes. Then, by the last proposition,\n\n\\[ P : p = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\text{col. MAP} \\]\n\\[ p : π = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\text{col. NBA} \\]\n\\[ π : W = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\text{col. RCB}, \\text{consequently} \\]\n\n\\[ P : W = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\text{col. MAP} \\times 2 \\text{col. NBA} \\times 2 \\text{col. RCB}, \\]\n\nor, which is the same thing,\n\n\\[ P : W = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times \\text{col. MAP} \\times \\text{col. NBA} \\times \\text{col. RCB}. \\]\n\nProp. VIII.\n\n113. In a single pulley, or in a combination of pulleys, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the weight is to the power.\n\n114. Case 1. In the single fixed pulley, it is obvious, that if the weight W is raised uniformly one inch, the power D will also describe one inch, consequently velocity of P : velocity of W = W : P.\n\n115. Case 2. In the single moveable pulley, when Fig. 13, the weight W is raised one inch, the ropes become one inch shorter; and since the rope has always the same weight, the power must describe two inches, therefore velocity P : velocity W = W : P.\n\n116. Case 3. In the combination of pulleys, in Figs. 14, 15, figs. 14, 15, 16, when the weight rises one inch, each 16, of the four strings becomes an inch shorter, so that P must describe four inches, as the length of the rope is invariable; consequently velocity P : velocity W = W : P.\n\n117. Case 4. In the system exhibited in fig. 17, it Fig. 17, is evident, that when the weight W rises one inch, the rope DC is lengthened two inches, the rope CB four inches, the rope BA eight inches, and the rope AFP, to which the power is suspended, 16 inches; so that since the power of this pulley is as 16 to 1, we have velocity P : velocity W = W : P.\n\n118. Case 5. In the combination of pulleys, represented in fig. 18, when the weight W rises one inch, all the three ropes CD, BE, AF are each shortened one inch. But while CD shortens one inch, CP becomes one inch longer; while BE shortens one inch, BC becomes one inch longer, and CP two inches longer (art. 110.); and while AF shortens one inch, AB becomes one inch longer, BC two inches longer, and CP four inches longer; therefore CP is lengthened altogether seven inches, and as the power of the pulley is as 7 to 1, we have, as before, velocity P : velocity W = W : P.\n\n119. Case 5. In the system of pulleys, called the Spanish barton, fig. 19, when the weight W rises one inch, the three ropes AC, DE, HG are each shortened one inch. By the shortening of HG, CA one inch each, the rope AP is lengthened two inches; and by the shortening of DE, one inch, BA is lengthened one inch, and AP two inches (art. 115.); consequently, since AP is lengthened in all four inches, and since the power of the pulleys is four, we have velocity P : velocity W = W : P.\n\n120. Case 6. In the other Spanish barton, in fig. 20, Fig. 20, when the weight is elevated one inch, the three ropes DE, IF, CG are each one inch shorter. While ED, and CG shorten one inch each, BP is lengthened two inches,\nMECHANICS.\n\nTheory. inches; and while IF becomes one inch shorter, AB becomes one inch longer; but when AB is lengthened one inch, BP becomes one inch longer, and ED, CG one inch shorter each, and by this shortening of ED, CG, the rope B is lengthened two inches, therefore, since the rope BP is lengthened altogether five inches, and since the pulleys have a power of five, we have, as formerly, velocity P : velocity W = W : P.\n\nSect. III. On the Wedge.\n\n121. Definition. A wedge is a machine composed of two inclined planes with their bases in contact; or, more properly, it is a triangular prism, generated by the motion of a triangle, parallel to itself, along a straight line passing through the vertex of one of its angles. The wedge is called ifofceles, rectangular, or scalene, according as the triangle ABC by which the wedge is generated, is an ifofceles, a rectangular or a scalene triangle. The part AB is called the head or back of the wedge, DC its altitude, and AC, BC its faces.—The wedge is generally employed for cleaving wood, or for quarrying stones; but all cutting instruments, such as knives, swords, chisels, teeth, &c., properly belong to this mechanical power, when they act in a direction at right angles to the cutting surface; for when they act obliquely, in which case their power is increased, their operation resembles more the action of a saw.\n\nProp. I.\n\n122. If each of the faces of an ifofceles wedge, which are perfectly smooth, meet with an equal resistance from forces acting at equal angles of inclination to their faces, and if a power act perpendicularly upon the back, these forces will be in equilibrium, when the power upon the back is to the sum of the resistances upon the sides, as the sine of half the angle of the wedge, multiplied by the sine of the angle at which the resisting forces act upon its faces, is to the square of radius.\n\nLet ABC be the wedge, AC, BC its acting faces, and MD, ND the directions in which the resisting forces act upon their faces, forming with them the equal angles DMA, DNB. Draw CD, DF, DE at right angles to three sides of the wedge, and join F, E meeting CD in G. On account of the equal triangles CAD, CDB (Euclid, Book i. Prop. 26.) AD = DB; and in the equal triangles ADM, BDN, MD = ND. In the same way DF = DE and AF = BE, therefore CF = CE. But in the triangles CFG, CEG there are two sides FC, CG equal to EC, CG, and the angle FCG = ECG, consequently FG = GE, and FGC, ABC are both right angles, therefore FE is parallel to AB.—Now the force MID is resolvable into DF, FM, of which FM has no effect upon the wedge. But, as the effective force FD is not in direct opposition to the perpendicular force exerted on the back of the wedge, we may resolve it into the two forces FG, GD, of which GD acts in direct opposition to the power, while FG acts in a direction parallel to the back of the wedge. In the same way it may be shown that EG, GD are the only effective forces which result from the force ND. But the forces FG, EG being equal and opposite, destroy each other; consequently 2 GD is the force which opposes that which is exerted upon the back of the wedge, and the wedge will be kept at rest if the force upon the back is equal to 2 GD; that is, when the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances upon the faces as 2 GD is to MD + ND, or as 2 GD : 2 DM, or as GD is to DM.\n\nNow\n\n\\[ \\text{DG} : \\text{DF} = \\text{fin. DFG : radius}, \\text{or as } (\\text{Euclid, vi. 8.}) \\]\n\nfin. DCF : radius, and\n\n\\[ \\text{DF} : \\text{MD} = \\text{fin. DMF : radius}; \\text{therefore by composition,} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{DG} : \\text{MD} = \\text{fin. DCF} \\times \\text{fin. DMF : rad.} \\times \\text{rad. or rad.}^2. \\]\n\nBut, DG : MD as the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances, therefore the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances as fin. DCF × fin. DMF is to the square of the radius.\n\n123. Cor. 1. If the direction of the resisting forces is perpendicular to the faces of the wedge, DMF becomes a right angle, and therefore its fine is equal to radius. Consequently we have, in this case, the force upon the back to the sum of the resistances, as fin. DCF × rad. is to radius², that is, as fin. DCF is to radius, or as AD half the back of the wedge is to AC the length of the wedge.\n\n124. Cor. 2. In the particular case in the proposition, it is obvious that the forces MF, NE are not opposed by any other forces, and therefore the force upon the back will not sustain the resisting forces; but in the case in cor. 2. the forces MF, NE vanish, and therefore the other forces will sustain each other.\n\n125. Cor. 3. If the resisting forces act in a direction perpendicular to AB, the angle DMF becomes equal to ACD, and therefore the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances as fin. ACD² is to radius², that is, as the square of AD half the back of the wedge is to the square of AC the length of the wedge.\n\n126. Cor. 4. When the direction of the resistances is parallel to the back of the wedge, the angle of inclination DMC becomes the complement of the semi-angle of the wedge, and therefore the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances as the fin. ACD × cos. ACD is to the square of the radius, that is, as DA × DC is to AC². But in the similar triangles DAF, DAC, we have DF : DA = DC : AC, and DF × AC = DA × DC, consequently the force upon the back of the wedge is to the sum of the resistances as DF × AC is to AC², that is, as DF : AC.\n\nProp. II.\n\n127. If, on account of the friction of the wedge, or any other cause, the resistances are wholly effective, that is, if the resisting surfaces adhere to the places to which they are applied without sliding, there will be an equilibrium, when the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances, as the sine of the acute angle which the direction of the resisting forces makes with the back of the wedge is to radius.\n\nJoin MN, which will cut DC perpendicularly at the point\npoint H. Then, since the forces MD, ND are resolvable into MH, HD and into NH, HD, and since MH, HN destroy each other, the force upon the back is fulfilled by 2 HD. Consequently, the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances as 2 HD is to 2 MD, or as HD is to MD. But the angle ADM, which the direction of the forces makes with the back of the wedge, is equal to DMN, and HD is the sine of that angle, MD being radius, therefore the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances as sin. ADM : radius.\n\nQ. E. D.\n\nCorollaries.\n\n128. Cor. 1. Since the angle AMD = MDC + MCD, the angle MDC is the difference between MCD the semiangle of the wedge, and AMD the angle which the direction of the resisting forces makes with the face of the wedge, and since HD is the cosine of that angle, MD being radius, we have the force upon the back to the sum of the resistances, as the cosine of the difference between the semiangle of the wedge and the angle which the direction of the resisting forces makes with the face of the wedge, is to radius.\n\nProp. III.\n\n129. When there is an equilibrium between three forces acting perpendicularly upon the sides of a wedge of any form, the forces are to one another as the sides of the wedge.\n\nThis is obvious from Dynamics, § 144, Cor. 2, where it is shown that when three forces are in equilibrium, they are proportional to the sides of a triangle, which are respectively perpendicular to their directions.\n\nProp. IV.\n\n130. When the power acting upon the back of a wedge is in equilibrium with the resistances opposed to it, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the resistance as the resistance is to the power.\n\nProduce DM to K, and draw CK perpendicular to DK. Then, by Art. 122, the power is to the resistance as MD : DH. Let the wedge be moved uniformly from D to C, and DK is the space uniformly described by the resisting force in the direction in which it acts; therefore, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the resistance as DC : DK; that is, on account of the equiangular triangles DHM, DKC, as MD : DH; that is, as the resistance is to the power.\n\nSect. IV. On the Screw.\n\n131. Definition. A screw is a cylinder with an inclined plane wrapped round it, in such a manner, that the surface of the plane is oblique to the axis of the cylinder, and forms the same angle with it in every part of the cylindrical surface. When the inclined plane winds round the exterior surface of a solid cylinder, it is called a male screw; but when it is fixed on the interior circumference of a cylindrical tube, it is called a female screw. In the female screw, the spiral grooves formed by the inclined plane on the surface of the cylindrical tube, must be equal in breadth to the inclined plane in the male screw, in order that the one may move freely in the other. By attending to the mode in which the spiral threads are formed by the circumvolution of the inclined plane, it will appear, that if one complete revolution of the inclined plane is developed, its altitude will be to its base as the distance between the threads is to the circumference of the screw.\n\nThus, let \\(a b c\\) (fig. 4.) be the inclined plane, whose base is \\(ac\\) and altitude \\(be\\), and let it be wrapped round the cylinder MN (fig. 5.) of such a size that the points \\(a, c\\) may coincide. The surface \\(ab\\) of the plane (fig. 4.) will evidently form the spiral thread \\(ad'eb\\) (fig. 5.), and \\(ab\\) the distance between the threads will be equal to \\(bc\\) (fig. 4.) the altitude of the plane, and the circumference of the screw MN will be equal to \\(ac\\) the base of the plane. If any body, therefore, is made to rise along the plane \\(ad'eb\\) in fig. 5., or along the spiral thread of the screw, by a force acting in a direction parallel to \\(ad'eb\\), there will be the same proportion between the power and the resistance as if the body ascended the plane \\(abe\\) (fig. 4.).\n\n132. A male screw with triangular threads is represented by AB (fig. 6.), and its corresponding female screw by \\(AB'\\) (fig. 7.). A male screw with quadrangular threads is exhibited in fig. 8., and the female screw Fig. 8., in which it works in fig. 9. The friction is considerably less in quadrangular than in triangular threads, though, when the screw is made of wood, the triangular threads should be preferred. When the screws are metallic and large, the threads should be quadrangular; but the triangular form is preferable in small screws. When the screw is employed in practice, the power is always applied to the extremity of a lever fixed in its head. This is shown in fig. 10., where \\(AB\\) is the lever acting Fig. 10. upon the screw BC, which works in a female screw in the block F, and exerts its force in bending the spring CD.\n\nProp. I.\n\n133. If the screw is employed to overcome any resistance, there will be an equilibrium when the power is to the resistance as the distance between two adjacent threads is to the circumference described by the power.\n\nLet FAK be a section of the screw represented in fig. Fig. 11. 8., perpendicular to its axis; CD a portion of the inclined plane which forms the spiral thread, and P the power, which, when applied at C in the plane ACF, will be in equilibrium with a weight upon the inclined plane CD. Then, in the inclined plane, when the direction of the power is parallel to the base, we have (Art. 72.) \\(P : W\\), as the altitude of the plane is to the base, or (Art. 131.) as the distance between two threads is to the whole circumference FKCF. If we suppose another power \\(P'\\) to act at the end of the lever \\(AB\\), and describe the arch HBG, and that this power produces the same effect at B as the power \\(P\\) did at C, then (Art. 36.), we have \\(P' : P = CA : BA\\), that is, as FKCF is to the circumference HBG; but it was shown before, that \\(P : W\\) as the distance between two contiguous threads is to FKCF; therefore, by composition, \\(P' : W\\) as the distance between two threads is to HBG or the circumference of a circle whose radius is \\(AB\\).\n\nQ. E. D.\n\n134. Cor. 1. It is evident from the proposition that\nMECHANICS.\n\nTheory. The power does not in the least depend upon the size of the cylinder FCK, but that it increases with the distance of that point from the centre A, to which the power is applied, and also with the shortness of the distance between the threads. Therefore, if P, p be the powers applied to two different screws, D, d the distances of these powers from the axis, and T, t the distances between the threads; their energy in overcoming a given resistance will be directly as their distances from the axis, and inversely as the distances of their threads, that is, \\( \\frac{P}{p} = \\frac{D}{d} \\times \\frac{T}{t} \\), or P varies as \\( \\frac{D}{T} \\).\n\nPROP. II.\n\n135. In the endless screw, there will be an equilibrium when the power is to the weight, as the distance of the threads multiplied by the radius of the axle, is to the distance of the power from the axis of the screw multiplied by the radius of the wheel.\n\nFig. 12. The endless screw, which is represented in fig. 12, consists of a screw EF, so combined with the wheel and axle ABC, that the threads of the screw may work in teeth fixed in the periphery of the wheel, and thus communicate the power exerted at the handles or winches P, p. Let W' represent the power produced by the screw at the circumference of the wheel; then, by the last proposition, P : W' as the distance between the threads is to the distance of P from the axis of the screw; but (Art. 92.) in the wheel and axle W' : W as the radius of the axle is to the radius of the wheel; therefore, by composition, P : W as the distances of the threads multiplied by the radius of the axle C, is to the distance of the power P from the axis multiplied by the radius of the wheel AB.\n\nPROP. III.\n\n136. When there is an equilibrium in the screw, the velocity of the weight is to the velocity of the power, as the power is to the weight.\n\nFig. 11. It is obvious from fig. 11. that while the power describes the circumference of the circle HBG uniformly, the weight uniformly rises through a space equal to the distance between two adjacent threads; therefore, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the distance between the threads is to the arch described by the power, that is, (by Art. 133.), as the weight is to the power.\n\nPROP. IV.\n\n137. To explain the construction and advantages of Mr Hunter's double screw *.\n\nLet the screw CD work in the plate of metal BA, and have n threads in an inch: the cylinder CD, of which this screw is formed, is a hollow tube, which is also formed into a screw, having \\( \\frac{n+1}{n} \\) threads in an inch, and into this female screw is introduced a male screw DE, having, of course, \\( \\frac{n+1}{n} \\) threads in an inch. The screw DE is prevented from moving round with CD by the frame ABGF and the cross bar ab, but is permitted to ascend and descend without a motion of rotation. Then, by a revolution of the screw CD, the other screw DE will rise through a space equal to \\( \\frac{1}{n+1} \\times n \\), and if the circumference described by the lever CK be m inches, we shall have \\( P : W = \\frac{1}{n+1} \\times n : m \\); or \\( P : W = \\frac{1}{m} : \\frac{n+1}{n} \\).\n\n138. This reasoning will be more perspicuous by supposing n, or the number of threads in CD, to be 12, and \\( \\frac{n+1}{n} \\) or the number of threads in DE, will consequently be 13. Let us suppose that the handle CK is turned round 12 times, the screw CD will evidently ascend through the space of an inch, and if the screw DE is permitted to have a motion of rotation along with CD, it will also advance an inch. Let the screw DE be now moved backwards by 12 revolutions, it will evidently describe a space of \\( \\frac{1}{13} \\) of an inch, and the consequence of both these motions will be that the point E is advanced \\( \\frac{1}{13} \\) of an inch. But, since DE is prevented from moving round with CD, the same effect will be produced as if it had moved 12 times round with CD, and had been turned 12 times backwards; that is, it will in both cases have advanced \\( \\frac{1}{13} \\) of an inch. Since, therefore, it has advanced \\( \\frac{1}{13} \\) of an inch in 12 turns, it will describe only \\( \\frac{1}{13} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{13} \\), or \\( \\frac{1}{169} \\) of an inch uniformly at one turn; but if the length of the lever CK is 8 inches, its extremity K will describe, in the same time, a space equal to \\( 16 \\times 3.1416 = 50.2656 \\) inches, the circumference of the circle described by K; therefore the velocity of the weight is to the velocity of the power, as \\( \\frac{1}{169} \\) of an inch is to 50.2656 inches, or as 1 is to 7841.4336, that is, (Art. 136.) \\( P : W = 1 : 7841.4336 \\). Hence the force of this double screw is much greater than that of the common screw, for a common one with a lever 8 inches long must have 156 threads in an inch to give the same power, which would render it too weak to overcome any considerable resistance.\n\n139. Mr Hunter proposes * to connect with his * Phil. Trans.* vol. lxxi. p. 65 double screws, a wheel and a lantern, which are put in motion by a winch or handle. The power of this compound machine is so great, that a man, by exerting a force of 32 pounds at the winch, will produce an effect of 172100 pounds; and if we suppose \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of this effect to be destroyed by friction, there will remain an effect of 57600 pounds.—In some screws it would be advantageous, instead of perforating the male screw CD, to have two cylindrical screws of different kinds at different parts of the same axis.\n\nSCHOLIUM.\n\n140. The screw is of extensive use as a mechanical power, when a very great pressure is required, and is very successfully employed in the printing press. In the press which is used for coining money, the power of the screw is advantageously combined with an impulsive force, which is conveyed to the screw by the intervention of a lever. The screw is also employed for raising water, in which form it is called the screw of Archimedes (Hydrodynamics, §. 328); and it has been lately employed in the flour mills in America for pulling the flour which comes from the millstones, to the end of a long trough, from which it is conveyed to other parts.\nMechanics.\n\nTheory of the machinery, in order to undergo the remaining processes. In this case, the spiral threads are very large in proportion to the cylinder on which they are fixed.\n\n141. As the lever attached to the extremity of the screw moves through a very great space when compared with the velocity of its other extremity, or of any body which it puts in motion; the screw is of immense use in subdividing any space into a great number of minute parts. Hence it is employed in the engines for dividing mathematical instruments, and in those which have been recently used in the art of engraving. It is likewise of great use in the common wire micrometer, and in the divided object-glass micrometer, instruments to which the science of astronomy has been under great obligations. See Micrometer.\n\nSect. V. On the Balance.\n\n142. Definition. The balance, in a mathematical sense, is a lever of equal arms, for determining the weights of bodies.—The physical balance is represented in fig. 1, where FA, FB are the equal arms of the balance, F its centre of motion situated a little above the centre of gravity of the arms, FD the handle which always retains a vertical position, P, W the scales suspended from the points A, B, and CF the tongue or index of the balance, which is exactly perpendicular to the beam AB, and is continued below the centre of motion, so that the momentum of the part below F is equal and opposite to the momentum of that part which is above it. Since the handle FD, suspended by the hook H, must hang in a vertical line, the tongue CF will also be vertical when its position coincides with that of FD, and consequently the beam AB, which is perpendicular to CF, must be horizontal. When this happens, the weights in the scale are evidently equal.\n\nProp. I.\n\n143. To determine the conditions of equilibrium in a physical balance.\n\nLet AOB be the beam, whose weight is S, and let P, Q be equal weights expressed by the letter p, and placed in the scales, whose weights are L and L'. Let O be the centre of motion, and g the centre of gravity of the whole beam, when unloaded, we shall have in the case of an equilibrium,\n\n\\[ \\rho + L \\times AC = \\rho + L' \\times BC + S \\times Cc; \\] for since S is the weight of the beam and g its centre of gravity, its mechanical energy in acting against the weights \\( \\rho + L \\) is \\( S \\times Cc \\), the distance of its centre of gravity from the vertical line passing through the centre of motion O.\n\nII. But since \\( AC = BC; \\quad \\rho \\times AC - \\rho \\times BC = 0. \\)\n\nThen, after transposition, take this from the equation in Prop. I, and we shall have,\n\n\\[ L \\times BC - L \\times AC + S \\times Cc; \\text{ or } L - \\frac{S \\times Cc}{AC}. \\]\n\nLet us now suppose that a small weight w is placed in the scale L, the line AB which joins the points of suspension will be no longer horizontal, but will assume an inclined position. Let \\( BA = \\phi \\) be the angle which the beam makes with the direction of gravity. Then by resolving the weight of the beam which acts in the direction \\( O \\alpha \\), the parts \\( \\frac{OG}{Og} \\) and \\( \\frac{Gg}{Og} \\) will be in equilibrium, and we shall have,\n\n\\[ \\rho + L \\times AO \\times Sin. \\alpha \\times AO + S \\times OG \\times Sin. \\phi = \\rho + L + w \\times BO \\times Sin. ABO + S \\times Cc \\times Cos. \\phi. \\]\n\nBut since the sines and cosines of any angles, are the same as the sines and cosines of their supplement, we have,\n\n\\[ \\rho + L \\times AC \\times Cos. \\phi - OC \\times Sin. \\phi + S \\times OG \\times Sin. \\phi = \\rho + L + w \\times AC \\times Cos. \\phi + OC \\times Sin. \\phi + S \\times Cc \\times Cos. \\phi. \\]\n\nHence by No III. we have,\n\nVI. Tang. \\( \\phi = \\frac{w \\times AC}{2\\rho + L + w \\times OC + S \\times OG} \\)\n\nBut the force w, with which the balance attempts to recover its horizontal situation, is the excess of the momenta with which one arm is moved, above the momenta with which the other arm is moved, therefore\n\n\\[ v = 2\\rho + L + w \\times OC \\times Sin. \\phi + S \\times OG \\times Sin. \\phi. \\]\n\n144. A more extended illustration of these conditions of equilibrium will be found in an excellent paper by Euler, published in the Comment. Petropol. tom. x. p. i. and in another memoir upon the same subject by Kuhne in the Verfische der naturforchende gesellschaft in Dantzig, tom. i. p. 1.—See also Hennert's Curvis Matheseos applicatae, tom. i. §. 123. From the preceding formulae, the following practical corollaries may be deduced.\n\n145. Cor. 1. The arms of the balance must be exactly equal in length, which is known by changing the weights in the scales; for if the equilibrium continues, the arms must be equal.\n\n146. Cor. 2. The sensibility of the balance increases with the length of the arms.\n\n147. Cor. 3. If the centre of motion coincides with the point C and the centre of gravity, the balance will be in equilibrium in any position, and the smallest weight added to one of the scales will bring the beam into a horizontal position. The centre of motion, therefore, should not coincide with the centre of gravity.\n\n148. Cor. 4. If the centre of motion is in the line which joins the points of suspension, the accuracy of the balance will be increased. The excess of the weights may be easily determined by the inclination of the beam, pointed out by the tongue or index upon a circular arch fixed to the handle, or more accurately by means of two divided arches fixed near the points of suspension, on a stand independent of the balance. When the value of one of these divisions is determined experimentally, the rest are easily found, being proportional to the tangents of the inclination of the beam.\nMechanics.\n\n149. Cor. 5. The sensibility of the balance will increase, the nearer that the centre of gravity approaches to the centre of motion.\n\n150. Cor. 6. If the centre of gravity is above the centre of motion, the balance is useless.\n\nScholium.\n\n151. A balance with all the properties mentioned in the preceding corollaries, has been invented by M. Kuhne, and described in the work already quoted (Art. 144). It is so contrived that the points of suspension may be placed either above the centre of motion or below it, or in the line of its axis: the beam is furnished with an index, which points out the proportion of the weights upon a divided scale, and the friction of the axis is diminished by the application of friction wheels.\n\n152. In order to get rid of the difficulties which attend the construction of the tongue, the handle, and the arms of the balance, M. Magellan invented a very accurate and moveable one, in which there is no handle, and where one of the arms acts as a tongue. The body to be weighed and the counterpoise are placed in the same scale, so that it is of little consequence whether the arms of the balance are equal or not. In this balance the centre of motion can be moved to the smallest distance from the centre of gravity. See Journal de Physique, Jan. 1751, tom. xvii. p. 43.\n\n153. The balance invented by Ludlam, and described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1765, No. 55, depends upon Archimedes's property of the lever, which we have explained in Art. 65. The angular lever AFB, in which AF = FB, is moveable round f, which is equidistant from A and B. The weight P is suspended by a thread from A, and the body W, which is to be weighed, is suspended by a thread from B. Hence it is obvious, that with different bodies the lever AFB will have different degrees of inclination, and the index or tongue LFf, which is perpendicular to AB, will form different angles ZFL, Ff with the line of direction ZFb. Now, by Art. 57, and by substituting for bB, bA the sines of the angles fFB, FfA, to which they are proportional, and also by taking instead of FfB the difference of the angles fFB, fFB, and instead of AFb, the sum of these angles, we shall have\n\n\\[ \\text{Tang.} fFb = \\frac{P - W}{P + W} \\times \\text{Tang.} \\frac{AFB}{2}, \\]\n\nwhence, by transposition, and by Geometry, Theor. VIII. Sect. IV.\n\n\\[ P + W : P - W = \\text{Tang.} \\frac{AFB}{2} : \\text{Tang.} fFb. \\]\n\nHence, when the angle formed by the arms of the balance, and the angle of aberration fFb or ZFL, are known, the weights may be found, and vice versa.\n\nChap. IV. On the Centre of Inertia, or Gravity.\n\n154. Definition.—The centre of inertia, or the centre of gravity, of any body or system of bodies, is that point upon which the body or system of bodies, when influenced only by the force of gravity, will be in equilibrium in every position. The centre of inertia of plane surfaces bounded by right lines, and also of some solids may be easily determined by the common geometry.\n\nThe application of the method of fluxions, however, to this branch of mechanics is so simple and beautiful, that we shall also avail ourselves of its assistance. The centre of gravity has been called, by some writers, the centre of position; and by others, the centre of mean distances.\n\nProp. I.\n\n155. To find the centre of inertia of any number of bodies, whatever be their position.\n\nLet ABCD be any number of bodies influenced by the force of gravity. Suppose the bodies A, B connected by the inflexible line AB considered as devoid of weight, then find a point F, so that the weight of A : the weight of B = BF : FA. The bodies A, B will therefore be in equilibrium about the point F in every position (Art. 36), and the pressure upon F will be equal to A + B. Join FC, and find the point f, so that A + B : C = Cf : FT; the bodies A, B, C will consequently be in equilibrium upon the point f, which will sustain a pressure equal to A + B + C. Join DF, and take the point ϕ, so that A + B + C : D = ϕD : ϕf; the bodies A, B, C, D will therefore be in equilibrium about the point ϕ, which will be their common centre of inertia, and which supports a weight equal to A + B + C + D. In the same manner we may find the centre of inertia of any system of bodies, by merely connecting the last fulcrum with the next body by an inflexible right line, and finding a new fulcrum from the magnitude of the opposite weights which it is to sustain.\n\n156. Cor. 1. If the weights of the bodies A, B, C, D be increased or diminished in a given ratio, the centre of inertia of the system will not be changed, for the positions of the points F, f, ϕ are determined by the relative and not by the absolute weights of the bodies.\n\n157. Cor. 2. A motion of rotation cannot be communicated to a body by means of a force acting upon its centre of inertia; for the resistances which the inertia of each particle opposes to the communication of motion act in parallel directions, and as they are proportional to the weights of the particles, they will be in equilibrium about the centre of gravity.\n\nProp. II.\n\n158. To find the centre of inertia of any number of bodies placed in a straight line.\n\nLet A, B, C, D, E be any number of bodies whose common centre of gravity is ϕ. In the straight line AE take any point X. Then since all the bodies are in equilibrium about their common centre of gravity ϕ, we have by the property of the lever (Art. 36) \\( AX \\times Aϕ + BX \\times Bϕ = CX \\times Cϕ + DX \\times Dϕ + EX \\times Eϕ \\); but since \\( Xϕ - XA = Aϕ \\), and \\( Xϕ - XB = Bϕ \\), and so on with the rest, we have by substitution \\( AX \\times Xϕ - XA + BX \\times Xϕ - XB = CX \\times Xϕ - XC + DX \\times Xϕ - XD + EX \\times Xϕ - XE \\). Hence by multiplying and transposing, we obtain \\( AX \\times Xϕ + BX \\times Xϕ + CX \\times Xϕ + DX \\times Xϕ + EX \\times Xϕ = AX \\times XA + BX \\times XB + CX \\times XC + DX \\times XD + EX \\times XE \\), then dividing by \\( A + B + C + D + E \\), we have\n\n\\[ Xϕ. \\]\nMECHANICS\n\n\\[ X \\phi = \\frac{A \\times XA + B \\times XB + C \\times XC + D \\times XD + E \\times XE}{A + B + C + D + E} \\]\n\nNow \\( A \\times XA; B \\times XB, \\) &c. are evidently the momenta of the bodies \\( A, B, \\) &c. and the divisor \\( A + B + C + D + E \\) is the sum of the weights of all the bodies; therefore the distance of the point \\( X \\) from the centre of gravity \\( \\phi \\) is equal to the sum of the momenta of all the weights divided by the sum of the weights.\n\n159. Cor. 1. If the point \\( X \\) had been taken between \\( A \\) and \\( E \\), at \\( x \\) for example, then the quantity \\( A \\times XA \\) would have been reckoned negative, as lying on a different side of the point \\( X \\).\n\n160. Cor. 2. From this proposition we may deduce a general rule for finding the centre of gravity in any body or system of bodies. Let any point be assumed at the extremity of the system, then the product of the momenta of all the bodies, (or the product arising from the continual multiplication of each body by its distance from the point,) divided by the sum of the weights of all the bodies, will be a quotient which expresses the distance of the centre of gravity from the point assumed.\n\nPROP. III.\n\n161. If, in a system of bodies, a perpendicular be let fall from each upon a given plane, the sum of the products of each body multiplied by its perpendicular distance from the plane, is equal to the sum of all the bodies multiplied by the perpendicular distance of their common centre of inertia from the given plane.\n\nLet \\( A, B, C \\) be the bodies which compose the system, and \\( MN \\) the given plane; by Art. 155, find \\( F \\) the centre of inertia of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), and \\( G \\) the centre of gravity of the three bodies; and from \\( A, F, B, G, C \\) draw \\( Aa, Ef, Bb, Gg, Cc \\) perpendicular to the plane \\( MN \\). Through \\( F \\) draw \\( Fy \\), meeting \\( Aa \\) produced in \\( x \\), and \\( Bb \\) in \\( y \\), then in the similar triangles \\( AxF, ByF \\), we have \\( Aa : By = AF : BF \\), that is, \\( Aa : By = AF : BF \\), hence \\( A \\times Aa = B \\times By \\), that is, \\( A \\times Aa - Aa = B \\times Bb - Bb \\), or on account of the equality of the lines \\( xa, Ff, Bb; A \\times Ff - Aa = B \\times Bb - Ff \\), therefore, by multiplying and transposing, we have \\( A + B \\times Ff = A \\times Aa + B \\times Bb \\). In the very same way, by drawing \\( Gz \\) parallel to the plane, it may be shewn that \\( A + B + C \\times Gg = A \\times Aa + B \\times Bb + C \\times Cc \\). Q. E. D.\n\n116. Cor. By dividing by \\( A + B + C \\) we have\n\n\\[ G = \\frac{A \\times Aa + B \\times Bb + C \\times Cc}{A + B + C} \\]\n\nPROP. IV.\n\n163. To find the centre of inertia of a straight line, composed of material particles.\n\nIf we consider the straight line as composed of a number of material particles of the same size and density, it is evident that its centre of inertia will be a point in the line equidistant from its extremities. For if we regard the line as a lever supported upon its middle point as a fulcrum, it will evidently be in equilibrium in every position, as the number of particles or weights on each side of the fulcrum is equal.\n\nPROP. V.\n\n164. To find the centre of inertia of a parallelogram.\n\nLet \\( ABCD \\) be a parallelogram of uniform density, bisect \\( AB \\) in \\( F \\), and having drawn \\( Ff \\) parallel to \\( AC \\) or \\( BD \\), bisect it in \\( \\phi \\); the point \\( \\phi \\) will be the centre of inertia of the parallelogram. The parallelogram may be regarded as composed of lines \\( AB, ab \\) parallel to one another, and consisting of material particles of the same size and density. Now, by Art. 155, the centre of inertia of \\( AB \\) is \\( F \\), and the centre of inertia of \\( ab \\) is \\( c \\); and in the same way it may be shewn that the centre of inertia, of every line of which the surface is composed, lies in the line \\( Ff \\). But \\( Ff \\) may be considered as composed of a number of material particles of uniform density, each being equal in weight to the particles in the line \\( AB \\), therefore, by Art. 165, its centre of inertia will be in \\( \\phi \\), its middle point.\n\nPROP. VI.\n\n165. To find the centre of inertia of a triangle.\n\nLet \\( ABC \\) be a triangle of uniform density, and let \\( AB, BC \\) be bisected in the points \\( E, D \\). Join \\( CE, AD \\), and the point of intersection \\( F \\) shall be the centre of inertia of the triangle \\( ABC \\). The triangle may be considered as composed of a number of parallel lines of material particles \\( BC, bc, \\beta x \\); but in the similar triangles \\( ADC, Aec; AD : DC = A : ec \\), and in the triangles \\( ADC, ADB, Aeb ; BD : DA = be : ea \\); hence by composition \\( BD : DC = be : ec \\); but \\( BD \\) and \\( DC \\) are equal; therefore, \\( bce = ec \\), and the line \\( bc \\), supposed to consist of material particles, will be in equilibrium about \\( e \\). In the same way it may be shewn that every other line \\( bx \\) will be in equilibrium about a point situated in the line \\( AD \\); consequently the centre of gravity is in that line. For the same reason it follows, that the centre of gravity is in the line \\( CE \\), that is, it will be in \\( F \\), the point of intersection of these two lines. In order to determine the relation between \\( FA \\) and \\( FD \\), join \\( ED \\); then, since \\( BE = EA \\), and \\( BD = DC, BE : EA = BD : DC \\), and consequently, (Geometry, Sect. IV. Theor. 18.) \\( ED \\) is parallel to \\( AC \\), and the triangles \\( BED, BAC \\) similar. We have, therefore, \\( CA : CB = DE : DB \\), and by alternation \\( CA : DE = CB : DB \\), that is, \\( CA : DE = 2 : 1 \\). In the similar triangles \\( CFA, DFE, AF : AC = DF : DE \\), and by alternation \\( AF : DF = AC : DE \\), that is, \\( AF : DF = 2 : 1 \\), or \\( AF = \\frac{2}{3} AD \\).\n\n166. Cor. 1. By Geometry, Theor. 16. Sect. IV. we have\n\n\\[\nAB^2 + AC^2 = 2BD^2 + 2AB^2 = \\frac{1}{2} BC^2 + \\frac{1}{2} AF^2 \\\\\nAB^2 + BC^2 = 2CC^2 + 2BG^2 = \\frac{1}{2} AC^2 + \\frac{1}{2} CF^2 \\\\\nAC^2 + BC^2 = 2AE^2 + 2EC^2 = \\frac{1}{2} AB^2 + \\frac{1}{2} BF^2.\n\\]\nMECHANICS.\n\nTheory. By adding these three equations, and removing the fractions, we have $AB^2 + BC^2 + AC^2 = 3AF^2 + 3CF^2 + 3BF^2$, or in any plane triangle, the sum of the squares of the three sides is equal to thrice the sum of the squares of the distances of the centre of gravity from each of the angular points.\n\n167. Cor. 2. By resolving the three quadratic equations in the preceding corollary, we obtain $AF = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{2AB^2 + 2AC^2 - BC^2}$; $CF = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{2BA^2 + 2BC^2 - AC^2}$; and $BF = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{2BC^2 + 2AC^2 - AB^2}$, formulae which express the distances of the centre of gravity from each of the angular points.\n\nProp. VII.\n\n168. To find the centre of inertia of a trapezium or any rectilineal figure.\n\nLet ABCDE be the trapezium, and let it be divided into the triangles ABC, ACE, ECD by the lines AC, EC. By the last proposition find m, n, o, the centres of gravity of the triangles, and take the point F in the line mn, so that $F : F = \\triangle ABC : \\triangle ACE$, then F will be the centre of gravity of these triangles. Join Fo, and find a point f, so that $f : F = \\triangle ABC + \\triangle ACE : \\triangle CED$, then all the triangles will be in equilibrium about f, that is, f is the centre of gravity of the rectilineal figure ABCDE. The same method may be employed in finding the centre of gravity of a trapezium, whatever be the number of its sides.\n\nProp. VIII.\n\n169. To find the centre of inertia of a pyramid with a polygonal base.\n\nLet the pyramid be triangular, as ABCD, fig. 10. Bisect BD in F, and join CF and FA. Make $FF = \\frac{1}{4} FC$, and $F = \\frac{1}{4} FA$, and draw $f \\phi$. It is evident, from Art. 159, that f is the centre of gravity of the triangular base ECD, and that the line AF, which joins the vertex and the point f, will pass through the centre of gravity of all the triangular laminae or sections of the pyramid parallel to its base ABC; for, by taking any section bcd, and joining cfn, it may be easily shewn, that $b = m d$, and $m = \\frac{1}{4} mc$, so that n is the centre of gravity of the section bcd. It follows, therefore, that Af will pass through the centre of gravity of the pyramid. In the same way it may be shewn, by considering ABD as the base, and D the vertex, and making $F = \\frac{1}{4} FA$, that the centre of gravity lies in the line $\\phi C$. But, as the lines Af, $\\phi C$ lie in the plane of the triangle AFC, they must intersect each other; and therefore the point of intersection H will be the centre of inertia of the triangular pyramid. Now, since $F = \\frac{1}{4} FC$, and $F = \\frac{1}{4} FA$, we have $F : F = \\frac{1}{4} FC$, therefore (Geometry, Theor. 8, Sect. IV.) $F$ is parallel to AC. The triangle $\\phi FH$ will consequently be similar to AHC, and $H : HC = HF : HA = \\phi : AC = 1 : 3$; therefore $H = \\frac{1}{3} HC$, and $F = \\frac{1}{3} AH = \\frac{1}{3} AF$.\n\n170. When the pyramid has a polygonal base, it may be conceived to be formed of a number of triangular pyramids, whose centres of inertia will be in one plane parallel to the base. Their common centre of gravity will therefore be in the same place, and in the line drawn from the vertex to the centre of gravity of all the triangles which compose the base; the distance of the centre of gravity, therefore, from the vertex, will be equal to three-fourths of the altitude of the pyramid.\n\n171. Cor. 1. Hence it is obvious, that the centre of gravity of a right cone is a point in its axis, whose distance from the vertex is equal to three-fourths of the length of the axis; for as this may be demonstrated of a pyramid whose base is a polygon, with an infinite number of sides, it must hold also of a right cone which may be considered as a pyramid of this description.\n\n172. Cor. 2. By proceeding as in Art. 160, it will be found, that in a triangular pyramid, the distance of any of the vertices from its centre of inertia, is equal to one-fourth of the square root of the difference of thrice the sum of the squares of the three edges which meet at that vertex, and the sum of the squares of the other three edges;—likewise, that the sum of the squares of the distances of the centre of inertia from the vertices of any triangular pyramid, is equal to one-fourth of the sum of the squares of the six edges of the pyramid. A demonstration of these theorems may be seen in Gregory's Mechanics, vol. i., p. 59, 60.\n\n173. In order to show the application of the doctrine of fluxions to the determination of the centre of inertia of curve lines, areas, solids, and the surfaces of solids, let ABC be any curve line whose axis is BR. Then, since the axis bisects all the ordinates DG, AC, each of the ordinates, considered as composed of material particles, will be in equilibrium about their points of bisection E, R; and therefore the centre of inertia of the body will lie in the axis. But, if we consider the body as composed of a number of small weights D a G G, we shall find its centre of inertia by multiplying each weight by its distance from any line mn parallel to the ordinates, and dividing the sum of all these products by the sum of all the particles, Art. 158. Thus, let x denote the distance EB, then its fluxion x will be the breadth of the element or small weight D a G G, and x × DG will represent the weight, and the fluent of this quantity will be the sum of all the weights. Again, if we multiply the weight x × DG by x = EB its distance from the point B, we shall have the momentum of that weight = x × x × DG, and the fluent of this quantity will express the sum of the momenta of all the weights into which the body is divided. But, by Art. 158, the distance of the centre of gravity from a given point B is equal to the sum of all the momenta divided by the sum of all the weights or bodies, that is, if F be the centre of gravity of the body ABC, we have $FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } x \\times x \\times DG}{\\text{fluent of } x \\times DG}$, or calling y the ordinate DE, we have $DG = y$, and $FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } x \\times y \\times x}{\\text{fluent of } y \\times x}$, or $FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } x \\times y \\times x}{\\text{fluent of } y \\times x}$, in the case of areas.\n\n174. In the case of solids generated by rotation, the element or small weight $F \\times DG$ will be a circular section,\nMechanics.\n\nTheory. flection, whose diameter is $2DE = 2y$, and since the area of a circle is equal to its circumference multiplied by its diameter, we have (making $\\pi = 3.1416$) $2\\pi y^2 x$, the circular flection whose diameter is DG; and since $x \\times 2\\pi y^2 x$, or $2\\pi x y^2 x$, will represent the momentum of the weight, we shall have $FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } 2\\pi x y^2 x}{\\text{fluent of } y x}$, and dividing by $2\\pi y$, we have $FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } y x}{\\text{fluent of } y x}$.\n\n175. In finding the centre of inertia of the surfaces of solids, the elements or small weights are the circumferences of circles, whose radii are the ordinates of the curve by whose revolution the solid is generated. Now, the surface of the solid may be conceived to be generated by the circumference of a circle increasing gradually from B towards A and C; making $x$ therefore equal to BD, its fluxion $x$ multiplied into the periphery of the circle whose diameter is DG, that is, $2\\pi y x$ will express the elementary surface or small weight whose diameter is DG. Then, since $x \\times 2\\pi y x$, or $2\\pi x y^2 x$ will be the momentum of the elementary weight, we shall have $FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } 2\\pi x y^2 x}{\\text{fluent of } y x}$, and dividing by $2\\pi$ we obtain $FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } y x}{\\text{fluent of } y x}$.\n\n176. If the body, whose centre of inertia is to be found, be a curve line, as GBD, then it is manifest that the small weights will be expressed by the fluxion of GBD, that is, by $2x$, since $GBD = 2BD = 2x$; consequently their momenta will be $2x$, and we shall have $FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent } 2x}{\\text{fluent } 2x} = \\frac{\\text{fluent } x}{\\text{fluent } x} = \\frac{\\text{fluent } x}{\\text{fluent } x}$.\n\nProp. IX.\n\n177. To find the centre of inertia of a circular flection.\n\nLet $AE = x$, $FC = y$, and AD the radius of the circle $= R$, consequently $ME = 2R - EA$. Then, since by the property of the circle (Geometry, Theor. 28, Sect. IV.) $ME \\times EA = BE^2$, we have, by substitution, $BE^2 = 2R \\times EA - EA \\times EA$, or $y^2 = 2R x - x^2$; hence $y = \\sqrt{2R x - x^2}$. Now, by Art. 174, we have the distance of the centre of gravity from A, that is,\n\n$$AG = \\frac{\\text{fluent } x y}{\\text{fluent } y x}$$\n\nbut the fluent of $y x$ or the sum of all the weights, is equal to the area of half the segment ABEC; therefore $AG = \\frac{\\text{fluent } x y}{\\text{fluent } y x}$. Then, by substituting instead of $y$, in this equation, the value of it deduced from the property of the circle, we have\n\n$$AG = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } x \\sqrt{2R x - x^2}}{\\text{ABEC}}$$\n\nor, in order to find GD the distance of the centre of gravity from the centre, we must substitute instead of $x$ (without the vinculum) its value $R - x$, and we have $GD = \\frac{\\text{fluent } (R - x)(2R x - x^2)}{\\text{ABEC}}$.\n\nNow, in order to find the fluxion of the numerator of the preceding fraction, assume $z = 2R x - x^2$, and $z' = \\sqrt{2R x - x^2}$, and by taking the fluxion, we have $z = 2R x - 2x = 2R - 2x x$; but this quantity is double of the first term of the numerator, therefore $\\frac{z}{2} = R - x \\times x$. By substituting these values in the fractional formula, we obtain $GD = \\frac{\\text{fluent } z}{\\text{ABEC}} = \\frac{\\text{fluent } (2R x - x^2)}{\\text{ABEC}}$; but since $y = 2R x - x^2$, we have, by raising both sides to the third power, $y^3 = 2R x - x^2$; therefore $GD = \\frac{\\text{fluent } y^3}{\\text{ABEC}} = \\frac{\\text{fluent } y^3}{\\text{ABEC}} = \\frac{\\text{fluent } y^3}{\\text{ABEC}}$, that is, the distance of the centre of gravity of a circular segment from the centre of the circle, is equal to the twelfth part of the cube of twice the ordinate, (or the chord of the segment) divided by the area of the segment.\n\n178. Cor. When the segment becomes a semicircle we have $2y = 2r$; and therefore $GD = \\frac{\\text{fluent } (2r)^3}{\\text{ABEC}} = \\frac{(2r)^3}{\\text{ABEC}} = \\frac{8 \\times r^3}{\\text{ABEC}}$, that is, the distance of the centre of gravity of a semicircle from the centre of the semicircle, is equal to the cube of the radius, divided by one and a half times the area of the segment.\n\nProp. X.\n\n179. To find the centre of inertia of the sector of a circle.\n\nLet $ABDC$ be the sector of the circle. By Art. 157, find $m$ the centre of inertia of the triangle $BCD$, and by the last proposition find $G$ the centre of inertia of the segment; then take a point $n$ so situated between $G$ and $m$, that $ABEC : ECB = mn : Gn$, then the point $n$ will be the centre of gravity of the sector.—By proceeding in this way, it will be found that $Dn$, or the distance of the centre of gravity of the sector from the centre of the circle, is a fourth proportional to the semiarc, to the semichord, and to two-thirds of the radius.\n\nProp. XI.\n\n180. To find the centre of inertia of a plane surface bounded by a parabola whose equation is $y = ax^n$.\n\nSince $y = ax^n$, multiply both terms by $x$, and separately, and we have $y x = ax^{n+1}$, and $y = ax^n$. But, by Art. 174, we have $FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } ax^{n+1}}{\\text{fluent of } ax^n}$, therefore, by substituting the preceding values of $ax^n$ and $ax^{n+1}$ in the formula, we obtain $FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } ax^{n+1}}{\\text{fluent of } ax^n}$, and\nTheory, and by taking the fluents it becomes\n\n\\[ FB = \\frac{a x^{n+1}}{n+2} \\times x. \\]\n\nIf \\( n \\), therefore, be equal to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), then \\( y = a x^{\\frac{3}{4}} \\), and, squaring both sides, \\( y^2 = a^2 x \\), which is the equation of the common or Apollonian parabola.

Suppose the abscissa EP to increase by the small quantity \\( E_o \\), draw \\( o \\) parallel to EC, \\( C_r \\) parallel to \\( E_o \\), and \\( C_r \\) perpendicular to DC; then it is evident, that in the similar triangles CDE, \\( C_s r \\), EC : DC = \\( C_s : C_r \\), that is, \\( y : R = C_s : C_r \\); but \\( C_r \\) is the fluxion of the arc NC, and \\( C_s \\) the fluxion of the abscissa PE; therefore \\( y : R = x : z \\), and \\( zy = Rx \\), and \\( z = \\frac{R x}{y} \\). Now, by Art. 175, \\( FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } xy z}{\\text{fluent of } x y z} \\), therefore, by substituting the preceding value of \\( z \\)\n\nin this formula, we obtain \\( FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } R x}{\\text{fluent of } R x} \\), for\n\n\\[ \\frac{R x z}{y} = \\frac{R y x z}{R y x z} \\] (and dividing by \\( y z \\)) \\( = \\frac{R x}{R x} \\). By taking the fluents we obtain \\( FB = \\frac{R x}{R x} = \\frac{1}{2} x \\), a fluent which requires no correction, as the other quantities vanish at the same time with \\( x \\).\n\n183. When DP is equal to DC, the solid becomes a spherical segment, and EA becomes the altitude of the segment, so that universally the centre of gravity of the spherical surface of a spherical segment is in the middle of the line which is the altitude of the segment, or in the middle of the line which joins the centres of the two circles that bound the spherical segment.\n\n184. When the spherical segment is a hemispheroid, the centre of gravity of its hemispherical surface is obviously at the distance of one-half the radius from its centre.\n\n**Prop. XIV.**\n\n185. To find the centre of gravity of a circular arc.\n\nLet BAC be the circular arc, it is required to find its centre of inertia, or the distance of the centre of inertia of the half arc AC from the diameter HG; for it is evident, that the line which joins the centres of gravity of each of the semiarcs AB, AC must be parallel to HG, and therefore the distance of their common centre of gravity, which must be in that line, from the line HG, will be equal to the distance of the centre of gravity of the semicircle from the same line. Make PC = DE = \\( x \\); EC = \\( y \\); DC = DA = \\( R \\), and \\( AC = z \\), then it may be shewn, as in the last proposition, that \\( y : R = x : z \\); hence \\( zy = Rx \\). But, by Art. 176, we have \\( FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } y z}{z} \\), \\( y \\) being in this case equal to \\( x \\) in the formula in Art. 176, and substituting the preceding value of \\( y z \\), it becomes \\( FB = \\frac{\\text{fluent of } R x}{z} \\), and, taking the fluent, we have \\( FB = \\frac{R x}{z} \\), which requires no correction, as the fluent of \\( y z \\) vanishes at the same time with \\( x \\). Calling \\( d \\), therefore, the distance of the centre of inertia of the arc BAC from the centre D, we have \\( d = \\frac{R x}{z} \\), and \\( d z = R x \\); hence \\( z : x = R : d \\), or \\( 2 Z : 2 x = R : d \\); that is, the distance of the centre of inertia of a circular arc from the centre of the circle is a fourth proportional to the arc, the chord of the arc, and radius.\n\n186. When the arc BAC becomes a semicircle, PC or \\( x \\) is equal to DG or radius, so that we have \\( 2 z : 2 R = R : d \\), or \\( 4 Z : 4 R = R : d \\); but \\( 4 z \\) is equal to the whole circumference of the circle, and \\( 4 R \\)\nMechanics.\n\nTheory.\n\nis equal to twice the diameter; therefore, \\(3 \\cdot 141593 : 2 = R : d\\); hence \\(d = \\frac{2R}{3 \\cdot 141593} = 63662R\\).\n\n187. When \\(y\\) is equal to \\(2R\\), or when the arc \\(ABC\\) becomes equal to the whole circumference of the circle, \\(x\\) vanishes, and is \\(= 0\\), and therefore \\(\\frac{Rx}{z} = 0\\), which shews, that the centre of inertia coincides with the centre of the circle.\n\nScholium I.\n\n188. From the specimens which the preceding propositions contain of the application of the formulae in Articles 173, 174, 175, 176, the reader will find no difficulty in determining the centre of inertia of other surfaces and solids, when he is acquainted with the equation of the curves by which the surfaces are bounded, and by whose revolution the solids are generated.\n\nA knowledge of the nature of these curves, however, is not absolutely necessary for the determination of the centres of inertia of surfaces and solids. A method of finding the centre of gravity, without employing the equation of the bounding curves, was discovered by our countryman, Mr Thomas Simson *. It was afterwards more fully illustrated by Mr Chapman, in his work on the Construction of Ships; by M. Leveque, in his translation of Don George Juan's Treatise on the Construction and Management of Vessels; and by M. Prony, in his Architecture Hydraulique, tom. i. p. 93, to which we must refer such readers as wish to prosecute the subject.\n\nScholium II.\n\n189. As it is frequently of great use to know the position of the centre of inertia in bodies of all forms, we shall collect all the leading results which might have been obtained, by the method given in the preceding propositions.\n\n1. The centre of inertia of a straight line is in its middle point.\n\n2. The centre of inertia of a parallelogram is in the intersection of its diagonals.\n\n3. The centre of inertia of a triangle is distant from its vertex two-thirds of a line drawn from the vertex to the middle of the opposite side.\n\n4. The centre of inertia of a circle, and of a regular polygon, coincides with the centres of these figures.\n\n5. The centre of inertia of a parallelopiped is in the intersection of the diagonals joining its opposite angles.\n\n6. The centre of inertia of a pyramid is distant from its vertex three-fourths of the axis.\n\n7. The centre of inertia of a right cone is in a point in its axis whose distance from the vertex is three-fourths of the axis.\n\n8. In the segment of a circle, the centre of inertia is distant from the centre of the circle a twelfth part of the cube of the chord of the segment divided by the area of the segment, or \\(d = \\frac{4C^3}{A}\\), where \\(d\\) is the distance of the centre of inertia from the centre of the circle, \\(C\\) is the chord of the segment, and \\(A\\) its axis.\n\n9. In the sector of a circle, the centre of inertia is distant from the centre of the circle, by a quantity which is a fourth proportional to the semicircle, the semichord, and two-thirds of the radius.\n\n10. In a spherical surface or zone, comprehended between two planes, the centre of inertia is in the middle of the line which joins the centres of the two circular planes by which it is bounded. When one of the circular planes vanishes, the spherical zone becomes the spherical surface of a spherical segment; therefore,\n\n11. In a spherical surface of a spherical segment, the centre of inertia is in the middle of its altitude or verified fine; consequently,\n\n12. The centre of inertia of the surface of a complete sphere coincides with the centre of the sphere.\n\n13. In a spherical segment, the centre of inertia is distant from the vertex by a quantity equal to \\(\\frac{4a - 3x}{6a - 4x} \\times x\\), where \\(a\\) is the diameter of the sphere, and \\(x\\) the altitude or verified fine of the segment.\n\nHence,\n\n14. The centre of inertia of a hemisphere is distant from its vertex by a quantity equal to five-eighths of the radius, or it is three-eighths of the radius distant from the hemisphere; and,\n\n15. The centre of inertia of a complete sphere coincides with the centre of the sphere.\n\n16. In a circular arc the centre of inertia is distant from its centre by a quantity equal to \\(\\frac{Rx}{z}\\), where \\(R\\) is the radius, \\(x\\) the semichord, and \\(z\\) the semicircle.\n\nHence,\n\n17. In a semicircular arc the centre of inertia is distant from its centre \\(63662R\\), and,\n\n18. The centre of inertia of the circumference of a circle coincides with the centre of the circle.\n\n19. In a circular sector the centre of inertia is distant from the centre of the circle \\(\\frac{2cR}{3a}\\), where \\(R\\) is the radius, \\(a\\) the arc, and \\(c\\) its chord.\n\n20. In a spherical sector, composed of a cone and a spherical segment, the centre of inertia is distant from the vertex of the segment by a quantity equal to \\(\\frac{2R + 3x}{8}\\), where \\(R\\) is radius, and \\(x\\) the altitude or verified fine of the segment.\n\n21. In an ellipse the centre of inertia coincides with the centre of the figure.\n\n22. The centre of inertia of an oblate and prolate spheroid, solids generated by the revolution of an ellipse round its lesser and its greater axis respectively, coincides with the centres of the figures.\n\n23. In the segment of an oblate spheroid the centre of inertia is distant from its vertex by a quantity equal to \\(\\frac{4m - 3x}{6m - 4x} \\times x\\), where \\(m\\) is the lesser axis, or axis of rotation, and \\(x\\) the altitude of the segment. Hence,\n\n24. In a hemispheroid the centre of inertia is distant from its vertex five-eighths of the radius.\n\n25. The centre of inertia of the segment of a prolate spheroid...\nMechanics.\n\nTheory. spheroid is distant from its vertex by a quantity equal to\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{5} \\times n^3 - \\frac{3}{5} \\times n^2 \\times x, \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the greater axis, or axis of rotation.\n\n26. In the common or Apollonian parabola, the distance of the centre of inertia from its vertex is three-fifths of the axis.\n\n27. In the cubical parabola the distance of the centre of inertia from its vertex is four-sevenths of the axis, in the biquadratic parabola five-ninths of the axis, and in the surfolded parabola six-elevenths of the axis.\n\n28. In the common semiparabola, the distance of its centre of gravity from the centre of gravity of the whole parabola, in the direction of the ordinate passing through that centre, is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the greatest ordinate.\n\n29. In the common paraboloid, the distance of the centre of inertia from its axis, is equal to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of the axis.\n\n30. In the common hyperboloid, the distance of the centre of inertia from the vertex is equal\n\n\\[ \\frac{4a + 3x}{6a + 4x} \\times x, \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the transverse axis of the generating hyperbola, and \\( x \\) the altitude of the solid.\n\n31. In the frustum of a paraboloid, the distance of the centre of inertia from the centre of the smallest circular end is\n\n\\[ \\frac{R^2 + r^2}{R^2 + Rr + r^2} \\times \\frac{h}{4}, \\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) is the distance between the centres of the circles which contain the paraboloidal frustum, \\( R \\) the radius of the greater circle, and \\( r \\) the radius of the lesser circle.\n\n32. In a conic frustum or truncated cone, the distance of the centre of inertia from the centre of the smallest circular end is\n\n\\[ \\frac{3R^2 + 2Rr + r^2}{R^2 + Rr + r^2} \\times \\frac{h}{4}, \\]\n\nwhich represents the distance between the centres of the circles which contain the frustum, and \\( R, r \\) the radii of the circles.\n\n33. The same formula is applicable to any regular pyramid, \\( R \\) and \\( r \\) representing the sides of the two polygons by which it is contained.\n\nProp. XIV.\n\n190. If a quantity of motion be communicated to a system of bodies, the centre of gravity of the system will move in the same direction, and with the same velocity, as if all the bodies were collected in that centre, and received the same quantity of motion in the same direction.\n\nLet \\( A, B, C \\) be the bodies which compose the system, and let \\( F \\) be the centre of gravity of the bodies \\( B, C \\), and \\( f \\) the centre of gravity of the whole system, as determined by Art. 155. Then if the body \\( A \\) receives such a momentum as to make it move to \\( a \\) in a second, join \\( Fa \\), and take a point \\( \\phi \\) so that \\( F\\phi : Fa = Ff : fa \\). \\( \\phi \\) will now be the centre of gravity of the system, \\( f\\phi \\) the path of that centre will be parallel to \\( Aa \\), and \\( f\\phi \\) will be to \\( Aa \\) as \\( B \\) is to \\( A + B + C \\).\n\nLet the same quantity of motion be now communicated to \\( B \\), so as to make it describe the space \\( bb \\) in a second; and having drawn \\( \\phi G \\) parallel to \\( bb \\), take a point \\( G \\), so that \\( \\phi G : Bb = B : A + B + C \\), and \\( G \\) will be the centre of gravity of the bodies after \\( B \\) has moved to \\( b \\). In the same it may be found, that \\( H \\) will be the common centre of gravity of the bodies after the same quantity of motion has been communicated to \\( C \\) in the direction \\( Cc \\). Now if the quantity of motion which was communicated to \\( A, B, C \\) separately had been communicated to them at the same instant, they would have been found at the end of a second in the points \\( a, b, c \\), and their centre of gravity would have been the point \\( H \\). Let us now suppose the three bodies collected in their common centre of gravity \\( f \\), the body at \\( F \\) will be equal to \\( A + B + C \\), and if the same quantity of motion which made \\( A \\) move to \\( a \\) in a second be communicated to the body at \\( f \\) and in the same direction, it will be found somewhere in the line \\( f\\phi \\) at the end of a second. But as the quantity of motion is equal to the product of the velocity of the body multiplied by its quantity of matter, the velocities are inversely as the quantities of matter, and consequently the velocity of the body at \\( f \\) is to \\( A \\)'s velocity as \\( A \\) is to \\( A + B + C \\), that is, as \\( f\\phi \\) is to \\( Aa \\); therefore \\( Aa \\) and \\( f\\phi \\) are described by \\( A \\) and by the body at \\( f \\) in equal times, and the body at \\( f \\) will be found at \\( \\phi \\) at the end of a second. In the same way it may be shown, that the body at \\( f \\) will be found at \\( G \\) if it receives the same momentum that was given to \\( B \\), and in the same direction, and that it will be found at \\( H \\) after it has received the momentum that was communicated to \\( C \\), consequently if it received all these momenta at the same instant, it would have described \\( fH \\) in a second. Q. E. D.\n\n191. Cor. 1. If the bodies of a system move uniformly in right lines, their common centre of gravity will either be at rest, or move uniformly in a right line. For if the momenta communicated to the bodies \\( A, B, C \\) were communicated to a body at \\( f = A + B + C \\), it will either remain at rest or move uniformly in a straight line. See Newton's Principia, I. Sect. III. Cor. 1.\n\n192. Cor. 2. The centre of gravity of any system is not affected by the mutual action of the bodies which compose it. For let \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) be two bodies whose common centre of gravity is \\( F \\); and let the points \\( \\beta, \\alpha \\) be taken so that \\( B\\beta : C = C : B \\), the spaces \\( B\\beta, C\\alpha \\) will represent the mutual action of the bodies \\( B, C \\), that is \\( B\\beta \\) will represent the action of \\( C \\) upon \\( B \\), or the motion which is the result of that action, and \\( C\\alpha \\) the action of \\( B \\) upon \\( C \\), or the motion which results from it. Then, since \\( F \\) is the common centre of gravity, of \\( B \\) and \\( C \\), we have (Art. 155.) \\( B : C = FC : FB \\), but \\( C : B = C\\alpha : B\\beta \\), therefore \\( FC : FB = C\\alpha : B\\beta \\); but \\( C\\alpha \\) is a magnitude taken from \\( FC \\), and \\( B\\beta \\) is a magnitude taken from \\( FB \\), consequently (Playfair's Euclid, Book V. Prop. 19.) the remainder \\( \\alpha F : \\beta F = FC : FB \\), that is, \\( \\alpha F : \\beta F = B : C \\), that is (Art. 155.) the point \\( F \\) continues to be the centre of gravity notwithstanding the action of the bodies \\( B, C \\). If the system is composed of several bodies, the same thing may be proved of every two of the bodies, and consequently of the whole system. See D'Alembert's Dynamique, Art. 76. and Newton's Principia, I. Sect. III. Cor. 4.\n\nProp. XV.\n\n193. If a body is placed upon a horizontal plane, or suspended by two threads, it cannot be in equilibrium.\nequilibrio unless a perpendicular drawn from the centre of gravity to the horizontal plane, or to a horizontal line passing through the two threads, fall within the base of the body, or upon that part of the horizontal line which lies between the threads.\n\n194. 1. Let ABCD be a body placed in the horizontal plane CD, G its centre of gravity, and GE a perpendicular drawn to the horizontal line DE. Then the whole matter of the body ABCD may be conceived as united in its centre of gravity G, and as its tendency downwards is in the vertical line GE, it can descend only by turning round the point C as a centre. Here then we have a body G placed at the end of a lever GC whose fulcrum is C, and its power to turn round C is represented by the quantity of matter in G multiplied by the perpendicular CE, let fall from the fulcrum upon its line of direction; and as there is no force to counterbalance this, the body G, and consequently the body ABCD, will fall by turning round C. When the vertical line GE coincides with GC, EC vanishes, and the weight of the body concentrated at G has no power to turn the lever round C, but is supported upon the fulcrum C. When the vertical line GE, (by some writers called the line of direction), falls within the base CD, it is obvious that the weight at G has no influence in producing a motion round C or D, but is employed in preluding the body upon the horizontal plane ED.\n\n195. 2. Let the body ACBD be suspended at the points f, φ by the threads hf, h'φ, and let G be the centre of gravity of the body. Join Gφ, Gf, draw fφ parallel to fφ. Continue hf, h'φ to o and n, and draw Gi perpendicular to fφ, the body AB cannot be in equilibrium unless the point i falls upon the horizontal line fφ which passes through the threads. It is obvious that the centre of gravity can never change its distance from the fixed points of suspension f, φ; if therefore the body is not in equilibrium, its centre of gravity must descend either towards m or n; let it descend towards m till it rests at the point γ, then γ = fG; but γ is greater than Gφ (Euclid, Book I. Prop. 7.) which is absurd, therefore the point G cannot descend, that is, the body is in equilibrium. It may be flown in the same way, that it will be in equilibrium when G is anywhere between n and o, that is, when the perpendicular let fall from G cuts the horizontal line fφ that lies between the threads. If the body be suspended by the two threads HE, hf, so that the perpendicular Gi falls without the line fF, the body is not in equilibrium, for the centre of gravity G acting at the end of the lever GF tends to turn round F with a power equal to GXGm, it will therefore descend, and as its distance from f cannot change, the point f will rise, and the thread fh will be relaxed. When G arrives at m the perpendicular Gm vanishes, and G has no power to turn round F. The body AB therefore cannot be in equilibrium till the perpendicular Gi falls within fF, which it does as soon as it arrives at m.\n\n196. Cor. 1. If a body is placed upon an inclined plane, supposed without friction, it will slide down the plane when the line of direction falls within its base, and will roll down when this line falls without the base.\n\nThis is the reason why a sphere or cylinder rolls down an inclined plane; for as they touch the plane only in one point or line, the line of direction must always fall without the base.\n\n197. Cor. 2. The higher the centre of gravity of Fig. 17, a body is, the more easily will it be overturned. For if ABCD be the body whose centre of gravity is F, and if any force be employed to move it round C as a fulcrum, the power with which it will resist this force is inversely as FC; then, if the centre of gravity is raised to f, fC will be greater than FC, and the power with which it resists being overturned is diminished, that is, the body is the more easily overturned the higher that its centre of gravity is placed.\n\n198. Cor. 3. If a body be suspended by one thread, it will not be at rest unless its centre of gravity is in the direction of the thread produced, for when the two threads hf, h'φ approach to near each other as to coincide with the single thread HE, the point i must in the case of an equilibrium fall upon F, and the lines Gi, Gφ must coincide with mF; but HF and mF are both perpendicular to the horizontal line fφ, therefore the centre of gravity G is in the direction of the thread HF.\n\n199. Cor. 4. If the bodies A, B, C, fig. 18, be suspended by any point F from the hook H, they will not be in equilibrium unless their common centre of gravity G is in the vertical line FG passing through the point of suspension; and in fig. 19, the bodies A, B connected by the bent rod AFB will not be in equilibrium unless their common centre of gravity G is in a vertical line passing through F, the point in which the system rests upon the plane CD.\n\nScholium.\n\n200. We have seen in the preceding proposition and different corollaries, the position which must be given to the centre of gravity in order to procure an equilibrium. It is evident, however, that though the bodies are necessarily at rest, yet they have different degrees of stability, depending on the position of the centre of gravity with regard to the centre of motion. Hence bodies are said to have a stable equilibrium when their centre of gravity cannot move without ascending, or when the path described by their centre of gravity has its concavity upwards,—a tottering equilibrium when the centre of gravity cannot move without descending, or when the path which it describes has its concavity downwards,—and a neutral equilibrium when the body will rest in any position. Thus in fig. 20, if the vessels A, B have their handles so placed that in the one the handle A is fixed above the centre of gravity g, and in the other the handle B is fixed below the centre of gravity g, then the equilibrium of A will be stable, and that of B tottering; for if A is held by the handle it will require a considerable force to make its centre of gravity describe the path mn, whereas the smallest force will destroy the equilibrium of B. The vessel A, too, has a constant tendency to recover its equilibrium, and always recovers it as soon as the disturbing force is removed, but the vessel B has no tendency to do this even when its equilibrium is affected in the smallest degree. For the same reason the elliptical body A, when resting on the extremity of its conjugate axis, has a stable equilibrium, but when resting on its transverse axis as at B, its equilibrium...\nThe equilibrium of a circle or sphere is always neutral, for when it is disturbed, the body has neither a tendency to fall nor to resume its former situation. A flat body A supported by a sphere B will have its equilibrium stable when its centre of gravity is nearer the point of contact than the centre of the sphere is, and the equilibrium of C will be tottering when its centre of gravity is farther distant from the surface of the sphere D than the centre of the sphere is.\n\n**Prop. XVI.**\n\n1. To find the centre of inertia mechanically.\n\n201. If the body whose centre of inertia is to be found can be suspended by a thread, then when the body is in equilibrium, the centre of gravity will be somewhere in the line, prolonged if necessary, that is formed by the thread upon the surface of the body. Let a body be again suspended from another part of its surface, so that the direction of the thread may be nearly at right angles to its former direction, then as the centre of gravity must also be in the new direction of the thread prolonged, it will be in the point where these two lines intersect each other.\n\n202. 2. If the body is of such a kind that it cannot be conveniently suspended, balance it upon two sharp points, and its centre of motion will be somewhere in the line which joins these points. Balance it a second time upon the sharp points, so that the line which joins the points may be nearly at right angles to the former line. The intersection of these two lines will be the centre of inertia of the body.\n\n203. 3. If the body is so flexible that it can neither be suspended by a thread nor balanced upon points, then let a thin board be balanced upon the points as before, and let the body be so placed upon this board when balanced, that the equilibrium may still continue; then, having found the centre of gravity of the board when loaded with the body, the centre of gravity of the body will be a point on its surface exactly opposite to that centre.\n\n204. The preceding method, however, only gives us the centre of gravity when the body has no sensible thickness; for when it is of three dimensions, the centre of gravity must be somewhere between the two opposite surfaces.\n\n205. Definition.—The centro-baryc method is the method of determining the areas of surfaces, and the contents of solids, by considering them as generated by motion, and by employing the laws of the centre of gravity.\n\n**Prop. XVII.**\n\n206. If any straight or curve line, or any plane surface bounded by straight or curve lines revolve round an axis situated in the same plane with the lines or surfaces, the surface or solid thus generated will be respectively equal to a surface or solid whose base is equal to the given line or surface, and whose height is equal to the arc described by the centre of gravity of the generating line or surface.\n\nLet ABCD be the plane surface by whose revolution round the axis MPN is generated the solid AD, contained by the parallelograms ABCD, abcd, and by the areas AC, BD, and ABBb, CDCd; let G be the centre of gravity of ABCD, then the solid AD shall be equal to a solid whose base is ABCD, and whose altitude is a line equal to GG, the space described by its centre of gravity G. It is evident from Art. 161, that the sum of the products of all the particles of the surface ABCD, multiplied by their respective distances from any given point P, is equal to the sum of all the particles multiplied by the distance of their common centre of gravity G from the same point P. Now every particle of the surface ABCD, during its revolution round the point P, will obviously describe the arch of a circle proportional to the distance of that particle from the point P, which is the centre of all the arches; therefore the sum of the product of all the particles multiplied by the arch described by each of them, will be equal to the sum of the particles multiplied by the arch which their common centre of gravity describes, that is, the solid AD will be equal to the area of the surface multiplied by the path of its centre of gravity. In order to have a clearer illustration of this reasoning, let P, p, π, &c., be the particles of the surface ABCD; D, d, δ their distance from the centre of rotation P, and A, a, α, the arches which they describe, while GP is the distance of the centre of gravity of the surface ABCD from the centre P, and GG the arch described by it. Then by Art. 161, \\( \\frac{P}{D} + \\frac{p}{d} + \\frac{\\pi}{\\delta} = \\frac{P}{D} + \\frac{p}{d} + \\frac{\\pi}{\\delta} \\times GP \\), but \\( D : d : \\delta : GP = A : a : \\alpha : GG \\), therefore \\( P \\times A + p \\times a + \\pi \\times \\alpha = P + p + \\pi \\times GG \\). But \\( P \\times A + p \\times a + \\pi \\times \\alpha \\) make up the whole solid AD, and \\( P + p + \\pi \\), &c., make up the whole surface ABCD; therefore the solid AD is equal to the generating surface ABCD multiplied by the path of its centre of gravity. Q. E. D.\n\n207. Cor. 1. Let us suppose the circle BACO to be generated by the revolution of the line DA round the point D; then since the centre of gravity of the line DA is in its middle point G, the path of this centre will be a circumference whose radius is DG, or a line equal to half the circumference BONAB, therefore, by the theorem, the area of the circle BONB will be equal to the radius DA multiplied by the semicircumference, which coincides with the result obtained from the principles of geometry. See Playfair's Geometry, Supp. B. I. Prop. 5. In the same way, by means of the preceding theorem, we may readily determine the area of any surface, or the content of any solid that is generated by motion.\n\n**Scholium.**\n\n208. The centro-baryc method, which is one of the finest inventions of geometry, was first noticed by Pappus in the preface to the seventh book of his mathematical collections, but it is to Father Guldinus that we are indebted for a more complete discussion of the subject. He published an account of his discovery partly in 1635, and partly in 1640, in his work entitled De Centro Gravitatis, lib. ii. cap. 8. prop. 3. and gave an indirect demonstration of the theorem, by showing the conformity of its results with those which were obtained by other means. Leibnitz demonstrated the theorem in the case of superficies generated by the revolution of curves, but concealed his demonstration (Act. Leipf. 1693, p. 493).\nTheorem. 493. The theorem of Leibnitz, however, as well as that of Guldinus, was demonstrated by Varignon in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1714, p. 78. Leibnitz observes that the method will still hold, even if the centre round which the revolution is performed be continually changed during the generating motion. For further information on this subject, the reader is referred to Dr. Wallis's work, De Calculo Centri Gravitatis, Hutton's Mensuration, Prony's Architecture Hydraulique, vol. i. p. 88, and Gregory's Mechanics, vol. i. p. 64.\n\nProp. XVIII.\n\n209. To show the use of the doctrine of the centre of gravity in the explanation of some mechanical phenomena.\n\nIn the equilibrium and motion of animals, we perceive many phenomena deducible from the properties of the centre of gravity. When we endeavour to rise from a chair, we naturally draw our feet inwards, and rest upon their extremities, in order to bring the centre of gravity directly below our feet, and we put the body into that position in which its equilibrium is tottering, a position which renders the smallest force capable of producing motion, or of overturning the body. In this situation, in order to prevent ourselves from falling backwards, we thrust forward the upper part of the body for the purpose of throwing the centre of gravity beyond our feet; and when the equilibrium is thus destroyed, we throw out one of our feet, and gradually raise the centre of gravity till the position of the body is erect.—When we walk, the body is thrown into the position of tottering equilibrium by resting it on one foot; this equilibrium is destroyed by pushing forward the centre of gravity, and the body again assumes the position of tottering equilibrium by resting it on the other foot. During this alternate process of creating and destroying a tottering equilibrium, the one foot is placed upon the ground, and the other is raised from it; but in running, which is performed in exactly the same way, both the feet are never off the ground at the same time: At every step there is a short interval, during which the runner does not touch the ground at all.\n\n210. When we ascend an inclined plane the body is thrown farther forward than when we walk on a horizontal one, in order that the line of direction may fall without our feet; and in descending an inclined plane, the body is thrown backward, in order to prevent the line of direction from falling too suddenly without the base. In carrying a burden, the centre of gravity is brought nearer to the burden, so that the line of direction would fall without our feet if we did not naturally lean towards the side opposite to the burden, in order to keep the line of direction within our feet. When the burden is therefore carried on the back, we lean forward; when it is carried in the right arm, we lean towards the left; when it is carried in the left arm, we lean towards the right; and when it is carried before the body, we throw the head backwards.\n\n211. When a horse walks, he first sets out one of his fore feet and one of his hind feet, supposing the right foot; then at the same instant he throws out his left fore foot and his left hind foot, so as to be supported only by the two right feet. His two right feet are then brought up at the same instant, and he is supported only by his two left feet.—When a horse pulls at a load which he can scarcely overcome, he raises both his fore feet, his hind feet become the fulcrum of a lever, and the weight of the horse collected in his centre of gravity acts as a weight upon this lever, and enables him to surmount the obstacle. (See Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii.)\n\n212. When a rope-dancer balances himself upon the Method in fore part of one foot, he preserves his equilibrium in two ways, either by throwing one of his arms or his elevated keeps his foot, or his balancing pole, to the side opposite to that towards which he is beginning to fall, or by shifting the bunion point of his foot, on which he rests, to the same side towards which he is apt to fall; for it amounts to the same thing whether he brings the centre of gravity directly above the point of support, or brings the point of support directly below the centre of gravity. For this purpose the convex form of the foot is of great use, for if it had been perfectly flat, the point of support could not have admitted of small variations in its position.*\n\n213. We have already seen (Art. 197.) that any body T. Young's is more easily overturned in proportion to the height of Natural its centre of gravity. Hence it is a matter of great importance that the centre of gravity of all carriages should be placed as low as possible. This may often be effected by a judicious disposition of the load, of which the heaviest materials should always have the lowest place. The present construction of our mail coaches is therefore adverse to every principle of science, and the cause of many of those accidents in mail coaches which the lives of individuals have been lost. The elevated position of the guard, the driver, and the outside passengers, and the two boots which contain the baggage, raises the centre of gravity of the loaded vehicle to a very great height, and renders it much more easily overturned than it would otherwise have been. When any accident of this kind is likely to happen, the passengers should bend as low as possible, and endeavour to throw themselves to the elevated side of the carriage.—In two wheeled carriages where the horse bears part of the load upon its back, the elevation of the centre of gravity renders the draught more difficult, by throwing a greater proportion of the load upon the horse's back when he is going down hill, and when he has the least occasion for it; and taking the load from the back of the horse when he is going up hill, and requires to be prefled to the ground.\n\n214. A knowledge of the laws of the centre of gravity enables us to explain the experiment represented in fig. 24., where the vessel of water CG is suspended on a rod AB, passing below its handle, and resting on the end E of the beam DE. The extremity B of the rod AB is supported by another rod BF, which bears against the bottom of the vessel; so that the vessel and the two rods become, as it were, one body, which, by Art. 199. will be in equilibrium when their common centre of gravity C is in the same vertical line with the A loaded point of support E.\n\n215. The cylinder G may be made to ascend the inclined plane ABC by putting a piece of lead or any heavy substance on one side of its axis, so that the centre of gravity may be moved from G towards g. Hence by its own weight.\nMechanics.\n\nTheory. It is obvious, that the centre of gravity \\( g \\) will descend, and by its descent the body will rise towards \\( A \\). The inclination of the plane, however, must be such, that before the motion commences, the angles formed by a vertical line drawn from \\( g \\) with a line drawn from \\( G \\) perpendicularly to \\( AB \\), must be less than the angle of inclination \\( ABC \\), or, which is the same thing, when the vertical line drawn from \\( g \\) does not cut the line which lies between the point of contact and the centre of the cylinder. When the vertical line, let fall from \\( g \\), meets the perpendicular line drawn from \\( G \\) to the plane in the point of contact, the cylinder will be in equilibrium on the inclined plane.\n\n216. Upon the same principle, a double scalene cone may be made to ascend an inclined plane without being loaded with a weight. In fig. 26, let \\( ABC \\) be the section of a double inclined plane, \\( AB, BC \\) being sections of its surfaces perpendicular to the line in which the double scalene cone \\( ADEF \\) moves. Then, since the centre of gravity of a cone is in the line joining the vertex and the centre of its base, and since the axis of a scalene cone is not perpendicular to its base, the line which joins the centres of both the cones, when in the position represented in the figure, will be above the line which joins the centres of their bases. If the circle, therefore, in fig. 27 represents the base of one of the cones, and \\( C \\) its centre, the line which joins the centres of gravity of the two cones will terminate in some point \\( G \\) at a distance from the centre, and therefore the double cone will ascend the plane upon the same principles, and under the same conditions, as those mentioned in the last paragraph.\n\nChap. V. On the Motion of Bodies along Inclined Planes and Curves, on the Curve of Swiftest Descent, and on the Oscillations of Pendulums.\n\nProp. I.\n\n217. When a body moves along an inclined plane, the force which accelerates or retards its motion, is to the whole force of gravity as the height of the plane is to its length, or as the sine of its inclination is to radius.\n\nLet \\( ABC \\) be the inclined plane, \\( A \\) the place of the body, and let \\( AB \\) represent the whole force of gravity. The force \\( AB \\) is equivalent to the two forces \\( AD, DB \\) or \\( AE, AD \\), of which \\( AD \\) is the force that accelerates the motion of the body down the plane, while \\( AE \\) is destroyed by the resistance or reaction of the plane. The part of the force of gravity, therefore, which makes the body arrive at \\( C \\) is represented by \\( AD \\), while the whole force of gravity is represented by \\( AB \\); but the triangle \\( ABD \\) is equilateral to \\( ABC \\), and \\( AD : AB = AR : AC \\), that is, the accelerating force which makes the body descend the inclined plane, is to the whole force of gravity as the height of the plane is to its length, or as the sine of the plane's inclination is to radius; for when \\( AC \\) is radius, \\( AB \\) becomes the sine of the angle \\( ACB \\).\n\n218. Cor. 1. Since the force of gravity, which is uniform, has a given ratio to the accelerating force, the accelerating force is also uniform; consequently the laws of accelerated and retarded motions, as exhibited in the article Dynamics, are also true when the bodies move along inclined planes. If \\( H \\), therefore, represent the height \\( AB \\) of the plane, \\( L \\) its length \\( AC \\), \\( g \\) the force of gravity, and \\( A \\) the accelerating force, we shall have, by the proposition, \\( L : H = g : A \\), hence \\( A = g \\times \\frac{H}{L} \\), or, since \\( g : A = \\text{radius} : \\sin ACB \\), and \\( A = g \\times \\sin ACB \\). Now, from the principles of Dynamics, \\( s = \\frac{1}{2} gt^2 \\), \\( v = gt = \\sqrt{2gs} \\), and \\( t = \\frac{v}{g} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2s}{g}} \\), where \\( s \\) is the space described, \\( g \\) the force of gravity, or 32 feet, \\( v \\) the velocity, and \\( t \\) the time.\n\nMaking \\( \\phi \\), therefore, equal to \\( ACB \\), and substituting the value of \\( A \\) instead of \\( g \\) in the preceding equation, we shall have \\( s = \\text{lin} \\phi \\times \\frac{v^2}{2g} ; v = g \\times \\text{lin} \\phi = \\sqrt{2gs} \\times \\text{lin} \\phi \\), and \\( t = \\frac{v}{g \\times \\text{lin} \\phi} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2s}}{g \\times \\text{sin} \\phi} \\).\n\n219. Cor. 2. If one body begins to descend through the vertical \\( AB \\) at the same time that another body descends along the plane \\( AC \\), when the one is at any point \\( m \\), the position of the other will be \\( n \\), which is determined by drawing \\( mn \\) perpendicular to \\( AC \\). The forces by which the two bodies are actuated, are as \\( AB : AD \\), that is, as \\( Am \\) to \\( An \\); but forces are measured by the spaces described in the same time; therefore, the spaces described in the same time, are as \\( Am, An \\), that is, as the length of the plane is to its height; for \\( Am : An = AC : AB \\); consequently, when the body that descends along the vertical line \\( AB \\) is at \\( m \\), the other body will be at \\( n \\). Through the three points \\( A, m, n \\) describe the semicircle \\( Amn \\); then, since \\( Amn \\) is a right angle, the centre of the semicircle will be in the line \\( Am \\) (Playfair's Euclid, Book iv., Prop. 5.); consequently, if two bodies descend from the point \\( A \\) at the same time, the one through the diameter of a circle \\( Am \\), and the other through any chord \\( An \\), they will arrive at the points \\( m, n \\), the extremities of the diameter and of the chord at the same instant. It also follows from this corollary, that if from the point \\( A \\) there be drawn any number of lines making different angles with the diameter \\( Am \\), and if bodies be let fall from \\( A \\), so as to move along these lines, they will, at the end of any given time, be found in the circumferences of circles which touch one another in the point \\( A \\). If the lines are not in the same plane, the bodies will be in the circumferences of spheres which touch each other in the point \\( A \\).\n\n220. Cor. 3. If any number of bodies descend from the same point \\( A \\) along any number of inclined planes \\( AC, AF \\), their velocities at the points \\( C, F \\) will be equal. By Cor. 1, the velocity of a body descending the plane \\( AC \\), is \\( \\sqrt{2gs} \\times \\text{lin} \\phi \\), and the velocity of a body falling in the vertical line \\( AB \\) is \\( v = \\sqrt{2gs} \\). But, since \\( v = v' \\), we have \\( \\sqrt{2gs} \\times \\text{lin} \\phi = \\sqrt{2gs} \\times \\text{lin} \\phi = 2gs \\times \\text{lin} \\phi = 2gs \\times \\text{lin} \\phi \\), consequently \\( s : t = \\text{lin} \\phi : 1 \\), or \\( AB : AC = \\text{lin} D : B \\) radius. Therefore, when \\( v = v' \\), that is, when the velocities of the two bodies are equal, the spaces described are as \\( \\text{lin} DAB : \\text{radius} \\), which can only happen when \\( BC \\) is perpendicular to \\( AB \\). In the same way it may be shewn that the velocity at \\( F \\) is equal to the velocity at \\( C \\), therefore the velocity at \\( C \\) is equal to the velocity at \\( F \\).\n\n221. Cor. 4. The time of descending along \\( AC \\) is\nMechanics:\n\nTheory. To the time of descending along \\( AB \\), as \\( AC \\) is to \\( AB \\).\n\nFrom the values of \\( s, s' \\) in Cor. 1, we obtain \\( t : t' = \\frac{AC}{\\sin \\phi} : \\frac{AB}{\\sin \\phi} \\). But \\( \\frac{AC}{AB} = \\sin \\phi \\); therefore,\n\n\\[ t : t' = AC^2 : AB^2 \\]\n\nand taking equal multiples of these two last terms, that is, multiplying them by \\( AB \\), we have\n\n\\[ t' : t'' = AC^3 : AB^3 \\text{ or } t : t' = AC : AB \\]\n\nHence the time of descending along \\( AF \\) and \\( AC \\), are as \\( AF \\) and \\( AC \\).\n\nCor. 5. The velocities acquired by descending any planes \\( AC, AF \\), are as the square roots of their altitudes \\( AB \\). The velocity acquired by falling through \\( AB \\) is, by the principles of Dynamics, as the square root of \\( AB \\); and as the velocities at \\( F, C \\), are equal to that at \\( B \\), they will also be as the square root of \\( AB \\).\n\nProp. II.\n\n223. If a body descend from any point along a number of inclined planes to a horizontal line, its velocity, when it reaches the horizontal line, will be equal to that which it would have acquired by falling in a vertical direction from the given point to the horizontal line.\n\nLet \\( AB, BC, CD \\) be a number of planes differently inclined to a horizontal line \\( DN \\), and let the body be let fall from the point \\( A \\) so as to move along these planes, without losing any of its velocity at the angular points; it will have the same velocity when it reaches the horizontal plane at \\( D \\), which it would have acquired by falling freely from \\( A \\) to \\( F \\). It is manifest, from Art. 220, that the velocity of the body when at \\( B \\) will be the same as that of another body which had fallen freely from \\( A \\) to \\( c \\) in a vertical line. The two bodies set out from \\( B \\) and \\( c \\) with the same velocity, and will therefore continue to have the same velocity when they reach the points \\( C, G \\), because \\( cG = BD \\). The two bodies again set off from the points \\( C, G \\) with the same velocity, and since \\( GE = CE \\), their respective velocities will be equal when they arrive at the points \\( D, F \\) in the horizontal plane. The velocity, therefore, acquired by the body falling along the planes \\( AB, BC, CD \\) is equal to that which is acquired by the same body falling through the vertical line \\( AF \\).\n\nCor. 1. As the preceding proposition holds true, whatever be the number of inclined planes which lie between the point \\( A \\) and the horizontal line, it will hold true also of any curve line which may be considered as made up of an infinite number of straight lines. And, since the small planes are diminished without limit, the radius is diminished without limit, and therefore the versed sine, or the velocity lost in passing from one plane to another, is diminished without limit (A), consequently, abstracting from friction, a body will ascend or descend a curve surface without losing any of its velocity from the curvature of the surface.\n\nCor. 2. If a body be made to ascend a curve surface, or a system of inclined planes, the vertical height to which it will rise, is equal to that through which it must fall in order to acquire the velocity with which it ascended, abstracting from the effects of friction, and the velocity which is lost in passing from one plane to another. This is obvious, from Dynamics, § 26, 51; for the body experiences the same decrements of velocity in its ascent, as it received increments in its descent.\n\nCor. 3. The same thing will hold if the body is kept in the curve by a string perpendicular to the curve, for the string sustains that part of the weight which was sustained by the curve, since the reaction of the curve surface is in a line perpendicular to the curve.\n\nScholium.\n\n227. It is obvious, that the body which moves along the system of inclined planes must lose a part of its velocity in passing from one plane to another. By the resolution of motion it will be found that the velocity acquired by falling through any of the planes, is to the velocity lost in passing to the succeeding one, as radius is to the versed sine of the angle formed by the two planes. Or the velocity with which the body enters upon one plane is as the cosine of the angle made by the contiguous planes, divided by the velocity which the body had when it left the preceding plane.\n\nProp. III.\n\n228. The times of descending two systems of inclined planes similar and similarly situated, are in the subduplicate ratio of their lengths.\n\nLet \\( AB, BC, CD \\), and \\( ab, bc, cd \\) be the similar systems of inclined planes, and let \\( T \\) be the time of descending \\( ABCD \\), and \\( t \\) the time of descending \\( abcd \\).\n\nBy Cor. 4, Prop. 1, we have\n\n\\[ \\text{Time along } AB : \\text{Time along } Ac = AB : Ac \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Time along } ab : \\text{Time along } a\\beta = ab : a\\beta \\]\n\nBut, on account of the similar triangles \\( ABC, ab\\beta \\), we have,\n\n\\[ AB : Ac = ab : a\\beta \\]\n\nHence (Euclid, Book v. Prop. 11. 16.)\n\n\\[ \\text{Time along } AB : \\text{Time along } ab = \\text{Time along } Ac : \\text{Time along } a\\beta \\]\n\n(A) See Wood's Principles of Mechanics, p. 58, note; and also Gregory's Mechanics, vol. i. p. 112, where this corollary is demonstrated by the method of fluxions.\nIn the same way it may be shewn, that\n\nTime along BC : Time along \\( b \\) = Time along \\( cG \\) : Time along \\( \\beta x \\),\nTime along CD : Time along \\( cd \\) = Time along GF : Time along \\( \\kappa f \\).\n\nThen, by Geometry, Sect. III. Theorem VIII.\n\nTime along \\( AB + BC + CD \\) : Time along \\( ab + bc + cd \\) = Time along \\( Ac + cG + GF \\) : Time along \\( \\alpha \\beta + \\beta x + \\kappa f \\),\nthat is,\n\nTime along \\( AB + BC + CD \\) : Time along \\( ab + bc + cd \\) = Time along AF : Time along \\( af \\).\n\nBut by Dynamics §. 37, 2.\n\nTime along AF : Time along \\( af \\) = \\( \\sqrt{AF} : \\sqrt{af} \\),\n\nTherefore, Euclid, B. V. Prop. 11.\n\nTime along \\( AB + BC + CD \\) : Time along \\( ab + bc + cd \\) = \\( \\sqrt{AF} : \\sqrt{af} \\). Q.E.D.\n\nBut by similar triangles, &c.\n\n\\( \\sqrt{AF} : \\sqrt{af} = \\sqrt{AB + BC + CD} : \\sqrt{ab + bc + cd} \\).\n\nTherefore,\n\nTime along \\( AB + BC + CD \\) : Time along \\( ab + bc + cd \\) = \\( \\sqrt{AB + BC + CD} : \\sqrt{ab + bc + cd} \\). Q.E.D.\n\n229. Cor. 1. This proposition holds true of curves, for the reasons mentioned in Prop. 2. Cor. 1.\n\n230. Cor. 2. The times of descent along similar arcs of a circle are as their radii; for by the preceding corollary the times are as the arcs, and the arcs are as the radii, therefore the times are as the radii.\n\nProp. IV.\n\nAn inverted semi-cycloid is the curve of quickest descent, or the curve along which a body must descend in order to move between two points not in a vertical line, in the least time possible.\n\nLet \\( qFZ \\) be a semicycloid, and \\( A'D', CF' \\) two parallel and vertical ordinates at an infinitely small distance. Draw the ordinate \\( B'E' \\) an arithmetical mean between the ordinates \\( A'D' \\) and \\( C'F' \\), and from \\( F', E' \\) draw \\( F'v, E'u \\) perpendicular to \\( B'F', C'E' \\). Make \\( C'F' = a, B'E' = b, E'v = c, C'B' = m, B'A' = n \\). Then since \\( F'E' \\) may be considered as a straight line, and since \\( B'C' = F'v \\), we have (Euclid, B. I. Prop. 47.) \\( F'E' = \\sqrt{m^2 + c^2} \\), and since \\( F'v = E'u, E'D' = \\sqrt{n^2 + c^2} \\).\n\nNow the velocities at \\( F' \\) and \\( E' \\) vary as \\( \\sqrt{a} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{b} \\), and \\( F'E', E'D' \\) are the elementary spaces described with these velocities; but the times are directly as the square root of the spaces, and inversely as the velocities, therefore the time of describing \\( F'E' \\) is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{m^2 + c^2}}{\\sqrt{a}} \\), and the time of describing \\( E'D' \\) is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{n^2 + c^2}}{\\sqrt{b}} \\), consequently,\n\nthe time of describing \\( FD \\) must be \\( \\frac{m^2 + c^2}{a} + \\frac{n^2 + c^2}{b} \\).\n\nBut the proposition requires that this time should be the least possible or a minimum, therefore taking its fluxion and making it equal to 0, we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2mm}{a \\times mm + c^2} + \\frac{2nn}{b \\times nn + c^2} = 0.\n\\]\n\nProperties of the Cycloid.\n\nDefinition.—If a circle NOP be so placed as to be in contact with the line AD, and be made to roll along that line from D towards A, till the same point D of the circle touches the other extremity A, the point D will describe a curve DBA, called a cycloid.\n\nThe line AD is called the base of the cycloid; the line CB, which bisects AD at right angles and meets the curve in B, is called the axis, and B the vertex.\n\nThe circle NOP is called the generating circle.\n232. 1. The base AD is equal to the circumference of the generating circle, and AC is equal to half that circumference.\n\n2. The axis CB is equal to the diameter of the generating circle.\n\n3. If from any point G of the cycloid, there be drawn a straight line GM parallel to AD, and meeting the circle BLC in L, the circular arc BL is equal to the line GL.\n\n4. If the points L, B be joined, and a tangent drawn to the cycloid at the point G, the tangent will be parallel to the chord LB, and the tangent is found by joining GE, for GE is parallel to LB.\n\n5. The arc BG of the cycloid is double of the chord BL, and the arc BA or BD is equal to twice the axis BC.\n\n6. If the two portions AB, DB of the cycloid in fig. 3. be placed in the inverted position AB, DB (fig. 4.), and if a string BP equal in length to BA be made to coincide with BA, and then be evolved from it, its extremity P will describe a semicycloid AF, similar and equal to BA. In the same way the semicycloid DF, produced by the evolution of the string BP from the semicycloid BD, is equal and similar to BD and to AF. Therefore, if BP be a pendulum or weight attached to the extremity of a flexible line BP, which vibrates between the cycloidal checks BA, BD, its extremity D will describe a cycloid AFD, equal to that which is composed of the two halves BA, BD.\n\n7. The chord CN is parallel to MP, and MP is perpendicular to the cycloid AFD, at the point P.\n\n8. If PP be an infinitely small arc, the perpendicular to the curve drawn from the points PP will meet at M, and PP may be regarded as a circular arc, whose radius is MP. An infinitely small cycloidal arc at F may likewise be considered as a circular arc whose radius is BF.\n\nAs these properties of the cycloid are demonstrated in almost every treatise on mechanics, and as their demonstrations more properly belong to geometry than to mechanics, they are purposely omitted to make room for more important matters.\n\n233. Definition.—If a body descend from any point of a curve, and ascend in the same curve till its velocity is destroyed, the body is said to oscillate in that curve, and the time in which this descent and ascent are performed is called the time of an oscillation or vibration.\n\n234. Definition.—A cycloidal pendulum is a pendulum which oscillates or vibrates in the arch of a cycloid.\n\n235. Definition.—Oscillations which are performed in equal times are said to be isochronous.\n\nProp. V.\n\n236. The velocity of the cycloidal pendulum BP at the point F, varies as the arch which it describes.\n\nThe velocity of the pendulum at F is that which it would have acquired by falling through EF (Prop. 2. and Cor. 3. Prop. 2.), and the velocity of a falling body is as the square root of the space which it describes (Dynamics, § 37.), therefore the velocity of the pendulum P, when it reaches F, varies as $\\sqrt{EF}$. But (Geometry, Sect. IV. Theor. 23. and 8.) FE varies as $FN^2$, and since FC is a constant quantity, FE will vary as FN varies, or, to adopt the notation used in the article Dynamics, $FE = FN^2$, or $\\sqrt{FE} = FN$, but the velocity acquired by falling through EF varies as $\\sqrt{FE}$, therefore the velocity of the pendulum at F varies as FN, that is, as FP, for (Art. 232. No. 5.) FN is equal to half FP. Q. E. D.\n\nProp. VI.\n\n237. If the pendulum begins its oscillation from the point P, the velocity of the pendulum at any point R varies as the fine of a circular arc whose radius is FP, and whose versed fine is PR.\n\nThrough F draw FP parallel to AD, and with a radius equal to the cycloidal arc FP, describe the semicircle p o q. Make pr equal to the arc PR of the cycloid, and through r draw rm perpendicular to FP. Through the points P, R draw PE, RT parallel to AD, and cutting the generating circle CNF in the points N, S.—By Prop. 4., the velocity at R varies as $\\sqrt{ET}$, that is, as $\\sqrt{EF - TF}$, or since CF is constant, as $\\sqrt{CF \\times EF - CF \\times TF}$, that is, as $\\sqrt{FN^2 - FS^2}$, (For, Playfair's Euclid, Book I. Prop. 47., Book II. Prop. 7. and Book III. Prop. 35.; FN = CF × EF, and FS = CF × TF), that is, as $\\sqrt{FN^2 - FS^2}$, that is (Art. 232. No. 5.) as $\\sqrt{FP^2 - FR^2}$. But FP or FM was made equal to FP, and, pr being made equal to PR, the remainder FR must be equal to FR; therefore, the velocity at R varies as $\\sqrt{FM^2 - FR^2}$, but (Euclid 47. i.) $r m = \\sqrt{FM^2 - FR^2}$, and r m is by construction equal to the fine of a circular arc, whose radius is FP, and versed fine PR, consequently, the velocity at R varies as the fine of that arc. Q. E. D.\n\n238. Corollary. The velocity of the pendulum at F is to the velocity of the pendulum at R, as FM : r m, for the versed fine is in this case equal to radius, and therefore the corresponding arc must be a quadrant whose fine is also equal to radius or FM.\n\nProp. VII.\n\n239. The time in which the pendulum performs one complete oscillation from P to O, is equal to the time in which a body would describe the semicircle p o q, uniformly with the velocity which the pendulum acquires at the point F.\n\nTake any infinitely small arc RV, and making rv equal to it, draw vo parallel to rm, and mn to rv. Now, by the last proposition, and by Dynamics, Art. 28.; the velocity with which RV is described is to the velocity with which mo is described as rm is to FM, that\nMECHANICS.\n\nTheory.\n\nThat is as \\( \\frac{RV}{rm} : \\frac{mo}{Fm} \\) or as \\( \\frac{m}{r} : \\frac{m_o}{Fm} \\), for \\( m = rv = RV \\).\n\nBut in the similar triangles \\( Fmr, mn_o, Fm : r = m : m_o : mn \\), consequently \\( \\frac{m}{r} = \\frac{m_o}{Fm} \\); therefore the velocity with which \\( RV \\) is described is equal to the velocity with which \\( mo \\) is described, and the times in which these equal spaces are described must likewise be equal.\n\nThe same thing may be demonstrated of all the other corresponding arcs of the cycloid and circle, and therefore it follows that the time in which the pendulum performs one complete oscillation is equal to the time in which the semicircle \\( p o q \\) is uniformly described with the velocity acquired at \\( F \\).\n\nPROP. VIII.\n\n240. The time in which a cycloidal pendulum performs a complete oscillation is to the time in which a body would fall freely through the axis of the cycloid, as the circumference of a circle is to its diameter.\n\nSince \\( FP = 2FN \\), and since the velocity acquired by falling down \\( NF \\) is equal to the velocity acquired by falling down \\( PF \\), the body, if it continued to move uniformly with this velocity, would describe a space equal to \\( 2PF \\) (Dynamics, § 37, No. 6.) in the same time that it would descend \\( NF \\) or \\( CF \\) (Art. 219). Calling \\( T \\) therefore the time of an oscillation, and \\( t \\) the time of descent along the axis, we have, by the preceding proposition,\n\n\\[ T = \\text{time along } p o q, \\text{ with the velocity at } F, \\]\n\nand by the preceding paragraph,\n\n\\[ t = \\text{time along } Fp, \\text{ with the same velocity}; \\text{ therefore } \\]\n\n\\[ T : t = \\text{time along } p o q \\text{ with velocity at } V : \\text{ time along } Fp \\text{ with the same velocity}; \\text{ that is, } T : t = p o q : Fp = 2poq : 2Fp = \\text{the circumference of a circle : its diameter}. \\]\n\n241. COR. 1. The oscillations in a cycloid are isochronous, that is, they are performed in equal times whatever be the size of the arc which the pendulum describes. For the time of an oscillation has a constant ratio to the time of descent along the axis, and is therefore an invariable quantity.\n\n242. COR. 2. The oscillations in a small circular arc whose radius is \\( BF \\), and in an equal arc of the cycloid, being isochronous (Art. 232, No. 8.), the time of an oscillation in a small circular arc will also be to the time of descent along the axis, as the circumference of a circle is to its diameter.\n\n243. COR. 3. Since the length \\( BF \\) of the pendulum is double of the axis \\( CF \\), the time of an oscillation in a cycloid or small circular arc varies as the time of descending along \\( CF \\); half the length of the pendulum, the force of gravity being constant. But the time of descent along \\( CF \\) varies as \\( \\sqrt{CF} \\), therefore the time of an oscillation in a small circular or cycloidal arc varies as the square root of half the length of the pendulum, or as the square root of its whole length. If \\( T, l \\) therefore be the times of oscillations of two pendulums, and \\( L, l \\) their respective lengths, we have by this corollary \\( T : l = \\sqrt{L} : \\sqrt{l}, \\) and \\( T \\times \\sqrt{l} = l \\times \\sqrt{L} \\); hence\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{T \\times \\sqrt{L}}{\\sqrt{l}}, \\quad l = \\frac{l \\times \\sqrt{L}}{T}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad L = \\frac{T \\times \\sqrt{l}}{l}, \\]\n\nfrom which we may find the time in which a pendulum of any length will vibrate; a pendulum of 39.2 inches vibrating in one second.\n\n244. COR. 4. When the force of gravity varies, which it does in going from the poles to the equator, the time of an oscillation is directly as the square root of the length of the pendulum, and inversely as the square root of the force of gravity. The time of an oscillation varies as the time of descent along half the length of the pendulum, and the time of descent through any space varies as \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{s}}{\\sqrt{g}} \\), where \\( s \\) is the space described and \\( g \\) the force of gravity; but in the present case \\( s = \\frac{L}{2} \\); therefore, by substitution, the time of descent along half the length of the pendulum, or the time of an oscillation, varies as \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{L}}{\\sqrt{g}} \\), or as \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{L}}{\\sqrt{g}} \\).\n\nHence \\( T : l = \\frac{\\sqrt{L}}{\\sqrt{g}} : \\frac{\\sqrt{l}}{\\sqrt{g}} \\), from which it is easy to deduce equations similar to those given in the preceding corollary.\n\n245. COR. 5. Since \\( T = \\frac{\\sqrt{L}}{\\sqrt{g}} \\), \\( \\sqrt{g} \\times T = \\sqrt{L} \\); and if the time of oscillation is 1 second, we have \\( \\sqrt{g} = \\sqrt{L} \\), or \\( g = L \\), that is, the force of gravity in different latitudes varies as the length of a pendulum that vibrates seconds.\n\n246. COR. 6. The number of oscillations which a pendulum makes in a given time, and in a given latitude, are in the inverse subduplicate ratio of its length. The number of oscillations \\( n \\) made in a given time are evidently in the inverse ratio of \\( t \\), the time of each oscillation; that is \\( n : t = 1 : t \\); but by Corollary 3, \\( t = \\sqrt{L} \\), therefore \\( n : \\sqrt{L} = 1 : \\sqrt{t} \\), and \\( l = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\), from which it is easy to find the length of a pendulum which will vibrate any number of times in a given time, or the number of vibrations which a pendulum of a given length will perform in a given time.\n\nPROP. IX.\n\n247. To find the space through which a heavy body will fall in one second by the force of gravity.\n\nSince by Proposition 8, the time of an oscillation: time along half the length of the pendulum as 3.14159 is to 1, and since the spaces are as the squares of the times, the spaces described by a heavy body in the time of an oscillation will be to half the length of the pendulum as 3.14159 is to 1. Now it appears from the experiments of Mr Whitehurst, that the length of a pendulum which vibrates seconds at London at 113 feet above the level of the sea, in a temperature of\nMECHANICS\n\n60° of Fahrenheit, and when the barometer is 30 inches, is \\( \\frac{39.1196}{2} = 19.5598 \\times \\frac{3.14159^2}{2} = 16.087 \\) feet the space required.\n\nThe methods of determining the centre of oscillation, gyration, and percussion, properly belong to this chapter, but they have been already given in the article Rotation, to which we must refer the reader who wishes to prosecute the subject.\n\nCHAP. VI. On the Collision or Impulsion of Bodies.\n\n248. Def. 1. When a body moving with a certain velocity strikes another body, either at rest or in motion, the one is said to impinge against, or to impell the other. This effect has been distinguished by the names collision, impulsion or impulse, percussion, and impact.\n\n249. Def. 2. The collision or impulsion of two bodies is said to be direct when the bodies move in the same straight line, or when the point in which they strike each other is in the straight line which joins their centres of gravity. When this is not the case, the impulse is said to be oblique.\n\n250. Def. 3. A hard body is one which is not susceptible of compression by any finite force. An elastic body is one susceptible of compression, which recovers its figure with a force equal to that which compresses it. A soft body is one which does not recover its form after compression. There does not exist in nature any body which is either perfectly hard, perfectly elastic or perfectly soft. Every body with which we are acquainted possesses elasticity in some degree or other. Diamond, crystal, agate, &c., though among the hardest bodies, are highly elastic; and even clay itself will in some degree recover its figure after compression. It is necessary, however, to consider bodies as hard, soft, or elastic, in order to obtain the limits between which the required results must be contained.\n\n251. Def. 4. The mass of a body is the sum of the material particles of which it is composed; and the momentum, or moving force, or quantity of motion of any body is the product arising from multiplying its mass by its velocity.\n\nPROP. I.\n\n252. Two hard bodies B, B' with velocities V, V' striking each other perpendicularly, will be at rest after impulse, if their velocities are inversely as their masses.\n\n1. When the two bodies are equal, their velocities must be equal in the case of an equilibrium after impulse, and therefore \\( B : B' = V : V' \\), or \\( BV = B'V' \\); for if they are not at rest after impulse, the one must carry the other along with it. But as their masses and velocities are equal, there can be no reason why the one should carry the other along with it.\n\n2. If the one body is double of the other, or \\( B = 2B' \\), we should have \\( V' = 2V \\). Now instead of B we may substitute two bodies equal to B', and instead of V' we may substitute two velocities equal to V, with which the bodies B' may be conceived to move; consequently we have \\( 2B' \\times V = B' \\times 2V \\), or \\( B' : 2B' = V : 2V \\); but \\( 2V \\) is the velocity of B', and V is the velocity of 2B', therefore when one body is double of the other, they will remain at rest when the masses of the bodies are inversely as their velocities.\n\nIn the same way the proposition may be demonstrated when the bodies are to one another in any commensurable proportion.\n\nPROP. II.\n\n253. To find the common velocity v of two hard bodies B, B' whose velocities are V, V', after striking each other perpendicularly.\n\nIf the bodies have not equal quantities of motion they cannot be in equilibrium after impulse. The one will carry the other along with it, and in consequence of their hardness, they will remain in contact, and move with a common velocity v.\n\n1. In order to find this, let us first suppose B' to be at rest and to be struck by B in motion. The quantity of motion which exists in B before impulse is BV, and as this is divided between the two bodies after impulse, it must be equal to the quantity of motion after impulse. But \\( v \\times (B + B') = BV \\), and \\( v = \\frac{BV}{B + B'} \\).\n\n2. Let us now suppose that both the bodies are in motion in the same direction that B follows B'. In order that B may impel B', we must have V greater than V'. Now we may conceive both the bodies placed upon a plane moving with the velocity V'. The body B', therefore, whole velocity is V' equal to that of the plane, will be at rest upon the plane, while the velocity of B with regard to B', or the plane, will be \\( V - V' \\); consequently, the bodies are in the same circumstances as if B' were at rest, and B moving with the velocity \\( V - V' \\). Therefore, by the last case, we have the common velocity of the bodies in the moveable plane \\( \\frac{BV - B'V'}{B + B'} \\); and by adding to this V', the velocity of the plane, we shall have v, or the absolute velocity of the bodies after impulse, \\( v = \\frac{BV + B'V'}{B + B'} \\).\n\nHence the quantity of motion, after impact, is equal to the sum of the quantities of motion before impact.\n\n3. If the impinging bodies mutually approach each other, we may conceive, as before, that the body B' is at rest upon a plane which moves with a velocity V' in an opposite direction to V, and that B moves on this plane with the velocity \\( V + V' \\). Then, by Case 1, \\( \\frac{BV + B'V'}{B + B'} \\) will be the common velocity upon the plane after impulse; and adding to this V', or the velocity of the plane, we shall have v, or the absolute velocity of the bodies after impact, \\( v = \\frac{BV - B'V'}{B + B'} \\). Hence the quantity of motion after impact is equal to the difference of the quantities of motion before impact. It is obvious that v is positive or negative, according as BV is greater or less than B'V', so that when BV is greater than B'V', the bodies will move in the direction of B's\nMECHANICS.\n\nTheory. B's motion; and when BV is less than B'V', the bodies will move in the direction of A's motion.\n\n254. All the three formulae which we have given, may be comprehended in the following general formula:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{BV - B'V'}{B + B'} \\]\n\nfor when B' is at rest, V' = 0, and the formula attains the form which it has in Case 1.\n\n255. Cor. 1. If B = B', and the bodies mutually approach each other, the equation in Case 3 becomes\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{V - V'}{2} \\]\n\nor the bodies will move in the direction of the quickest body, with a velocity equal to one half of the difference of their velocities.\n\n256. Cor. 2. If V = V', and the bodies move in the same direction, the last formula will become\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{B + B'}{B + B'} \\times V \\]\n\nor \\( v = V \\); for in this case there can be no impulsion, the one body merely following the other in contact with it. When the bodies mutually approach each other, and when V = V', we have\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{B - B'}{B + B'} \\times V \\]\n\n257. Cor. 3. When the bodies move in the same direction, we have, by Case 2,\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{BV + B'V'}{B + B'} \\]\n\nNow the velocity gained by B' is evidently\n\n\\[ v = V' - V \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{BV - B'V'}{B + B'} \\]\n\nhence\n\n\\[ B + B' : B = V - V' : B + B' \\]\n\nbut this last term is the velocity gained by B, and V - V' is the relative velocity of the two bodies. Therefore, in the impact of two hard bodies moving in the same direction, B + B' : B as the relative velocity of the two bodies is to the velocity gained by B'. It is obvious also, that the velocity lost by B is\n\n\\[ V - V' = \\frac{BV + B'V'}{B + B'} \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ V - V' = \\frac{BV - B'V'}{B + B'} \\]\n\nbut this last term is the velocity lost by B, and V - V' is the relative velocity of the bodies, therefore in the impact of two hard bodies B + B' : B as their relative velocity is to the velocity lost by B. The same thing may be shown when the bodies move in opposite directions, in which case their relative velocity is V + V'.\n\nPROP. III.\n\n258. To determine the velocities of two elastic bodies after impulse.\n\nIf an elastic body strikes a hard and immoveable plane, it will, at the instant of collision, be compressed at the place of contact. But as the elastic body instantaneously endeavours to recover its figure, and as this force of restitution is equal and opposite to the force of compression, it will move backwards from the plane in the same direction in which it advanced.—If two elastic bodies, with equal momenta, impinge against each other, the effect of their mutual compression is to destroy their relative velocity, and make them move with a common velocity, as in the case of hard bodies. But by the force of restitution, equal to that of compression, the bodies begin to recover their figure,—the parts in contact serve mutually as points of support, and the bodies recede from each other. Now, before the force of restitution began to exert itself, the bodies had a tendency to move in one direction with a common momentum; therefore, the body whose effort to recover its figure was in the same direction with that of the common momentum, will move on in that direction, with a momentum or moving force equal to the sum of the force of restitution and the common momentum; while the other body, whose effort to recover from compression is in a direction opposite to that of the common momentum, will move with a momentum equal to the difference between its force of restitution and the common momentum, and in the direction of the greatest of these momenta: After impulse, therefore, it either moves in the direction opposite to that of the common momentum, or its motion in the same direction as that of the common momentum is diminished, or it is stopped altogether, according as the force of restitution is greater, less, or equal to the common momentum.\n\n259. In order to apply these preliminary observations, let us adopt the notation in the two preceding propositions, and let v be the common velocity which the bodies would have received after impulse, if they had been hard, and v', v\" the velocities which the elastic bodies B, B' receive after impact.\n\n260. 1. If B follows B', then V is greater than V', and when B has reached B', they are both compelled at the point of impact. Hence, since v is the common velocity with which they would advance if the force of restitution were not exerted, we have V - v = the velocity lost by B, and v - V' = the velocity gained by B' in consequence of compression.—But, when the bodies strive to recover their form by the force of restitution, the body B will move backwards in consequence of this force, while B' will move onward in its former direction with an accelerated velocity. Hence, from the force of restitution, B will again lose the velocity V - v, and B' will, a second time, gain the velocity v - V'; consequently, the whole velocity lost by B is 2 V - 2 v, and the whole velocity gained by B' is 2 v - 2 V'. Now, subtracting this loss from the original velocity of B, we have V - 2 V - 2 v, for the velocity of B after impact, and adding the velocity gained by B to its original velocity, we have V + 2 v - 2 V' for the velocity of B' after impact; hence we have\n\n\\[ v' = V - 2 V - 2 v = 2 v - V \\]\n\n\\[ v'' = V' + 2 v - 2 V' = 2 v - V. \\]\n\nNow, substituting in these equations, the value of v as found in Case 2, Prop. 2, we obtain\n\n\\[ v' = \\frac{BV - B'V + 2 B'V'}{B + B'} \\]\n\n\\[ v'' = \\frac{BV - B'V + 2 BV}{B + B'} \\]\n\n261. 2. When the bodies move in opposite directions or mutually approach each other, the body B is in precisely the same circumstances as in the preceding case; but\nbut the body $B'$ loses a part of its velocity equal to $\\frac{2}{v+2} V' - V$. Hence we have, by the same reasoning that was employed in the preceding case,\n\n$$v' = \\frac{2}{v+2} V'$$\n\nand by substituting instead of $v$ its value, as determined in Cafe 3, Prop. 2, or by merely changing the sign of $V'$ in the two last equations in the preceding corollary, we obtain the two following equations, which will answer for both cases, by using the upper sign when the bodies move in the same direction, and the under sign when they move in opposite directions.\n\n$$v' = \\frac{BV - B'V + 2B'V'}{B + B'}$$\n\n$$v'' = \\frac{BV - B'V + 2BV}{B + B'}$$\n\nFrom the preceding equation the following corollaries may be deduced.\n\n262. Cor. 1. The velocity gained by the body that is struck, and the velocity lost by the impinging body, are twice as great in elastic as they are in hard bodies; for in hard bodies the velocities gained and lost were $v - V$, and $V - v$; whereas in elastic bodies the velocities gained and lost were $2v - 2V$, and $2V - 2v$.\n\n263. Cor. If one of the bodies, suppose $B'$, is at rest, its velocity $V' = 0$, and the preceding equation becomes\n\n$$v' = \\frac{VB - VB'}{B + B'}; \\quad v'' = \\frac{2VB}{B + B'}$$\n\n264. Cor. 3. If one of the bodies $B'$ is at rest, and their masses equal, we have $B = B'$, and $V' = 0$, by substituting which in the preceding formulae, we obtain $v' = 0$, and $v'' = V$; that is, the impinging body $B$ remains at rest after impact, and the body $B'$ that is struck when at rest moves on with the velocity of the body $B$ that struck it, so that there is a complete transfer of $B$'s velocity to $B'$.\n\n265. Cor. 4. If $B'$ is at rest and $B$ greater than $B'$, both the bodies will move forward in the direction of $B$'s motion; for it is obvious from the equations in Cor. 2, that when $B$ is greater than $B'$, $v'$ and $v''$ are both positive.\n\n266. Cor. 5. If $B'$ is at rest, and $B$ less than $B'$, the impinging body $B$ will return backwards, and the body $B'$ which is struck will move forward in the direction in which $B$ moved before the stroke. For it is evident that when $B$ is less than $B'$, $v'$ is negative, and $v''$ positive.\n\n267. Cor. 6. If both the bodies move in the same direction, the body $B'$ that is struck will after impact move with greater velocity than it had before it. This is obvious from the formula in Cafe 1, of this proposition.\n\n268. Cor. 7. If the bodies move in the same direction, and if $B = B'$, there will at the moment of impact be a mutual transfer of velocities, that is, $B$ will move on with $B'$s velocity, and $B'$ will move on with $B$'s velocity. For in the formulae in Cafe 1, when $B = B'$, we have $v' = V'$ and $v'' = V$.\n\n269. Cor. 8. When the bodies move in opposite directions, or mutually approach other, and when $B = B'$ and $V = V'$, both the bodies will recoil or move backwards after impact with the same velocities which they had before impact. For in the formulae in Cafe 2, with the inferior signs, when $B = B'$ and $V = V'$, we have $v' = -V$ and $v'' = V'$.\n\n270. Cor. 9. If the bodies move in opposite directions, and $V = V'$, we have $v' = V \\times \\frac{B - 3B'}{B + B'}$, and $v'' = V \\times \\frac{3B - B'}{B + B'}$. Hence it is obvious, that if $B = 3B'$, or if one of the impinging bodies is thrice as great as the other, the greatest will be stopped, and the smallest will recoil with a velocity double of that which it had before impact. For since $B = 3B'$, by substituting this value of $B$ in the preceding equations, we obtain $v' = 0$, and $v'' = 2V$.\n\n271. Cor. 10. If the impinging bodies move in opposite directions, and if $B = B'$, they will both recoil after a mutual exchange of velocities. For when $B = B'$, we have $v' = -V'$, and $v'' = V$.\n\n272. Cor. 11. When the bodies move in opposite directions, the body which is struck, and the body which strikes it, will stop, continue their motion or return backwards according as $BV - B'V$ is equal to, or greater or less than $2B'V$.\n\n273. Cor. 12. The relative velocity of the bodies after impact, is equal to their relative velocity before impact, or, which is the same thing, at equal instants before and after impact, the distance of the bodies from each other is the same. For in the different cases we have $v' = 2v - V$; $v'' = 2v - V'$. But the relative velocity before impact is in the different cases $V = V'$, and the relative velocity after impact is $v' = v'' = V = V'$.\n\n274. Cor. 13. By reasoning similar to that which was employed in Prop. 2, Cor. 3, it may be shewn that $B + B' : 2B$ as their relative velocity before impact is to the velocity gained by $B'$ in the direction of $B$'s motion; and $B + B' : 2B'$ as their relative velocity before impact is to the velocity lost by $B$ in the direction of $A$'s motion.\n\n275. Cor. 14. The vis viva, or the sum of the products of each body multiplied by the square of its velocity, is the same before and after impact, that is, $Bv^2 + B'v'^2 = BV^2 + B'V'^2$. From the formulae at the end of Cafe 2, we obtain\n\n$$Bv^2 = \\frac{B - B'}{B + B'} \\times \\frac{BV^2 + B'V'^2}{B + B'}$$\n\n$$B'v'^2 = \\frac{BB' \\times BV^2 + B'V'^2}{B + B'}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{B - B'}{B + B'} \\times \\frac{BV^2 + B'V'^2}{B + B'}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{BB' \\times BV^2 + B'V'^2}{B + B'}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{BV^2 + B'V'^2}{B + B'}$$\n\n276. Cor. 14. If several equal elastic bodies $B$, $B'$, $B''$, $B'''$, &c., are in contact, and placed in the same straight line, and if another elastic body $\\beta$ of the same magnitude impinges against $B$, they will remain at rest, except the last body $B'''$, which will move on with the velocity of $\\beta$. By Art. 264, $B$ will transfer\nTheory. to B'' all its velocity, and therefore B will be at rest, in the same way B'' will transfer to B''' all its velocity, and B''' will remain at rest, and so on with the rest; but when the last body B''''' is set in motion, there is no other body to which its velocity can be transferred, and therefore it will move on with the velocity which it received from B'', that is, with the velocity of B.\n\n277. Cor. 15. If the bodies decrease in size from B to B'''''', they will all move in the direction of the impinging body B, and the velocity communicated to each body will be greater than that which is communicated to the preceding body.\n\n278. Cor. 16. If the bodies increase in magnitude, they will all recoil, or move in a direction opposite to that of B, excepting the last, and the velocity communicated to each body will be less than that which is communicated to the preceding body.\n\nProp. IV.\n\n279. To determine the velocities of two imperfectly elastic bodies after impulse, the force of compression being in a given ratio to the force of restitution or elasticity.\n\nLet B, B' be the two bodies, V, V' their velocities before impact, v, v' their velocities after impact, and 1 : n as the force of compression is to that of restitution. It is evident from Cafe 1. Prop. 8. that in consequence of the force of compression alone we have,\n\n\\[ V - v = \\text{velocity lost by } B \\]\n\\[ v - V' = \\text{velocity gained by } B' \\]\n\nBut the velocity which B loses and B' gains by the force of compression will be to the velocity which B loses and B' gains by the force of restitution or elasticity as 1 : n; hence\n\n\\[ 1 : n = V - v : n V - n v, \\text{the velocity lost by } B \\]\n\\[ 1 : n = v - V' : n v - n V' \\text{the velocity gained by } B' \\]\n\ntherefore by adding together the two portions of velocity lost by B, and also those gained by B', we obtain\n\n\\[ 1 + n V - 1 + n v, \\text{the whole velocity lost by } B, \\]\n\\[ 1 + n v - 1 + n V', \\text{the whole velocity gained by } B \\]\n\nHence by subtracting the velocity lost by B in consequence of collision from its velocity before impact, we shall have v' or the velocity of B after impact, and by adding the velocity gained by B' after collision to its velocity before impact, we shall find v'' or the velocity of B' after impact, thus\n\n\\[ v' = V - 1 + n V - 1 + n v \\text{the velocity of } B \\text{ after impact}, \\]\n\\[ v'' = V' + 1 + n v - 1 + n V' \\text{the velocity of } B' \\text{ after impact}. \\]\n\nNow by substituting in the place of v its value as determined in Cafe 2. Prop. 2. we obtain\n\n\\[ v' = V - 1 + n \\times B'V - B'V' \\]\n\\[ v'' = V' + 1 + n \\times BV - BV' \\]\n\n280. Cor. 1. Hence by converting the preceding equation into analogies, B + B : 1 + n × B as the relative velocity of the bodies before impact is to the velocity gained by B' in the direction of B's motion; and B + B' : 1 + n × B' as the relative velocity of the bodies before impact is to the velocity lost by B.\n\n281. Cor. 2. The relative velocity before impact is to the relative velocity after impact as the force of compression is to the force of restitution, or as 1 : n.\n\nThe relative velocity after impact is v'' - v', or taking the preceding values of these quantities v'' - v' = V'\n\n\\[ + \\frac{1 + n \\times B'V - B'V'}{B + B'} - V - \\frac{1 + n \\times B'V - B'V'}{B + B'} = V' - \\]\n\n\\[ V + \\frac{1 + n \\times B + B' \\times V - V'}{B + B'}, \\text{dividing by } B + B' \\text{we have} \\]\n\n\\[ v'' - v' = V' - V - V' + n \\times V - V' = n \\times V - V' \\]\n\n= the relative velocity after impact. But the relative velocity before impact is V - V', and V - V' : n × V - V' = 1 : n. Q. E. D. The quantity V' has evidently the negative sign when the bodies move in opposite directions.\n\n282. Cor. 3. Hence from the velocities before and after impact we may determine the force of restitution or elasticity.\n\nProp. V.\n\n283. To find the velocity of a body, and the direction in which it moves after impinging upon a hard and immoveable plane.\n\n284. Case 1. When the impinging body is perfectly hard. Let AB be the hard and immoveable plane, body be perfectly hard and let the impinging body move towards AB in the direction CD, Fig. 6. Then the velocity CD may be resolved into the two velocities CM, MD, or MD, FD; CM DF being a parallelogram. But the part of the velocity FD, which carries the body in a line perpendicular to the plane, is completely destroyed by impact, while the other part of the velocity MD, which carries the body in a line parallel to the plane, will not be affected by the collision, therefore the body will, after impact, move along the plane with the velocity MD. Now, CD : MD = radius : cof. ∠CDM, therefore since MD = CF the fine of the angle of incidence CDF, the velocity before impact is to the velocity after impact, as radius is to the fine of the angle of incidence; and since AM = CD - MD, the velocity before impact is to the velocity lost by impact, as radius is to the versed sine of the complement of the angle of incidence.\n\n285. Case 2. When the impinging body is perfectly elastic. Let the body move in the direction CD with body be perfectly elastic a velocity represented by CD, which, as formerly, may be resolved to MD, FD. The part of the velocity MD remains after impact, and tends to carry the body parallel to the plane. The other part of the velocity FD is destroyed by compression; but the force of restitution or elasticity will generate a velocity equal to FD, but in the opposite direction DF. Consequently the impinging body after impact is solicited by two velocities, one of which would carry it uniformly from D to F in the same time that the other would carry it uniformly from M to D, or from D to N; the body will, therefore...\nMechanics.\n\n286. Case 3. When the impinging body is imperfectly elastic. In DF take a point m, so that DF is to DM as the force of compression is to the force of restitution or elasticity, and having drawn me parallel to DB, and meeting NE in e, join De; then, if the impinging body approach the plane in the direction CD, with a velocity represented by CD, De will be the direction in which it will move after impact. Immediately after compression, the velocity DF is destroyed as in the last case, while the velocity MD tends to carry the body parallel to the plane. But, by the force of restitution, the body would be carried uniformly along DM, perpendicular to the plane, while, by the velocity MD = DN = me, it would be carried in the same time along me, consequently, by means of these two velocities, the body will describe De, the diagonal of the parallelogram Dm e N. The velocity, therefore, before impact is to the velocity after impact as DC : De, or as DE : De, or as fin. De e, fin. DE e, or as fin. Dem : fin. DE e, or as fin. FD e : fin. FDE. Now, by producing De so as to meet the line CE produced in G, we have, on account of the parallels FE, me, DM : DF = me : FG; but, FD being radius, FE is the tangent of FDE, or FDG the angle of incidence, and FDG is the tangent of the angle of reflection FDG: Therefore DM : DF = tang. CDF : tang. FDG. Consequently, when an imperfectly elastic body impinges against a plane, it will be reflected in such a manner that the tangent of the angle of reflection is to the tangent of the angle of incidence, as the force of compression is to the force of restitution or elasticity; and the velocity before incidence will be to the velocity after reflection, as the sine of the angle of reflection is to the sine of the angle of incidence.\n\nScholium.\n\n287. When the surface against which the body impinges is curved, we must conceive a plane touching the surface at the place of incidence, and then apply the rules in the preceding proposition. The doctrine of the oblique collision of bodies is of great use both in acoustics and optics, where the material particles which suffer reflection, are regarded as perfectly elastic bodies.\n\nProp. VI.\n\n288. To find the point of an immovable plane which an elastic body moving from a given place must strike, in order that it may, after reflection, either from one or two planes, impinge against another body whose position is given.\n\nFig. 7.\n\n289. Case 1. When there is only one reflection. Let C be the place from which the impinging body is to move, and let E be the body which is to be struck after reflection from the plane AB. From C let fall CH perpendicular to AB, continue it towards C till HG = CH, and join G, E by the line GDE; the point D where this line cuts the plane, is the place against which the body at C must impinge in order that, after reflection, it may strike the body at E. The triangles CDH, HDG are equiangular, because two sides and one angle of each are respectively equal, therefore the angles DCH, DCH are equal. But on account of the parallels FD, CG the angle EDF = DGC = DCH, and DCH = FLC, therefore the angle of incidence FDC = FDE the angle of reflection; consequently by Prop. 4, a body moving from C and impinging on the plane at D will, after reflection, move in the line DE, and strike the body at E.\n\n290. Case 2. When there are two reflections. Let Fig. 8. AB, BL be the two immovable planes, C the place from which the impinging body is to move, and F the body which it is to strike after reflection from the two planes, it is required to find the point of impact D. Draw CHG perpendicular to AB, so that HG = CH. Through G draw GMN parallel to AB, cutting LB produced in M, and make GM = MN. Join N, F, and from the point E, where NF cuts the plane BL, draw EG, joining the points EG: the point D will be the point of the plane, against which the body at C must impinge, in order to strike the body at F. By reasoning as in the preceding case, it may be shown that the angle CDH = EDB, therefore DE will be the path of the body after the first reflection. Now, the triangles GEM, EMN are equiangular, because GM = MN, and the angles at M right, therefore DEB = FEL, that is, the body after reflection at E will strike the body placed at F.\n\nProp. VII.\n\n291. To determine the motions of two spherical bodies which impinge obliquely upon each other, when their motion, quantities of matter, and radii, are given.\n\nLet A, B be the two bodies, and let CA, DB be Fig. 9. the directions in which they move before impact, and let these lines represent their respective velocities. Join A, B the centres of the bodies, and produce it both ways to K and I. Draw LM perpendicular to IK, and it will touch the bodies at the point of impact. Now, the velocity CA may be resolved into the two velocities CI, IA, and the velocity DB into the velocities DK, KB, but CA and DB are given, and also the angles CAI, DBK, consequently CI and IA, and DK and KB may be found. The velocities CI, DK, which are parallel to the plane, will not be altered by collision, therefore IA, KB are the velocities with which the bodies directly impinge upon each other, consequently their effects or the velocities after impact may be found from Prop. 3.; let these velocities be represented by AN, BP. Take AF = CI and BH = DM, and having completed the parallelograms AFON, BPQH, draw the diagonals AO, BO. Then, since the body A is carried parallel to the line LM with a velocity CI = AF, and from the line LM by the velocity AN, it will describe AO, the diagonal of the parallelogram.\nMECHANICS.\n\n292. COROLLARY. If \\( A = B \\), and if the body which is struck moves in a given direction and with a given velocity after impact, the direction of the impinging body, and the velocity of its motion, may be easily found.

In the preceding proposition, we have endeavoured to give a short and perspicuous view of the common theory of impulsion. The limits of this article will not permit us to enter upon those interesting speculations to which this subject has given rise; but those who are anxious to pursue them will find ample assistance in the article IMPULSION, in the Supplement to the last edition of this work, where Dr Robison has treated the subject with his usual ability. It may be proper however to remark, that all the phenomena of impulse as well as prelure, are owing to the existence of forces which prevent the particles of matter from coming into mathematical contact. The body which is struck, in the case of collision, is put in motion by the mutual repulsion of the material particles at the point of impact, while the velocity of the impinging body is diminished by the same cause. Hence we see the absurdity of referring all motion to impulse, or of attempting to account for the phenomena of gravitation, electricity, and magnetism by the intervention of any invisible fluid. Even if the supposition that such a medium exists were not gratuitous, it would be impossible to show that its particles, by means of which the impulse is conveyed, are in contact with the particles of the body to which that impulse is communicated.\n\n294. A physico-mathematical theory of percussion, in which the impinging bodies are considered as imperceptibly elastic, has been lately given by Don Georges Juan, in his Examen Maritimo, a Spanish work which has been translated with additions by M. L'Eveque, under the title of Examen maritime, theorique et pratique, ou Traite de mecanique, appliquee a la construction, et a la manœuvre des vaisseaux et autres batiments. This theory has been embraced by many eminent French philosophers, and may be seen in Prony's Architecture Hydraulique, vol. i. p. 208, and in Gregory's Mechanics, vol. i. p. 291. We shall endeavour, under the article Percussion, to give a short account of this interesting theory, which has been found to accord with the most accurate experiments.\n\n295. In some cases of collision the results of experiments are rather at variance with those of theory, in consequence of the communication of motion not being exactly instantaneous. \"If an ivory ball (says Mr Leffice) strikes against another of equal weight, there should, according to the common theory, be an exact transfer of motion.\" But if the velocity of the impinging ball be very considerable, so far from stopping suddenly, it will recoil back again with the same force, while the ball which is struck will remain at rest; the reason is, that the shock is so momentary, as not to permit the communication of impulse to the whole mass of the second ball; a small spot only is affected, and the consequence is therefore the same as if the ball had impinged against an immovable wall. On a perfect acquaintance with such facts depends, in a great measure, the skill of the billiard player. It is on a similar principle that a bullet fired against a door which hangs freely on its hinges will perforate without affecting it in the least. Nay, a pellet of clay, a bit of tallow, or even a small bag of water, discharged from a pistol will produce the same effect. In all these instances the impression of the stroke is confined to a single spot, and no sufficient time is allowed for diffusing its action over the extent of the door. If a large stone be thrown with equal momentum, and consequently with smaller velocity, the effect will be totally reversed, the door will turn on its hinges, and yet scarcely a dent will be made on its surface. Hence likewise the theory of most of the tools, and their mode of application in the mechanical arts: the chisel, the saw, the file, the scythe, the hedge bill, &c.—In the process of cutting, the object is to concentrate the force in a very narrow space, and this is effected by giving the instrument a rapid motion. Hence, too, the reason why only a small hammer is used in riveting, and why a mallet is preferred for driving wedges.\"\n\nEnquiry into the Nature of Heat, p. 127,8.\n\n296. The successive propagation of motion may be illustrated by a very simple experiment. Take two balls of motion \\( A, B \\), of which \\( B \\) is very large when compared with illustrated \\( A \\), and connect them by a string \\( S \\) passing over the Fig. 11 pulley \\( P \\). If the ball \\( B \\) is lifted up towards \\( S \\) and allowed to fall by its own weight, instead of bringing the little ball \\( A \\) along with it, as might have been expected, the string will break at \\( P \\). Here it is evident that the motion is not propagated instantaneously, for the string is broken before the motion is communicated to the portion of the string between \\( P \\) and \\( A \\).\n\n297. An apparatus for making experiments on the collision of bodies is represented in fig. 12. The impinging bodies are suspended by threads like pendulums, and as the velocities acquired by descending through the arches of circles are in the ratio of their chords, the velocities of the impinging bodies may be easily ascertained. The apparatus is therefore furnished with a graduated arch \\( MN \\) which is generally divided into equal parts, though it would be more convenient to place the divisions at the extremities of arcs whose chords are expressed by the corresponding numbers. The balls that are not used may be placed behind the arc as at \\( m \\) and \\( n \\); and in order to give variety to the experiments, the balls may be of different sizes. Sometimes a dish like \\( G \\) is attached to the extremities of the strings, for the purpose of holding argillaceous balls, and balls of wax softened with a quantity of oil equal to one fourth part of their weight.—See Smeaton's Experiments on the Collision of Bodies.\nMECHANICS.\n\nCHAP. VII. On the Maximum Effects of Machines.\n\n298. We have already seen in some of the preceding chapters, that when two bodies act upon each other by the intervention either of a simple or compound machine, there is an equilibrium when the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the weight is to the power. In this situation of equilibrium, therefore, the velocity of the weight is nothing, and the power has no effect in raising the weight, or in other words, the machine performs no work. When the weight to be raised is infinitely small, the velocity is the greatest possible; but in this case likewise, the machine performs no work. In every other case, however, between these two extremes, some work will be performed.—In order to illustrate this more clearly, let us suppose a man employed in raising a weight by means of a lever with equal arms; and that he exerts a force upon the extremity of the lever, equivalent to 50 pounds. If the weight to be raised is also 50 pounds, there will be an equilibrium between the force of the man and the weight to be raised, the machine will remain at rest, and no work will be performed. If the man exert an additional force of one pound, or if his whole force is 51 pounds, the equilibrium will be destroyed, the weight will rise with a very slow motion, and the machine will therefore perform some work. When the motion of the machine therefore is — the work performed is also nothing, and when the machine is in such a state that the power preponderates, the work performed increases. Let us now suppose that the weight suspended from the lever is infinitely small, the motion of the machine will then be the greatest possible; but no work will be performed. If the weight however is increased, the motion of the machine will be diminished, and work will be performed. Here then it is evident that the work performed increases from nothing when the velocity is a maximum, and decreases to nothing when the velocity is a minimum. There must therefore be a particular velocity when the work performed is a maximum, and this particular velocity it is our present object to determine. Sometimes, indeed, the velocities of the machine are determined by its structure, and therefore it is out of the power of the mechanic to obtain a maximum effect by properly proportioning them. The same object however may be obtained, by making the work to be performed, or the resistance to be overcome, in a certain proportion to the power which is employed to perform the work or overcome the resistance.\n\n299. Def. 1.—In a machine performing work, the powers employed to begin and continue the motion of the machine, are called the first movers, the movers of powers; and those powers which oppose the production and continuance of motion are called resistances. The friction of the machine, the inertia of its parts, and the work to be performed, all oppose the production and continuance of motion, and are therefore the resistances to be overcome. When various powers act at the same time, and in different directions, the equivalent force which results from their combined action is called the moving force, and the force resulting from all the resisting forces, the resistance. If the machine, for example, is a lever AB moving round the centre F, by means of which, two men raise water out of two pump barrels by the chains A u, C w attached to the pistons, and passing over the arched heads or circular sectors M, N, for the purpose of giving the pistons and chains a vertical motion. Let the force of the man at B, six feet from F, be equal to 50 pounds, or π, his mechanical energy to turn the lever is $6 \\times 50 = 300$. Let the force of the other man applied at E, four feet from F, be also equal to 50 pounds, or ρ. His mechanical energy will be $4 \\times 50 = 200$, so that the whole moving power is equal to $300 + 200 = 500$. But if the two forces of 50 pounds, instead of being applied at two different distances from F, had been applied at the same point G, 5 feet from F, their energy to turn the lever would have been the same, for $5 \\times 50 + 50 = 500$. In the present case, therefore, the moving force is equivalent to $P \\times GF$, or a force of 100 pounds acting at a distance of five feet from the centre of motion. Now let us suppose that each piston A u, C w raises 60 pounds of water equivalent to the weights u, w, and that CF = 2 feet, and AF = 3 feet, then the mechanical energy of these weights will be respectively $2 \\times 60 = 120$, and $3 \\times 60 = 180$, and the sum of their energies = 300. But two forces of 60 pounds each, acting at the distances two feet and three feet from F, are equivalent to their sum = 120 pounds, acting at a distance of two feet and a half from F, for $\\frac{2}{3} \\times 120 = 300$; therefore, the resistance arising from the work to be performed, or from the water raised in the pump barrels, is equal to a weight P of 120 pounds acting at the distance DF = 2½ feet. But in addition to the resistance arising from the work to be performed, the two men have to overcome the resistance arising from the friction of the piston in the barrel, which we may suppose equivalent to $f_1$, each equal to 10 pounds, acting at the points A, C; but these forces are equivalent to 20 pounds, or $f_1 + f_2$ acting at D, therefore the resistance arising from the work and from friction is equal to 140 pounds, acting at the distance DF = 2 feet and a half. While the two men are employed in overcoming these resistances, they have also to contend against the inertia of the beam AF, and that of the chains and pistons, which we may suppose equal to 20 pounds when collected in their centre of gravity g, whose distance from F is 2.2 feet; but a weight of 20 pounds acting at the distance of 2.2 feet is equivalent to a weight of 19½ pounds, acting at the distance of 2.5 feet, or DF, consequently the sum of all the resistances when reduced to the same point D of the lever is equal to 159½ pounds acting at the distance of 2.5 feet from F. The mechanical energy, therefore, of the sum of all the resistances will be $2.5 \\times 159\\frac{1}{2} = 398.75$, while the energy of the moving force, or the sum of all the moving powers, is equal to 500.\n\n300. Def. 2.—The impelled point of a machine is that point to which the moving power is applied, if there is only one power, or that point to which all the moving powers are reduced, or at which the moving force is supposed to act. The working point of a machine is that point at which the resistance acts if it is single, or that point to which all the resistances are reduced, and at which they are supposed to act when combined. Thus in fig. 1, G is the impelled point of the machine, and Fig. 2, D the working point. Had a single force π been applied at the point B to raise a single weight u, acting at...\nat the point A, then B would have been the impelled point, and A the working point of the machine. In the wheel and axle, the point of the wheel at which the rope touches its circumference is the impelled point, while the working point is that point in the circumference of the axle where the rope which carries the weight is in contact with it.\n\n301. Def. 3.—The velocity of the moving power, and the velocity of the resistance, are respectively the same as the velocity of the impelled point, and the velocity of the working point.\n\n302. Def. 4.—The effect of a machine, or the work performed, is equal to the resistance multiplied by the velocity of the working point; for when any machine raises a mass of matter to a given height in a certain time, the effect produced is measured by the product of the mass, and the height through which it rises, that is, by the product of the mass by the velocity with which it moves.\n\n303. Def. 5.—The momentum of impulse is equal to the moving force multiplied by the velocity of the impelled point.\n\nIn any machine that has a motion of rotation, let \\( x \\) be the velocity of the impelled point, and \\( y \\) the velocity of the working point. When the machine is a lever, \\( x, y \\) will express the perpendiculars let fall from the centre of motion upon the line of direction in which the forces act; and if the machine is a wheel and axle, \\( x, y \\) will represent the diameters of the wheel and the axle respectively. In compound machines, which may be regarded as composed of levers, (Art. 90.) \\( x \\) will represent the sum of all the levers by which the power acts, and \\( y \\) the sum of all the levers by which the resistance acts.\n\nLet \\( P \\) be the real pressure which the moving power exerts at the impelled point of the machine, and \\( R \\) the actual pressure which the mere resistance of the work to be performed exerts at the working point, or which it directly opposes to the exertion of the power. Let \\( a \\) be the inertia of the power \\( P \\), or the mass of matter which the power \\( P \\) must move with the velocity of the impelled point, in order that \\( P \\) may exert its pressure at the impelled point; and let \\( b \\) be the inertia of the resistance \\( R \\), or the mass of matter which must be moved with the velocity of the working point in the performance of the work.\n\nSince the resistance arising from the friction of the communicating parts is an uniformly retarding force, it may be measured by a weight \\( \\varphi \\) acting at the working point of the machine, which will oppose the same resistance to the moving power as the friction of the parts.\n\nLet \\( m \\) be the inertia of the machine, or rather that quantity of matter, which acting at the working point of the machine will require the same part of the moving force to give it an angular motion, then since \\( y \\) represents the arm of the lever by which the resistance acts, or the distance of the working point from the centre of motion; and since the momentum of inertia, or the momentum with which any mass revolving round a centre resists being put in motion, is equal to its quantity of matter multiplied by the square of its distance from its centre of motion (see article ROTATION), we have \\( my^2 \\) for the momentum of inertia of the machine.\n\nIt is obvious that every machine opposes a certain resistance to any force that endeavours to give it an angular motion, and that this resistance will increase with the inertia of its parts. It is easy, therefore, to find a quantity of matter, which, when placed at any part of the machine, will oppose the same resistance to an angular motion, as the combined inertia of the various parts of the machine. This is the quantity of matter which we have called \\( m \\), and which we have supposed to act at the working point, because to that point all the other resistances have been reduced. Collecting the symbols, therefore, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\text{the velocity of the impelled point or the radius of the wheel, or the length of the lever by which the power acts.} \\\\\ny &= \\text{the velocity of the working point, or the radius of the axle, or the length of the lever by which the resistance acts against the power.} \\\\\nP &= \\text{the pressure exerted by the power at the impelled point of the machine.} \\\\\nR &= \\text{the pressure which the resistance arising from the work to be performed exerts at the working point of the machine.} \\\\\na &= \\text{the inertia of the power } P, \\text{ or the quantity of matter to which it must communicate the velocity of the impelled point.} \\\\\nb &= \\text{the inertia of the resistance } R, \\text{ or the quantity of matter which it must move with the velocity of the working point before any work is performed.} \\\\\n\\varphi &= \\text{a quantity of matter which, if placed at the working point of the machine, would oppose the same resistance to the moving power as that which arises from the friction of the communicating parts.} \\\\\nm &= \\text{the quantity of matter which, if placed at the working point of the machine, would oppose the same resistance to the production of an angular motion, that is opposed by the inertia of the various parts of which the machine is composed. Hence, by the principles of rotation, we have} \\\\\nmy^2 &= \\text{the momentum of inertia of the machine.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe are now prepared for determining the conditions of construction, which will enable any machine to produce a maximum effect.\n\nProp. I.\n\n308. To determine the velocities which must be given to the impelled and working points of a machine, or the ratio of the levers by which the power and resistance ought to act, in order to obtain a maximum effect.\n\nLet \\( AB \\) be a lever, whose fulcrum is \\( F \\), and to whose extremity \\( B \\) is applied the power \\( P \\) to overcome the resistance \\( R \\), and let \\( FB = x \\), and \\( FA = y \\). Then, by Art. 36, we shall have, from the following analogy, the weight which, placed at \\( B \\), would be in equilibrio with \\( R \\); \\( x : y = R : \\frac{Ry}{x} \\), the weight which will keep \\( R \\) in equilibrio, or the weight which is equal to\nMechanics.\n\nTheory. to that part of the power \\( P \\) which balances the resistance \\( R \\). Hence, \\( P - \\frac{R}{x} y \\) will be the effective force exerted by the power \\( P \\), which, multiplied by \\( x \\), its distance from the centre of motion, gives \\( Px - Ry \\) for the force which is exerted in giving an angular motion to the power and resistance. But the resistance of friction was supposed equal to the weight \\( \\phi \\) acting at the working point or at the distance \\( FA \\) or \\( y \\); consequently \\( \\phi y \\) will be the resistance which friction opposes to the force \\( Px - Ry \\), and therefore \\( Px - Ry - \\phi y \\) is the motive force exerted by \\( P \\). Now, the momentum of the inertia of the power \\( P \\), or the force with which it resists being put in motion, is \\( ax^2 \\), and the momentum of inertia of the resistance \\( R \\) is \\( by^2 \\), while the momentum of inertia of the machine is \\( my^2 \\). Therefore, the sum of these momenta, viz., \\( ax^2 + by^2 + my^2 \\) is the mass to be put in motion by the power \\( P \\). But, by Dynamics, § 167, the velocity generated in a given time is directly as the motive force, and inversely as the quantity of matter to which that force is applied. Hence the angular velocity, or the number of turns which the machine will make in a given time, is \\( \\frac{P}{ax^2 + by^2 + my^2} \\). But in every rotatory machine the velocities of its different parts are as their distance from the axis; hence, we shall have the velocities of the impelled and working points of the machine, by multiplying the angular velocity by \\( x, y \\) the distances of the impelled and working points of the machine from the centre of motion. Therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P}{ax^2 + by^2 + my^2} = \\text{the velocity of the impelled point,}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P}{ax^2 + by^2 + my^2} = \\text{the velocity of the working point of the machine; and multiplying by } R, \\text{ we have from Def. 4. }\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Pxy}{ax^2 + by^2 + my^2} = \\text{the work performed.}\n\\]\n\n309. But as forces are proportional to the velocities generated by them in equal times (Dynamics, § 153, Cor. 4. § 159), the preceding quantities will represent the accelerating forces. Now, the velocities are as the forces and times jointly (Dynamics, § 153.), that is, \\( v = Ft \\), or \\( s = gtF \\); but \\( F \\), the accelerating force, which generates the velocity of the impelled point, is represented by the formula \\( \\frac{P}{ax^2 + by^2 + my^2} \\). Therefore, \\( v \\), or the absolute velocity of the impelled point, is \\( \\frac{P}{ax^2 + by^2 + my^2} \\times g t \\), and the absolute velocity of the working point \\( \\frac{P}{ax^2 + by^2 + my^2} \\times g t \\). Again, by Def. 4, the effect of a machine, or the work performed, is equal to the resistance of the work multiplied by the velocity; consequently, since \\( R \\) is the work, we have, for the performance of the machine,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Pxy}{ax^2 + by^2 + my^2} = \\text{the work performed.}\n\\]\n\nNow, considering \\( y \\) as the variable quantity, and making the fluxion of the preceding formula \\( = 0 \\), we shall find that the performance of the machine is a maximum, when\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{a^2x^2 + P^2a \\times m + b^2}{Pm + Pb} \\times x.\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( R = 0 \\), we have\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{a^2x^2 + P^2a \\times m + b^2}{Pm + Pb} \\times x.\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( \\phi = 0 \\), the first formula becomes\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{a^2x^2 + P^2a \\times m + b^2}{Pm + Pb} \\times x.\n\\]\n\nWhen both \\( R \\) and \\( \\phi = 0 \\), we have, after reduction,\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{m + b}} \\times x.\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( b = 0 \\), the first formula becomes\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{a^2x^2 + P^2a \\times m + b^2}{Pm} \\times x.\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( R, \\phi \\) and \\( b = 0 \\), we have\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{m}} \\times x.\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( a : b = P : R \\), we have, by substituting \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) instead of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\),\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{P^2x^2 + P^2a \\times m + R^2}{Pm + PR} \\times x.\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( Pm \\) and \\( \\phi = 0 \\), the last formula becomes\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{P^2x^2 + P^2a \\times m + R^2}{Pm + PR} \\times x = \\frac{\\sqrt{P^2x^2 + P^2a \\times m + R^2}}{PR} \\times x.\n\\]\n\nand when \\( x = 1 \\), and \\( R = 1 \\), we have\n\n\\[\ny = \\sqrt{P + 1} - 1,\n\\]\n\nand when \\( P = 1 \\), and \\( x = 1 \\), we obtain\n\n\\[\ny = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{R} + 1} - 1.\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( x = 1 \\),\n\n\\[\ny = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{R} + 1} - 1.\n\\]\n\nThese various formulae, the application of which to particular cases shall be shown in the practical part of this article, give us values of \\( y \\) for almost every species of machinery; so that the mechanic may easily determine the velocities which must be given to the impelled and working points of the machine in order to produce a maximum effect.\n\n310. When the machine, however, is already constructed, the velocities of the impelled and working points cannot be changed, without altering the structure of the machine; and therefore we must find the ratio between the power and resistance, which will enable\nenable us to obtain a maximum effect. The method of determining this will be shewn in the following proposition.\n\n**Prop. II.**\n\n311. To determine the ratio between the power and the resistance of a machine when its performance is a maximum.\n\nSince the structure of the machine is given, the values of \\( x, y \\) are known, and therefore we have to determine the relative values of \\( P \\) and \\( R \\), when the effect of the machine is a maximum. This would be easily done, by making \\( R \\) variable in the formula which expresses the performance of the machine, and making its fluxion equal to 0, if none of the other quantities varied along with \\( R \\). It often happens, however, that while \\( R \\) varies, the mass \\( b \\) suffers a considerable change, though in other cases the change induced upon \\( b \\) is too unimportant to merit notice. This proposition, therefore, admits of two cases, 1. When the change upon \\( b \\) is so small that it may be safely omitted in the investigation; and, 2. When the change upon \\( b \\) is sufficiently great to require attention.\n\n312. **Case 1.** When \\( R \\) is the only quantity which is variable, the fluxion of the formula\n\n\\[\n\\frac{PxyR - Rx^2 - \\phi Ry^2}{a^2 + bx^2 + my^2},\n\\]\n\nwhich represents the work performed, is equal to the fluxion of the numerator, because the denominator is constant, that is, \\( PxyR - 2Rx^2 - \\phi Ry^2 = 0 \\), and dividing by \\( R \\); \\( Pxy - 2Rx^2 - \\phi y^2 = 0 \\), hence \\( 2Rx^2 = Pxy - \\phi y^2 \\), and \\( R = \\frac{Pxy - \\phi y^2}{2x^2} \\), which, divided by \\( y \\), gives \\( R = \\frac{Pxy - \\phi y}{2y} \\).\n\nNow, according to the experiments of Coulomb, the friction is, in general, proportional to the resisting pressure, or a certain part of that pressure, for example, \\( \\frac{1}{3}R \\); and calling \\( |Z| = \\frac{1}{3}R \\), and omitting \\( \\phi y \\), we have for the resistance \\( R = \\frac{Pxy}{2y} \\div \\frac{1}{3} \\), and making \\( P = 1 \\), and \\( x = 1 \\), we have \\( R = \\frac{1}{2} \\div \\frac{1}{3} \\), so that, abstracting from the quotient \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), which being little greater than 1, will not alter the result, the resistance should be one half of the force which would keep the impelling power in equilibrium.\n\n313. **Case 2.** When \\( b \\) varies at the same time with \\( R \\), it will in most cases vary in the same proportions, and therefore may be represented by any multiple of \\( R \\), as \\( dR \\), where \\( d \\) may be either an integer or a fraction. In order to simplify the investigation, we may consider the fraction \\( \\phi \\) as a resistance diminishing the impelling power, instead of regarding it as a resistance to be added to the other resisting forces. Thus the impelling power \\( P \\) will become \\( P - \\phi \\). In the same way we may consider the momentum of the machine's inertia applied to the impelled point, that is, instead of \\( my^2 \\) it may be made \\( mx^2 \\). Now making \\( P = \\phi \\), or the impelling power \\( = 1 \\), and making \\( x = 1 \\), we shall have by these substitutions in the formula which expresses the effect of the machine,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Ry - Rx^2}{a + m + dRy^2},\n\\]\n\nor, for the sake of simplicity, making \\( a + m = q \\), we have for the performance of the machine\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Ry - Rx^2}{q + dRy^2};\n\\]\n\nthen since \\( R \\) is the variable quantity, we shall find, after making the fluxion of this formula \\( = 0 \\), that the performance is a maximum when \\( R = \\frac{q^2 + qdy}{dRy^2} \\).\n\nWhen \\( b = R \\) then \\( d = 1 \\), and we shall have\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{q^2 + qy}{y^2}.\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( a = P \\) and \\( P = 1 \\), and when \\( m \\), the inertia of the machine, \\( = 0 \\), we shall have \\( a + m = 1 = q \\), and then the formula becomes\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{y + 1}{y^2}.\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( y = x \\), then \\( y = 1 \\), and\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{1 + 1}{1} = 0.4142.\n\\]\n\n**Scholium.**\n\n314. Those who wish to prosecute this interesting subject may consult the different papers of Euler in the Comment. Petropol. vol. x. p. 89, 1743, and in the Comment. Nov. Petropol. vol. iii. and viii. In the article Machinery in the Supplement to the last edition of this Work, the subject has been treated with great ability by Dr Robison, though he has omitted the various steps in the investigation which conduct to the leading formula. The subject has been also ably discussed by Professor Leslie in a paper published in the Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 355; and as the results of his investigations may be of great use in practice, we shall here present the reader with a short abstract of them.\n\nIf the resistance is equal to the power, is double, triple, or quadruple, &c., a maximum effect will be produced when the velocity of the power, or its distance from the centre of motion, is \\( 1 + \\sqrt{2}; 2 + \\sqrt{6}; 3 + \\sqrt{12}; 4 + \\sqrt{20}; 5 + \\sqrt{30}; 6 + \\sqrt{42} \\), that of the weight being 1, &c. If the resistance is very great, compared with the power, the velocity should at least be double of that which would procure an equilibrium, in order that the machine will produce a maximum effect.\n\n315. If the velocity of the power, or its distance from the centre of motion, be equal to, double, triple, quadruple, &c., &c. of the velocity of the weight or resistance, a maximum effect will be produced when the power \\( P \\) is equal to \\( R \\times 1 + \\sqrt{2}; R \\times 1 + \\sqrt{3}; R \\times 1 + \\sqrt{4}; R \\times 1 + \\sqrt{5}; R \\times 1 + \\sqrt{6}; R \\times 1 + \\sqrt{7}; \\ldots \\), &c., where \\( R \\) is the resistance or weight to be raised. If the velocity of the power be very large, a maximum effect will be produced when the power \\( P \\) is, at least, double of that which would procure an equilibrium. It appears also from Mr Leslie's paper, that in whatever way the maximum be procured, the force which impells\nthe weight can never amount to one-fourth part of the direct action of the power; and that in machines where the velocity of the power is great, we may diffract the momenta of the connecting parts, and consider the force which ought to be employed as double of what is barely able to maintain the equilibrium.\n\n**CHAP. VIII. On the Equilibrium of Arches, Piers, and Domes.**\n\n316. **DEF. 1.** An arch is represented in fig. 3 by the assemblage of stones \\(ab, cd, ef, \\&c.\\) forming the mals \\(ABMN\\), whose inferior surface is the portion of a curve. The parts \\(A, B\\) are called the spring of the arch, the line \\(AB\\) the span of the arch, \\(C\\) its altitude, \\(b\\) its crown, \\(a\\) the keystone, the curve or lower surface \\(AB\\) the intrados, and the roadway \\(TUV\\) the extrados; \\(PQ, RS\\), the piers when they stand between two arches, and the abutments when they are at the extremities of the bridge.\n\n317. **DEF. 2.** A catenarian curve is the curve formed by any line or cord perfectly flexible, and suspended by its extremities. Thus if the chain \\(ACB\\) be suspended by its extremities \\(A, B\\), it will by the action of gravity upon all its parts assume the form \\(ACB\\), which is called the catenary or catenarian curve.\n\n318. There are three modes of determining the construction of arches; the first of which is to consider the arch as an inverted catenary; the second is to establish an equilibrium between the vertical pressures of all the materials between the intrados and extrados; and the third is to regard the different arch-stones as portions of wedges without friction, which, endeavour by their own weight to force their way through the arch. The first of these methods was given by the ingenious Dr Hook, and is contained in the following proposition.\n\n**PROP. I.**\n\n319. To determine the form of an arch by considering it as an inverted catenary, when its span, its altitude, and the form of the roadway or extrados are given.\n\nLet \\(a, b, c, d\\) be a number of spheres or beads connected by a string, and suspended by their extremities \\(A, B\\); they will form a catenarian curve \\(AabcB\\), and be in equilibrium by the action of gravity. Each sphere is acted upon by two forces; at its lower point by the weight of the spheres immediately below it, and at its upper point by the weight of the same spheres added to that of the sphere itself; that is, any sphere \\(c\\) is in equilibrium from the result of two forces, one of which is produced by the weights of \\(cde\\) acting at the lower point of \\(b\\), while the other force arises from the weight of \\(bcde\\) acting at its upper point. The equilibrium of this chain of spheres is evidently of the stable kind, as it will immediately recover its position when the equilibrium is disturbed. Let us now suppose this arch inverted, so as to stand in a vertical plane as in fig. 6. It will still preserve its equilibrium. For the relative positions of the lines which mark the directions remain unchanged by inverting the curve, the force of gravity continues the same, and therefore the result of the forces will be the same, and the arch will be in equilibrium. The equilibrium, however, which the arch now possesses is of the tottering kind, so that the least disturbing force will destroy it, and it will consequently be unable to support any other weight but its own.\n\n320. Let us now suppose that it is required to form an equilibrated arch, whose span is \\(AB\\), whose altitude is \\(Dk\\), and which will support the materials of a roadway, whose form \\(TUV\\) is given. It is obvious, that if the spheres \\(a, b, c, d\\) increase in density from \\(k\\) towards \\(a\\), the catenarian curve will grow less concave at its vertex \\(e\\), and more concave towards its extremities \\(A, B\\). Let us then suppose that the densities of the spheres \\(a, b, c, d, e, \\&c.\\) are respectively as \\(am, bn, cn, dp, ep, \\&c.\\), and the vertical distances of their respective centres from the roadway \\(TUV\\), the arch will have a form different from that which it would have assumed if the spheres were of equal density, and will be in equilibrium when inverted as in fig. 6. Now, in place of the spheres \\(a, b, c, d, e, \\&c.\\) of different densities, let us substitute spheres of the same density, and having the same position as those of different densities; let us then load the sphere \\(a\\) with a weight which, when combined with the weight of \\(a\\), will be equal to the weight of the corresponding sphere \\(a\\), that had a greater density; and let us load the other spheres \\(b, c, d, \\&c.\\) with weights proportional to \\(bn, cn, dp, ep, \\&c.\\). Then it is obvious that the pressure of each sphere when thus loaded upon that which is contiguous to it, is precisely equal to the pressure of the spheres of different densities upon each other, because the density of these spheres varied as their distances from the roadway. But the arch composed of spheres of different densities was in equilibrium when inverted, therefore since the loaded spheres of the same density have the same position and exert the same pressures, the arch composed of these spheres and supporting \\(TUVB\\) is a composed of homogeneous materials, will be in equilibrium. Hence a roadway of a given form, and composed of homogeneous materials, will be supported by an arch whose form is that of a catenary, each of whose points varies in density as their distance from the surface of the roadway; or, which is the same thing, a roadway of a given form, and composed of homogeneous materials, will be supported by an arch whose form is that of a catenary, each of whose points is acted upon by forces proportional to the distances of these points from the surface of the roadway.\n\n321. Hence we have the following practical method of ascertaining the form of an equilibrated arch, whose span is \\(AB\\), and altitude \\(Dk\\), and which is to support a roadway of the form \\(T'UV'\\). Let a chain Fig. 7, \\(AabcB\\), of uniform density, be suspended from the points \\(A, B\\), so that it forms a catenary whose altitude is \\(Dk\\), the required height of the arch. Divide \\(AB\\) into any number of equal parts, suppose eight, and let the vertical lines \\(1m, 2n, 3o\\), drawn from these points, intersect the catenary in the points \\(a, b, c\\). From the points \\(a, b, c, k, r, s, t\\), suspend pieces of chain of uniform density, and form them of such a length, that when the whole is in equilibrium, the extremities of the chains may lie in the line \\(T'UV'\\); then the form which the catenary \\(Akb\\) now assumes, will be the form of an equilibrated arch, which, when inverted like \\(AKB\\), will support the roadway \\(TUV\\), similar to \\(T'UV'\\).\nThis is obvious from the last paragraph, for the pieces of chain \\(a, m, b, n, c, o, k, U\\), &c., are forces acting upon the points \\(a, b, c, k\\) of the catenary, and are proportional to \\(a, m, b, n, c, o, k\\), &c., the distances of the points \\(a, b, c, k\\), &c., from the roadway.\n\n322. An arch of this construction will evidently answer for a bridge, in which the weight of the materials between the roadway and the arch stones is to the weight of the arch stones, as the weight of all the pieces of chain suspended from \\(a, b, c, k\\), &c., is to the weight of the chain \\(A \\& B\\). As the ratio, however, of the weight of the arch stones to the weight of the superincumbent materials is not known, we may assume a convenient thickness for the arch stones, and if from this assumed thickness their weight be computed, and be found to have the required ratio to the weight of the incumbent mails, the curve already found will be a proper form for the arch. But if the ratio is different from that of the weight of the whole chain to the weight of the suspended chains; it may be easily computed how much must be added to or subtracted from the pieces of chain, in order to make the ratios equal. The new curve which the catenary then assumes, in consequence of the change upon the length of the suspended chains, will be the form of an equilibrated arch, the weight of whose arch stones is equal to that which was assumed.\n\nSCHOLIUM.\n\n323. In most cases the catenary curve thus determined will approach very near to a circular arc equal to 120 degrees, which springs from the piers so as to form an angle of 60 degrees with the horizon. The form of the arch, however, as determined in the preceding proposition, is suited only to those cases in which the superincumbent materials exert a vertical pressure. A quantity of loose earth and gravel exerts a pressure in almost every direction, and therefore tends to destroy the equilibrium of a catenary arch. This tendency, however, may be removed by giving the arch a greater curvature towards the piers. This will make it approach to the form of an ellipse, and make it spring more vertically from the piers or abutments.\n\n324. We shall now proceed to deduce the form of an arch and its roadway, by establishing an equilibrium among the weights of all the materials between the arch and the roadway. This method was given by Emerson in his Fluxions, published in 1742, and afterwards by Dr Hutton in his excellent work on bridges.\n\nPROP. II.\n\n325. To determine the form of the roadway or extrados, when the form of the arch or intrados is given.\n\nLet the lines \\(AD, DE, EB, BF, FG, GH\\) lie in the same plane, and let them be placed perpendicular to the horizon. From the points \\(D, E, B, F, G, H\\) draw the vertical lines \\(Dd, Ee, Bb, &c.\\) and taking \\(DP\\) of any length, make \\(Er\\) equal to \\(DP\\), &c., and complete the parallelograms \\(pc, qr\\). Again, make \\(Bx = qe\\), and complete the parallelogram \\(rs\\); in like manner make \\(Fk = rb\\), and complete the parallelogram \\(ff\\); and so on with all the other lines, making the side of each parallelogram equal to that side of the preceding parallelogram which is parallel to it. Let us now suppose that the lines \\(CD, DE, EB, &c.\\) can move round the angular points \\(D, E, B, F, &c.\\) the extremities \\(A, C\\) being immovable; and that forces proportional to \\(Dd, Ee, Bb, &c.\\) are exerted upon the points \\(D, E, B, F, &c.\\) and in the direction \\(Dd, Ee, &c.\\). Now, by the resolution of forces, the force \\(Dd\\) may be resolved into the forces \\(Dc, Dp\\), the force \\(Ee\\) into the forces \\(Eq, Er\\), and the force \\(Bb\\) into the forces \\(Bx, Br\\), and so on with the rest. The force \\(Dc\\) produces no other effect than to press the point \\(A\\) on the plane on which it rests, and is therefore destroyed by the resistance of that plane; but the remaining force \\(Dp\\) tends to bring the point \\(D\\) towards \\(E\\), and to enlarge the angle \\(ADE\\); this force, however, is destroyed by the equal and opposite force \\(Eq\\), and in the same way the forces \\(Er, Br, Fx\\) are destroyed by the equal and opposite forces \\(Bx, Ft, Gv\\), while the remaining force \\(Gw\\) is destroyed by the resistance of the plane which supports the point \\(C\\). When the lines \\(AD, DE, &c.\\) therefore are acted upon by vertical forces proportional to \\(Dd, Ee, Bb, &c.\\), these forces are all destroyed by equal and opposite ones, and the lines will remain in equilibrium.\n\n326. Now the force \\(Dc : Dp\\) or \\(Eq : fin. cdD\\) or \\(dDp : fin. ADd\\), that is, by taking the reciprocals\n\n\\[\nDc : Eq = \\frac{1}{\\sin. ADd} : \\frac{1}{\\sin. dDp},\n\\]\n\nand for the same reason\n\n\\[\nEq : Bs = \\frac{1}{\\sin. Eeq} : \\frac{1}{\\sin. bBs}.\n\\]\n\nHence\n\n\\[\nEq = \\frac{1}{\\sin. Eeq}.\n\\]\n\nNow, since \\(Eq : Ee = \\sin. Eeq : \\sin. Eee\\), we have:\n\n\\[\nEe = \\frac{Eq \\times \\sin. Eeq}{\\sin. Eeq}, \\text{ that is, since } DEm = Eeq, \\text{ and }\n\\]\n\n\\[\neEB = Eeq; \\quad Ee = \\frac{Eq \\times \\sin. DEm}{\\sin. eEB}. \\text{ But } Eq = \\frac{1}{\\sin. Eeq}\n\\]\n\ntherefore, by substitution, we obtain\n\n\\[\nEe = \\frac{\\sin. DEm}{\\sin. Eeq \\times \\sin. eEB}.\n\\]\n\nNow, as the same reasoning may be employed to find \\(Dd, Bb, &c.\\) we have obtained expressions of the forces which, when acting at the angular points \\(D, E, B, &c.\\), keep the whole in equilibrium, and these expressions are in terms of the angles which the lines \\(DE, EB, &c.\\) form with the direction of the forces. If the lines \\(AD, DE, &c.\\) be increased in number so that they may form a polygon with an infinite number of sides, which will not differ from a curve line, then the forces will act at every point of the curve, and the line \\(mE\\) will be a tangent to the curve at the point \\(E\\), and \\(DEm\\) will be the angle of contact. The line \\(Eg\\) being now infinitely small will coincide with \\(Em\\), and therefore the angles \\(eEB\\) and \\(eEB\\) or \\(Eeq\\) will be equal to the angle \\(eEm\\), and consequently their sines will be equal. Therefore by making these substitutions in the last formula, we have an expression of the forces at every point of the curve, thus\n\n\\[\nEe = \\frac{\\sin. DEm}{\\sin. eEm \\times \\sin. eEm} = \\frac{\\sin. DEm}{\\sin. eEm}.\n\\]\nBut the angle of contact DEM varies with the curvature at the point E, and the curvature varies as the reciprocal of the radius of curvature, therefore the angle of contact varies as the reciprocal of the radius of curvature; hence by substitution,\n\n\\[ E c = \\frac{1}{\\text{radius of curvature}} \\times \\text{fin. } e E m^2. \\]\n\nIn order to get rid of the confusion in fig. 8, where the arch is a polygon, let us suppose ABC, fig. 9, to be the curve, \\( mn \\) a tangent to any point E, and \\( Ec \\) a vertical line; then the pressure at any point of the arch is reciprocally as the radius of curvature at that point, and the square of the sine of the angle which the tangent to that point of the curve forms with a vertical line.\n\n327. Corollary. Let us now suppose that the arch ABC supports a mass of homogeneous materials lying between the roadway TUV and the arch AEB; and the whole being supposed in equilibrium, let us determine the weight which presses on the point E. The weight of the superincumbent column Ecbd varies as Ec × \\( \\frac{1}{\\text{radius of curvature}} \\times \\text{fin. } e E m^2 \\), but \\( Ec = \\frac{1}{\\text{radius of curvature}} \\times \\text{fin. } E d \\times \\text{fin. } E g \\), \\( Ed \\) being radius, and \\( Eg = EnB \\), on account of the parallels Ec UB, therefore the weight of the column Ecbd varies as Ec × \\( \\frac{1}{\\text{radius of curvature}} \\times \\text{fin. } EnB \\), that is, as Ec × fin. EnB, because Ed is a constant quantity; but the pressure at E was proved to vary as\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{\\text{radius of curvature}} \\times \\text{fin. } e E m^2, \\]\n\ntherefore the weight of the column Ecbd or Ec × fin. EnB varies also as this quantity, that is,\n\n\\[ Ec \\times \\text{fin. } EnB = \\frac{1}{\\text{radius of curvature}} \\times \\text{fin. } e E m^2. \\]\n\nBut as the angle EnB is equal to the angle Em, we shall have, by substitution and division,\n\n\\[ Ec = \\frac{1}{\\text{radius of curvature}} \\times \\text{fin. } e E m^2, \\]\n\nthat is,\n\nWhen an arch supports a roadway, the pressure exerted upon any point of it, is reciprocally as the radius of curvature, and the cube of the sine of the angle which the tangent to that point forms with a vertical line.\n\n328. Having thus obtained an expression for Ec, we shall proceed to show the application of the formula to the case when the arch is a portion of a circle.\n\nLet EB be the arch of a circle whose centre is F. Let the radius = R, BD = versed sine, BE = x, DF = col. BE = b, BU = m. Draw the tangent GE, and through E the vertical line Ec, which will be parallel to BE. Then since GEF is a right angle, and \\( Ec = \\text{col. } EFB = FD \\). But, in the present case, the radius of curvature is the radius of the arch, or R, therefore, \\( Ec = \\frac{1}{R} \\times \\text{fin. } GEc \\), or by substitution, \\( Ec = \\frac{1}{R} \\times \\text{fin. } Ec \\), that is, since R is constant,\n\n\\[ Ec = \\frac{1}{R} \\times \\text{fin. } Ec. \\]\n\nBut when the point E coincides with B, the cosine b becomes equal to radius; therefore, in that case \\( Ec = \\frac{1}{R^3} \\), and Ec becomes BU = m, hence\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{R^3} : \\frac{1}{b^3} = m : Ec, \\]\n\nand by Geometry, Theor. 8.\n\nSect. IV. and Division, we have \\( Ec = \\frac{m}{b^3} \\). Now, by the notation \\( R : b = BF : DF \\); therefore \\( R^3 : b^3 = BF^3 : DF^3 \\), hence \\( \\frac{R^3}{b^3} = \\frac{BF^3}{DF^3} \\), and multiplying each side by m, we have \\( \\frac{mR^3}{b^3} = \\frac{mBF^3}{DF^3} \\); but \\( \\frac{mR^3}{b^3} = Ec \\), therefore the vertical distance of the surface of the roadway from the point F, or \\( Ec = \\frac{mBF^3}{DF^3} = \\frac{BU \\times BF^3}{DF^3} \\).\n\nWhen the point E coincides with B, BF = DF, and Ec = BU. When E coincides with A, the cosine DF vanishes, and therefore Ec, or the distance of the point A from the extrados or roadway, is infinite. The curve VuT, therefore, will run up to an infinite height, approaching continually to a vertical line, drawn from A, which will be its asymptote. Such a form of the extrados, however, is inadmissible in practice; and therefore a semicircular arch is not an arch of equilibration. When the arch is less than a semicircle, as PBR, the curve terminates in the point p; and as it does not rise very much above a horizontal line, passing through U when the arch is small, we might produce a perfect equilibrium, by making the roadway horizontal as Vu, and making the density of the superincumbent columns PnEc, which press upon the points P, E respectively, in the ratio of Pp, Ec, the distances of these points from the curvilinear roadway.\n\n329. The inconvenience, however, arising from the inflexion of the extrados, may be considerably removed by throwing the point of contrary flexure to a greater distance, which may be done by diminishing BU, the thickness of the incumbent mass above the keystone. Thus, if BU is diminished to Bd, and if points a, b are taken in the lines Pp, Ec, so that Pa : Pp = Eb : Ec = Bd : BU, and so on with all the points in the arch; and if a new roadway vdbat be drawn through these points, the equilibrium of the arch will still continue, for the various pressures which it sustained, though they are diminished, preserve the same proportion.\n\n330. Let us suppose it necessary to have the extrados a horizontal line, and let it be required to find BU = m when there is an equilibrium. In this case the point H coincides with U; or rather, when the curve VuT cuts the horizontal line Vu, the point H coincides with U. By substituting BF = BD instead of DF in the value of Ec, formerly determined, and by putting BD = y, we have \\( Ec = \\frac{mR^3}{R - y^3} \\). But when H coincides with U, Ec coincides with a, and therefore Ec = BD + BU = y + m, consequently, \\( \\frac{mR^3}{R - y^3} = y + m \\), and multiplying by \\( R - y^3 \\), we have \\( mR^3 = y \\times R - y^3 + m \\times R - y^3 \\), or \\( mR^3 + m \\times R - y^3 = y \\times R - y^3 \\), and, dividing by the coefficients of m, we have\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{y \\times R - y^3}{R^3 - R - y^3}, \\]\n\nthat is,\n\nThe thickness of the roadway above the keystone, when the extrados is a straight line, is equal to the quotient arising\nMECHANICS.\n\nTheory. arising from multiplying the versed sine of half the arch by the cube of its cosine, and dividing this product by the difference between the cube of the radius, and the cube of the cosine; or, to change the expression, the thickness of the roadway above the keystone, when the roadway is a straight line, is equal to the quotient arising from multiplying the height of the arch, by the cube of the difference between the radius of the arch and its height, and dividing this product by the difference between the cube of the radius, and the cube of the difference between the radius and the height of the arch.\n\n331. When the arch is a semicircle \\( R - y \\) vanishes, and \\( m \\) becomes equal to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), so that the semicircular arch is evidently inadmissible. But when the arch is less than a semicircle, the value of \\( m \\) will be finite. Thus, if the arches are respectively\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Arch.} & \\\\\n60^\\circ, & \\text{we have } m = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ of the span}, \\\\\n90^\\circ, & \\text{we have } m = \\frac{1}{8} \\text{ of the span, or} \\\\\n110^\\circ, & \\text{we have } m = \\frac{7}{17} \\text{ of the span nearly}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe two first arches of \\( 60^\\circ \\) and \\( 90^\\circ \\), manifestly give too great a thickness to the part \\( BU \\) or \\( m \\). In the third arch of \\( 110^\\circ \\), the thickness of \\( BD \\) is nearly what is given to it by good architects, and is therefore the best in practice; for if the arch were made greater than \\( 110^\\circ \\), the thickness of \\( BU \\) or \\( m \\) would be too small. It is obvious, however, that an arch of \\( 110^\\circ \\) is not an arch of perfect equilibration, for this can be the case only when the roadway has the form \\( U \\approx r \\). When the roadway, therefore, is horizontal, as \\( Ur \\), there is an unbalanced pressure on both sides of the keystone, produced by the weight of the materials in the mixtilinear space \\( r \\approx U \\). It is indeed very small, and might be counteracted, by making the materials below \\( Z \\) lighter than those below \\( U \\); but the unbalanced pressure is so trifling, that it may be safely neglected. We may, therefore, conclude, that when the arch is to be circular with a horizontal roadway, an arch of \\( 110^\\circ \\) degrees approaches nearest to an arch of equilibration.\n\n332. When the arch is elliptical, it will be found, as in the circle, that \\( m = \\frac{y \\times R - y^3}{R^3 - R - y^3} \\). An elliptical arch, however, has the advantage of a circular one, when their transverse axis is horizontal; for as it is transverse much flatter, the point of contrary flexure in the extra-axis is horizontal thrown at a greater distance, and therefore horizontal. Elliptical arches have also the advantage of being more elegant, and likewise require less labour and materials.\n\n333. The cycloidal arch is likewise superior to a circular one, but inferior to those which are elliptical. Parabolic, hyperbolic, and catenarian arches, may be employed when the bridge has only one arch, and is to rise high; but in other cases they are inadmissible. The method of determining the roadway for all these forms of arches, will be found in Dr Hutton's excellent work on the Principles of Bridges, p. 3. See also Emerson's Miscellanies, p. 156.; and his work on Fluxions, published in 1742.\n\n334. When the form of the roadway is given, the mechanical shape of the intrados for an arch of equilibration may be determined. As the investigation is very difficult, unless when the roadway is a horizontal line, we shall merely give the formula, which will enable any person to construct the curve. In all the other curves the equilibrium of the arch is imperfect; but the curve described by the following formula is an arch of perfect equilibration, and has been called the mechanical curve of equilibration.\n\n\\[\nED = AF \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{BU + BD + \\sqrt{2 \\times BU \\times BD + BD^2}}}{BU}\n\\]\n\nFrom this formula, which corresponds with figure 11. Dr Hutton has computed the following table, containing the values of \\( cU \\) and \\( cE \\), for an arch whose span \\( AC \\) is 100, whose height \\( BF \\) is 40, and whose thickness at the crown or \\( BU \\) is 6. The table will answer for any other arch whose span and thickness are as the numbers 100, 40, 6; only the values of \\( cU \\) and \\( cE \\) must be increased or diminished in the same ratio as these numbers.\n\n**Table for constructing the Curve of Equilibration, when the span, height, and thickness at the crown, are as the numbers 100, 40, and 6.**\n\n| Value of \\( cU \\) | Value of \\( cE \\) | Value of \\( cU \\) | Value of \\( cE \\) | Value of \\( cU \\) | Value of \\( cE \\) | Value of \\( cU \\) | Value of \\( cE \\) | Value of \\( cU \\) | Value of \\( cE \\) |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 0                | 6.000            | 15               | 8.120            | 24               | 11.911           | 33               | 18.627           | 42               | 29.919           |\n| 2                | 6.035            | 16               | 8.430            | 25               | 12.489           | 34               | 19.617           | 43               | 31.56            |\n| 4                | 6.144            | 17               | 8.766            | 26               | 13.106           | 35               | 20.663           | 44               | 33.29            |\n| 6                | 6.324            | 18               | 9.168            | 27               | 13.761           | 36               | 21.774           | 45               | 35.13            |\n| 8                | 6.580            | 19               | 9.517            | 28               | 14.457           | 37               | 22.948           | 46               | 37.07            |\n| 10               | 6.914            | 20               | 9.934            | 29               | 15.196           | 38               | 24.190           | 47               | 39.12            |\n| 12               | 7.330            | 21               | 10.381           | 30               | 15.980           | 39               | 25.505           | 48               | 41.19            |\n| 13               | 7.571            | 22               | 10.858           | 31               | 16.811           | 40               | 26.894           | 49               | 43.18            |\n| 14               | 7.834            | 23               | 11.368           | 32               | 17.693           | 41               | 28.364           | 50               | 45.00            |\n\nVol. XIII. Part I.\n335. The construction of arches has also been deduced from considering the arch-stones as frustums of polished wedges without friction, which endeavour to force their way through the arch. This principle has been adopted by Belidor, Parent, Boult, Prony, and other French philosophers, and likewise by our ingenious countryman, the late Mr Atwood. This theory, however, is more plausible than useful. So far from the arch-stones having liberty to slide between those which are contiguous to them, without friction, they are bound together by the strongest cement, and sometimes connected by iron pins or wedges. The theory likewise requires, that the weight of the arch must regularly increase as the portion of the vertical tangent cut off by lines drawn from a given point in a direction parallel to that of the joints, and therefore either the density or the magnitude of the arch-stones must be very great at the spring of the arch, where the portion of the vertical tangent is a maximum. Those who wish to be acquainted with the mode of investigation, by which the equilibrium of arches is established in this theory, may consult Prony's Architecture Hydraulique, tom. i. p. 152.\n\nOn the Construction of Piers and Abutments.\n\n336. In the construction of piers and abutments, there are two circumstances which claim our attention. 1. The strength that must be given to them, in order to resist the lateral thrust which they sustain from the adjacent semiarches, and which tend either to overturn them, or make them slide upon their base. 2. The form which must be given to their extremities, so that the force of the current may be a minimum.—The adhesion of the pier to the place on which it rests is always much greater than one-third of the pressure; and as the lateral thrust of the arch which this adhesion resists, is oblique to the horizon, and may be resolved into two forces, one of which is horizontal, and the other vertical, we have the vertical portion of the lateral thrust, the weight of the pier, and the friction on its base, combined in resisting the horizontal portion of the lateral thrust, which tends to make the pier slide upon its base, so that there is no danger of the pier yielding to such a pressure.—We do not here consider, that the lateral thrust which tends to give a horizontal motion to the pier, is completely counteracted by the lateral thrust of the opposite semarch, because it is necessary that the pier should have sufficient stability to resist the lateral thrust of one semarch, in case of the failure of the opposite one. Let us therefore consider the strength of the pier which will prevent it from being overturned.\n\n337. For this purpose, let ABC be an arch, MHTO the pier, and BUHA the loaded semarch, whose pressure tends to overturn the pier. Let G be the centre of gravity of the mass BUHA: Join GA, and from G draw GK perpendicular to AC. Then, since the whole pressure of the arch is exerted at its spring A; and since this pressure is the same as if the whole weight of the arch were collected into the point G, GA will be the direction in which the weight of the arch and the superincumbent mass acts upon the point A. Now, by Dynamics, the force GA may be resolved into the two forces GK, KA, one of which KA endeavours to give the pier a motion of rotation about the point O, while the other GK denotes the weight of the loaded arch in the direction GK. Putting W, therefore, for the weight or area of the superincumbent mass, we have GK : KA = W : \\(\\frac{W \\times KA}{GK}\\), the pressure upon A. Now, as this force tends to turn the pier round O by means of the lever OA, and as ON = AM is the perpendicular from the centre of motion upon the line of direction, we have AM \\(\\times\\) \\(\\frac{W \\times KA}{GK}\\) for the force which tends to overturn the pier. Now, the force which is opposed to this is the weight of the pier MHTO collected in its centre of gravity g, which acts by the vertical lever OM = \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) OM, because g is in the centre of the rectangle TM (Art. 164.). But the weight or area of the pier may be represented by OM \\(\\times\\) MH; therefore, the force which resists the lateral thrust of the loaded arch is OM \\(\\times\\) MH \\(\\times\\) \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) OM, or \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) MH \\(\\times\\) OM. Now, in the case of an equilibrium between these opposing forces, we have AM \\(\\times\\) \\(\\frac{W \\times KA}{GK}\\) = \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) MH \\(\\times\\) OM\\(^2\\), which, by reduction, becomes OM \\(= \\sqrt{\\frac{2 AM \\times W \\times KA}{MH \\times GK}}\\). This formula gives us the breadth of the pier which is capable of balancing the lateral thrust; and therefore OM must be taken a little greater than the preceding value. In practice, OM is generally between one-fifth and one-seventh of AC, the span of the arch. The method of finding the centre of gravity G of the loaded arch, whether the arch is in perfect equilibrium or not, may be seen in Dr Hutton's work, already quoted, p. 49. A very simple method of doing this is to form the part BVHA of a piece of card, and to find its centre of gravity G by the rules given in Articles 201, 202, 203. This indeed supposes all the materials to be homogeneous; but if they are of various kinds, we can load the arch made of card in a similar manner, and determine its centre of gravity as before.\n\n338. The limits of this article will not permit us to apply the method of fluxions to the determination of the form which should be given to the ends of the pier, in order that the impulse of the current may be the least possible. The theory of the resistance of fluids, indeed, differs so widely from experiment, that such an investigation would, in this place, be of little practical utility. It may be sufficient merely to remark, that the pier should have an angular form, and that the impulse of the current will be diminished as the angle is more acute. When the ends are semicircular, the impulse of the stream is reduced to one half; and though a triangular termination of the piers reduces the impulse still more, yet semicircular ends are more pleasing to the eye, and are particularly advantageous when small vessels have occasion to pass the arch. When those vessels happen to impinge against the piers, the semicircular ends are more able to bear the shock, and do less injury to the vessel, while the additional quantity of masonry will give greater stability to the pier.\n339. **Definition.** A dome, cupola, or vault, is an arched roof, either of a spherical, conoidal, or spheroidal form.\n\nThe following proposition, taken from Dr Robison's article upon this subject, in the Supplement to the last edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, contains a very brief view of the theory of domes.\n\n**Proposition.**\n\n340. \"To determine the thickness of a dome vaulting when the curve is given, or the curve when the thickness is given.\"\n\nLet $b b A$, figure 1, be the curve which produces the dome by revolving round the vertical axis $A D$. We shall suppose this curve to be drawn through the middle of all the arch-stones, and that the couring or horizontal joints are everywhere perpendicular to the curve. We shall suppose (as is always the case) that the thickness $K L$, $H I$, &c., of the arch-stones is very small, in comparison with the dimensions of the arch. If we consider any portion $H A h$ of the dome, it is plain that it presses on the course, of which $H L$ is an arch-stone, in a direction $b C$ perpendicular to the joint $H I$, or in the direction of the next superior element $b b$ of the curve. As we proceed downwards, course after course, we see plainly that this direction must change, because the weight of each course is superadded to that of the portion above it, to complete the pressure on the course below. Through $B$ draw the vertical line $B C G$, meeting $b b$, produced in $C$. We may take $b c$ to express the pressure of all that is above it, propagated in this direction to the joint $K L$. We may also suppose the weight of the course $H L$ united in $b$, and acting on the vertical. Let it be represented by $b F$. If we form the parallelogram $b F G C$, the diagonal $b G$ will represent the direction and intensity of the whole pressure on the joint $K L$. Thus it appears that this pressure is continually changing its direction, and that the line, which will always coincide with it, must be a curve concave downward. If this be precisely the curve of the dome, it will be an equilibrated vaulting; but so far from being the strongest form, it is the weakest, and it is the limit to an infinity of others, which are all stronger than it. This will appear evident, if we suppose that $b G$ does not coincide with the curve $a b B$, but passes without it. As we suppose the arch-stones to be exceedingly thin from inside to outside, it is plain that this dome cannot stand, and that the weight of the upper part will press it down, and spring the vaulting outwards at the joint $K L$. But let us suppose, on the other hand, that $b G$ falls within the curvilinear element $b B$. This evidently tends to push the arch-stone inward, toward the axis, and would cause it to slide in, since the joints are supposed perfectly smooth and slippery. But since this takes place equally in every stone of this course, they must all abut on each other in the vertical joints, squeezing them firmly together. Therefore, revolving the thrust $b G$ into two, one of which is perpendicular to the joint $K L$, and the other parallel to it, we see that this last thrust is withstood by the vertical joints all around, and there remains only the thrust in the direction of the curve. Such a dome must therefore be firmer than an equilibrated dome, and cannot be so easily broken by overloading the upper part. When the curve is concave upwards, as in the lower part of the figure, the line $b C$ always falls below $b B$, and the point $C$ below $B$. When the curve is concave downwards, as in the upper part of the figure, $b C'$ passes above, or without $b B$. The curvature may be so abrupt, that even $b' G'$ shall pass without $b' B'$, and the point $G'$ is above $B'$. It is also evident that the force which thus binds the stones of a horizontal course together, by pushing them towards the axis, will be greater in flat domes than in those that are more convex; that it will be still greater in a cone; and greater still in a curve whose convexity is turned inwards: for in this last case the line $b G$ will deviate most remarkably from the curve. Such a dome will stand (having polished joints) if the curve springs from the base with any elevation, however small; nay, since the friction of two pieces of stone is not less than half of their mutual pressure, such a dome will stand, although the tangent to the curve at the bottom should be horizontal, provided that the horizontal thrust be double the weight of the dome, which may easily be the case if it do not rise high.\n\nThus we see that the stability of a dome depends on very different principles from that of a common arch, and is in general much greater. It differs also in another very important circumstance, viz. that it may be open in the middle; for the uppermost course, by tending equally in every part to slide in toward the axis, presses all together in the vertical joints, and acts on the next course like the key-stone of a common arch. Therefore an arch of equilibration, which is the weakest of all, may be open in the middle, and carry at top another building, such as a lantern, if its weight do not exceed that of the circular segment of the dome that is omitted. A greater load than this would indeed break the dome, by causing it to spring up in some of the lower courses; but this load may be increased if the curve is flatter than the curve of equilibration: and any load whatever, which will not crush the stones to powder, may be set on a truncate cone, or on a dome formed by a curve that is convex toward the axis; provided always that the foundation be effectually prevented from flying out, either by a hoop or by a sufficient mass of solid pier on which it is set.\"\n\nWe have seen that if $b G$, the thrust compounded of the thrust $b C$, exerted by all the courses above $H I L K$, and if the force $b F$, or the weight of that course, be everywhere coincident with $b B$, the element of the curve, we shall have an equilibrated dome; if it falls within it, we have a dome which will bear a greater load; and if it falls without it, the dome will break at the joint. We must endeavour to get analytical expressions of these conditions. Therefore draw the ordinates $b b''$, $B D B''$, $C d C''$. Let the tangents at $b$ and $b''$ meet the axis in $M$, and make $M O$, $M P$, each equal to $b c$, and complete the parallelogram $M O N P$, and draw $O Q$ perpendicular to the axis, and produce $b F$, cutting the ordinates in $E$ and $e$. It is plain that $M N$\nTheory.\n\nMECHANICS.\n\nis to MO as the weight of the arch HA h to the thrust b c which it exerts on the joint KL (this thrust being propagated through the course of HILK); and that MQ, or its equal b e, or d d, may represent the weight of the half AH.\n\nLet AD be called x, and DB be called y. Then b c = x, and c = y (because b c is in the direction of the element b b). It is also plain, that if we make y constant, BC is the second fluxion of x, or BC = x, and b e and BE may be considered as equal, and taken indiscriminately for x. We have also b C = \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). Let d be the depth or thickness HI of the arch-stones. Then \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\) will represent the trapezium HL; and since the circumference of each course increases in the proportion of the radius y, dy \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\) will express the whole course. If \\( \\int \\) be taken to represent the sum or aggregate of the quantities annexed to it, the formula will be analogous to the fluent of a fluxion, and \\( \\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\) will represent the whole mass, and also the weight of the vaulting, down to the joint HI. Therefore we have this proportion, \\( \\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} : dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = b e : b F, = b e : CG, = d : CG, = x : CG \\). Therefore \\( CG = \\frac{\\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{\\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\).\n\nIf the curvature of the dome be precisely such as puts it in equilibrium, but without any mutual pressure in the vertical joints, this value of OG must be equal to CB, or to x, the point G coinciding with B. This condition will be expressed by the equation \\( \\frac{dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{\\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = \\frac{x}{x} \\), or, more conveniently, by \\( \\frac{dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{\\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = \\frac{x}{x} \\). But this form gives only a tottering equilibrium, independent of the friction of the joints and the cohesion of the cement. An equilibrium, accompanied by some firm stability, produced by the mutual pressure of the vertical joints, may be expressed by the formula \\( \\frac{dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{\\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = \\frac{x}{x} \\), or by \\( \\frac{dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{\\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = \\frac{x}{x} \\), where t is some variable positive quantity, which increases when x increases. This last equation will also express the equilibrated dome, if t be a constant quantity, because in this case \\( \\frac{t}{x} \\) is = 0.\n\nSince a firm stability requires that \\( \\frac{dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{\\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\) shall be greater than \\( \\frac{x}{x} \\), and CG must be greater than CB: Hence we learn, that figures of too great curvature, whose sides descend too rapidly, are improper. Also, since stability requires that we have\n\n\\( \\frac{dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{\\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\) greater than \\( \\frac{dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{\\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\), we learn that the upper part of the dome must not be made very heavy. This, by diminishing the proportion of b F to b C, diminishes the angle c b G, and may set the point G above B, which will infallibly spring the dome in that place. We see here also, that the algebraic analysis expresses that peculiarity of dome-vaulting, that the weight of the upper part may even be suppressed.\n\nThe fluent of the equation \\( \\frac{dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{\\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = \\frac{x}{x} + \\frac{i}{i} \\) is most easily found. It is \\( L \\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = L \\cdot x + L \\cdot i \\), where L is the hyperbolic logarithm of the quantity annexed to it. If we consider y as constant, and correct the fluent so as to make it nothing at the vertex, it may be expressed thus, \\( L \\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = L \\cdot x - L \\cdot y + L \\cdot i \\). This gives us \\( L \\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = L \\cdot x - L \\cdot y \\), therefore \\( \\frac{dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{a} = \\frac{x}{y} \\).\n\nThis last equation will easily give us the depth of vaulting, or thickness d of the arch, when the curve is given. For its fluxion is \\( \\frac{dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{a} = \\frac{ix + iy}{y} \\), and \\( d = \\frac{ai \\cdot x + ai \\cdot x}{yy \\cdot x^2 + y^2} \\), which is all expressed in known quantities; for we may put in place of t any power or function of x or of y, and thus convert the expression into another, which will still be applicable to all sorts of curves.\n\nInstead of the second member \\( \\frac{x}{x} + \\frac{i}{i} \\) we might employ \\( p \\cdot \\frac{x}{x} \\), where p is some number greater than unity. This will evidently give a dome having stability; because the original formula \\( \\frac{dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{\\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\) will then be greater than \\( \\frac{x}{x} \\). This will give \\( d = \\frac{p \\cdot ax^{p-1} \\cdot x}{yy \\cdot x^2 + y^2} \\).\n\nEach of these forms has its advantages when applied to particular cases. Each of them also gives \\( d = \\frac{ax}{yy \\cdot x^2 + y^2} \\) when the curvature is such as is in precise equilibrium. And, lastly, if d be constant, that is, if the vaulting be of uniform thickness, we obtain the form of the curve, because then the relation of x to x and to y is given.\n\nThe chief use of this analysis is to discover what curves are improper for domes, or what portions of given curves may be employed with safety. Domes are\nare generally built for ornament; and we see that there is great room for indulging our fancy in the choice. All curves which are concave outwards will give domes of great firmness: they are also beautiful. The Gothic dome, whose outline is an undulated curve, may be made abundantly firm, especially if the upper part be convex and the lower concave outwards.\n\n\"The chief difficulty in the case of this analysis arises from the necessity of expressing the weight of the incumbent part, or \\( \\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). This requires the measurement of the conoidal surface, which, in most cases, can be had only by approximation by means of infinite series.\n\n\"The surface of any circular portion of a sphere is very easily had, being equal to the circle described with a radius equal to the chord of half the arch. This radius is evidently \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\).\n\n\"In order to discover what portion of a hemisphere may be employed (for it is evident we cannot employ the whole) when the thickness of the vaulting is uniform, we may recur to the equation or formula\n\n\\[ \\frac{dy}{x} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - y^2}}{x} = \\int dy \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}. \\]\n\nLet \\( a \\) be the radius of the hemisphere. We have \\( x = \\frac{ay}{\\sqrt{a^2 - y^2}} \\)\n\nand \\( y = \\frac{a^2 y^2}{a^2 - y^2} \\). Substituting these values in the formula, we obtain the equation \\( y^2 \\sqrt{x^2 - y^2} = \\int \\frac{a^2 y^2}{\\sqrt{a^2 - y^2}} \\).\n\nWe easily obtain the fluent of the second member\n\n\\[ \\frac{a^3 - a^2}{\\sqrt{a^2 - y^2}} \\text{ and } y = a \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{a^2}}. \\]\n\nTherefore if the radius of the sphere be 1, the half breadth of the dome must not exceed \\( \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}} \\) or 0.786, and the height will be .618. The arch from the vertex is about 51° 49′. Much more of the hemisphere cannot stand, even though aided by the cement, and by the friction of the couring joints. This last circumstance, by giving connection to the upper parts, causes the whole to press more vertically on the course below, and thus diminishes the outward thrust; but it at the same time diminishes the mutual abutment of the vertical joints, which is a great cause of firmness in the vaulting. A Gothic dome, of which the upper part is a portion of a sphere not exceeding 45° from the vertex, and the lower part is concave outwards, will be very strong, and not ungraceful.\n\n\"341. Persuaded that what has been said on the subject convinces the reader that a vaulting perfectly equilibrated throughout is by no means the best form, provided that the base is secured from separating, we think it unnecessary to give the investigation of that form, which has a considerable intricacy, and shall merely give its dimensions. The thickness is supposed uniform. The numbers in the first column of the table express the portion of the axis counted from the vertex, and those of the second column are the length of the ordinates.\n\n\"The curve formed according to these dimensions will not appear very graceful, because there is an abrupt change in its curvature at a small distance from its vertex; if, however, the middle be occupied by a lantern of equal or of smaller weight than the part whose place it supplies, the whole will be elegant, and free from this defect.\n\n\"The connexion of the parts arising from cement and from friction has a great effect on dome-vaulting. In the same way as in common arches and cylindrical vaulting, it enables an overload on one place to break the dome in a distant place. But the resistance to this effect is much greater in dome-vaulting, because it operates all round the overloaded part. Hence it happens that domes are much less shattered by partial violence, such as the falling of a bomb, or the like. Large holes may be broken in them without much affecting the rest; but, on the other hand, it greatly diminishes the strength which should be derived from the mutual pressure in the vertical joints. Friction prevents the sliding in of the arch-stones which produces this mutual pressure in the vertical joints, except in the very highest courses, and even there it greatly diminishes it. These causes make a great change in the form, which gives the greatest strength; and as their laws of action are but very imperfectly understood as yet, it is perhaps impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to determine this form with tolerable precision. We see plainly, however, that it allows a greater deviation from the best form than the other kind of vaulting; and domes may be made to rise perpendicular to the horizon at the base, although of no great thickness; a thing which must not be attempted in a plane arch. The immense addition of strength which may be derived from hooping largely compensates for all defects; and there is hardly any bounds to the extent to which a very thin dome-vaulting may be carried, when it is hooped or framed in the direction of the horizontal courses. The roof of the Halle du Bled at Paris is but a foot thick, and its diameter is more than 200, yet it appears to have abundant strength.\"\n\nScholium:\n\n342. The section of the dome of St Paul's cathedral is part of an ellipse whose conjugate diameter is parallel to the horizon. It is built of wood, and confined by strong iron chains; and is supported by carpentry resting on a cone of brick work.\nMECHANICS.\n\nCHAP. IX. On the Force of Torsion.\n\n343. Definition. Let \\( g \\) be a metallic wire firmly fixed in the pincers \\( g \\) by means of the screw \\( s \\); let the cylindrical weight \\( P \\), furnished with an index \\( e \\), be suspended at the lower extremity of the wire; and let the axis of the cylinder, or the wire \\( g \\) produced, terminate in the centre of the divided circle \\( MNO \\). Then, if the cylinder \\( P \\) is made to move round its axis so that the index \\( e \\) may describe the arch \\( ON \\), the wire \\( g \\) will be twisted. If the cylinder be now left to itself, the wire will, in consequence of its elasticity, endeavour to recover its form; the index \\( e \\) will therefore move backwards from \\( N \\), and oscillate round the axis of the cylinder. The force which produces these oscillations is called the force of torsion, and the angle measured by the arch \\( ON \\) is called the angle of torsion.\n\nProp. I.\n\n344. To deduce formulae for the oscillatory motion of the cylinder, on the supposition that the reaction of the force of torsion is proportional to the angle of torsion, or nearly proportional to it.\n\nLet \\( PQ \\) be a section of the cylinder \\( P \\) in fig. 2, and let all the elements of the cylinder be projected upon this circular section in \\( d, d', d'' \\). Let \\( ACB \\), the primitive angle of torsion, be called \\( A \\), and let this angle, after the time \\( t \\), become \\( ACb \\), so that it has been diminished by the angle \\( BCb = M \\); then \\( ACb = A - M \\) = the angle of torsion after the time \\( t \\).\n\nSince the force of torsion is supposed to be proportional to the angle of torsion, the momentum of the force of torsion must be some multiple of that angle, or \\( n \\times A - M \\), \\( n \\) being a constant coefficient, whose value depends on the nature, length, and thickness of the metallic wire. If, therefore, we call \\( v \\) the velocity of any point \\( d \\) at the end of the time \\( t \\), when the angle of torsion becomes \\( ACb \\), and \\( r = Cd \\) the distance of the point \\( d \\) from the axis of rotation \\( C \\), we shall have by the principles of Dynamics,\n\n\\[\nn \\times A - M \\times i = \\int dr \\cdot v.\n\\]\n\nBut if \\( CD \\), the radius of the cylinder, be equal \\( a \\), and if \\( u \\) be the velocity of the point \\( D \\) after the time \\( t \\), we have evidently \\( v : u = r : a \\), and \\( v = \\frac{ru}{a} \\). Now by substituting the fluxion of this value of \\( v \\) in the place of \\( v \\) in the preceding formula, we have\n\n\\[\nn \\times A - M \\times i = \\int \\frac{dr}{a} \\cdot \\frac{ru}{a};\n\\]\n\nand since \\( i = \\frac{aM}{u} \\), we have by substitution\n\n\\[\nn \\times A - M \\times \\frac{aM}{u} = \\int \\frac{dr}{a},\n\\]\n\nwhose fluent is\n\n\\[\nn \\times 2AM - M^2 = u \\int \\frac{dr}{a}.\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides of the equation, we have\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{n} \\times \\sqrt{2AM - M^2} = u \\int \\frac{dr}{a}.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( \\frac{aM}{u} \\), and dividing by \\( \\sqrt{n} \\times \\sqrt{2AM - M^2} \\), the equation becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{aM}{u} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n} \\times \\sqrt{2AM - M^2}}{\\sqrt{n} \\times \\sqrt{2AM - M^2}} = \\frac{aM}{\\sqrt{n} \\times \\sqrt{2AM - M^2}} \\times \\frac{1}{a} \\times \\int \\frac{dr}{a}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, since \\( i = \\frac{aM}{u} \\), we shall have\n\n\\[\ni = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{n} \\times \\sqrt{2AM - M^2}} \\times \\int \\frac{dr}{a}.\n\\]\n\nBut \\( \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{2AM - M^2}} \\) represents an arch or angle whose radius is \\( A \\) and whose versed sine is \\( M \\), which arch vanishes when \\( M = 0 \\), and which becomes equal to \\( 90^\\circ \\) when \\( M = A \\). Therefore the time of a complete oscillation will be\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{\\rho r^2}{n} \\times 180^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n345. In order to compare the force of torsion with the force of gravity in a pendulum, we have for the time of a complete oscillation of a pendulum whose length is \\( l \\), \\( g \\) being the force of gravity,\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{l}{g} \\times 180^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, since the time in which the cylinder oscillates must be equal to the time in which the pendulum oscillates, we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\rho r^2}{n} \\times 180^\\circ = \\frac{l}{g} \\times 180^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nHence dividing by \\( 180^\\circ \\), and squaring both sides, we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\rho r^2}{n} = \\frac{l}{g}.\n\\]\n\nWe must therefore find for a cylinder the value of \\( \\int \\rho r^2 \\), or the sum of all the particles multiplied by the squares of their distances from the axis. Now, if we make \\( \\pi = 6.28318 \\) the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its radius, \\( a = \\) radius of the cylinder, \\( \\lambda = \\) its length, \\( d = \\) its density; then we shall have for the area of its base \\( \\frac{a^2 \\pi}{2} \\), which multiplied by \\( \\lambda \\) gives the solid content of the cylinder \\( \\frac{a^2 \\pi \\lambda}{2} \\), and this multiplied by \\( d \\).\nTheory.\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{a^2 \\pi \\lambda}{2} \\text{ for the sum of all its particles. But} \\]\n\nas this is to be multiplied by the sum of the squares of all the distances of the particles from the centre \\( C \\), we shall have\n\n\\[ \\int \\rho r^2 = \\frac{a^4 \\pi \\lambda}{4}. \\]\n\nBut the number of particles in the cylinder, or the mass \\( \\mu \\) of the cylinder, is\n\n\\[ \\frac{a^2 \\pi \\lambda}{2}, \\]\n\ntherefore substituting \\( \\mu \\) instead of this value of it in the preceding equation, we have\n\n\\[ \\int \\rho r^2 = \\frac{\\mu a^2}{2}, \\]\n\nand, dividing both sides by \\( n \\), we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\int \\rho r^2}{n} = \\frac{\\mu a^2}{2n}, \\]\n\nand, extracting the square root and multiplying by 180 it becomes\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{\\int \\rho r^2}{n} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\times 180^\\circ = \\frac{a^2}{2n} \\times 180^\\circ. \\]\n\nTherefore\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{\\mu a^2}{2n} \\times 180^\\circ, \\]\n\nand since\n\n\\[ \\int \\rho r^2 = \\frac{l}{g}, \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\mu a^2}{2n} = \\frac{l}{g}, \\]\n\nand by reduction \\( n = \\frac{g \\mu a^2}{l} \\). But \\( g \\mu \\) is the weight \\( W \\) of the cylinder, therefore, by substituting \\( W \\) instead of \\( g \\mu \\), we obtain\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{P a^2}{2l}, \\]\n\na very simple formula for determining the value of \\( n \\) from experiments.\n\nIf it were required to find a weight \\( Q \\), which, acting at the extremity of a lever \\( L \\), would have a momentum equal to the momentum of the force of torsion when the angle of torsion is \\( A - M \\), we must make\n\n\\[ Q \\times L = n \\times A - M. \\]\n\n346. In the preceding investigation we have supposed, what is conformable to experiment, that the force of torsion is proportional to the angle of torsion, which gives us \\( n \\times A - M \\) for the momentum of that force.\n\nLet us now suppose that this momentum is altered by any quantity \\( S \\), then the momentum of the force of torsion will become \\( n \\times A - M - S \\), and the general equation will assume this form\n\n\\[ n \\times A - M - S \\times i = u \\int \\rho r^2; \\]\n\nand by multiplying in place of \\( i \\) its value \\( \\frac{a M}{u} \\), and taking the fluent, we have\n\n\\[ n \\times 2AM - M^2 - 2SM = u^2 \\int \\rho r^2. \\]\n\nNow, in order to find the value of \\( T \\) or a complete oscillation, we must divide the oscillation into two parts, the first from \\( B \\) to \\( A \\), where the force of torsion accelerates the velocity \\( u \\), while the retarding force, arising from the resistance of the air and the imperfection of elasticity, diminishes the velocity \\( u \\); and the second from \\( A \\) to \\( B' \\), where the force of torsion, as well as the other forces, concur in diminishing \\( u \\) or retarding the motion.\n\n347. Ex. 1. If \\( S = m \\times A - M \\), we shall have for the state of motion in the first portion \\( BA \\)\n\n\\[ n \\times 2AM - M^2 + \\frac{2m \\times A - M}{v+1} = \\frac{2mA^{v+1}}{v+1} = u^2 \\int \\rho r^2. \\]\n\nHence, when the angle of torsion becomes equal to nothing, or \\( A - M = 0 \\), we have\n\n\\[ nA^2 - \\frac{2mA^{v+1}}{v+1} = UU \\int \\rho r^2, \\]\n\nwhich dividing by \\( \\int \\rho r^2 \\), becomes\n\n\\[ \\frac{nA^2}{\\int \\rho r^2} = \\frac{2mA^{v+1}}{v+1}. \\]\n\nLet us now consider the other part of the motion from \\( A \\) to \\( B' \\), and suppose the angle \\( AC = M' \\), we shall find, by calling \\( U \\) the velocity of the point \\( A \\),\n\n\\[ \\frac{nM^2}{2} + \\frac{mM'^{v+1}}{v+1} = \\frac{U^2 - u^2}{2} \\times \\int \\rho r^2. \\]\n\nThen, by substituting instead of \\( U \\) its value as lately found, and taking the fluents, we shall have, when the velocity vanishes, or when the oscillation is finished,\n\n\\[ A - M' = \\frac{2m}{n \\times v+1} \\times \\frac{A^{v+1} + M'^{v+1}}{A + M'}, \\]\n\nand if the retarding forces are such, that at each oscillation, the amplitude is a little diminished, we shall have for the approximate value of \\( A - M' \\)\n\n\\[ A - M' = \\frac{2m}{n \\times v+1} \\times \\frac{A^{v+1}}{A + M'}, \\]\n\nand if the angle \\( A - M' \\) is so small that it may be treated as a common fluxional quantity, we shall then have for any number \\( N \\) of oscillations\n\n\\[ N \\times \\frac{2m}{n \\times v+1} = \\frac{1}{v-1} \\times \\frac{1}{M^{v-1} - A^{v-1}}, \\]\n\nwhere \\( M \\) represents the angle to which \\( A \\) becomes equal after any number of oscillations \\( N \\). Hence we obtain\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{1}{\\left( N \\times \\frac{2m}{n \\times v+1} + \\frac{1}{A^{v-1}} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{v-1}}, \\]\n\nwhich determines the value of \\( M \\) after any number of oscillations \\( N \\).\n\n348. Ex. 2. If \\( S = m \\times A - M \\) and \\( m' \\times A - M \\) and \\( v \\) being different values of \\( m \\) and \\( v \\), we shall obtain by following the mode of investigation in the last example,\n349. Ex. 3. In general, if $S = m \\times A - M + m' \\times A - M' + m'' \\times A - M'' + m''' \\times A - M'''$, &c., we shall always have an oscillation when $S$ is smaller than the force of torsion,\n\n$$n \\times A - M = \\frac{2mA'}{r+1} + \\frac{2m'A''}{r'+1} + \\frac{2m''A'''}{r''+1} + \\frac{2m'''A''''}{r'''+1} + \\text{&c.}$$\n\n350. Having thus given after Coulomb, the mode of deducing formulæ for the oscillatory motion of the cylinder, we shall proceed to give an account of the results of his experiments.\n\nIn these experiments M. Coulomb employed the torsion balance represented in fig. 2, in which he suspended cylinders of different weights from iron and brass wires of different lengths and thicknesses; and by observing carefully the duration of a certain number of oscillations, he was enabled to determine, by means of the preceding formulæ, the laws of the force of torsion relative to the length, the thickness, and the nature of the wires employed. If the elasticity of the metallic wires had been perfect, and if the air opposed no resistance to the oscillating cylinder, it would continue to oscillate till its motion was stopped. The diminution of the amplitudes of the oscillations, therefore, being produced solely by the imperfection of elasticity, and by the resistance of the air, M. Coulomb was enabled, by observing the successive diminution of the amplitude of the oscillation, and by subtracting the part of the change which was due to the resistance of the air, to ascertain, with the assistance of the preceding formulæ, according to what laws this elastic force of torsion was changed.\n\n351. From a great number of experiments it appeared, that when the angle of torsion was not very great, the oscillations were sensibly isochronous; and therefore it may be regarded as a fundamental law, That for all metallic wires, when the angles of torsion are not very great, the force of torsion is sensibly proportional to the angle of torsion. Hence, as the preceding formulæ are founded on this supposition, they may be safely applied to the experiments.\n\n352. In all the experiments, a cylinder of two pounds weight oscillated in twice the time employed by a cylinder which weighed only half a pound; and therefore the duration of the oscillations is as the square root of the weights of the oscillating cylinders. Consequently the tension of the wires has no sensible influence upon the force of torsion. If the tensions however be very great relative to the strength of the metal, the force of torsion does suffer a change; for when the weight of the cylinder, and consequently the tension of the wire, is increased, the wire is lengthened, and as this diminishes the diameter of the wire, the duration of the oscillation must evidently be affected.\n\n353. When the lengths of the wires are varied without changing their diameters or the weights of the cylinders, the times of the same number of oscillations are as the square roots of the lengths of the wires, a result also deducible from theory.\n\n354. When the diameters of the wires are varied without changing their lengths, or the weight of the cylinders, the momentum of the force of torsion varied as the fourth power of the diameters of the wires. Now this result is perfectly conformable to theory; for if we suppose two wires of the same substance, and of the same length, but having their diameters as one to two, it is obvious that in the wire whose diameter is double of the other, there are four times as many parts extended by torsion, as in the smaller wire, and that the mean extension of all these parts will be proportional to the diameter of a wire, the same as the mean arm of a lever is, relative to the axis of rotation. Hence it appears that, according to theory, the force of torsion of two wires of the same nature and of the same length, but of different diameters, is proportional to the fourth power of their diameter.\n\n355. From this it follows in general, that in metallic wires the momentum of torsion is directly in the compound ratio of the angle of torsion and the fourth power of their diameter, and inversely as the length of the wires. If $\\alpha$ therefore be the angle of torsion, $\\lambda$ the length of the thread, $\\delta$ its diameter, and $F$ the force of torsion, we shall have\n\n$$F = \\frac{ma^4}{\\lambda},$$\n\nwhere $m$ is a constant coefficient for wires of the same metal, depending on the tenacity of the metal, and deducible from experiment.\n\n356. When the angle of torsion is not great, relative to the length of the wire, the index of the cylinder returns to the position which it had before the torsion took place, or, in other words, the wire untwists itself by the same quantity by which it had been twisted. But when the angle of torsion is very great, the wire does not completely untwist itself, and therefore the centre of torsion will have advanced by a quantity equal to that which it has not untwisted.—When the angle of torsion was below 45°, the decrements of the amplitudes of the oscillations were nearly proportional to the amplitudes of the angle of torsion; but when the angle exceeded 45°, the decrements increased in a much greater ratio.—The centre of torsion did not begin to advance or be displaced till the angle of torsion was nearly a semicircle: its displacement was very irregular till the angle was one circle and 10 degrees, but beyond this angle the torsion remained nearly the same for all angles.\n\n357. The theory of torsion is particularly useful in delicate researches, where small forces are to be ascertained with a precision which cannot be obtained by ordinary means. It has been successfully employed by Coulomb in discovering the laws of the forces of electricity and magnetism, and in determining the resistance of fluids when the velocities are very small.\nPART II. ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF MACHINERY.\n\n358. We have already seen, when considering the maximum effects of machines, the various causes which affect their performance. It appeared from that investigation, that there must be a certain relation between the velocities of the impelled and working points of a machine, or between the power and the resistance to be overcome, before it can produce a maximum effect, and therefore it must be the first object of the engineer to ascertain that velocity, and to employ it in the construction of this machine. The performance of the machine is also influenced by the friction and inertia of its various parts; and as both these act as resistances, and therefore destroy a considerable portion of the impelling power, it becomes an object of great importance to attend to the simplification of the machinery, and to ascertain the nature of friction so as to diminish its effect, either by the application of unguents or by mechanical contrivances. Since the impelled and working points of a machine are generally connected by means of toothed wheels, the teeth must be formed in such a manner, that the wheels may always act upon each other with the same force, otherwise the velocity of the machine will be variable, and its structure soon injured by the irregularity of its motion. The irregular motion of machines sometimes arises from the nature of the machinery, from an inequality in the resistance to be overcome, and from the nature of the impelling power. In large machines, the momenta of their parts are generally sufficient to equalize these irregularities; but in machines of a small size, and in those where the irregularities are considerable, we must employ fly-wheels for regulating and rendering uniform their variable movements. These various subjects, and others intimately connected with them, we shall now proceed to discuss in their order.\n\nCHAP. I. On the Proportion between the Velocity of the Impelled and Working points of Machines, and between the Power and Resistance, in order that they may perform the greatest work.\n\n359. In the chapter on the maximum effect of machines we have deduced formulae containing $x$ and $y$, the velocities of the impelled and working points of the machines, and including every circumstance which can affect their motion. The formula which exhibits the value of $y$, or the velocity of the working point, assumes various forms, according as we neglect one or more of the elements of which it is composed.—When the work to be performed results only by its inertia, which is the case in urging round a millstone or heavy fly, the quantity $R$ may be neglected, and the second formula, (Page 92, col. 2.) should be employed. In small machines, and particularly in those where the motion is conveyed by wheels with epicycloidal teeth, the friction is very trifling, and the element $\\phi$ may be safely omitted. In corn and saw mills, the quantity $b$ or the inertia of the resistance may be left out of the formula, as the motion communicated to the flour or to the saw dust is too small to be subjected to computation. In machines where one heavy body is employed to raise another merely by its weight, the inertia of the power and the resistance, viz. $a, b$, are proportional to $P, R$, the powers and resistances themselves, and consequently $P, R$ may be substituted in the formula in the place of $a, b$.—The engineer therefore must consider, before he constructs his machine, what elements should enter into the formula, and what should be omitted, in order that he may adapt it to the circumstances of the case, and obtain from his machine the greatest possible effect.\n\n360. When the inertia of the power and that of the resistance are proportional to the power and resistance themselves; and when the inertia and friction of the machine may be omitted, the formula becomes\n\n$$ y = \\sqrt{\\frac{P}{R} + 1} $$\n\nled and working from which the following table is computed, which contains the values of $y$ for different values of $P; R$ being supposed $= 10$, and $m = 1$.\n\n| Proportional value of the impelling power, or $P$ | Value of the velocities of the working point or $y$; or of the lever by which the resistance acts, that of $x$ being 1. |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 1                                             | 0.48829                                          |\n| 2                                             | 0.95445                                          |\n| 3                                             | 1.40175                                          |\n| 4                                             | 1.83216                                          |\n| 5                                             | 2.24745                                          |\n| 6                                             | 2.64911                                          |\n| 7                                             | 3.03841                                          |\n| 8                                             | 3.41641                                          |\n| 9                                             | 3.78405                                          |\n| 10                                            | 4.14214                                          |\n| 11                                            | 4.49138                                          |\n| 12                                            | 4.83240                                          |\n| 13                                            | 5.16575                                          |\n| 14                                            | 5.49193                                          |\n| 15                                            | 5.81139                                          |\n| 16                                            | 6.12451                                          |\n| 17                                            | 6.43168                                          |\n| 18                                            | 6.73320                                          |\n| 19                                            | 7.02938                                          |\n\nIn order to explain the use of this table, let us suppose that it is required to raise one cubic foot of water in a second, by means of a stream which discharges three cubic feet of water in a second; and let it be required to find the construction of a wheel and axle for performing this work; that is, the diameter of the axle, that of the wheel being 6. Here the power is evidently 3 cubic feet, while the resistance is only one cubic foot, therefore $P = 3; R = 10$.\nMECHANICS.\n\nPractical Mechanics. R = 10, consequently P = 3 × 10 = 30. But it appears from the table that when P = 30, y or the diameter of the axle is 1, upon the supposition that the diameter x of the wheel is 1; but as x must be = 6, we shall have y = 6.\n\n361. Instead of using the preceding table, we might find the best proportion between x and y by a kind of tentative process, from the formula \\( \\frac{P \\times R_y - R^2 y^2}{P x^2 + R y^2} \\), which expresses the work performed. This method is indeed tedious; and we mention it only for the sake of showing the conformity of the results, and of proving that there is a certain proportion between x and y which gives a maximum effect. Let x = 6, as in the preceding paragraph, and let us suppose y to be successively 5, 6, and 7, in order to see which of these values is the best. Since P = 3, R = 1, and x = 6, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{When } y = 5 & : \\frac{P \\times R_y - R^2 y^2}{P x^2 + R y^2} = \\frac{3 \\times 6 \\times 1 \\times 5 - 1 \\times 5 \\times 5}{3 \\times 6 \\times 6 + 1 \\times 5 \\times 5} = \\frac{65}{133} = 0.488 \\\\\n\\text{When } y = 6 & : \\frac{P \\times R_y - R^2 y^2}{P x^2 + R y^2} = \\frac{3 \\times 6 \\times 1 \\times 6 - 1 \\times 6 \\times 6}{3 \\times 6 \\times 6 + 1 \\times 6 \\times 6} = \\frac{72}{144} = 0.500 \\\\\n\\text{When } y = 7 & : \\frac{P \\times R_y - R^2 y^2}{P x^2 + R y^2} = \\frac{3 \\times 6 \\times 1 \\times 7 - 1 \\times 7 \\times 7}{3 \\times 6 \\times 6 + 1 \\times 7 \\times 7} = \\frac{77}{157} = 0.49045\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIt appears therefore that when y = 5, 6, 7, the work performed is 0.488; 0.500; 0.49045; so that the effect is a maximum when y = 6, a result similar to what was obtained from the table.\n\nTo find the best proportion between the power and the resistance, the same object however will be gained by properly adjusting the power to the work when the work cannot be altered, or the work to the power when the power is determinate. The formulae in Prop. 2, Chap. 7, exhibit the values of R under many circumstances, and it depends on the judgement of the engineer to select such of them as are adapted to all the conditions of the case.\n\n362. When the machine is already constructed, x and y cannot be varied so as to obtain a maximum effect. The same object however will be gained by properly adjusting the power to the work when the work cannot be altered, or the work to the power when the power is determinate. The formulae in Prop. 2, Chap. 7, exhibit the values of R under many circumstances, and it depends on the judgement of the engineer to select such of them as are adapted to all the conditions of the case.\n\n363. The following table is founded on the formula\n\n\\[ R = \\sqrt{\\frac{y + 1}{y^2}} \\]\n\nwhich answers to the case where the inertia of the impelling power is the same with its pressure, and where the inertia and the friction of the machine may be safely neglected. The second column contains the different values of R corresponding to the values of y in the first column. The numbers in the third column show the ratio of y to R, or they have the same proportion to 1, which R has to the resistance which will balance P. In the table it is supposed that P = 1 and x = 1.\n\n| Values of y, or the velocity of the working point; x being equal to 1. | Values of R, or the resistance to be overcome, P being = 1. | Ratio of R to the resistance which would balance P. |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 1/2                         | 1.8885                                          | 0.4724 to 1                      |\n| 1/3                         | 1.3928                                          | 0.4639                           |\n| 1/4                         | 0.8986                                          | 0.4493                           |\n| 1/5                         | 0.4142                                          | 0.4142                           |\n| 1/6                         | 0.1830                                          | 0.3660                           |\n| 1/7                         | 0.1111                                          | 0.3333                           |\n| 1/8                         | 0.0772                                          | 0.3088                           |\n| 1/9                         | 0.0580                                          | 0.2900                           |\n| 1/10                        | 0.0457                                          | 0.2742                           |\n\n364. To exemplify the use of the preceding table, let us suppose that we are to raise water by means of a simple pulley and bucket, with a power = 10, and that it is required to find the resistance R, or the quantity of water which must be put into the bucket, in order that the work performed may be a maximum. In the simple pulley, x, y, the arms of the vertical levers or the velocities of the impelled and working points are equal; and since x is supposed in the table to be = 1, we have y = 1, which corresponds in the table with 0.4142, the value of R, P being = 1 in the table: But in the present case P = 10. Therefore,\n\n\\[ 10 : 1 = 0.4142 : 4.142 \\]\n\nthe value of R when P = 10.\n\n365. The same result might be obtained in a more circuitous method by means of the formula\n\n\\[ \\frac{P \\times R_y - R^2 y^2}{P x^2 + R y^2} \\]\n\nwhich expresses the performance of the machine. Thus, let x = 1; y = 1; P = 10, and let us suppose R successively equal to 3; 4; 4.142; 5; so that we may determine which of these values gives the greatest performance.\n\nWhen\nWhen $R = 3$, the preceding formula becomes\n\n$$\\frac{10 \\times 3 - 3 \\times 3}{10 + 3} = \\frac{21}{13} = 1.6154.$$  \n\nWhen $R = 4$, the formula becomes\n\n$$\\frac{10 \\times 4 - 4 \\times 4}{10 + 4} = \\frac{24}{14} = 1.7143.$$  \n\nWhen $R = 4.142$, the formula becomes\n\n$$\\frac{10 \\times 4.142 - 4.142^2}{10 + 4.142} = \\frac{24.26384}{14.142} = 1.7157.$$  \n\nWhen $R = 5$, the formula becomes\n\n$$\\frac{10 \\times 5 - 5 \\times 5}{10 + 5} = \\frac{25}{15} = 1.6666.$$  \n\nHence it appears, that when $R = 3; 4; 4.142; 5$; the work performed is respectively $= 1.6154; 1.7143; 1.7157; 1.6666$; so that the work performed is a maximum when $R = 4.142$, the same result which was obtained from the table.\n\n**Chap. II. On the Simplification of Machinery.**\n\n366. As the inertia of every machine adds greatly to the resistance to be overcome, and as the friction of the communicating parts is proportional to the preflure, it becomes a matter of great practical importance, that the different parts of a machine should be proportioned to the strains to which they are exposed. If the beam of a steam-engine, for example, is larger than what is necessary, an immense portion of the impelling power must be destroyed at every stroke of the piston, by dragging the superfluous mass from a state of rest into motion; the preflure upon the gudgeons will also be increased, and their friction in their sockets proportionally enlarged. The engineer, therefore, should be well acquainted with the strength of the materials of which the machine is to be constructed, and should frame its different parts in such a manner that they may not be heavier than what is necessary for resisting the forces with which they are urged.—When the motions of the machine are necessarily irregular, and when the machine may be exposed to accidental strains, the parts must be made considerably stronger than what is necessary for resisting its ordinary strains; but it is not often that such a precaution should be observed. The gudgeons of water-wheels, and of the beams of steam-engines, ought to be made as short and small as possible, as the friction increases with the rubbing surfaces. This is very seldom attended to in the construction of water-wheels. The diameter of the gudgeons is frequently thrice as large as what is necessary for supporting the weight of the wheel.\n\n367. In the construction of machinery we must not only attend to the simplification of the parts, but also to the number of these parts, and the mode of connecting them. From the nature and quantity of the work to be performed, it is easy to ascertain the velocity of the working point which is most proper for performing it. Now this velocity may be procured in a variety of ways, either by a perplexing multiplicity of wheels, or by more simple combinations. The choice of these combinations must be left solely to the judgment of the engineer, as no general rules can be laid down to direct him. It may be useful, however, to remark, that the power should always be applied as near as possible to the working point of the machine, and that when one wheel drives another, the diameter of the one should never be great, when the diameter of the other is very small.—The size of wheels is often determined from the strains to which they are exposed. If, for example, we are obliged to give a certain velocity to an axle by means of a wheel with 120 teeth, and if the force with which this wheel is urged, requires the teeth to be at least one inch thick in order to prevent them from breaking, we shall be obliged to make its diameter at least seven feet; for supposing the spaces between the teeth to be equal to the thickness of the teeth, the circumference of the wheel must at least be equal to $120 + 120 = 240$ inches, the sum of the teeth and their intervals, which gives a diameter of six feet eight inches. There are some cases where our choice of combination must be directed by the nature of the machinery. If the work to be performed is a load raised with a certain velocity by means of a rope winding round a hollow drum, and if the simplest combination of mechanical powers for producing this velocity should give a small diameter to the drum, then this combination must give way to another which corresponds with a larger size of the drum, for, on account of the inflexibility of the ropes, a great portion of the impelling power would be wasted in winding them about the circumference of a small drum.\n\n368. The advantages of simplifying machinery are well exemplified in the following capstan, which unites a powerful capstan with great strength and simplicity. It is represented in fig. 4, where AD is a compound barrel composed of two cylinders of different radii. The rope DEC is fixed at the extremity of the cylinder D; and after passing over the pulley E, which is attached to the load by means of the hook F, it is coiled round the other cylinder D, and fixed at its upper end. The capstan bar AB urges the compound barrel CD about its axis, so that while the rope coils round the cylinder D it unwinds itself from the cylinder C. Let us suppose that the diameter of the part D of the barrel is 21 inches, while the diameter of the part C is only 20 inches, and let the pulley E be 20 inches in diameter. When the barrel AD, therefore, has performed one complete revolution by the preflure exerted at B, 63 inches of rope, equal to the circumference of the cylinder, will be gathered upon the cylinder D, and 60 inches will be unwinded from the cylinder C. The quantity of wound rope, therefore, exceeds the quantity that is unwound by $63 - 60 = 3$ inches, the difference of their respective perimeters; and the half of this quantity, or $\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, will be the space through which the load or pulley E moves by one turn of the bar. If a simple capstan of the same dimensions had been employed, the length of rope coiled round the barrel would have been 60 inches;\ninches; and the space described by the pulley, or load to be overcome, would have been 30 inches. Now, as the power is to the weight as the velocity of the weight is to the velocity of the power, and as the velocity of the power is the same in both capstanes, the weights which they will raise will be as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to 30. If it is wished to double the power of the machine, we have only to cover the cylinder C with lathes a quarter of an inch thick, so that the difference between the radii of each cylinder may be half as little as before; for it is obvious that the power of the capstan increases as the difference between the radii of the cylinders is diminished. As we increase the power, therefore, we increase the strength of our machine, while all other engines are proportionably enfeebled by an augmentation of power. Were we for example to increase the power of the common capstan, we must diminish the barrel in the same proportion, supposing the bar AB not to admit of being lengthened, which will not only diminish its strength, but destroy much of its power by the additional flexure of the rope.—This capstan may be easily converted into a crane by giving the compound barrel a horizontal position, and substituting a winch instead of the bar AB. The superiority of such a crane above the common ones does not require to be pointed out; but it has this additional advantage, that it allows the weight to stop at any part of its progress, without the aid of a ratchet wheel and catch, because the two parts of the rope pull on the contrary sides of the barrel. The rope indeed which coils round the larger part of the barrel acts with a larger lever, and consequently with greater force than the other; but as this excess of force is not sufficient to overcome the friction of the machine, the weight will remain stationary in any part of its path. (Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii.)\n\n369. The principle on which the preceding capstan is constructed, might be applied with great advantage when two separate axles AC, BD are driven by means of the winch H and the wheels B and A. It is evident that when the winch is turned round in one direction, the rope R is unwinded from the axle BD; the wheel B drives the wheel A, so that the axle AC moves in a direction opposite to that of BD, and the rope is coiled round the axle AC. If the wheels A, B are of the same diameter and the same number of teeth, the weight W will be stationary, as the rope winded about one axle will be always equal to what is unwound from the other. If the wheels have different diameters, or different numbers of teeth, the quantity of rope wound round the one axle will exceed what is unwound from the other, and the weight will be raised.\n\n**CHAP. III. On the Nature of Friction and the Method of diminishing its effects in Machinery; and on the rigidity of Ropes.**\n\n370. The friction generated in the communicating parts of machinery, opposes such a resistance to the impelling power, and is so injurious to the machine itself, that an acquaintance with the nature and effects of this retarding force, and with the method of diminishing its effects on machinery, is of infinite importance to the practical mechanic.\n\n371. The subject of friction has been examined at great length by Amontons, Bullinger, Parent, Euler, and Bouffet, and has lately occupied the attention of our ingenious countryman Mr Vince of Cambridge.\n\nHe found that the friction of hard bodies in motion is an uniformly retarding force, and that the Vince's quantity of friction considered as equivalent to a weight, drawing the body backwards is equal to\n\n\\[\nM + \\frac{W \\times S}{g t^2},\n\\]\n\nwhere M is the moving force expressed by its weight, W the weight of the body upon the horizontal plane, S the space through which the moving force or weight descended in the time t, and \\( g = 16.087 \\) feet, the force of gravity. Mr Vince also found that the quantity of friction increases in a less ratio than the quantity of matter or weight of the body, and that the friction of a body does not continue the same when it has different surfaces applied to the plane on which it moves, but that the smallest surfaces will have the least friction.\n\n372. Notwithstanding the attempts of preceding philosophers to unfold the nature of friction, it was reserved for the celebrated Coulomb to surmount the difficulties which are inseparable from such an investigation, and to give an accurate and satisfactory view of this difficult branch of mechanical philosophy. By employing large bodies and conducting his experiments on a large scale, he has corrected several errors which arose from the limited experiments of others; he has brought to light many new and striking phenomena, and confirmed others which were hitherto but partially established. As it would be foreign to the nature of this work to follow this ingenious philosopher through his numerous and varied experiments, we shall only present the reader with the interesting results to which they led.\n\n1. The friction of homogeneous bodies, or bodies of the same kind, moving upon one another, is generally supposed to be greater than that of heterogeneous bodies; but Coulomb has shewn that there are exceptions to this rule. He found, for example, that the friction of oak upon oak was equal to \\( \\frac{1}{2.34} \\) of the force of friction; the friction of pine against pine \\( \\frac{1}{1.78} \\), and that of oak against pine \\( \\frac{1}{1.5} \\). The friction of oak against copper was \\( \\frac{1}{5.5} \\), and that of oak against iron nearly the same.\n\n2. It was generally supposed, that in the case of wood, the friction is greatest when the bodies are dragged contrary to the course of their fibres; but Coulomb has shewn that the friction is in this case sometimes the smallest. When the bodies moved in the direction of their fibres, the friction was \\( \\frac{1}{2.34} \\) of the force with which they were pressed together; but when the motion was contrary to the course of the fibres, the friction was only \\( \\frac{1}{3.76} \\).\n\n3. The longer the rubbing surfaces remain in contact, the greater is their friction.—When wood was moved upon\nMechanics.\n\nPractical upon wood, according to the direction of the fibres, the friction was increased by keeping the surfaces in contact for a few seconds; and when the time was prolonged to a minute, the friction seemed to have reached its farthest limit. But when the motion was contrary to the course of the fibres, a greater time was necessary before the friction arrived at its maximum. When wood was moved upon metal, the friction did not attain its maximum till the surfaces continued in contact for five or six days; and it is very remarkable, that when wooden surfaces were anointed with tallow, the time requisite for producing the greatest quantity of friction is increased. The increase of friction which is generated by prolonging the time of contact is so great, that a body weighing 1650 pounds was moved with a force of 64 pounds when first laid upon its corresponding surface. After having remained in contact for the space of three seconds, it required 160 pounds to put it in motion; and, when the time was prolonged to fix days, it could scarcely be moved with a force of 622 pounds. When the surfaces of metallic bodies were moved upon one another, the time of producing a maximum of friction was not changed by the interpolation of olive oil; it was increased, however, by employing swine's grease as an unguent, and was prolonged to five or six days by beaufearing the surfaces with tallow.\n\n4. Friction is in general proportional to the force with which the rubbing surfaces are pressed together; and is, for the most part, equal to between \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) and \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of that force.\n\nIn order to prove the first part of this proposition, Coulomb employed a large piece of wood, whose surface contained three square feet, and loaded it successively with 74 pounds, 874 pounds, and 2474 pounds. In these cases the friction was successively \\( \\frac{1}{2.46} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{2.16} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{2.21} \\) of the force of pression; and when a less surface and other weights were used, the friction was \\( \\frac{1}{2.36} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{2.42} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{2.40} \\).\n\nSimilar results were obtained in all Coulomb's experiments, even when metallic surfaces were employed. The second part of the proposition has also been established by Coulomb. He found that the greatest friction is engendered when oak moves upon pine, and that it amounts to \\( \\frac{1}{1.78} \\) of the force of pression; on the contrary, when iron moves upon brass, the least friction is produced, and it amounts to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the force of pression.\n\n5. Friction is in general not increased by augmenting the rubbing surfaces.—When a supercifices of three feet square was employed, the friction, with different weights, was \\( \\frac{1}{2.28} \\) at a medium; but when a small surface was used, the friction instead of being greater, as might have been expected, was only \\( \\frac{1}{2.39} \\).\n\n6. Friction for the most part is not augmented by an increase of velocity. In some cases, it is diminished by an augmentation of celerity.—M. Coulomb found, that when wood moved upon wood in the direction of the fibres, the friction was a constant quantity, however much the velocity was varied; but that when the surfaces were very small in respect to the force with which they were pressed, the friction was diminished by augmenting the rapidity; the friction, on the contrary, was increased when the surfaces were very large when compared with the force of pression. When the wood was moved contrary to the direction of its fibres, the friction in every case remained the same. If wood be moved upon metals, the friction is greatly increased by an increase of velocity; and when metals move upon wood beaufearing with tallow, the friction is still augmented by adding to the velocity. When metals move upon metals, the friction is always a constant quantity; but when heterogeneous substances are employed which are not beaufearing with tallow, the friction is so increased with the velocity, as to form an arithmetical progression when the velocities form a geometrical one.\n\n7. The friction of loaded cylinders rolling upon a horizontal plane, is in the direct ratio of their weights, and the inverse ratio of their diameters. In Coulomb's experiments, the friction of cylinders of guaiacum wood, which were two inches in diameter, and were loaded with 1000 pounds, was 18 pounds or \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of the force of pression. In cylinders of elm, the friction was greater by \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\), and was scarcely diminished by the interpolation of tallow.\n\n373. From a variety of experiments on the friction of the axes of pulleys, Coulomb obtained the following results.—When an iron axle moved in a brass bush the friction was \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) of the pression; but when the bush was beaufearing with very clean tallow, the friction was only \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\); when swine's grease was interposed, the friction amounted to \\( \\frac{1}{8.5} \\); and when olive oil was employed as an unguent, the friction was never less than \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{7.5} \\). When the axis was of green oak, and the bush of guaiacum wood, the friction was \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) when tallow was interposed; but when the tallow was removed, so that a small quantity only covered the surface, the friction was increased to \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\). When the bush was made of elm, the friction was in similar circumstances \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), which is the least of all. If the axis be made of box, and the bush of guaiacum wood, the friction will be \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), circumstances being the same as before. If the axle be of boxwood, and the bush of elm, the friction will be \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\); and if the axle be of iron and the bush of elm, the friction will be \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of the force of pression.\n\n374. Having thus considered the nature and effects of friction, we shall now attend to the method of lessening diminishing the resistance which it opposes to the motion of machines. The most efficacious mode of accomplishing this is to convert that species of friction which arises from one body being dragged over another, into that which is occasioned by one body rolling upon another. As this will always diminish the resistance, it may be easily effected by applying wheels or rollers to the sockets or bushes which sustain the gudgeons of large wheels, and the axles of wheel carriages. Caffatus seems to have been the first who recommended this apparatus. It was afterwards mentioned by Sturmius and Wolfus; but was not used in practice till Sully applied wheels to clocks in the year 1716, and Mondran to cranes in 1725. Notwithstanding these solitary attempts to introduce friction wheels, they seem to have attracted little notice till the celebrated Euler examined\nand explained, with his usual accuracy, their nature and advantages. The diameter of the gudgeons and pivots should be made as small as the weight of the wheel and the impelling force will permit. The gudgeons should rest upon wheels as large as circumstances will allow, having their axes as near each other as possible, but no thicker than what is absolutely necessary to sustain the superincumbent weight. When these precautions are properly attended to, the resistance which arises from the friction of the gudgeon, &c., will be extremely trifling.\n\n375. The effects of friction may likewise in some measure be removed by a judicious application of the impelling power, and by proportioning the size of the friction wheels to the pressure which they severally sustain. If we suppose, for example, that the weight of a wheel, whose iron gudgeons move in bushes of brass, is 100 pounds; then the friction arising from both its gudgeons will be equivalent to 25 pounds. If we suppose also that a force equal to 40 pounds is employed to impel the wheel, and acts in the direction of gravity, as in the cases of overhanging wheels, the pressure of the gudgeons upon their supports will then be 140 pounds and the friction 35 pounds. But if the force of 40 pounds could be applied in such a manner as to act in direct opposition to the wheel's weight, the pressure of the gudgeons upon their supports would be 100—40, or 60 pounds, and the friction only 15 pounds. It is impossible indeed to make the moving force act in direct opposition to the gravity of the wheel, in the case of water-mills; and it is often impracticable for the engineer to apply the impelling power but in a given way; but there are many cases in which the moving force may be so exerted, as at least not to increase the friction which arises from the wheel's weight.\n\n376. When the moving force is not exerted in a perpendicular direction, but obliquely as in underhanging wheels, the gudgeon will press with greater force on one part of the socket than on any other part. This point will evidently be on the side of the bush opposite to that where the power is applied; and its distance from the lowest point of the socket, which is supposed circular and concentric with the gudgeon, being called \\( x \\), we shall have\n\n\\[\n\\tan x = \\frac{H}{V}\n\\]\n\nthat is, the tangent of the arch contained between the point of greatest pressure and the lowest point of the bush, is equal to the sum of all the horizontal forces, divided by the sum of all the vertical forces and the weight of the wheel, \\( H \\) representing the former, and \\( V \\) the latter quantities. The point of greatest pressure being thus determined, the gudgeon must be supported at that part by the largest friction wheel, in order to equalize the friction upon their axles.\n\nThe application of these general principles to particular cases is so simple as not to require any illustration. To aid the conceptions, however, of the practical mechanic, we may mention two cases in which friction wheels have been successfully employed.\n\n377. Mr Gottlieb, the constructor of a new crane, has received a patent for what he calls an anti-friction axle-tree, the beneficial effects of which he has ascertained by a variety of trials. It consists of a steel roller \\( R \\) about four or six inches long, which turns within a groove cut in the inferior part of the axle-tree \\( C \\) which runs in the nave \\( A B \\) of the wheel. When the wheel-carriages are at rest, Mr Gottlieb has given the friction Practical wheel its proper position; but it is evident that the point of greatest pressure will change when they are put in motion, and will be nearer the front of the carriage. This point, however, will vary with the weight of the load; but it is sufficiently obvious that the friction roller should be at a little distance from the lowest point of the axle-tree.\n\n378. Mr Garnett of Bristol has applied friction rollers in a different manner, which does not, like the preceding method, weaken the axle-tree. Instead of fixing them in the iron part of the axle, he leaves a space between the nave and the axis to be filled with equal rollers almost touching each other. A section of this apparatus is represented in fig. 7, where \\( ABCD \\) is the metallic ring inserted in the nave of the wheel. The axle-tree is represented at \\( E \\), placed between the friction rollers \\( I, I, I \\), made of metal, and having their axes inserted into a circle of brass which passes through their centres. The circles are riveted together by means of bolts passing between the rollers, in order to keep them separate and parallel.\n\n379. As it appears from the experiments of Coulomb, that the least friction is generated when polished iron moves upon brass, the gudgeons and pivots of wheels, and the axles of friction rollers, should all be made of polished iron; and the bushes in which these gudgeons move, and the friction wheels, should be formed of polished brass.\n\n380. When every mechanical contrivance has been adopted for diminishing the obstruction which arises from the attrition of the communicating parts, it may be still farther removed by the judicious application of unguents. The most proper for this purpose are swine's grease and tallow when the surfaces are made of wood, and oil when they are of metal. When the force with which the surfaces are pressed together is very great, tallow will diminish the friction more than swine's grease. When the wooden surfaces are very small, unguents will lessen their friction a little, but it will be greatly diminished if wood moves upon metal greased with tallow. If the velocities, however, are increased, or the unguent not often enough renewed, in both these cases, but particularly in the last, the unguent will be more injurious than useful. The best mode of applying it, is to cover the rubbing surfaces with as thin a stratum as possible, for the friction will then be a constant quantity, and will not be increased by an augmentation of velocity.\n\n381. In small works of wood, the interposition of the powder of black lead has been found very useful in relieving the motion. The ropes of pulleys should be rubbed with tallow, and whenever the screw is used, the square threads should be preferred.\"\n\nAppendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii.\n\n382. When ropes pass over cylinders or pulleys, a considerable force is necessary to bend them into the form of the circumference round which they are coiled. The force which is necessary to overcome this resistance is called the stiffness or rigidity of the ropes. This important subject was first examined by Amontons, who contrived an ingenious apparatus for ascertaining the rigidity of ropes. His experiments were repeated and confirmed in part by subsequent philosophers, but particularly by M. Coulomb, who has investigated the subject\nMechanics.\n\nHis experiments were made both with the apparatus of Amontons, and with one of his own invention; and as there was no great discrepancy in the results, he was authorised to place more confidence in his experiments. The limits of this article will not permit us to give an account of the manner in which the experiments were conducted, or even to give a detailed view of the various conclusions which were obtained. We can only present the reader with some of those leading results which may be useful in the construction of machinery.\n\n1. The rigidity of ropes increases, the more that the fibres of which they are composed are twisted.\n\n2. The rigidity of ropes increases in the duplicate ratio of their diameters. According to Amontons and Desaguliers, the rigidity increases in the simple ratio of the diameters of the ropes; but this probably arose from the flexibility of the ropes which they employed: for Desaguliers remarks, that when he used a rope whose diameter was half an inch, its rigidity was increased in a greater proportion; so that it is probable that if they had employed ropes from two to four inches in diameter, like those used by Coulomb, they would have obtained similar results. (See No. 9.)\n\n3. The rigidity of ropes is in the simple and direct ratio of their tension.\n\n4. The rigidity of ropes is in the inverse ratio of the diameters of the cylinders round which they are coiled.\n\n5. In general, the rigidity of ropes is directly as their tensions and the squares of their diameters, and inversely as the diameters of the cylinders round which they are wound.\n\n6. The rigidity of ropes increases so little with the velocity of the machine, that it need not be taken into the account when computing the effects of machines.\n\n7. The rigidity of small ropes is diminished when penetrated with moisture; but when the ropes are thick, their rigidity is increased.\n\n8. The rigidity of ropes is increased and their strength diminished when they are covered with pitch; but when ropes of this kind are alternately immersed in the sea and exposed to the air, they last longer than when they are not pitched.—This increase of rigidity, however, is not so perceptible in small ropes as in those which are pretty thick.\n\n9. The rigidity of ropes covered with pitch is a sixth part greater during frost than in the middle of summer, but this increase of rigidity does not follow the ratio of their tensions.\n\n10. The resistance to be overcome in bending a rope over a pulley or cylinder may be represented by a formula composed of two terms. The first term \\( \\frac{aD^n}{r} \\) is a constant quantity independent of the tension, \\( a \\) being a constant quantity determined by experiment, \\( D^n \\) a power of the diameter \\( D \\) of the rope, and \\( r \\) the radius of the pulley or cylinder round which the rope is coiled. The second term of the formula is \\( T \\times \\frac{bD^n}{r} \\), where \\( T \\) is the tension of the rope, \\( b \\) a constant quantity, and \\( D^n \\) and \\( r \\) the same as before. Hence the complete formula is \\( \\frac{aD^n}{r} + T \\times \\frac{bD^n}{r} = \\frac{D^n}{r} \\times a + Tb \\). The exponent \\( n \\) of the quantity \\( D \\) diminishes with the flexibility of the rope, but is generally equal to 1.7 or 1.8; or, as in No. 2, the rigidity is nearly in the duplicate ratio of the diameter of the rope. When the cord is much used, its flexibility is increased, and \\( n \\) becomes equal to 1.5 or 1.4.\n\nChap. IV. On the Nature and Advantages of Fly Wheels.\n\n383. A fly, in mechanics, is a heavy wheel or cylinder which moves rapidly upon its axis, and is applied to machines for the purpose of rendering uniform a delibitory or reciprocating motion, arising either from the nature of the machinery, from an inequality in the resistance to be overcome, or from an irregular application of the impelling power. When the first mover is inanimate, as wind, water, and steam, an inequality of force obviously arises from a variation in the velocity of the wind, from an increase or decrease of water occasioned by sudden rains, or from an augmentation or diminution of the steam in the boiler, produced by a variation in the heat of the furnace; and accordingly various methods have been adopted for regulating the action of these variable powers. The same inequality of force obtains when machines are moved by horses or men. Every animal exerts its greatest strength when first set to work. After pulling for some time, its strength will be impaired; and when the resistance is great, it will take frequent though short relaxations, and then commence its labour with renovated vigour. These intervals of rest and vigorous exertion must always produce a variation in the velocity of the machine, which ought particularly to be avoided, as being detrimental to the communicating parts as well as the performance of the machine, and injurious to the animal which is employed to draw it. But if a fly, consisting either of crosbars, or a maffy circular rim, be connected with the machinery, all these inconveniences will be removed. As every fly wheel must revolve with great rapidity, the momentum of its circumference must be very considerable, and will consequently resist every attempt either to accelerate or retard its motion. When the machine therefore has been put in motion, the fly wheel will be whirling with an uniform celerity, and with a force capable of continuing that celerity when there is any relaxation in the impelling power. After a short rest the animal renews his efforts; but the machine is now moving with its former velocity, and these fresh efforts will have a tendency to increase that velocity. The fly, however, now acts as a resisting power, receives the greatest part of the superfluous motion, and causes the machinery to preserve its original celerity. In this way the fly secures to the engine an uniform motion, whether the animal takes occasional relaxations or exerts his force with redoubled ardour.\n\n384. We have already observed that a delibitory or variable motion frequently arises from the inequality of the resistance, or work to be performed. This is particularly manifest in thrashing mills, on a small scale, which are driven by water. When the corn is laid unequally\nMechanics.\n\nPractical on the feeding board, so that too much is taken in by the fluted rollers, this increase of resistance instantly affects the machinery, and communicates a defunct or irregular motion even to the water wheel or first mover. This variation in the velocity of the impelling power may be distinctly perceived by the ear in a calm evening when the machine is at work. The best method of correcting these irregularities is to employ a fly wheel, which will regulate the motion of the machine when the resistance is either augmented or diminished. In machines built upon a large scale there is no necessity for the introduction of a fly, as the inertia of the machinery supplies its place, and resists every change of motion that may be generated by an unequal admixture of the corn.\n\n385. A variation in the velocity of engines arises also from the nature of the machinery. Let us suppose that a weight of 1000 pounds is to be raised from the bottom of a well 50 feet, by means of a bucket attached to an iron chain which winds round a barrel or cylinder, and that every foot length of this chain weighs two pounds. It is evident that the resistance to be overcome in the first moment is 1000 pounds added to 50 pounds the weight of this chain, and that this resistance diminishes gradually as the chain coils round the cylinder, till it is only 1000 pounds when the chain is completely wound up. The resistance therefore decreases from 1050 to 1000 pounds; and if the impelling power is inanimate, the velocity of the bucket will gradually increase; but if an animal is employed, it will generally proportion its action to the resisting load, and must therefore pull with a greater or less force according as the bucket is near the bottom or top of the well. In this case, however, the affluence of a fly may be dispensed with, because the resistance diminishes uniformly, and may be rendered constant by making the barrel conical, so that the chain may wind upon the part nearest the vertex at the commencement of the motion, the diameter of the barrel gradually increasing as the weight diminishes. In this way the variable resistance will be equalized much better than by the application of a fly wheel, for the fly having no motion of its own must necessarily waste the impelling power.\n\n386. Having thus pointed out the chief causes of a variation in the velocity of machines, and the method of rendering it uniform by the intervention of fly wheels, the utility, and in some instances the necessity, of this piece of mechanism, may be more obviously illustrated by shewing the propriety of their application in particular cases.\n\n387. In the description of Vaulone's pile engine *, the reader will observe a striking instance of the utility of fly wheels. The ram Q is raised between the guides bb by means of horses acting against the levers S, S; but as soon as the ram is elevated to the top of the guides, and discharged from the follower G, the resistance against which the horses have been exerting their force is suddenly removed, and they would instantaneously tumble down, were it not for the fly O. This fly is connected with the drum B by means of the trundle X, and as it is moving with a very great force, it opposes a sufficient resistance to the action of the horses, till the ram is again taken up by the follower.\n\n388. When machinery is driven by a single-stroke steam engine, there is such an inequality in the impelling power, that for two or three seconds it does not act at all. During this interval of inactivity the machinery would necessarily stop, were it not impelled by a massy fly wheel of a great diameter, revolving with rapidity, till the moving power again resumes its energy.\n\n389. If the moving power is a man acting with a handle or winch, it is subject to great inequalities. The greatest force is exerted when the man pulls the handle upwards from the height of his knee, and he acts with the least force when the handle being in a vertical position is thrust from him in a horizontal direction. The force is again increased when the handle is pulled downwards by the man's weight, and it is diminished when the handle being at its lowest point is pulled towards him horizontally. But when a fly is properly connected with the machinery, these irregular exertions are equalized, the velocity becomes uniform, and the load is raised with an equable and steady motion.\n\n390. In many cases, where the impelling force is alternately augmented and diminished, the performance of the machine may be increased by rendering the resistance unequal, and accommodating it to the inequalities of the moving power. Dr Robison observes that \"there are some beautiful specimens of this kind of adjustment in the mechanism of animal bodies.\"\n\nBesides the utility of fly wheels as regulators of machinery, they have been employed for accumulating or collecting power. If motion is communicated to a fly wheel by means of a small force, and if this force is continued till the wheel has acquired a great velocity, such a quantity of motion will be accumulated in its circumference, as to overcome resistances and produce effects which could never have been accomplished by the original force. So great is this accumulation of power; that a force equivalent to 20 pounds applied for the space of 37 seconds to the circumference of a cylinder 20 feet diameter, which weighs 4713 pounds, would, at the distance of one foot from the centre, give an impulse to a musket ball equal to what it receives from a full charge of gunpowder. In the space of six minutes and ten seconds, the same effect would be produced if the cylinder was driven by a man who constantly exerted a force of 20 pounds at a winch one foot long (d).\n\n391. This accumulation of power is finely exemplified in the sling. When the thong which contains the stone is swung round the head of the slinger, the force of the hand is continually accumulating in the revolving stone, till it is discharged with a degree of rapidity which it could never have received from the force of the hand alone. When a stone is projected from the hand itself, there is even then a certain degree of force accumulated, though the stone only moves through the arch of a circle. If we fix the stone in an opening at\n\n* See Part III.\nPlate CCCXXIX.\nFig. 1.\n\n(d) This has been demonstrated by Mr Atwood. See his Treatise on Rectilineal and Rotatory Motion.\nMECHANICS.\n\n392. When coins or medals are struck, a very considerable accumulation of power is necessary, and this is effected by means of a fly. The force is first accumulated in weights fixed in the end of the fly. This force is communicated to two levers, by which it is farther condensed; and from these levers it is transmitted to a screw, by which it suffers a second condensation. The stamp is then impressed on the coin or medal by means of this force, which was first accumulated by the fly, and afterwards augmented by the intervention of two mechanical powers.\n\n393. Notwithstanding the great advantage of fly wheels, both as regulators of machines and collectors of power, their utility wholly depends upon the position which is assigned them relative to the impelled and working points of the engine. For this purpose no particular rules can be laid down, as their positions depend altogether on the nature of the machinery. We may observe however, in general, that when fly wheels are employed to regulate machinery, they should be near the impelling power; and when used to accumulate force in the working point they should not be far distant from it. In hand mills for grinding corn, the fly is for the most part very injudiciously fixed on the axis to which the winch is attached; whereas it should always be fastened to the upper millstone so as to revolve with the same rapidity. In the first position indeed it must equalize the varying efforts of the power which moves the winch; but when it is attached to the turning millstone, it not only does this, but contributes very effectually to the grinding of the corn.\n\n394. A new kind of fly, called a conical pendulum, has been ingeniously employed by Mr Watt for procuring a determinate velocity at the working point of his steam-engine. It is represented in fig. 8, where AB is a vertical axis moving upon pivots, and driven by means of a rope passing from the axis of the large fly over the sheave EF. The large balls M, N are fixed to the rods NG, MH, which have an angular motion round P, and are connected by joints at G and H, with the rods GK, HK attached to the extremity of the lever KL whose centre of motion is L, and whose other extremity is connected with the cock which admits the steam into the cylinder. The frames CD and QR prevent the balls from receding too far from the axis, or from approaching too near it. Now when this conical pendulum is put in motion, the centrifugal force of the balls M, N makes them recede from the axis AB. In consequence of this recession, the points C, H, K are depressed and the other extremity of the lever is raised; and the cock admits a certain quantity of steam into the cylinder. When the velocity of the fly is by any means increased, the balls recede still farther from the axis, the extremity of the lever is raised higher, and the cock closes a little and diminishes the supply of steam. From this diminution in the impelling power, the velocity of the fly and the conical pendulum decreases, and the balls resume their former position. In this way, when there is any increase or diminution in the velocity of the fly, the corresponding increase or diminution in the centrifugal force of the balls raises or depresses the arm of the lever, admits a greater or a less quantity of steam into the cylinder, and restores to the engine its former velocity.\n\nCHAP. V. On the Teeth of Wheels, and the Wipers of Stampers.\n\n395. In the construction of machines, we must not only attend to the form and number of their parts, but also to the mode by which they are to be connected. It would be easy to show, did the limits of this article permit it, that, when one wheel impels another, the impelling power will sometimes act with greater and sometimes with less force, unless the teeth of one or both of the wheels be parts of a curve generated after the manner of an epicycloid by the revolution of one circle along the convex or concave side of another. It may be sufficient to show, that, when one wheel impels another by the action of epicycloidal teeth, their motion will be uniform. Let the wheel CD drive the wheel AB by means of the epicycloidal teeth mp, nq, or r, acting upon the infinitely Fig. 9. small pins or spindles a, b, c; and let the epicycloids mp, nq, &c. be generated by the circumference of the wheel AB, rolling upon the convex circumference of the wheel CD. From the formation of the epicycloid it is obvious that the arch ab is equal to mn, and the arch ac to mo; for during the formation of the part nb of the epicycloid nq, every point of the arch ab is applied to every point of the arch mn, and the same happens during the formation of the part co of the epicycloid or. Let us now suppose that the tooth mp begins to act on the pin a, and that b, c are successive positions of the pin a after a certain time; then, nq, or will be the positions of the tooth mp after the same time; but a = mn and ac = mo, therefore the wheels AB, CD, when the arch is driven by epicycloidal teeth, move through equal spaces in equal times, that is, the force of the wheel CD, and the velocity of the wheel AB, are always uniform.\n\n396. In illustrating the application of this property of the epicycloid, which was discovered by Olaus Roemer the celebrated Danish astronomer, we shall call the small wheel the pinion, and its teeth the leaves of the pinion. The line which joins the centre of the wheel and pinion is called the line of centres. There are three different ways in which the teeth of one wheel may drive another, and each of these modes of action requires a different form for the teeth.\n\n1. When the action is begun and completed after the teeth have passed the line of centres.\n\n2. When the action is begun and completed before they reach the line of centres.\n\n3. When the action is carried on, on both sides of the line of centres.\n\n397. 1. The first of these modes of action is represented in fig. 1, where B is the centre of the wheel (D), A that of the pinion, and AB the line of centres. It is evident from the figure, that the part b of the tooth ab of the wheel, does not act on the leaf m of the pinion till they arrive at the line of centres AB; and that all the action is carried on after they have passed this line, and is completed when the leaf m comes into the situation n. When this mode of action is adopted, the acting faces\n\n(D) In figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, the letter B is supposed to be placed at the centre of the wheels.\nof the leaves of the pinion should be parts of an interior epicycloid, generated by a circle of any diameter rolling upon the concave superficies of the pinion, or within the circle adh; and the faces ab of the teeth of the wheel should be portions of an exterior epicycloid formed by the same generating circle rolling upon the convex superficies adp of the wheel.\n\n398. But when one circle rolls within another whose diameter is double that of the rolling circle, the line generated by any point of the latter is a straight line, tending to the centre of the larger circle. Therefore, if the generating circle above mentioned should be taken with its diameter equal to the radius of the pinion, and be made to roll upon the concave superficies adh of the pinion, it will generate a straight line tending to the pinion's centre, which will be the form of the faces of its leaves; and the teeth of the wheel will be exterior epicycloids, formed by a generating circle, whose diameter is equal to the radius of the pinion, rolling upon the convex superficies adp of the wheel. This rectilineal form of the teeth is exhibited in fig. 2, and is perhaps the most advantageous, as it requires less trouble, and may be executed with greater accuracy, than if the epicycloidal form had been employed, though the teeth are evidently weaker than those in fig. 1; it is recommended both by De la Hire and Camus as particularly advantageous in clock and watch work.\n\n399. The attentive reader will perceive from fig. 1, that in order to prevent the teeth of the wheel from acting upon the leaves of the pinion before they reach the line of centres AB; and that one tooth of the wheel may not quit the leaf of the pinion till the succeeding tooth begins to act upon the succeeding leaf, there must be a certain proportion between the number of leaves in the pinion and the number of teeth in the wheel, or between the radius of the pinion and the radius of the wheel, when the distance of the leaves AB is given. But in machinery the number of leaves and teeth is always known from the velocity which is required at the working point of the machine: It becomes a matter therefore of great importance to determine with accuracy the relative radii of the wheel and pinion.\n\n400. For this purpose, let A, fig. 2, be the pinion having the acting faces of its leaves straight lines tending to the centre, and B the centre of the wheel, AB will be the distance of their centres. Then as the tooth C is supposed not to act upon the leaf Am till it arrives at the line AB, it ought not to quit Am till the following tooth F has reached the line AB. But since the tooth always acts in the direction of a line drawn perpendicular to the face of the leaf Am from the point of contact, the line CH, drawn at right angles to the face of the leaf Am, will determine the extremity of the tooth CD, or the last part of it which should act upon the leaf Am, and will also mark out CD for the depth of the tooth. Now, in order to find AH, HB, and CD, put a for the number of teeth in the wheel, b for the number of leaves in the pinion, c for the distance of the pivots A and B, and let x be the radius of the wheel, and y that of the pinion. Then, since the circumference of the wheel is to the circumference of the pinion, as the number of teeth in the one to the number of leaves in the other, and as the circumferences of circles are proportional to their radii, we shall have \\(a : b = x : y\\), then by composition (Eucl. v. 18.) \\(a + b : b = c : y\\) (c being equal to \\(x + y\\)), and consequently the radius of the pinion, viz. \\(y = \\frac{c}{a + b}\\); then by inverting the first analogy, we have \\(b : a = y : x\\), and consequently the radius of the wheel, viz. \\(x = \\frac{a}{b} y\\); \\(y\\) being now a known number.\n\nNow, in the triangle AHC, right angled at C, the side AH is known, and likewise all the angles (HAC being equal to \\(\\frac{360}{b}\\)); the side AC, therefore, may be found by plain trigonometry. Then, in the triangle ACB, the CAB, equal to HAC, is known, and also the sides AB, AC, which contain it; the third side, therefore, viz. CB, may be determined; from which DB, equal to HB, already found, being subtracted, there will remain CD for the depth of the teeth. When the action is carried on after the line of centres, it often happens that the teeth will not work in the hollows of the leaves. In order to prevent this, the CBH must always be greater than half the HBP. The CBH is equal to 360 degrees, divided by the number of teeth in the wheel, and CBH is easily found by plain trigonometry.\n\n401. If the teeth of wheels and the leaves of pinions be formed according to the directions already given, they will act upon each other, not only with uniform force, but nearly without friction. The one tooth rolls upon the other, and neither slides nor rubs to such a degree as to retard the wheels, or wear their teeth. But as it is impossible in practice to give that perfect curvature to the faces of the teeth which theory requires, a quantity of friction will remain after every precaution has been taken in the formation of the communicating parts.\n\n402. 2. The second mode of action is not so advantageous as that which we have been considering, and should, if possible, always be avoided. It is represented in action fig. 3, where A is the centre of the pinion, B that of fig. 3, the wheel, and AB the line of centres. It is evident from the figure that the tooth C of the wheel acts upon the leaf D of the pinion before they arrive at the line BA; that it quits the leaf when they reach this line, and have assumed the position of E and F; and that the tooth C works deeper and deeper between the leaves of the pinion, the nearer it comes to the line of centres. From this last circumstance a considerable quantity of friction arises, because the tooth C does not, as before, roll upon the leaf D, but slides upon it; and from the same cause the pinion soon becomes foul, as the dust which lies upon the acting faces of the leaves is pushed into the interjacent hollows. One advantage, however, attends this mode of action: It allows us to make the teeth of the large wheel rectilineal, and thus renders the labour of the mechanic less, and the accuracy of his work greater, than if they had been of a curvilinear form. If the teeth C, E, therefore of the wheel BC are made rectilineal, having their surfaces directed to the wheel's centre, the acting faces of the leaves D, F, &c., must be epicycloids formed by a generating circle, whose diameter is equal to the radius Bo of the circle op, rolling upon the circumference mn of the pinion A. But if the teeth of the wheel and the leaves of the pinion are made curvilinear as in the figure, the faces of the teeth of the wheel must be portions of an interior epicycloid formed by any generating...\nMechanics.\n\n403. The third mode of action, which is represented in fig. 4, is a combination of the two first modes, and consequently partakes of the advantages and disadvantages of each. It is evident from the figure that the portion \\( e b \\) of the tooth acts upon the part \\( b c \\) of the leaf till they reach the line of centres \\( A B \\), and that the part \\( e d \\) of the tooth acts upon the portion \\( b a \\) of the leaf after they have passed this line. Hence the acting parts \\( e k \\) and \\( b c \\) must be formed according to the directions given for the first mode of action, and the remaining parts \\( e d \\) and \\( b a \\) must have that curvature which the second mode of action requires; consequently \\( e h \\) should be part of an interior epicycloid formed by any generating circle rolling on the concave circumference \\( m n \\) of the wheel, and the corresponding part \\( b c \\) of the leaf should be part of an exterior epicycloid formed by the same generating circle rolling upon \\( b E O \\), the convex circumference of the pinion; the remaining part \\( c d \\) of the tooth should be a portion of an exterior epicycloid, engendered by any generating circle rolling upon \\( e L \\), the concave supercifices of the wheel; and the corresponding part \\( b a \\) of the leaf should be part of an interior epicycloid described by the same generating circle, rolling along the concave side \\( b E O \\) of the pinion. As it would be extremely troublesome, however, to give this double curvature to the acting faces of the teeth, it will be proper to use a generating circle, whose diameter is equal to the radius of the wheel \\( BC \\), for describing the interior epicycloid \\( e k \\) and the exterior one \\( b c \\), and a generating circle, whose diameter is equal to \\( AC \\), the radius of the pinion, for describing the interior epicycloid \\( b a \\), and the exterior one \\( e d \\). In this case the two interior epicycloids \\( e h \\) and \\( b a \\) will be straight lines tending to the centres \\( B \\) and \\( A \\), and the labour of the mechanic will by this means be greatly abridged.\n\n404. In order to find the relative diameters of the wheel and pinion, when the number of teeth in the one and the number of leaves in the other are given, and when the distance of their centres is also given, and the ratio of \\( ES \\) to \\( CS \\), let \\( a \\) be the number of teeth in the wheel, \\( b \\) the number of leaves in the pinion, \\( c \\) the distance of the pivots \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), and let \\( m \\) be to \\( n \\) as \\( ES \\) to \\( CS \\), then the arch \\( ES \\), or \\( \\angle SAE \\), will be equal to \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{b} \\), and \\( LD \\), or \\( \\angle LBD \\), will be equal to \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{a} \\). But \\( ES : CS = m : n \\); consequently \\( LD : LC = m : n \\), therefore (Eucl. vi. 16.) \\( LC \\times m = LD \\times n \\), and \\( LC = \\frac{LD \\times n}{m} \\); but \\( LD \\) is equal to \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{a} \\), therefore by substitution \\( LC = \\frac{360^\\circ \\times n}{a \\times m} \\).\n\nNow, in the triangle \\( APB \\), \\( AB \\) is known, and also \\( PB \\), which is the cosine of the angle \\( ABD \\), \\( PC \\) being perpendicular to \\( DB \\); \\( AP \\) or the radius of the pinion therefore may be found by plane trigonometry. The reader will observe, that the point \\( P \\) marks out the parts of the tooth \\( D \\) and the leaf \\( SP \\) where they commence their action; and the point \\( I \\) marks out the parts where their mutual action ceases (\\( E \\)); \\( AP \\) therefore is the proper radius of the pinion, and \\( BI \\) the proper radius of the wheel, the parts of the tooth \\( L \\) without the point \\( I \\), and of the leaf \\( SP \\) without the point \\( P \\), being superfluous. Now, to find \\( BI \\), we have \\( ES : CS = m : n \\), and \\( CS = \\frac{ES \\times n}{m} \\); but \\( ES \\) was shewn to be \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{b} \\), therefore, by substitution, \\( CS = \\frac{360^\\circ \\times n}{b \\times m} \\). Now the arch \\( ES \\), or \\( \\angle EAS \\), being equal to \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{b} \\), and \\( CS \\), or \\( \\angle CAS \\), being equal to \\( \\frac{360^\\circ \\times n}{b \\times m} \\), their difference \\( EC \\), or the angle \\( EAC \\), will be equal to \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{b} - \\frac{360^\\circ \\times n}{b \\times m} \\), or \\( \\frac{360^\\circ \\times m - n}{b \\times m} \\). The \\( \\angle EAC \\) being thus found, the triangle \\( EAB \\), or \\( IAB \\), which is almost equal to it, is known, because \\( AB \\) is given, and likewise \\( AI \\), which is equal to the cosine of the angle \\( IAB \\), \\( AC \\) being radius, and \\( AIC \\) being a right angle, consequently \\( IB \\) the radius of the wheel may be found by trigonometry. It was formerly shewn that \\( AC \\), the radius of what is called the primitive pinion, was equal to \\( \\frac{ab}{a + b} \\), and that \\( BC \\) the radius of the primitive wheel was equal to \\( \\frac{AC \\times a}{b} \\). If then we subtract \\( AC \\) or \\( AS \\) from \\( AP \\), we shall have the quantity \\( SP \\) which must be added to the radius of the primitive pinion, and if we take the difference of \\( BC \\) (or \\( BL \\)) and \\( DE \\), the quantity \\( LE \\) will be found, which must be added to the radius of the primitive wheel. We have all along supposed that the wheel drives the pinion, and have given the proper form of the teeth upon this supposition. But when the pinion drives the wheel, the form which was given to the teeth of the wheel in the first case, must in this be given to the leaves of the pinion; and the shape which was formerly given to the leaves of the pinion must now be transferred to the teeth of the wheel.\n\n405. Another form for the teeth of wheels, different from any which we have mentioned, has been recommended by Dr Robison. He shews that a perfect uniformity of action may be secured, by making the acting faces of the teeth involutes of the wheel's circumference, which are nothing more than epicycloids, the centres of whose generating circles are infinitely distant. Thus, in fig. 1, let \\( AB \\) be a portion of the wheel on which\n\n---\n\n(e) The letter \\( L \\) marks the intersection of the line \\( BL \\) with the arch \\( em \\), and the letter \\( E \\) the intersection of the arch \\( BO \\) with the upper surface of the leaf \\( m \\). The letters \\( D \\) and \\( S \\) correspond with \\( L \\) and \\( E \\) respectively, and \\( P \\) with \\( I \\).\nwhich the tooth is to be fixed, and let A p a be a thread lapped round its circumference, having a loop hole at its extremity a. In this loop hole fix the pin a, and with it describe the curve or involute a b c d e h, by unlapping the thread gradually from the circumference A p m. This curve will be the proper shape for the teeth of a wheel whose diameter is A B. Dr Robison observes, that as this form admits of several teeth to be acting at the same time (twice the number that can be admitted in M. de la Hire's method), the pressure is divided among several teeth, and the quantity upon any one of them is so diminished, that those dents and impressions which they unavoidably make upon each other are partly prevented. He candidly allows, however, that the teeth thus formed are not completely free from sliding and friction, though this slide is only \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) th of an inch, when a tooth three inches long fixed on a wheel ten feet in diameter drives another wheel whose diameter is two feet. Append. to Ferguson's Lectures.\n\n406. On the Formation of Exterior and Interior Epicycloids, and on the Disposition of the Teeth on the Wheel's Circumference.\n\nNothing can be of greater importance to the practical mechanic, than to have a method of drawing epicycloids with facility and accuracy; the following, we trust, is the most simple mechanical method that can be employed.—Take a piece of plain wood G H, fig. 6, and fix upon it another piece of wood E, having its circumference m b of the same curvature as the circular base upon which the generating circle A B is to roll. When the generating circle is large, the segment B will be sufficient: in any part of the circumference of this segment, fix a sharp pointed nail a, sloping in such a manner that the distance of its point from the centre of the circle may be exactly equal to its radius; and fasten to the board G H a piece of thin brass, or copper, or tinplate, a b, distinguished by the dotted lines. Place the segment B in such a position that the point of the nail a may be upon the point b, and roll the segment towards C, so that the nail a may rise gradually, and the point of contact between the two circular segments may advance towards m; the curve a b described upon the brass plate will be an accurate exterior epicycloid. In order to prevent the segments from sliding, their peripheries should be rubbed with rosin or chalk, or a number of small iron points may be fixed on the circumference of the generating segment. Remove, with a file, the part of the brass on the left hand of the epicycloid, and the remaining concave arch or gage a b will be a pattern tooth, by means of which all the rest may be easily formed. When an interior epicycloid is wanted, the concave side of its circular base must be used. The method of describing it is represented in fig. 7, where C D is the generating circle, F the concave circular base, M N the piece of wood on which this base is fixed, and c d the interior epicycloid formed upon the plate of brass, by rolling the generating circle C, or the generating segment D, towards the right hand. The cycloid, which is useful in forming the teeth of rack work, is generated precisely in the same manner, with this difference only, that the base on which the generating circle rolls must be a straight line.\n\nIn order that the teeth may not embarrass one another before their action commences, and that one tooth may begin to act upon its corresponding leaf of the pinion, before the preceding tooth has ceased to act upon the preceding leaf, the height, breadth, and distance of teeth, the teeth must be properly proportioned. For this purpose the pitch-line or circumference of the wheel, which is represented in fig. 2, and 3, by the dotted arches, must be divided into as many equal spaces as the number of teeth which the wheel is to carry. Divide each of these spaces into 16 equal parts; allow 7 of these for the greatest breadth of the teeth, and 9 for the distance between each; or the distance of the teeth may be made equal to their breadth. If the wheel drive a trundle, each space should be divided into 7 equal parts, and 3 of these allotted for the thickness of the tooth, and 3 for the diameter of the cylindrical flange of the trundle. If each of the spaces already mentioned, or if the distance between the centres of each tooth, be divided into three equal parts, the height of the teeth must be equal to two of these. These distances and heights, however, vary according to the mode of action which is employed. The teeth should be rounded off at the extremities, and the radius of the wheel made a little larger than that which is deduced from the rules in Art. 400, 404. But when the pinion drives the wheel, a small addition should be made to the radius of the pinion.\n\nOn the Nature of Bevelled Wheels, and the method of giving an epicycloidal form to their Teeth.\n\n407. The principle of bevelled wheels was pointed out by De la Hire, so long ago as the end of the 17th century. It consists in one fluted or toothed cone acting upon another, as is represented in fig. 8, where the cone O D Fig. 8 drives the cone O C, conveying its motion in the direction O C. If these cones be cut parallel to their bases at A and B, and if the two small cones between A B and O be removed, the remaining parts A C and B D may be considered as two bevelled wheels, and B D will act upon A C in the very same manner, and with the same effect, that the whole cone O D acted upon the whole cone O C. If the section be made nearer the bases of the cones, the same effect will be produced: this is the case in fig. 9, where C D and Fig. 9. D E are but very small portions of the imaginary cones A C D and A D E.\n\n408. In order to convey motion in any given direction, and determine the relative size and situation of the wheels for this purpose, let A B, fig. 10, be the axis Fig. 10. of a wheel, and C D the given direction in which it is required to convey the motion by means of a wheel fixed upon the axis A B, and acting upon another wheel fixed on the axis C D, and let us suppose that the axis C D must have four times the velocity of A B, or must perform four revolutions while A B performs one. Then the number of teeth in the wheel fixed upon A B must be four times greater than the number of teeth in the wheel fixed upon C D, and their radii must have the same proportion. Draw c d parallel to C D at any convenient distance, and draw a b parallel to A B at four times that distance, then the lines i m and i n drawn perpendicular to A B and C D respectively, will mark the situation and size of the wheels required.\nMechanics.\n\nPractical Mechanics.\n\nOn the formation of their teeth.\n\nThis case the cones are Oni and Omi, and sri, r p mi, are the portions of them that are employed.\n\nThe formation of the teeth of bevelled wheels is more difficult than one would at first imagine. The teeth of such wheels, indeed, must be formed by the same rules which have been given for other wheels; but since different parts of the same tooth are at different distances from the axis, these parts must have the curvature of their acting surfaces proportioned to that distance. Thus, in fig. 10, the part of the tooth at r must be more incurvated than the part at i, as is evident from the inspection of fig. 9; and the epicycloid for the part i must be formed by means of circles whose diameters are im and Ff, while the epicycloid for the part r must be generated by circles whose diameters are Cn and Dd.\n\n409. Let us suppose a plane to pass through the points O, A, D; the lines AB, AO, will evidently be in this plane, which may be called the plane of centres. Now, when the teeth of the wheel DE, which is supposed to drive CD the smallest of the two, commence their action on the teeth of CD, when they arrive at the plane of centres, and continue their action after they have passed this plane, the curve given to the teeth of CD at C should be a portion of an interior epicycloid formed by any generating circle rolling on the concave surfaces of a circle whose diameter is twice Cn perpendicular to CA, and the curvature of the teeth at i should be part of a similar epicycloid, formed upon a circle, whose diameter is twice im. The curvature of the teeth of the wheel DE at D, should be part of an exterior epicycloid formed by the same generating circle rolling upon the concave circumference of a circle whose diameter is twice Dd perpendicular to DA; and the epicycloid for the teeth at F is formed in the same way, only instead of twice Dd, the diameter of the circle must be twice Ff. When any other mode of action is adopted, the teeth are to be formed in the same manner that we have pointed out for common wheels, with this difference only, that different epicycloids are necessary for the parts F and D. It may be sufficient, however, to find the form of the teeth at F, as the remaining part of the tooth may be shaped by directing a straight rule from different points of the epicycloid at F to the centre A, and filing the tooth till every part of its acting surface coincide with the side of the ruler. The reason of this operation will be obvious by attending to the shape of the tooth in fig. 8. When the small wheel CD impels the large one DE, the epicycloids which were formerly given to CD must be given to DE, and those which were given to DE must be transferred to CD.\n\n410. The wheel represented in fig. 11, is sometimes called a crown wheel, though it is evident from the figure that it belongs to that species of wheels which we have just been considering; for the acting surfaces of the teeth both of the wheel MB and of the pinion EDG are directed to C the common vertex of the two cones CM, CEG. In this case the rules for bevelled wheels must be adopted, in which AS is to be considered as the radius of the wheel for the profile of the tooth at A, and MN as its radius for the profile of the tooth at M; and the epicycloids thus formed will be the sections or profiles of the teeth in the direction MP, at right angles to MC, the surfaces of the cone. When the vertex C of the cone MCG approaches to N till it be in the same plane with the points M, G, some of the curves will be cycloids and others involutes, as in the case of rackwork, for then the cone CEG will revolve upon a plane surface. Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures.\n\nSect. II. On the Wipers of Stampers, &c., the Teeth of Rackwork, &c., &c.\n\n411. In fig. 12, let AB be the wheel which is employed to elevate the rack C, and let their mutual action not commence till the acting teeth have reached the line of centres AC. In this case C becomes as it were the pinion or wheel driven, and the acting faces of its teeth must be interior epicycloids formed by any generating circle rolling within the circumference pq; but as pq is a straight line, these interior epicycloids will be cycloids, or curves generated by a point in the circumference of a circle, rolling upon a straight line or plane surface. The acting face op, therefore, will be part of a cycloid formed by any generating circle, and mn, the acting face of the teeth of the wheel, must be an exterior epicycloid produced by the same generating circle rolling on mr the convex surface of the wheel. If it is required to make op a straight line, as in the figure, then mn must be an involute of the circle mr formed in the manner represented in fig. 5.\n\n412. Fig. 12 likewise represents a wheel depressing the rack c when the third mode of action is used. In this case also c becomes the pinion, and DE the wheel; e h therefore must be part of an interior epicycloid formed by any generating circle rolling on the concave side ex of the wheel, and bc must be an exterior epicycloid produced by the same generating circle rolling upon the circumference of the rack. The remaining part cd of the teeth of the wheel, must be an exterior epicycloid described by any generating circle moving upon the convex side ex, and ba must be an interior epicycloid engendered by the same generating circle rolling within the circumference of the rack. But as the circumference of the rack is in this case a straight line, the exterior epicycloid bc and the interior one ba will be cycloids formed by the same generating circles which are employed in describing the other epicycloids. Since it would be difficult, however, as has already been remarked, to give this compound curvature to the teeth of the wheel and rack, we may use a generating circle whose diameter is equal to D x the radius of the wheel, for describing the interior epicycloid eh, and the exterior one bc; and a generating circle whose diameter is equal to the radius of the rack, for describing the interior epicycloid ab, and the exterior one de; ab and eh, therefore, will be straight lines and bc will be a cycloid, and de an involute of the circle ex, the radius of the rack being infinitely great.\n\n413. In the same manner may the form of the teeth of rack-work be determined, when the second mode of action is employed, and when the teeth of the wheel or rack are circular or rectilineal. But if the rack be part of a circle, it must have the same form for its teeth as that of a wheel of the same diameter with the circle of which it is a part.\nIn machinery, where large weights are to be raised, such as fulling-mills, mills for pounding ore, &c., or where large pistons are to be elevated by the arms of levers, it is of the greatest consequence that the power should raise the weight with an uniform force and velocity; and this can be effected only by giving a proper form to the wiper.\n\nNow there are two cases in which this uniformity of motion may be required, and each of these demands a different form for the communicating parts.\n\n1. When the weight is to be raised vertically, as the piston of a pump, &c.\n2. When the weight to be raised or depressed moves upon a centre, and rises or falls in the arch of a circle, such as the fledge hammer in a forge, &c.\n\nFig. 13.\n\n414. 1. Let AH be a wheel moved by any power which is sufficient to raise the weight MN by its extremity O, from O to e, in the same time that the wheel moves round one-fourth of its circumference, it is required to fix upon its rim a wing OB CDEH which shall produce this effect with an uniform effort. Divide the quadrant OH into any number of equal parts Om, mn, &c., the more the better, and o into the same number ob, bc, cd, &c., and through the points m, n, p, H draw the indefinite lines AB, AC, AD, AE, and make AB equal to Ab, AC to Ac, AD to Ad, and AE to Ae; then through the points O, B, C, D, E, draw the curve OB CDE, which is a portion of the spiral of Archimedes, and will be the proper form for the wiper or wing OHE. It is evident that when the point m has arrived at O, the extremity of the weight will have arrived at b; because AB is equal to Ab, and for the same reason, when the points n, p, H have successively arrived at O, the extremity of the weight will have arrived at the corresponding points c, d, e. The motion therefore will be uniform, because the space described by the weight is proportional to the space described by the moving power, Ob being to Oc as Om to On. If it be required to raise the weight MN with an accelerated or retarded motion, we have only to divide the line Oe according to the law of acceleration or retardation, and divide the curve OB CDE as before.\n\n415. 2. When the lever moves upon a centre, the weight will rise in the arch of a circle, and consequently a new form must be given to the wipers or wings. Let AB, fig. 14, be a lever lying horizontally, which it is required to raise uniformly through the arch BC into the position AC, by means of the wheel BFH furnished with the wing BNOP, which acts upon the extremity C of the lever; and let it be required to raise it through BC in the same time that the wheel BFH moves through one-half of its circumference; that is, while the point M moves to B in the direction MFB. Divide the chord CB into any number of equal parts, the more the better, in the points 1, 2, 3, and draw the lines 1a, 2b, 3c parallel to AB, or a horizontal line passing through the point B, and meeting the arch CB in the points a, b, c. Draw the lines CD, aD, bD, cD, and BD cutting the circle BFH in the points m, n, o, p.\n\nHaving drawn the diameter BM, divide the semicircle BFM into as many equal parts as the chord CB, in the points q, s, u. Take Bm, and set it from q to r; Take Bn and let it from s to t; Take Bo and set it from u to v, and lastly set Bp from M to E. Through the points r, s, t, v, draw the indefinite lines DN, DO, DP, DQ, and make DN equal to De; DO equal to Db; DP equal to Da; and DQ equal to DC. Then through the points Q, P, O, N, B, draw the spiral B, N, O, P, Q, which will be the proper form for the wing of the wheel when it moves in the direction EMB.\n\nThat the spiral BNO will raise the lever AC, with an uniform motion, by acting upon its extremity c, will appear from the slightest attention to the construction of the figure. It is evident, that when the point q arrives at B, the point r will be in m, because Bm is equal to qr, and the point N will be at c, because DN is equal to De; the extremity of the lever, therefore, will be found in the point c, having moved through Be. In like manner, when the point s has arrived at B, the point t will be at n, and the point O in b, where the extremity of the lever will now be found; and so on with the rest, till the point M has arrived at B. The point E will then be in p, and the point Q in C; so that the lever will now have the position AC, having moved through the equal heights Be, eb, ba, ac, (r) in the same time that the power has moved through the equal spaces qB, sq, us, Mu. The lever, therefore, has been raised uniformly, the ratio between the velocity of the power, and that of the weight, remaining always the same.\n\n416. If the wheel D turn in a contrary direction, according to the letters MHB, we must divide the semicircle BH EM, into as many equal parts as the chord CB, viz., in the points e, g, h. Then, having set the arch Bm from e to d, the arch Bn from g to f, and the rest in a similar manner, draw through the points d, f, h, E, the indefinite lines DR, DS, DT, DQ; make DR equal to De; DS equal to Db; DT equal to Da, and DQ equal to DC; and though the points B, R, S, T, Q, describe the spiral BRSTQ, which will be the proper form for the wing, when the wheel turns in the direction MEB. For, when the point e arrives at B, the point d will be in m, and R in c, where the extremity of the lever will now be found, having moved through Be in the same time that the power, or wheel, has moved through the division eB. In the same manner it may be shewn, that the lever will rise through the equal heights eb, ba, ac, C, in the same time that the power moves through the corresponding spaces eg, g i, iM. The motion of the lever, therefore, and also that of the power, are always uniform. Of all the positions that can be given to the point B, the most disadvantageous are those which are nearest the points F, H; and the most advantageous position is when the chord Be is vertical, and passes, when prolonged, through D, the centre\n\n(r) The arches Be, eb, &c., are not equal; but the perpendiculars let fall from the points e, a, b, &c., upon the horizontal lines, passing through a', &c., are equal, being proportional to the equal lines c1, 1, 2. Eucl. VI. 2.\nMECHANICS.\n\nIn this particular case the two curves have equal bases, though they differ a little in point of curvature. The farther that the centre A is distant, the nearer do these curves resemble each other; and if it were infinitely distant, they would be exactly similar, and would be the spirals of Archimedes, as the extremity c would in this case rise perpendicularly.\n\nIt will be easily perceived that 4, 6, or 8 wings may be placed upon the circumference of the circle, and may be formed by dividing into the same number of equal parts as the chord BC, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), or \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) of the circumference, instead of the semicircle BFM.\n\nThat the wing BNO may not act upon any part of the lever between A and C, the arm AC should be bent; and that the friction may be diminished as much as possible, a roller should be fixed upon its extremity C. When a roller is used, however, a curve must always be drawn parallel to the spiral described according to the preceding method, the distance between it and the spiral being everywhere equal to the radius of the roller.\n\nIf it should be required to raise the lever with an accelerated or retarded motion, we have only to divide the chord BC, according to the degree of retardation or acceleration required, and the circle into the same number of equal parts as before.\n\n417. As it is frequently more convenient to raise or depress weights by the extremity of a constant radius, furnished with a roller, instead of wings fixed upon the periphery of a wheel; we shall now proceed to determine the curve which must be given to the arm of the lever, which is to be raised or depressed, in order that this elevation or depression may be effected with an uniform motion.\n\nLet AB be a lever, which it is required to raise uniformly through the arch BC, into the position AC, by means of the arm or constant radius DE, moving upon D as a centre, in the same time that the extremity E describes the arch EeF. From the point C draw CH at right angles to AB, and divide it into any number of equal parts, suppose three, in the points 1, 2; and through the points 1, 2, draw 1a2b, parallel to the horizontal line AB, cutting the arch CB in the points a, b, through which draw aA, bA. Upon D as a centre, with the distance DE, describe the arch EieF, and upon A as a centre, with the distance Practical AD, describe the arch eOD, cutting the arch EieF Mechanics in the point e. Divide the arches Eie, and F'e, each into the same number of equal parts as the perpendicular CH, in the points k, i, s, m, and through these points, about the centre A, describe the arches kzs, igq', mn'. Take sa and let it from k to l, and take gf, and set it from i to h. Take rq also, and set it from s to t, and set nm from o to p, and de from e to O. Then through the points E, I, h, O, and O, i, p, F draw the two curves E/I/O, and O/i/p/F, which will be the proper form that must be given to the arm of the lever. If the handle DE moves from E towards F, the curve EO must be used, but if in the contrary direction, we must employ the curve OF.\n\nIt is evident, that when the extremity E of the handle DE, has run through the arch Ek, or rather EI, the point l will be in k, and the point z in x, because xz is equal to kl, and the lever will have the position Ab. For the same reason, when the extremity E of the handle has arrived at i, the point h will be in i, and the point g in f, and the lever will be raised to the position Aa. Thus it appears, that the motion of the power and the weight are always proportional. When a roller is fixed at E, a curve parallel to EO, or OF, must be drawn as formerly. See Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures.\n\nCHAP. VI. On the First Movers of Machinery.\n\n418. The powers which are generally employed as the first movers of machines are water, wind, steam, and animal exertion. The mode of employing water as an impelling power has already been given at great length in the article HYDRODYNAMICS. The application of wind to turn machinery will be discussed in the chapter on Windmills; and what regards steam will be more properly introduced into the article STREAM-Engine. At present, therefore, we shall only make a few general remarks on the strength of men and horses; and conclude with a general view of the relative powers of the first movers of machinery. The following table contains the weight which a man is able to raise through a certain height in a certain time, according to different authors.\n\n| Number of pounds raised. | Height to which the weight is raised. | Time in which it is raised. | Duration of the Work. | Names of the authors. |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| 1000                     | 180                                 | 60 minutes                | 8 hours              | Euler                |\n| 60                       | 1                                   | 1 second                  |                      | Bernouilli           |\n| 25 French                | 220                                 | 145 seconds               | half an hour         | Amontons             |\n| 170                      | 1 French                             | 1 second                  |                      | Coulomb              |\n| 1000                     | 330                                 | 60 minutes                |                      | Defaguliers          |\n| 1000                     | 225                                 | 60 minutes                |                      | Smatton              |\n| 30                       | 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet               | 1 second                  | 10 hours             | Emerson              |\n| 29 or 30                 | 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet               | 1 second                  |                      | Schulze              |\n\n(g) In the figure we have taken the point B in a disadvantageous position, because the intersections are in this scale more distinct.\nAccording to Amontons, a man weighing 133 pounds French, ascended 62 feet French by steps in 34 seconds, but was completely exhausted. The same author informs us that a lawyer made 200 strokes of 18 inches French each, with a force of 25 pounds, in 145 seconds; but that he could not have continued the exertion above three minutes.\n\nIt appears from the observations of Defaguliers, that an ordinary man can, for the space of ten hours, turn a winch with a force of 30 pounds, and with a velocity of two feet and a half per second; and that two men working at a windlass with handles at right angles to each other can raise 70 pounds more easily than one man can raise 30. The reason of this is, that when there is only one man, he exerts variable efforts at different positions of the handle, and therefore the motion of the windlass is irregular; whereas in the case of two men, with handles at right angles, the effect of the one man is greatest when the effect of the other is least, and therefore the motion of the machine is more uniform, and will perform more work. Defaguliers also found, that a man may exert a force of 80 pounds with a fly when the motion is pretty quick, and that by means of a good common pump, he may raise a hogshead of water 10 feet high in a minute, and continue the exertion during a whole day.\n\nA variety of interesting experiments upon the force of men were made by the learned M. Coulomb. He found that the quantity of action of a man who ascended stairs with nothing but his own weight, was double that of a man loaded with 223 pounds avoirdupois, both of them continuing the exertion for a day. In this case the total or absolute effect of the unloaded man is the greatest possible; but the useful effect which he produces is nothing. In the same way, if we were loaded to such a degree that he was almost incapable of moving, the useful effect would be nothing. Hence there is a certain load with which the man will produce the greatest useful effect. This load M. Coulomb found to be 173.8 pounds avoirdupois, upon the supposition that the man is to ascend stairs, and continue the exertion during a whole day. When thus loaded, the quantity of action exerted by the labourer is equivalent to 183.66 pounds avoirdupois raised through 3282 feet. This method of working is however attended with a loss of three fourths of the total action of the workman.—It appears also from Coulomb's experiments, that a man going upstairs for a day raises 205 kilogrammes (a kilogramme is equal to three ounces five drams avoirdupois) to the height of a kilometre (a kilometre is equal to 3957 English inches);—that a man carrying wood up stairs raises, together with his own weight, 109 kilogrammes to one kilometre;—that a man weighing 150 pounds French, can ascend by stairs three feet French in a second, for the space of 15 or 20 seconds;—that a man cultivating the ground performs 1/2 as much labour as a man ascending stairs, and that his quantity of action is equal to 328 pounds avoirdupois raised through the space of 3282 feet;—that a man with a winch does 1/3 as much as by ascending stairs;—and that in a pile-engine, a man by means of a rope drawn horizontally, raised for the space of five hours 533 pounds French through one foot French in a second.—When men walk on a horizontal road, Cou-\n\nlomb found that the quantity of action was a maximum practical when they were loaded, and that this maximum quantity of action is to that which is exerted by a man loaded with 190.25 pounds avoirdupois as 7 to 4.—The weight which a man ought to carry in order that the useful effect may be a maximum, is 165.3 pounds avoirdupois. When the workman, however, returns unloaded for a new burden, he must carry 200.7 pounds avoirdupois.\n\nAccording to Dr Robison a feeble old man raised seven cubic feet of water = 437.5 pounds avoirdupois, 11 1/2 feet high, in one minute, for eight or ten hours a day, by walking backwards and forwards on a lever;—and a young man weighing 135 pounds, and carrying 30 pounds, raised 9 1/2 cubic feet of water = 578.1 pounds avoirdupois, 11 1/2 feet high, for 10 hours a day, without being fatigued.\n\nFrom the experiments of Mr Buchanan, it appears that the forces exerted by a man pumping, acting at a winch, ringing and rowing, are as the numbers 1742, 2856, 3883, 4095.\n\nAccording to Defaguliers and Smeaton, the power of one horse is equal to the power of five men, while M. Schulze considers one horse as equivalent to 14 men.—Two horses, according to the experiment of Amontons, exerted a force of 150 pounds French, when yoked in a plough. According to Defaguliers, a horse is capable of drawing, with a force of 200 pounds, two miles and a half an hour, and of continuing this action eight hours in the day. When the force is 240 pounds he can work only six hours. It appears from Smeaton's reports, that by means of pumps a horse can raise 250 hogsheads of water, 10 feet high, in an hour.—The most advantageous way of employing the power of a horse is to make him carry a load up an inclined plane, for it was observed by De la Hire, that three men, with 100 pounds each, will go faster up the inclined plane than a horse with 300 pounds. When the horse walks on a good road, and is loaded with about two hundred weight, he may easily travel 25 miles in the space of seven or eight hours.\n\nWhen a horse is employed in raising coals by means of a wheel and axle, and moves at the rate of about two miles an hour, Mr Fenwick found that he could continue at work 12 hours each day, two and a half of which were spent in short intervals of rest, when he raised a load of 1000 pounds avoirdupois, with a velocity of 13 feet per minute;—and that he will exert a force of 75 pounds for nine hours and a half, when moving with the same velocity. Mr Fenwick also found that 230 ale gallons of water delivered every minute on an overflot water wheel, 10 feet in diameter; that a common steam-engine, with a cylinder eight inches in diameter, and an improved engine with a cylinder 6.12 inches in diameter, will do the work of one horse, that is, will raise a weight of 1000 pounds avoirdupois, through the height of 13 feet in a minute. It appears from Mr Smeaton's experiments, that Dutch sails in their common position with a radius of nine feet and a half,—that Dutch sails in their best position with a radius of eight feet, and that his enlarged sails with a radius of seven feet, perform the same work as one man; or perform one-\n### Table showing the relative strength of Overflow Wheels, Steam Engines, Horses, Men, and Wind-mills of different kinds.\n\n| Number of ale gallons delivered on an overflow wheel, 10 feet in diameter, every minute. | Diameter of the cylinder in the common steam-engine, in inches. | Diameter of the cylinder of the improved steam-engine, in inches. | Number of horses working 12 hours per day, and moving at the rate of two miles per hour. | Number of men working 12 hours a-day. | Radius of Dutch falls in their common position, in feet. | Radius of Dutch falls in their best position, in feet. | Radius of Mr Smeaton's enlarged falls, in feet. | Height to which these different powers will raise 1000 pounds avoirdupois in a minute. |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 230 | 8 | 6.12 | 1 | 5 | 21.24 | 17.89 | 15.65 | 13 |\n| 390 | 9.5 | 7.8 | 2 | 10 | 30.04 | 25.30 | 22.13 | 26 |\n| 528 | 10.5 | 8.2 | 3 | 15 | 36.80 | 30.98 | 27.11 | 39 |\n| 660 | 11.5 | 8.8 | 4 | 20 | 42.48 | 35.78 | 31.30 | 52 |\n| 790 | 12.5 | 9.35 | 5 | 25 | 47.50 | 40.00 | 35.00 | 65 |\n| 970 | 14 | 10.55 | 6 | 30 | 52.03 | 43.82 | 38.34 | 78 |\n| 1170 | 15.4 | 11.75 | 7 | 35 | 56.90 | 47.33 | 41.41 | 90 |\n| 1350 | 16.8 | 12.8 | 8 | 40 | 60.09 | 50.60 | 44.27 | 104 |\n| 1445 | 17.3 | 13.6 | 9 | 45 | 63.73 | 53.66 | 46.96 | 117 |\n| 1584 | 18.5 | 14.2 | 10 | 50 | 67.17 | 56.57 | 49.50 | 130 |\n| 1740 | 19.4 | 14.8 | 11 | 55 | 70.46 | 59.33 | 51.91 | 143 |\n| 1900 | 20.2 | 15.2 | 12 | 60 | 73.59 | 61.97 | 54.22 | 156 |\n| 2100 | 21 | 16.2 | 13 | 65 | 76.59 | 64.5 | 56.43 | 169 |\n| 2300 | 22 | 17 | 14 | 70 | 79.49 | 66.94 | 58.57 | 182 |\n| 2500 | 23.1 | 17.8 | 15 | 75 | 82.27 | 69.28 | 60.62 | 195 |\n| 2686 | 23.9 | 18.3 | 16 | 80 | 84.97 | 71.55 | 62.61 | 208 |\n| 2870 | 24.7 | 19 | 17 | 85 | 87.07 | 73.32 | 64.16 | 221 |\n| 3055 | 25.5 | 19.6 | 18 | 90 | 90.13 | 75.90 | 67.41 | 234 |\n| 3240 | 26.25 | 20.1 | 19 | 95 | 92.60 | 77.98 | 68.23 | 247 |\n| 3420 | 27 | 20.7 | 20 | 100 | 95.00 | 80.00 | 70.00 | 260 |\n| 3750 | 28.5 | 22.2 | 22 | 110 | 99.64 | 83.90 | 73.42 | 286 |\n| 4000 | 29.8 | 23 | 24 | 120 | 104.06 | 87.63 | 76.68 | 312 |\n| 4460 | 31.1 | 23.9 | 26 | 130 | 108.32 | 91.22 | 79.81 | 338 |\n| 4850 | 32.4 | 24.7 | 28 | 140 | 112.20 | 94.66 | 82.82 | 364 |\n| 5250 | 33.6 | 25.5 | 30 | 150 | 116.35 | 97.98 | 85.73 | 390 |\n\n426. Dutch falls are always constructed so that the angle of weather may diminish from the centre to the extremity of the fall. They are concave to the wind, and are in their common position when their extremities are parallel to the plane in which they move, or perpendicular to the direction of the wind. Dutch falls are in their best position when their extremities make an angle of seven degrees with the plane of their motion. Mr Smeaton's enlarged falls are Dutch falls in their best position, but enlarged at their extremities.\n\n427. It appears from M. Coulomb's experiments on Dutch wind-mills, with rectangular falls, that when the distance between the extremities of two opposite falls is 66 feet French, and the breadth of each fall six feet, a wind moving at the rate of 20 feet per second will produce an effect equivalent to 1000 pounds raised through the space of 218 feet in a minute.\n\nAccording to Watt and Boulton, one of their steam-engines, with a cylinder 31 inches in diameter, and which makes 17 double strokes per minute, is equivalent to 40 horses working day and night; that is, to 101 horses working nine hours and a half, the time of constant exertion in the preceding table. When the cylinder is 19 inches in diameter, and the engine makes 25 strokes of four feet each per minute, its power is equivalent to twelve horses working constantly, or thirty horses working nine hours and a half; and when the cylinder is 24 inches in diameter, and the engine makes 22 strokes, of five feet each, in a minute, its power is equal to that of 20 horses working constantly, or 50 horses working nine hours and a half.\n\n### Chap. VII. On the Construction of Wind-mills.\n\n428. A wind-mill is represented in fig. 1, where MN is the circular building that contains the machinery, E the extremity of the windshaft, or principal axis, which is generally inclined from 8° to 15° degrees to the horizon; and FA, EB, EC, ED four rectangular frames upon which falls of cloth of the same form are stretched. At the lower extremity G of the falls their surface is inclined to the axis 72°; and at their farthest extremities A, D, &c., the inclination of the fall is about 83°. Now, when the falls are adjusted to the wind, which happens when the wind blows in the direction of the windshaft E, the impulse of the wind...\nMechanics.\n\nUpon the oblique sails may be resolved into two forces, one of which acts at right angles to the windshaft, and is therefore employed solely in giving a motion of rotation to the sails and the axis upon which they are fixed. When the mill is used for grinding corn, a crown wheel, fixed to the principal axis E, gives motion to a lantern or trundle, whose axis carries the moveable millstone.\n\n429. That the wind may act with the greatest efficacy upon the sails, the windshaft must have the same direction as the wind. But as this direction is perpetually changing, some apparatus is necessary for bringing the windshaft and sails into their proper position. This is sometimes effected by supporting the machinery on a strong vertical axis, whose pivot moves in a brass socket firmly fixed into the ground, so that the whole machine, by means of a lever, may be made to revolve upon this axis, and be properly adjusted to the direction of the wind. Most wind-mills, however, are furnished with a moveable roof which revolves upon friction rollers inserted in the fixed kerb of the mill; and the adjustment is effected by the assistance of a simple lever. As both these methods of adjustment require the assistance of men, it would be very desirable that the same effect should be produced solely by the action of the wind. This may be done by fixing a large wooden vane or weather-cock at the extremity of a long horizontal arm which lies in the same vertical plane with the windshaft. By this means, when the surface of the vane, and its distance from the centre of motion, are sufficiently great, a very gentle breeze will exert a sufficient force upon the vane to turn the machinery, and will always bring the sails and windshaft to their proper position. This weather-cock, it is evident, may be applied either to machines which have a moveable roof, or which revolve upon a vertical arbor.\n\nOn the Form and Position of Wind-mill Sails.\n\n430. It appears from the investigations of Parent, that a maximum effect will be produced when the sails are inclined 54° degrees to the axis of rotation, or when the angle of weather is 35° (c) degrees. In obtaining this conclusion, however, M. Parent has assumed data which are inadmissible, and has neglected several circumstances which must materially affect the result of his investigations. The angle of inclination assigned by Parent is certainly the most efficacious for giving motion to the sails from a state of rest, and for preventing them from stopping when in motion; but he has not considered that the action of the wind upon a sail at rest is different from its action upon a sail in motion: for since the extremities of the sails move with greater rapidity than the parts nearer the centre, the angle of weather should be greater towards the centre than at the extremity, and should vary with the velocity of each part of the sail. The reason of this is very obvious. It has been demonstrated by Bézout, and confirmed by experience, that when any fluid acts upon a plain surface, the force of impulsion is always exerted most advantageously when the impelled surface is in a state of rest, and that this force diminishes as the velocity of the surface increases. Now, let us suppose with Parent that the most advantageous angle of weather for the sails of wind-mills is 35° degrees for that part of the sail which is nearest the centre of rotation, and that the sail has everywhere this angle of weather; then, since the extremity of the sail moves with the greatest velocity, it will, in a manner, withdraw itself from the action of the wind, or, to speak more properly, it will not receive the impulse of the wind so advantageously as those parts of the sail which have a less degree of velocity. In order therefore to counteract this diminution of force, we must make the wind act more perpendicularly upon the sail, by diminishing its obliquity or its angle of weather. But since the velocity of every part of the sail is proportional to its distance from the centre of motion, every elementary portion of it must have a different angle of weather diminishing from the centre to the extremity of the sail. The law or rate of diminution, however, is still to be discovered, and we are fortunately in possession of a theorem of Euler's, afterwards given by Maclaurin, which determines this law of variation. Let \\(a\\) represent the velocity of the wind, and \\(c\\) the velocity of any given part of the sail; then the effort of the wind upon that part of the sail will be greatest when the tangent of the angle of the wind's incidence, or of the sail's inclination to the axis, is to radius, as \\(\\sqrt{2 + \\frac{9c}{4aa} + \\frac{3c}{2a}}\\) to 1.\n\n431. In order to apply this theorem, let us suppose that the radius or whip ED of the sail \\(a\\) & \\(b\\), is divided into equal parts; that the point \\(n\\) is equidistant from E and D, and is the point of the sail which has the same velocity as the wind; then, in the preceding theorem, we shall have \\(c = a\\), when the sail is loaded to a maximum; and therefore the tangent of the angle, which the surface of the sail at \\(n\\) makes with the axis, when \\(a = 1\\), will be \\(\\sqrt{2 + \\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{3}{2}} = 3.561 = \\tan(74° 10')\\), which gives \\(15° 41'\\) for the angle of weather at the point \\(n\\). Since, at \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the radius \\(c = a\\), and since \\(c\\) is proportional to the distance of the corresponding part of the sail from the centre, we will have, at \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the radius \\(sm\\), \\(c = \\frac{a}{3}\\); at \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of the radius, \\(c = \\frac{2a}{3}\\); at \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\), \\(c = \\frac{4a}{3}\\); at \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\), \\(c = \\frac{5a}{3}\\); and at the extremity of the radius, \\(c = 2a\\). By substituting these different values of \\(c\\), instead of \\(c\\) in the theorem, and by making \\(a = 1\\), the following table will be obtained, which exhibits the angles of inclination and weather which must be given to different parts of the sails.\n\nParts\n\n(c) The weather of the sails is the angle which the surface forms with the plane in which they move, and is equal to the complement of the angle which that surface forms with the axis.\nMr Smeaton found, from a variety of experiments, that the common practice of inclining plane sails from 72° to 75° to the axis, was much more efficacious than the angle assigned by Parent, the effect being as 4.5 to 31. When the sails were weathered in the Dutch manner, that is, when their surfaces were concave to the wind, and when the angle of inclination increased towards their extremities, they produced a greater effect than when they were weathered either in the common way, or according to Euler's theorem. But when the sails were enlarged at their extremities, as represented at αβ in fig. 2, so that αβ was one-third of the radius ED, and αD to Dβ as 5 to 3, their power was greatest of all, though the surface acted upon by the wind remained the same. If the sails be farther enlarged, the effect is not increased in proportion to the surface; and besides, when the quantity of cloth is great, the machine is much exposed to injury by sudden squalls of wind. In Mr Smeaton's experiments, the angle of weather varied with the distance from the axis; and it appeared from several trials, that the most efficacious angles were those in the following table.\n\n| Parts of the radius EA, which is divided into 6 parts | Angle with the axis | Angle of weather |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| 1                                                    | 72                | 18              |\n| 2                                                    | 71                | 19              |\n| 3                                                    | 72                | middle          |\n| 4                                                    | 74                | 16              |\n| 5                                                    | 77½               | 12½             |\n| 6                                                    | 83                | 7               |\n\nIf the radius ED of the sail be 30 feet, then the sail will commence at \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) ED, or 5 feet from the axis, where the angle of inclination will be 72°. At \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) ED, or 10 feet from the axis, the angle will be 71°, and so on.\n\nOn the Effect of Wind-mill Sails.\n\nThe following maxims deduced by Mr Smeaton from his experiments, contain the most accurate information upon this subject.\n\nMaxim 1. The velocity of wind-mill sails, whether unloaded or loaded, so as to produce a maximum effect, is nearly as the velocity of the wind, their shape and position being the same.\n\nMaxim 2. The load at the maximum is nearly, but somewhat less than, as the square of the velocity according to the wind, the shape and position of the sails being the same.\n\nMaxim 3. The effects of the same sails at a maximum, are nearly, but somewhat less than, as the cubes of the velocity of the wind.\n\nMaxim 4. The load of the same sails at the maximum is nearly as the squares, and their effects as the cubes of their number of turns in a given time.\n\nMaxim 5. When sails are loaded, so as to produce a maximum at a given velocity, and the velocity of the wind increases, the load continuing the same: 1st, The increase of effect, when the increase of the velocity of the wind is small, will be nearly as the squares of those velocities; 2dly, When the velocity of the wind is double, the effects will be nearly as 10 : 27½: But, 3dly, When the velocities compared are more than double of that where the given load produces a maximum, the effects increase nearly in the simple ratio of the velocity of the wind.\n\nMaxim 6. In sails where the figure and positions are similar, and the velocity of the wind the same, the number of turns in a given time will be reciprocally as the radius or length of the sail.\n\nMaxim 7. The load at a maximum that sails of a similar figure and position will overcome at a given distance from the centre of motion, will be as the cube of the radius.\n\nMaxim 8. The effects of sails of similar figure and position are as the square of the radius.\n\nMaxim 9. The velocity of the extremities of Dutch sails, as well as of the enlarged sails, in all their usual positions when unloaded, or even loaded to a maximum, are considerably quicker than the velocity of the wind.\n\nA new mode of constructing the sails of wind-mills has been recently given by Mr Sutton, and fully described by Mr Helleden of Barton, in a work exclusively devoted to the subject.\n\nThe limits of this article will not permit us to enter into any discussion respecting the principles upon which Mr Sutton's gravitated sails are constructed; but the subject shall be resumed under the article Windmill. It may be proper however to remark that Mr Sutton gives his sails the form represented in fig. 4, and makes fig. 3, the angle of weather at the point M, equidistant from A and B, equal to 25° 30'. The inclination of the sail at any other point N of the sail, is an angle whose sine is the distance of that point from the centre of motion A, the radius being the breadth of the sail at that point. Fig. 3 shows the angles at the different points of the sail; and the apparent and absolute breadths of the sail at these points. Mr Sutton's mode of regulating the velocity of the sails, and of bringing them to a state of rest is particularly ingenious.\n435. Various opinions have been entertained respecting the relative advantages of horizontal and vertical wind mills. Mr Smeaton, with great justice, gives a decided preference to the latter; but when he affirms that horizontal wind-mills have only $\\frac{1}{4}$ or $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the power of vertical ones, he certainly forms too low an estimate of their power. Mr Beaton, on the contrary, who has received a patent for the construction of a new horizontal wind mill, seems to be prejudiced in their favour, and greatly exaggerates their comparative value. From an impartial investigation, it will probably appear, that the truth lies between these two opposite opinions; but before entering on this discussion, we must first consider the nature and form of horizontal wind-mills.\n\n436. In fig. 4, CK is the windshaft, which moves upon pivots. Four cross bars, CA, CD, IB, FG, are fixed to this arbor, which carry the frames APIB, DEFG. The sails AI, EG, are stretched upon these frames, and are carried round the axis CK, by the perpendicular impulse of the wind. Upon the axis CK, a toothed wheel is fixed, which gives motion to the particular machinery that is employed. In the figure, only two sails are represented; but there are always other two placed at right angles to these. Now, let the sails be exposed to the wind, and it will be evident that no motion will ensue; for the force of the wind upon the sail AI, is counteracted by an equal and opposite force upon the sail EG. In order then, that the wind may communicate motion to the machine, the force upon the returning sail EG must either be removed by screening it from the wind, or diminished by making it present a less surface when returning against the wind. The first of these methods is adopted in Tartary, and in some provinces of Spain; but is objected to by Mr Beaton, from the inconvenience and expense of the machinery and attendance requisite for turning the screens into their proper positions. Notwithstanding this objection, however, I am disposed to think that this is the best method of diminishing the action of the wind upon the returning sails, for the moveable screen may easily be made to follow the direction of the wind, and assume its proper position, by means of a large wooden weathercock, without the aid either of men or machinery. It is true, indeed, that the resistance of the air in the returning sails is not completely removed; but it is at least as much diminished as it can be by any method hitherto proposed. Besides, when this plan is resorted to, there is no occasion for any moveable flaps and hinges, which must add greatly to the expense of every other method.\n\nBeaton's method.\n\n437. The mode of bringing the sails back against the wind, which Mr Beaton invented, is, perhaps, the simplest and best of the kind. He makes each sail AI to consist of six or eight flaps or vanes, AP, b1, b2, c1, c2, &c., moving upon hinges represented by the dark lines, AP, b1, c2, &c., so that the lower side b1, of the first flap overlaps the hinge or higher side of the second flap, and so on. When the wind, therefore, acts upon the sail AI, each flap will press upon the hinge of the one immediately below it, and the whole surface of the sail will be exposed to its action. But when the sail AI returns against the wind, the flaps will revolve round upon their hinges, and present only their edges to the wind, as is represented at EG, so that the resistance occasioned by the return of the sail must be greatly diminished, and the motion will be continued by the great superiority of force exerted upon the sails in the position AI. In computing the force of the wind upon the sail AI, and the resistance opposed to it by the edges of the flaps in EG, Mr Beaton finds, that when the pressure upon the former is 18½ pounds, the resistance opposed by the latter is only about 36 pounds, or $\\frac{1}{3}$ part of the whole force; but he neglects the action of the wind upon the arms CA, &c., and the frames which carry the sails, because they expose the same surface in the position AI, as in the position EG. This omission, however, has a tendency to mislead us in the present case, as we shall now see, for we ought to compare the whole force exerted upon the arms, as well as the sail, with the whole resistance which these arms and the edges of the flaps oppose to the motion of the windmill. By inspecting fig. 4, it will appear, that if the force upon the edges of the flaps, which Mr Beaton supposed to be 12 in number, amounts to 36 pounds, the force spent upon the bars CD, DG, GF, FE, &c., cannot be less than 60 pounds. Now, since these bars are acted upon with an equal force, when the sails have the position AI, $18\\frac{1}{2} + 60 = 93\\frac{1}{2}$ will be the force exerted upon the sail AI, and its appendages, while the opposite force upon the bars and edges of the flaps when returning against the wind will be $36 + 60 = 96$ pounds, which is nearly $\\frac{1}{3}$ of 93$\\frac{1}{2}$, instead of $\\frac{1}{3}$ as computed by Mr Beaton. Hence we may see the probable advantages of a screen over moveable flaps, as it will preserve not only the sails, but the arms and the frame which support it, from the action of the wind.\n\n438. We shall now conclude this chapter with a comparison of the power of horizontal and vertical wind-mills. It was already stated, that Mr Smeaton rather underrated the former, while he maintained that horizontal wind-mills have only $\\frac{1}{4}$ or $\\frac{1}{5}$ the power of the latter. Mr Beaton observes, that when the vanes of a horizontal and a vertical mill are of the same dimensions, the power of the latter is four times that of the former, because, in the first case, only one sail is acted upon at once, while, in the second case, all the four receive the impulse of the wind. This, however, is not strictly true, since the vertical sails are all oblique to the direction of the wind. Let us suppose that the area of each sail is 100 square feet; then the power of the horizontal sail will be 100, and the power of a vertical sail may be called $100 \\times \\tan 75^\\circ$ ($75^\\circ$ being the common angle of inclination) = 88 nearly; but since there are four vertical sails, the power of them all will be $4 \\times 88 = 352$; so that the power of the horizontal sail is to that of the four vertical ones as 1 to 3.52, and not as 1 to 4, according to Mr Smeaton. But Mr Smeaton also observes, that if we consider the farther disadvantage which arises from the difficulty of getting the sails back against the wind, we need not wonder if horizontal wind-mills have only about $\\frac{1}{4}$ or $\\frac{1}{5}$ the power of the common sort. We have already seen, that the resistance occasioned by the return of the sails, amounts to $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the whole force which they receive; by subtracting $\\frac{1}{25}$, therefore, from $\\frac{1}{3.52}$, we shall find that\nthe power of horizontal wind-mills is only $\\frac{1}{4}$ that of vertical ones. This calculation proceeds upon a supposition, that the whole force exerted upon vertical sails is employed in turning them round the axis of motion; whereas a considerable part of this force is lost in pressing the pivot of the axis or windshaft against its gudgeon. Mr Smeaton has overlooked this circumstance, otherwise he could never have maintained that the power of four vertical sails was quadruple the power of one horizontal sail, the dimensions of each being the same. Taking this circumstance into account, we cannot be far wrong in saying, that in theory at least, if not in practice, the power of a horizontal windmill is about $\\frac{1}{4}$ or $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the power of a vertical one, when the quantity of surface and the form of the sails is the same, and when every part of the horizontal sails has the same distance from the axis of motion as the corresponding parts of the vertical sails. But if the horizontal sails have the position $AI$, $EG$, in fig. 4, instead of the position $CA$, $dm$, $CD$, $n$, their power will be greatly increased, though the quantity of surface is the same, because the part $CP$, $3m$ being transferred to $BI$, $3d$, has much more power to turn the sails.\n\n**Chap. VIII. On the Construction of Wheel Carriages.**\n\nIt is evident from Art. 60, that when a wheel furnishes an obstacle, it acts as a lever of the first kind, and that its power to overcome such resistances increases with its diameter. The power of the force $P$, for example, to raise the wheel $NB$ over the eminence $C$, is proportional to the vertical lever $FC$, which increases with the diameter of the wheel, while the lever of resistance $FA$, by which the weight of the wheel acts, remains unchanged; hence we see the advantages of large wheels for overcoming such obstacles as generally resist the motion of wheel-carriages. There are some circumstances, however, which, independent of the additional weight and expense of large wheels, prescribe limits to their size. If the radius $AC$ of the wheel exceeds the height of that part of the horse to which the traces are attached, the line of traction $DA$ will be oblique to the horizon, and part of the power $P$ will be employed in pressing the wheel upon the ground. A wheel exceeding four and a half feet radius, which is the general distance from the ground of that part of the horse to which the traces are attached, has still the advantage of a smaller wheel; but when we consider that the traces or poles of the cart will, in this case, rub against the flanks of the horses, so that the power of the wheel is diminished by the increase of its weight, we shall be convinced that no power is gained by making the radius of the wheels greater than four and a half feet. Even this size is too great, as shall be afterwards shown, when we treat of the line of traction, so that we may safely affirm, that the diameter of wheels should never be greater than six feet. The fore wheels of our carriages are still unaccountably small, and it is not uncommon to see carts moving upon wheels scarcely 14 inches in diameter. The convenience of turning is urged as the reason for diminishing the fore wheels of carriages, and the facility of loading the cart is considered as a sufficient reason for using wheels so small as 14 inches.\n\nThe first of these advantages, however, may be obtained by going to the end of a street, or to a proper place for turning the carriage; and a few additional turns of the windlass will be sufficient to convey the heaviest loads into carts mounted on high wheels.\n\nThe next thing to be determined is the shape of the wheels. Now it is certainly a matter of surprise how the unnatural shape which is at present given to them could ever have been brought into use. A cylindrical wheel, with the spokes perpendicular to the naves, is undoubtedly the form which every mechanic would give to his wheels, before he had heard of the pretended advantages of concave or dishing wheels, or those which have inclined spokes and conical rims. It has been alleged, indeed, that the form represented in fig. 5, when $A$, $r$, $B$, $s$ is the conical rim, and $o$, $A$, $p$, $B$ the inclined spokes, renders the wheel stronger than it would otherwise be; that by extending the base of the carriage it prevents it from being overturned; that it hinders the felloes from rubbing against the load or the sides of the cart; and that when one wheel falls into a rut, and therefore supports more than one half of the load, the spokes are brought into a vertical position, which renders them more capable of sustaining the additional weight. Now it is evident that the second of these advantages is very trifling, and may be obtained, when required, by interposing a piece of board between the wheel and the load.\n\nThe other two advantages exist only in very bad roads; and if they are necessary, which we much question, in a country like this, where the roads are so excellently made and so regularly repaired, they can easily be procured, by making the axle-tree a few inches longer, and increasing the strength of the spokes. But it is allowed on all hands that perpendicular spokes are preferable on level ground. The inclination of the spokes therefore, which renders concave wheels advantageous in rugged and unequal roads, renders them disadvantageous when the roads are in good order; and where the good roads are more numerous than the bad ones, as they certainly are in this country, the disadvantages of concave wheels must overbalance their advantages. It is true indeed that in concave wheels, the spokes are in their strongest position, when they are exposed to the severest strains, that is, when one wheel is in a deep rut, and sustains more than one half of the load; but it is equally true that on level ground, where the spokes are in their weakest position, a less severe strain, by continuing for a much longer time, may be equally if not more detrimental to the wheel.\n\nUpon these observations, we might rest the opinion which we have been maintaining, and appeal for its truth to the judgement of every intelligent and unbiased mind; but we shall go a step farther, and endeavour to show that concave dishing wheels are more expensive, more injurious to the roads, more liable to be broken by accidents, and less durable in general, than those wheels in which the spokes are perpendicular to the naves. By inspecting fig. 5, it will appear that the whole of the pressure which the wheel $AB$ sustains is exerted along the inclined spoke $pr$, and therefore acts obliquely upon the level ground $nD$, whether the rims are conical or cylindrical. This oblique action must necessarily...\nMechanics.\n\nPractical necessity injure the roads, by loosening the stones more between B and D than between B and n, and if the load were sufficiently great, the stones would start up between s and D. The texture of the roads, indeed, is sufficiently firm to prevent this from taking place; but in consequence of the oblique pressure, the stones between s and D will at least be loosened, and by admitting the rain the whole of the road will be materially damaged. But when the spokes are perpendicular to the nave as \\( \\theta \\), and when the rims mA, mB are cylindrical, or parallel to the ground, the weight sustained by the wheel will act perpendicularly upon the road; and however much that weight is increased, its action can have no tendency to derange the materials of which it is composed, but is rather calculated to consolidate them, and render the road more firm and durable.\n\n442. It was observed that concave wheels are more expensive than plane ones. This additional expense arises from the greater quantity of wood and workmanship which the former require; for in order that dishing wheels may be of the same perpendicular height as plane ones, the spokes of the former must exceed in length those of the latter; as much as the hypothenuse oA of the triangle oAn exceeds the side om; and therefore the weight and the resistance of such wheels must be proportionably great. The inclined spokes, too, cannot be formed nor inserted with such facility as perpendicular ones. The extremity of the spoke which is fixed into the nave is inserted at right angles to it, in the direction oA, and if the rims are cylindrical, the other spoke should be inserted in a similar manner; while the intermediate portion has an inclined position. There are therefore two flexures or bendings in the spokes of concave wheels, which requires them to be formed out of a larger piece of wood, than if they had no such flexures, and render them liable to be broken by any sudden strain at the points of flexure.\n\n443. We shall now dismiss the subject of concave wheels with one observation more, and we beg the reader's attention to it, because it appears to be decisive of the question. The obstacles which carriages have to encounter, are almost never spherical protuberances that permit the elevated wheel to resume by degrees its horizontal position. They are generally of such a nature, that the wheel is instantaneously precipitated from their top to the level ground. Now the momentum with which the wheel strikes the ground is very great, arising from a successive accumulation of force. The velocity of the elevated wheel is considerable when it reaches the top of the eminence, and while it is tumbling into the level ground, it is receiving gradually that proportion of the load which was transferred to the other wheel, till having recovered the whole, it impinges against the ground with great velocity and force. But in concave wheels the spoke which then strikes the ground is in its weakest position, and therefore much more liable to be broken by the impetus of the fall, than the spokes of the lowest wheel by the mere transference of additional weight. Whereas, if the spokes be perpendicular to the nave, they receive this sudden shock in their strongest position, and are in no danger of giving way to the strain.\n\n444. In the preceding observations we have supposed the rims of the wheels to be cylindrical. In concave wheels, however, the rims are uniformly made of practical conical form, as \\( \\Delta r, B r \\), fig. 5, which not only increases the disadvantages which we have ascribed to them, but adds many more to the number. Mr. Cumming, in a late Treatise on Wheel Carriages, solely devoted to the consideration of this single point, has thrown with great ability the disadvantages of conical rims, and the propriety of making them cylindrical; but we are of opinion that he has ascribed to conical rims several disadvantages which arise chiefly from an inclination of the spokes. He infers much upon the injury done to the roads by the use of conical rims; yet though we are convinced that they are more injurious to pavements and highways than cylindrical rims, we are equally convinced, that this injury is occasioned chiefly by the oblique pressure of the inclined spokes. The defects of conical rims are so numerous and palpable, that it is wonderful how they should have been so long overlooked. Every cone that is put in motion upon a plane surface will revolve round its vertex, and if force is employed to confine it to a straight line, the smaller parts of the cone will be dragged along the ground and the friction greatly increased. Now when a carriage moves upon conical wheels, one part of the cone rolls while the other is dragged along, and though confined to a rectilineal direction by external force, their natural tendency to revolve round their vertex occasions a great and continued friction upon the linch pin, the shoulder of the axle-tree, and the sides of deep ruts.\n\n445. The shape of the wheels being thus determined, we must now attend to some particular parts of their construction. The iron plates of which the rims are composed should never be less than three inches in breadth, as narrow rims sink deep into the ground, and therefore injure the roads and fatigue the horses. Mr. Walker, indeed, attempts to throw ridicule upon the act of parliament which enjoined the use of broad wheels; but he does not assign any sufficient reason for his opinion, and ought to have known that several excellent and well devised experiments were lately instituted by Boulard and Margueron, which evince in the most satisfactory manner the great utility of broad wheels. Upon this subject an observation occurs to us, which has not been generally attended to, and which appears to remove all the objections which can be urged against broad rims. When any load is supported upon two points, each point supports one half of the weight; if the points are increased to four, each will sustain one fourth of the load, and so on; the pressure upon each point of support diminishing as the number of points increases. If a weight therefore is supported by a broad surface, the points of support are infinite in number, and each of them will bear an infinitely small portion of the load; and, in the same way, every finite portion of this surface will sustain a part of the weight inversely proportional to the number of similar portions which the surface contains. Let us now suppose that a cart carrying a load of fifteen hundred weight is supported upon wheels whose rims are four inches in breadth, and that one of the wheels passes over four stones, each of them an inch broad and equally high, and capable of being pulverized only by a pressure of four hundred pounds weight. Then as each wheel sustains one half of the load, and as the wheel which passes over\nover the stones has four points of support, each stone will bear a weight of two hundred weight, and therefore will not be broken. But if the same cart, with rims only two inches in breadth, should pass the same way, it will cover only two of the stones; and the wheel having now only two points of support, each stone will be pressed with a weight of four hundred weight, and will therefore be reduced to powder. Hence we may infer that narrow wheels are in another point of view injurious to the roads, by pulverizing the materials of which they are composed.\n\n446. As the rims of wheels wear soonest at their edges, they should be made thinner in the middle, and ought to be fastened to the felloes with nails of such a kind that their heads may not rise above the surface of the rims. In some military wagons we have seen the heads of these nails rising an inch above the rims, which not only destroys the pavements of streets, but opposes a continual resistance to the motion of the wheel. If these nails were eight in number, the wheel would experience the same resistance, as if it had to surmount eight obstacles, one inch high, during every revolution. The felloes on which the rims are fixed should in carriages be three inches and a fourth deep, and in wagons four inches. The naves should be thicker at the place where the spokes are inserted; and the holes in which the spokes are placed should not be bored quite through, as the grease upon the axle-tree would infuse itself between the spoke and the nave, and prevent that close adhesion which is necessary to the strength of the wheel.\n\nOn the Position of the Wheels.\n\n447. It must naturally occur to every person reflecting upon this subject, that the axle-trees should be straight and the wheels perfectly parallel, so that they may not be wider at their highest than at their lowest point, whether they are of a conical or a cylindrical form. In this country, however, the wheels are always made concave, and the ends of the axle-trees are universally bent downwards, in order to make them spread at the top and approach nearer below. In some carriages which we have examined, where the wheels were only four feet six inches in diameter, the distance of the wheels at top was fully five feet, and their distance below only four feet eight inches. By this foolish practice the very advantages which may be derived from the concavity of the wheels are completely taken away, while many of the disadvantages remain; more room is taken up in the coach-house, and the carriage is more liable to be overturned by the contraction of its bale.\n\n448. With some mechanics it is a practice to bend the ends of the axle-trees forwards, and thus make the wheels wider behind than before. This blunder has been strenuously defended by Mr Henry Beighton, who maintains that wheels in this position are more favourable for turning; since, when the wheels are parallel, the outermost when turning would press against the lynch pin, and the innermost would rest against the shoulder of the axle-tree. In rectilinear motions, however, these converging wheels engender a great deal of friction both on the axle and the ground, and must therefore be more disadvantageous than parallel ones.\n\nOn the Line of Traction, and the Method by which Horses exert their strength.\n\n449. M. Camus attempted to shew that the line of traction should always be parallel to the ground on which the carriage is moving, both because the horse can exert his greatest strength in this direction, and because the line of draught being perpendicular to the vertical spoke of the wheel, acts with the largest possible lever. M. Couplet, however, considering that the roads are never perfectly level, and that the wheels are constantly surmounting small eminences even in the best of roads, recommends the line of traction to be oblique to the horizon. By this means the line of draught HA, (which is by far too much inclined in the figure) Fig. 6, will in general be perpendicular to the lever AC which mounts the eminence, and will therefore act with the longest lever when there is the greatest necessity for it. We ought to consider also, that when a horse pulls hard against any load, he always brings his breast nearer the ground, and therefore it follows, that if a horizontal line of traction is preferable to all others, the direction of the traces should be inclined to the horizon when the horse is at rest, in order that it may be horizontal when he lowers his breast and exerts his utmost force. The particular manner, however, in which living agents exert their strength against great loads, seems to have been unknown both to Camus and Couplet, and to many succeeding writers upon this subject. It is to M. Deparcieux, an excellent philosopher and ingenious mechanic, that we are indebted for the only accurate information with which we are furnished; and we are sorry to see that philosophers who flourished after him have overlooked his important instructions. In his memoir on the draught of horses he has shewn in the most satisfactory manner, that animals draw by their weight, and not by the force of their muscles. In four-footed animals, the hinder feet is the fulcrum of the lever by which their weight acts against the load, and when the animal pulls hard, it depresses its chest and thus increases the lever of its weight, and diminishes the lever by which the load resists its efforts. Thus, in fig. 6, let P be the load, AD the line of traction, and let us suppose FC to be the hinder leg of the horse, and AE part of its body, A its chest or centre of gravity, and CE the level road. Then AFC will represent the crooked lever by which the horse acts, which is equivalent to the straight one AC. But when the horse's weight acts downwards at A, so as to drag forward the rope AD and raise the load P, CE will represent the power of the lever in this position, or the lever of the horse's weight, and CF the lever by which it is resisted by the load, or the lever of resistance. Now if the horse lowers its centre of gravity A, which it always does when it pulls hard, it is evident that CE, the lever of its weight, will be increased, while CF the lever of its resistance will be diminished, for the line of traction AD will approach nearer to CE. Hence we see the great benefit which may be derived from large horses; for the lever AC necessarily increases with their size, and their power is always proportioned to the length of this lever, their weight remaining the same. Large horses, therefore, and other animals, will draw more than small ones, even though they have less muscular force.\nMechanics.\n\nPractical force, and are unable to carry such a heavy burden. The force of the muscles tends only to make the horse carry continually forward his centre of gravity, or, in other words, the weight of the animal produces the draught, and the play and force of its muscles serve to continue it.\n\n450. From these remarks, then, we may deduce the proper position of the line of traction. When the line of traction is horizontal, as AD, the lever of resistance is CF; but if this line is oblique to the horizon, as AD', the lever of resistance is diminished to CF', while the lever of the horse's weight always remains the same. Hence it appears, that inclined traces are much more advantageous than horizontal ones, as they uniformly diminish the resistance to be overcome. Deparcieux, however, has investigated experimentally the most favourable angle of inclination, and found, that when the angle DAF made by the trace AD and a horizontal line is fourteen or fifteen degrees, the horses pulled with the greatest facility and force. This value of the angle of draught will require the weight of the spring-tree bar, to which the traces are attached in four-wheeled carriages, to be one-half of the height of that part of the horse's breast to which the fore end of the traces is connected.\n\n451. When several horses are yoked in the same carriage as represented in fig. 7, and when the declivity changes, the length of the traces has a considerable influence upon the draught. From the point E where the traces are fastened to the horse next the load, draw ER to the same point in the second horse R, and let R' be another position of the second horse; it is required to find the difference of effect that will be produced by placing the second horse at R or at R', or the comparative advantages of short and long traces. From R', the point where the traces are fixed, draw R'FE'; and from E draw Emn parallel to the declivity DA. Take EF = EF' to represent the power of the horse in the direction of the traces, which will be the same whether he is yoked at R or at R'; draw EA perpendicular to DA, Fn, F'm parallel to EA, and Fφ, F'f parallel to En. Then since the second horse when at R pulls with a force represented by FE, in the direction FE, we may resolve this force into two forces En, Eφ, one of which En is solely employed in dragging the cart up the inclined plane DA, while the other Eφ is solely employed in pressing the first horse E to the ground. Let the horse be now removed from R to R', the direction of the traces becomes RFE, and F'FE = FE is the power exerted by the horse at R' and the direction in which it is exerted. But this force is equivalent to the forces Em, Ef, the first of which acts directly against the load, while the other presses the horse against the ground. Hence we see the disadvantages of long traces, for the force which draws the load when the horse is at R' is to the force when the horse is at R, as Em to En, and the forces which press the horse upon the ground as Ef to Eφ, or as F'm to Fn. Now Eφ = FE × fin. n EF; hence Eφ = FE × fin. (n F'g - F'g'), (g' being parallel to AB'), and En = EF × cof. (n Eg - F'g'). In like manner we have Ef = FE × fin. (n Eg - F'g'), and Em = EF × cof. (n Eg - F'g'). Now fin. FEg = fin. FEg = Rg/ER, and fin. FEg' = Rg'/ER'/ER'; but Rg\n\n\\[= Rg' = BR - EQ = BR - BR \\times \\text{cof.} n \\quad \\text{Eg} = BR \\times \\text{cof.} (1 - \\text{cof.} n \\quad \\text{Eg}).\\]\n\nBy substituting this value in the equations which contain the values of Eφ, En, Ef, Em, and considering that the angles F'g', F'g' are always so small that their arcs differ very little from their fines, we have\n\n\\[FEg = \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\text{cof.} n \\quad \\text{Eg}}{\\text{ER}},\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[F'g' = \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\text{cof.} n \\quad \\text{Eg}}{\\text{ER'}}.\\]\n\nBy substituting these values in the preceding equations, we have\n\n\\[Eφ = EF \\times \\text{fin.} (n \\quad \\text{Eg} = \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\text{cof.} n \\quad \\text{Eg}}{\\text{ER}},\\]\n\n\\[Ef = EF \\times \\text{fin.} (n \\quad \\text{Eg} = \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\text{cof.} n \\quad \\text{Eg}}{\\text{ER'}},\\]\n\n\\[En = EF \\times \\text{cof.} (n \\quad \\text{Eg} = \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\text{cof.} n \\quad \\text{Eg}}{\\text{ER}},\\]\n\n\\[Em = EF \\times \\text{cof.} (n \\quad \\text{Eg} = \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\text{cof.} n \\quad \\text{Eg}}{\\text{ER'}}).\\]\n\nIf AB is horizontal, and the declivity AD = 28°, we shall have n Eg = 9° 28', or in parts of the radius = 0.16522, and cof. n Eg = 0.98638. Then, if ER = 200 pounds, BR = 3 feet, ER = 8 feet, ER' = 12 feet, then we shall have from the preceding formulae, Eφ = 31.716 pounds, Ef = 32.350 pounds, En = 197.470 pounds, and Em = 197.404. Hence an additional length of four feet to traces eight feet long, presses the horse E to the ground with an additional force of 32.350 - 31.716 = 0.534 pounds, and diminishes the effect of the other horse by 0.066 pounds.\n\nOn the Position of the Centre of Gravity, and the manner of distributing the load.\n\n452. If the axle tree of a two-wheeled carriage passes through the centre of gravity of the load, the carriage will be in equilibrium in every position in which it can be placed with respect to the axle-tree; and in going up and down hill the whole load will be sustained by the wheels, and will have no tendency either to press the horse to the ground or to raise him from it. But if the centre of gravity is above the axle-tree, as it must necessarily be, according to the present construction of wheel-carriages, a great part of the load will be thrown on the back of the horses from the wheels when going down a steep road, and thus tend to accelerate the motion of the carriage which the animal is striving to prevent; while, in ascending steep roads, a part of the load will be thrown behind the wheels, and tend to raise the horse from the ground, when there is the greatest necessity for some weight on his back to enable him to fix his feet in the earth, and overcome the great resistance which is occasioned by the steepness of the road. On the contrary, if the centre of gravity is below the axle, the horse will be pressed to the ground in going up hill, and lifted from it when going down. In all these cases, therefore, where the centre of gravity is either on the axle-tree or directly above it or below, the\nMechanics.\n\n453. The only way of remedying these evils, is to assign such a position to the centre of gravity, that the horse may bear some portion of the weight when he must exert great force against the load, that is, in level ground, and when he is ascending steep roads; for no animal can pull with its greatest effort unless it is prelled to the ground.—Now this may be in some measure effected in the following manner. Let BCN be the wheel of a cart, AD one of the shafts, D that part of it where the cart is suspended on the back of the horse, and A the axle-tree; then, if the centre of gravity of the load is placed at m, a point equidistant from the two wheels, but below the line DA, and before the axle-tree,—the horse will bear a certain weight on level ground,—a greater weight when he is going up hill and has more occasion for it, and less weight when he is going down hill, and does not require to be prelled to the ground: All this will be evident from the figure.—When we recollect that the shaft DA is horizontal, the centre of gravity will press more upon the point of suspension D the nearer it comes to it, or the pressure upon D, or the horse's back, will be proportional to the distance of the centre of gravity from A. If m, therefore, be the centre of gravity, bA will represent its pressure upon D, when the shaft DA is horizontal. When the cart is ascending a steep road, AH will be the position of the shaft, the centre of gravity will be raised to a, and aA will be the pressure upon D. But if the cart is going down hill, AC will be the position of the shaft, the centre of gravity will be depressed to m, and cA will represent the pressure upon the horse's back. The weight sustained by the horse, therefore, is properly regulated by placing the centre of gravity at m. We have still, however, to determine the proper length of bA and bm, the distance of the centre of gravity from the axle, and from the horizontal line DA; but as these depend upon the nature and inclination of the roads, u on the length of the shaft DA, which depends on the size of the horse, on the magnitude of the load, and on other variable circumstances, it would be impossible to fix their value.—If the load, along with the cart, weighs 400 pounds; if the distance DA be eight feet, and if the horse should bear 50 pounds of the weight, then bA should be one foot, which, being one-eighth of DA, will make the pressure upon D exactly 50 pounds. If the road slopes four inches in a foot, bm must be four inches, or the angle bAm should be equal to the inclination of the road; for then the point m will rise to a when ascending such a road, and will press with its greatest force on the back of the horse.\n\n454. When carts are not made in this manner, we may, in some degree, obtain the same end by judiciously disposing the load. Let us suppose that the centre of gravity is at O when the cart is loaded with homogeneous materials, such as sand, lime, &c. then if the load is to consist of heterogeneous substances, or bodies of different weights, we should place the heaviest at the bottom and nearest the front, which will not only lower the point o, but will bring it forward, and practically nearer the proper position m. Part of the load, too, might be suspended below the fore part of the carriage in dry weather, and the centre of gravity would approach still nearer the point m. When the point m is thus depressed, the weight on the horse is not only judiciously regulated, but the cart would be prevented from overturning; and in rugged roads the weight sustained by each wheel would be in a great degree equalized.\n\nDescription of different Carriages.\n\n455. In figure 8, is represented a carriage invented by Mr Richard, a physician in Rochelle, which moves without horses, merely by the exertion of the passenger, without the machinery by which this is effected is placed in a box behind the carriage, and is shown in figure 9, where AA is a small axis fixed into the box, and B a pulley over which a rope passes whose two extremities are tied to the ends of the levers or tredles C, D: the other ends of the levers are fixed by joints to the cross beam MN. The cranks FF are fixed to the axle KL, and move upon it as a centre. Each of them has a detent tooth at F which catches in the teeth of the wheels H, H, so that they can move from F to H without moving the wheel, but the detent tooth catches in the teeth of the wheels when the cranks are brought backward, and therefore brings the wheel along with them. When the foot of the passenger, therefore, is placed upon the treddle D, it brings down the crank F and along with it the wheel H, so that the large wheels fixed on the same axle perform part of a revolution; but when D is depressed, the rope DA descends, the extremity C of the other treddle rises, and the crank F rising along with it, takes into the teeth of the wheel H, so that when the elevated treddle C is depressed, the wheels H, H, and consequently the wheels I, I perform another part of a revolution. In this way, by continuing to work at the treddles, the machine advances with a regular pace.\n\n456. A carriage of this kind, where the mechanism is much more simple and beautiful than that which we have described, has been lately invented and constructed by Mr Na'myth of Edinburgh, a gentleman whose mechanical genius is scarcely inferior to his talents as a painter. The pulley B and axle AA, are rendered unnecessary; leather straps are substituted in place of the cranks F, F, and the whole mechanism is contained in two small cylindrical boxes about six inches in diameter, and one and a half broad.\n\n457. A carriage driven by the action of the wind is exhibited in fig. 10. It is fixed on four wheels, and moved by the impulse of the wind upon the sails C, D, being guided by the rudder E. Carriages of this kind will answer very well in a level country where the roads are good and the wind fair; and are said to be much used in China. In Holland they sometimes use similar vehicles for travelling upon the ice; but they have a flake instead of wheels, so that if the ice should happen to break, there will be no danger of sinking. Stephinos, a Dutchman is said to have constructed one of these carriages with wheels, which travelled at the rate of 21 miles an hour with a very strong wind.\n\n458. The carriage represented in fig. 11, is made Fig. IX, so as to fall against the wind by means of the spiral sails R E,\nMechanics.\n\nDescription E, F, G, H, one of which F is expanded by the wind. The impulse of the wind upon the sails gives a rotatory motion to the axle M, furnished with a cog-wheel K, whose trundles act upon teeth placed on the inside of the fore-wheels.\n\nFig. 12. A carriage which cannot be overturned is represented in figure 12, where A.B is the body of the carriage, consisting of a hollow globe, made of leather or wood, at the bottom of which is placed an immovable weight proportioned to the load which the carriage is to bear. Two horizontal circles of iron D, E connected with bars HI, and two vertical circles F, G, surround the globe; and the wheels are fastened by a handle K to the perpendicular bars HI. Then since the body of the carriage moves freely in every direction within the iron circles, the centre of gravity will always be near C, and the carriage will preserve an upright position even if the wheels and frame were overturned.\n\nPART III. DESCRIPTION OF MACHINES.\n\nChap. I. Machines which illustrate the doctrines of Mechanics, or are connected with them.\n\nI. Atwood's Machine.\n\n460. THE ingenious machine invented by Mr Atwood for illustrating the doctrines of accelerated and retarded motion, is represented in figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and enables us to discover, 1. The quantity of matter moved. 2. The moving force. 3. The space described. 4. The time of description; and 5. The velocity acquired at the end of that time.\n\n461. 1. Of the quantity of matter moved.—In order to observe the effects of the moving force, which is the object of any experiment, the interference of all other forces should be prevented: the quantity of matter moved, therefore, considering it before any impelling force has been applied, should be without weight; for though it be impossible to abstract weight from any substance whatever, yet it may be so counteracted as to produce no sensible effect. Thus in the machine fig. 1, A, B represent two equal weights affixed to the extremities of a very fine silk thread: this thread is stretched over a wheel or fixed pulley a b c d, moveable round a horizontal axis: the two weights A, B being equal and acting against each other, remain in equilibrium; and when the least weight is superadded to either (letting aside the effects of friction), it will preponderate. When A, B are set in motion by the action of any weight m, the sum A+B+m, would constitute the whole mass moved, but for the inertia of the materials which must necessarily be used in the communication of motion. These materials consist of:\n\n1. The wheel a b c d, over which the thread sustaining A and B passes. 2. The four friction wheels on which the axle of the wheel a b c d rests. 3. The thread by which the bodies A and B are connected, so as when set in motion to move with equal velocities. The weight and inertia of the thread are too small to have any sensible effect on the experiments; but the inertia of the other materials constitute a considerable proportion of the mass moved, and must therefore be taken into account. Since when A and B are put in motion, they must move with a velocity equal to that of the circumference of the wheel a b c d to which the thread is applied; it follows, that if the whole mass of the wheels were accumulated in this circumference, its inertia would be truly estimated by the quantity of matter moved; but since the parts of the wheels move with different velocities, their effects in resisting the communication of motion to A and B by their inertia will be different; those parts which are furthest from the axis resisting more than those which revolve nearer in a duplicate proportion of those distances, (see Rotation). If the figures of the wheels were regular, the distances of their centres of gyration from their axes of motion would be given, and consequently an equivalent weight, which being accumulated uniformly in the circumference a b c d, would exert an inertia equal to that of the wheels in their constructed form, would also be given. But as the figures are irregular, recourse must be had to experiment, to assign that quantity of matter, which being accumulated uniformly in the circumference of the wheel a b c d, would resist the communication of motion to A in the same manner as the wheels.\n\nIn order to ascertain the inertia of the wheel a b c d, with that of the friction wheels, the weights A.B being removed, the following experiment was made:\n\nA weight of 30 grains was affixed to a silk thread of inconsiderable weight; this thread being wound round the wheel a b c d, the weight 30 grains by descending from rest communicated motion to the wheel, and by many trials was observed to describe a space of about 38½ inches in 3 seconds. From these data the equivalent mass or inertia of the wheels will be known from this rule.\n\nLet a weight P, fig. 2, be applied to communicate motion to a system of bodies by means of a very slender flexible thread going round the wheel SLDIM, through the centre of which the axis passes (G being the common centre of gravity, R the centre of gravity of the matter contained in this line, and O the centre of oscillation). Let this weight descend from rest through any convenient space s inches, and let the observed time of its descent be t seconds; then if l be the space through which bodies descend freely by gravity in one second, the equivalent weight sought \\( W \\times SR \\times SO = \\frac{P \\times t^2}{SD} - P \\).\n\nHere we have \\( f = 30 \\) grains, \\( t = 3 \\) seconds, \\( l = 193 \\) inches, \\( s = 38.5 \\) inches; and \\( \\frac{P \\times t^2}{SD} = \\frac{30 \\times 9 \\times 193}{385} = 1323 \\) grains, or 2½ ounces.\n\nThis is the inertia equivalent to that of the wheel a b c d, and the friction wheels together: for the rule extends to the estimation of the inertia of the mass contained in all the wheels.\n\nThe resistance to motion therefore arising from the wheel's inertia, will be the same as if they were absolutely...\nMECHANICS.\n\nDescription lately removed, and a mass of \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) ounces uniformly accumulated in the circumference of the wheel \\(a b c d\\). This being premised, let the boxes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be replaced, being suspended by the silk thread over the wheel or pulley \\(a b c d\\), and balancing each other; suppose that any weight \\(m\\) added to \\(A\\) so that it shall descend, the exact quantity of matter moved, during the descent of the weight \\(A\\), will be ascertained, for the whole mass will be \\(A + B + m = 2\\frac{1}{2} oz\\).\n\nIn order to avoid troublesome computations in adjusting the quantities of matter moved and the moving forces, some determinate weight of convenient magnitude may be assumed as a standard, to which all the others are referred. This standard weight in the subsequent experiments is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of an ounce, and is represented by the letter \\(m\\). The inertia of the wheels being therefore \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) ounces, will be denoted by \\(11 m\\). \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two boxes constructed so as to contain different quantities of matter, according as the experiment may require them to be varied; the weight of each box, including the hook to which it is suspended, \\(=1\\frac{1}{2} oz\\); or according to the preceding division, the weight of each box will be denoted by \\(6 m\\); these boxes contain such weights as are represented by fig. 3, each of which weighs an ounce, so as to be equivalent to \\(4 m\\); other weights of \\(\\frac{1}{2} oz\\), \\(\\frac{1}{4} m\\), and aliquot parts of \\(m\\), such as \\(\\frac{1}{8} m\\), \\(\\frac{1}{16} m\\), may be also included in the boxes, according to the conditions of the different experiments hereafter described.\n\nIf \\(4\\frac{1}{2} oz\\), or \\(19 m\\), be included in either box, this with the weight of the box itself will be \\(25 m\\); so that when the weights \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each being \\(25 m\\), are balanced in the manner above represented, their whole mass will be \\(50 m\\), which being added to the inertia of the wheels \\(11 m\\), the sum will be \\(61 m\\). Moreover, three circular weights, such as that which is represented at fig. 4, are constructed; each of which \\(=2\\frac{1}{2} oz\\), or \\(m\\); if one of these be added to \\(A\\) and one to \\(B\\), the whole mass will now become \\(63 m\\), perfectly in equilibrium, and moveable by the least weight added to either (leaving aside the effects of friction), in the same manner precisely as if the same weight or force were applied to communicate motion to the mass \\(63 m\\), existing in free space and without gravity.\n\n462. 2. The moving force. Since the weight of any substance is constant, and the exact quantity of it easily estimated, it will be convenient here to apply a weight to the mass \\(A\\) as a moving force; thus, when the system consists of a mass \\(=63 m\\), according to the preceding description, the whole being perfectly balanced, let a weight \\(\\frac{1}{4} oz\\), or \\(m\\), such as is represented in fig. 5, be applied on the mass \\(A\\); this will communicate motion to the whole system; by adding a quantity of matter \\(m\\) to the former mass \\(63 m\\), the whole quantity of matter moved will now become \\(64 m\\); and the moving force being \\(=m\\), this will give the force which accelerates the descent of \\(A = \\frac{m}{64 m}\\), or \\(\\frac{1}{64}\\) part of the accelerating force of gravity.\n\nBy the preceding construction, the moving force may be altered without altering the mass moved; for suppose the three weights \\(m\\), two of which are placed on \\(A\\) and one on \\(B\\), to be removed, then will \\(A\\) balance \\(B\\). If the weights \\(3 m\\) be all placed on \\(A\\), the moving force will become \\(3 m\\), and the mass moved \\(64 m\\) as before, and the force which accelerates the descent of \\(A = \\frac{3 m}{64 m} = \\frac{3}{64}\\) parts of the force by which gravity accelerates falling bodies.\n\nSuppose it were required to make the moving force \\(2 m\\), the mass moved continuing the same. Let the three weights, each of which \\(=m\\), be removed; \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) will balance each other; and the whole mass will be \\(61 m\\): let \\(\\frac{1}{4} m\\), fig. 5, be added to \\(A\\), and \\(\\frac{1}{4} m\\) Fig. 5, to \\(B\\), the equilibrium will be preserved, and the mass moved will be \\(62 m\\); now let \\(2 m\\) be added to \\(A\\), the moving force will be \\(2 m\\), and the mass moved \\(64 m\\) as before; wherefore the force of acceleration \\(=\\frac{1}{64}\\) part of the acceleration of gravity. These alterations in the moving force may be easily made in the more elementary experiments, there being no necessity for altering the contents of the boxes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\); but the proportion and absolute quantities of the moving force and mass moved, may be of any assigned magnitude, according to the conditions of the proposition to be illustrated.\n\n463. 3. Of the space described. The body \\(A\\), fig. 1, descends in a vertical line; and a scale about \\(64\\) inches in length divided into inches and tenths of an inch is adjusted vertical, and so placed that the descending weight \\(A\\) may fall in the middle of a square stage, fixed to receive it at the end of the descent: the beginning of the descent is estimated from \\(o\\) on the scale, when the bottom of the box \\(A\\) is on a level with \\(o\\). The descent of \\(A\\) is terminated when the bottom of the box strikes the stage, which may be fixed at different distances from the point \\(o\\); so that by altering the position of the stage, the space described from rest may be of any given magnitude less than \\(64\\) inches.\n\n464. 4. The time of description is observed by a pendulum, vibrating seconds; and the experiments intended to illustrate the elementary propositions, may easily be so constructed that the time of motion shall be a whole number of seconds. The estimation of the time, therefore, admits of considerable exactness, provided the observer takes care to let the bottom of the box \\(A\\) begin its descent precisely at any beat of the pendulum; then the coincidence of the stroke of the box against the stage, and the beat of the pendulum at the end of the time of motion, will show how nearly the experiment and the theory agree. There might be various devices for letting the weight \\(A\\) begin its descent at the instant of a beat of the pendulum \\(W\\); for instance, let the bottom of the box \\(A\\), when at \\(o\\) on the scale, rest on a flat rod, held in the hand horizontally; its extremity being coincident with \\(o\\), by attending to the beats of the pendulum; and with a little practice, the rod which supports the box \\(A\\) may be removed at the moment the pendulum beats, so that the descent of \\(A\\) shall commence at the same instant.\n\n465. 5. Of the velocity acquired. It remains only to describe in what manner the velocity acquired by the descending weight \\(A\\), at any given point of its path is made evident to the senses. The velocity of \\(A\\)'s descent being continually accelerated will be the same in two points of the space described. This is occasioned by the constant action of the moving force; and since the velocity of \\(A\\) at any instant is measured by the space which\nMechanics.\n\nDescription which would be described by it moving uniformly for a given time with the velocity it had acquired at that instant, this measure cannot be experimentally obtained, except by removing the force by which the descending body's acceleration was caused.\n\nIn order to show in what manner this is effected particularly, let us again suppose the boxes A and B = 25 m each, so as together to be = 50 m; this with the wheel's inertia 11 m will make 61 m; now let m be added to A, and an equal weight m to B, these bodies will balance each other, and the whole mass will be 63 m. If a weight m be added to A, motion will be communicated, the moving force being m, and the mass moved 64 m. In estimating the moving force, the circular weight = m was made use of as a moving force; but for the present purpose of showing the velocity acquired, it will be convenient to use a flat rod, the weight of which is also = m. Let the bottom of the box A be placed on a level with o on the scale, the whole mass being as described above = 63 m, perfectly balanced. Now let the rod, the weight of which = m, be placed on the upper surface of A; this body will descend along the scale in the same manner as when the moving force was applied in the form of a circular weight. Suppose the mass A, fig. 6, to have descended by constant acceleration of the force of m, for any given time, or through a given space: let a circular frame be so affixed to the scale, contiguous to which the weight descends, that A may pass centrally through it, and that this circular frame may intercept the rod m by which the body A has been accelerated from rest. After the moving force m has been intercepted at the end of the given space or time, there will be no force operating on any part of the system which can accelerate or retard its motion: this being the case, the weight A, the instant after m has been removed, must proceed uniformly with the velocity which it had acquired that instant: in the subsequent part of its descent, the velocity being uniform will be measured by space described in any convenient number of seconds.\n\n466. Mr Atwood's machine is also useful for estimating experimentally the velocities communicated by the impact of bodies elastic and nonelastic; the quantity of resistance opposed by fluids, as well as for various other purposes. These uses we shall not insist on; but the properties of retarded motion being a part of the present subject, it may be necessary to show in what manner the motion of bodies resisted by constant forces are reduced to experiment by means of the instrument above described, with as great ease and precision as the properties of bodies uniformly accelerated. A single instance will be sufficient: Thus, suppose the mass contained in the weights A and B, fig. 6, and the wheels to be 61 m, when perfectly in equilibrium; let a circular weight m be applied to B, and let two long weights or rods, each = m, be applied to A, then will A descend by the action of the moving force m, the mass moved being 64 m: suppose that when it has described any given space by constant acceleration, the two rods m are intercepted by the circular frame above described, while A is descending through it, the velocity acquired by that descent is known; and when the two rods are intercepted, the weight A will begin to move on with the velocity acquired, being now retarded by the constant force m; and since the mass moved is 62 m, the force of retardation will be \\( \\frac{m}{62} \\) part of that force where gravity retards bodies thrown perpendicularly upwards. The weight A will therefore proceed along the graduated scale in its descent, with an uniformly retarded motion, and the spaces described, times of motion, and velocities destroyed by the resisting force, will be subject to the same measures as in the examples of accelerated motion already described.\n\nIn the preceding descriptions, two suppositions have been assumed, neither of which is mathematically true: but it might be easily shown that they are so in a physical sense; the errors occasioned by them being infensible in practice.\n\n2. Machine for illustrating the Theory of the Wedge.\n\n467. This machine is represented in fig. 7, where KILM and LMNO are two flat pieces of wood joined together by a hinge at LM; P is a graduated arch on which these pieces of wood can be moved so as to subtend any angle not greater than 60°, and a, b two screws for fixing them at the required angle. The back of the wedge will therefore be represented by IKNO, its sharp edge by LM, and its two sides by KILM, LMNO. The weight p suspended to the wedge by the hook M, and the weight of the wedge itself, may be considered as the force employed to drive the wedge. The wooden cylinders AB, CD, have their extremities made like two flat circular plates to prevent the wedge from slipping off at one side. To the pivots of these cylinders, two of which are represented at e and f, are fastened the cords e W, f U, CV, AX, which passing over the pulleys U, V, X, W are fastened to the two bars u v, x w, on which any equal weights Y, Z may be hung at pleasure. The tendency of these weights is evidently to draw the cylinders towards each other, and they may therefore be regarded as the resistance of the wood acting against the sides of the wedge. The cylinders themselves are suspended by their pivots to the threads E, F, G, H, which may be fixed to the ceiling of the room, or to the horizontal beam of a frame made on purpose.—By placing various equal weights at Y and Z, it may be easy to determine the proportion between the power and the resistance when the wedge is in equilibrium.—In this machine the impelling power is the prelude of the weight p, whereas, in the real wedge, the impelling power is always an impulsive force which is infinitely more powerful.\n\n3. Machine for illustrating the effects of the centrifugal force in flattening the poles of the Earth.\n\n468. Fig. 8 represents this machine, which consists of two flexible circular hoops, AB and CD, crossing one another at right angles, and fixed to the vertical axis EF at its lower extremity, but left loose at the pole or intersection e. If this axis be made to revolve rapidly by means of the wheel m, and the wheel and pinion n, o, the middle parts A, B, C, D will, by their centrifugal force, fly out and strike against the frame at F and G; if the pole e, when sinking, is not stopped by means of a pin E fixed in the vertical axis. The hoops, therefore, will have a spheroidal form; the equatorial being larger than the polar diameter.\n\n4. Machine for trying the Strength of Materials.\n\n469. The piece of wood, whose strength is to be tried,\nMechanics\n\nDescription tried, is represented by E.F., and the force is applied to it by means of the winch A, which winds up the rope BC, passing over the pulley n, and below the pulley m, and attached to the point D of the beam EF. The pulleys slide on two parallel bars fixed in a frame, held down by a projecting point, at G, of the lever GR, which is graduated like a fleelyard, and measures the force employed. The beam EF is held by a double vice IK with four screws, two of which are invisible. When a wire is to be torn it is fixed to the cross bar LM; and when any body is to be crushed, it must be placed beneath the lever NO, the rope BC being fixed to the hook N, and the end O being held down by the click which acts on the double ratchet OP.—The lever is double from O to Q, and acts on the body by a loop fixed to it by a pin. See Young's Nat. Philos. vol. i. p. 768, from which this drawing and description are taken.\n\n5. Machine in which all the Mechanical powers are combined.\n\n470. The lever AB, whose centre of motion is C, is fixed to the endless screw DE, which drives the wheel and axle FHG. Round the axle G is coiled a rope GHI, which passes round the four pulleys K, L, m, n, and is fixed to a hook at m on the lower block, which carries the weight W. When equal weights are suspended on the lever at equal distances from the fulcrum C, the lever becomes a balance, and the wedge and inclined plane are evidently included in the endless screw DE. If the wheel F has 30 teeth, if the lever AB is equal to twice the diameter of the wheel FH, and if the diameter of the axle G is one-tenth of the diameter of the wheel, a power of 1 exerted at P will raise a weight of 2400 suspended at the lower block of the four pulleys.\n\n6. Fidler's Balance.\n\n471. The balance represented in fig. 3. was made by Fidler for the Royal Institution, and does not differ much from those which have been constructed by Ramsden and Troughton. The middle column A can be raised at pleasure by the nut B, and supports the round ends of the axis in the forks at its upper extremity, in order to remove the pressure on the sharp edges of the axis within the forks. C and D are pillars which occasionally support the scales, and may be elevated or depressed by turning the nut E. The screw F raises or depresses a weight within the conical beam, for the purpose of regulating the position of the centre of gravity. The graduated arc G measures the extent of the vibrations. See Young's Nat. Phil. vol. i. p. 765.\n\n7. Improvement on the Balance.\n\n472. An improvement on the balance is represented in fig. 4. where DC is a micrometer screw fixed to the arm FA, so that when it is turned round by the nut D, it neither approaches to, nor recedes from, the centre of motion F. The screw DC works in a female screw in the small weight n, and by revolving in one direction, carries this weight from S to R, and thus gives the preponderance to the scale GR. The reception of the weight n from the centre F is measured as in the common micrometer, and a weight n placed in the scale suspended at A, will be in equilibrium with n placed at any distance Sn, when $x = \\frac{Sn}{FA}$. Append. to Ferguson's Lectures.\n\n8. Machine for shewing the Composition of Forces.\n\n473. The part BEFC is made to draw other parts into Machine 473. The part BEFC is made to draw other parts into Machine combination to BEFC so as to turn on an axis which will be at H of forces, when the square BEFC is pushed in, and at p when it Fig. 4. is drawn out. A ball G is made to slide on the wire k which is fixed to BEFC, and the thread m attached to the ball goes over the pulley to I, where it is fixed. Now, when the piece BEFC is pulled out, the pulley, wire, and ball, move along with it, in the direction DCF, and it is evident that the ball G will slide gradually up the wire k. It is therefore acted upon by two forces; one in the direction GH, and the other in the direction GC, and will be found at the end of the motion at g, having moved in the direction Gg, the diagonal of a parallelogram whose sides are GH, GC.\n\n8. Smeaton's Machine for experiments on Windmill Sails.\n\n474. In the experiments with this machine, the sails Apparatus were carried round in the circumference of a circle, so that the same effect was produced as if the wind had struck the sails at rest with the velocity which was then given them. In the pyramidal frame ABC is fixed to the axis DE, which carries the arm FG with the sails GI. By pulling the rope Z, which coils round the barrel H, a motion of rotation is given to the sails, so that they revolve in the circumference of a circle, whose radius is DI. At L is fixed a cord which passes round the pulleys M, N, O, and coils round a small cylinder on the axis of the sails and raises the scale C, in which different weights are placed for trying the power of the sails, and which, being in the direction of the axis DE, is not affected by the circular motion of the arm DG. The scale C is kept steady by the pillars Q, R, and prevented from swinging by the chains S, T, which hang loosely round the pillars. VX is a pendulum composed of two leaden balls moveable upon a wooden rod, so that they can be adjusted to vibrate in any given time. The pendulum hangs upon a cylindrical wire, on which it vibrates as on a rolling axis.\n\n9. Smeaton's Machine for experiments on Rotatory Motion.\n\n475. This machine is exhibited in fig. 1. where the Apparatus vertical-axis NB is turned by the rope M passing over the pulley R, and carrying the scale S. The axis NB carries two equal leaden weights K, D, moveable at pleasure on the horizontal bar HI. The upper part of the axis is one half the diameter of the part M, so that when the rope is made to wind round N, it acts at half the distance from the axis, at which it acts when coiled round M.—When the rope is wound round N, the same force will produce in the same time but half the velocity which is produced when the rope coils round M, the situation of the leaden weights being the same: But when the weights K, L are removed to a double distance from the axis, a quadruple force will be required in order to produce an equal angular velocity in a given time.\n1. Prony's Condenser of Forces.\n\n476. The object of this machine is to obtain a maximum effect from an impelling power which is subject to variation in its intensity. Let us suppose that wind is the first mover, and that O, O is the vertical axis of a windmill; e, e, e, e, are several radii issuing from this axis, and carrying a wiper b d, which acts upon the corresponding wipers a f, and gives a motion of rotation to the axes a, a, a, a to which they are attached. The wipers b d, a f must be so constructed that when b d ceases to press on one wiper a f, it shall at the same moment begin to act upon the next wiper. Each of the axes a, a, a, a carries a drum r r r r, round which is coiled a cord p F, passing over the pulley p, and supporting a weight Q which can be placed at different distances from G on the lever FG. The axes a, a, a, a also pass through the pinions q q, to which they are not fixed; but these pinions carry ratchet wheels that bear against the teeth r r, so that when the weight Q rises, the rope merely coils round the drum without moving the pinion q q. But when the wiper b d ceases to act upon a f, the weight Q descends, and then the toothed wheel r r acts against the ratchet, so that Q cannot descend without turning the pinion q q along with the drum. The pinion q q drives the wheel a b, which again drives the wheel C E by means of the bevelled teeth CD, and elevates the load at P. Hence, when the axis OO is put in motion by the wind acting on the sails, it will first raise a number of weights Q sufficient to put the machine in motion, and will continue to raise new weights while those before raised are fallen, so that the motion once impressed will be continued.\n\n2. Portable Stone Crane, for loading and unloading Carts.\n\n477. This crane is mounted on a wooden frame, and is so constructed that it may be taken to pieces. The frame A, A, A, A is about ten feet high, nine feet long and nine feet wide. The wheels B, B are of iron, and about three feet in diameter. The pinion D that is fixed to the axis of the first wheel B is eight inches diameter, and the other pinion C is about the same diameter. When the stones are suspended to the rope that coils round the barrel, the workman turns a winch on the axis of the wheel C, and raises or lowers the weight according to the direction in which he turns it.\n\n3. Portable Cellar Crane.\n\n478. This crane is represented in fig. 5, where A, A are two wooden supports about six feet high, which are jointed at E, and connected by the iron cylinder C and the wooden bar D. The supports A, A are fastened to the edge of the cellar by the iron prongs E, E, and the two ropes which support the barrel and pass round it are fixed to the iron clamp G, G. These ropes coil round the cylindrical bar F, which is put in motion by the winch K, driving the pinion I about four inches diameter, which gives motion to the wheel H, about three feet in diameter. The barrel, therefore, will rise or fall according to the direction in which the winch is moved.\n\n4. Weighing Crane.\n\n479. This crane represented in fig. 6 was invented by Mr Andrews, and weighs the body at the time that it is raising it. The weight W is elevated by means of CCXXX. the levers M, N, O, P which coil the rope HR round Fig. 6. the barrel H. The jib ED stands on a horizontal beam moveable in a vertical plane round the centre crane. FA, and the distance of the upright beam E from the centre of motion A is 3/5 of BE. The weight of the body W is then ascertained by the weight at H, which keeps it in equilibrium. The piece of wood C projects from the vertical beam CT, in order to prevent the beam from rising too high.\n\n5. Gilpin's Crane.\n\n480. In fig. 1, where this machine is represented, Gilpin's A.B is the perpendicular stand, formed of two oaken crane planks let into cast iron mortises C, D: Between these plate planks is fixed the barrel E with spiral grooves on its surface, on which the chain RL winds. When the winch N is put in motion it drives the pinion O, which again drives the wheel P, on whose axle is fixed the barrel F, so that the chain is coiled round the barrel and the weight raised. A section of this part of the machinery is shown in fig. 2. Figure 3 shows an enlarged view of part of the barrel, and part of the chain lying in its proper position in the spiral grooves or channels. In order to prevent the chain from twitting when it is wound upon the barrel, the lower edge of one link lies in the groove, and the next link upon the surface of the barrel. This will be better understood from fig. 4, which is a section of the barrel F, and shows the manner in which one link lies within it, and the other link on its outside. The old method of working chains is exhibited in fig. 5. For a full account of this useful invention, see Nicholson's Journal, vol. xv. p. 126.\n\n6. Bramah's Jib for Cranes.\n\n481. The nature of this invention, for which we are indebted to the ingenious Mr Bramah, may be easily understood from a bare inspection of fig. 6, which represents a jib attached to the wall of a warehouse. The jib turns on a perforated axis or pillar. The rope by which the weight is raised after passing over two pulleys, goes through the perforated axis, and is conducted over another pulley to the barrel of the crane, which is not represented in the figure. In jibs of the common construction which turn in two solid gudgeons, the rope passes over the upper gudgeon, and is confined between two vertical rollers; but the bending of the rope occasions a great deal of friction, and produces a constant effort to bring the arm of the jib into a position parallel to the inner part of the rope.\n\n7. Gottlieb's Carriage Crane.\n\n482. This machine, which is useful for carrying large stones where carts and horses cannot be easily obtained consists of two sorts of crane wheels applied to the two Carriage men, one acting at each winch A, A give motion to the loaded carriage. The pinion B, six inches in diameter turns the wheel C, three feet in diameter. The wheel C gives motion to the pinion D one foot in diameter,\nMechanics\n\n8. Common Jack.\n\n483. The common worm jack is represented in fig. 8, and is impelled by the weight W, which is suspended to a rope passing through the pulleys V, R, and rolling round the barrel Q. When the barrel is put in motion by the action of the weight, it drives the wheel KL of 60 teeth, by means of a catch fixed to AB, which lays hold of the cross bars in KL. The wheel KL drives the pinion M of 15 teeth, fixed on the axis of the wheel N of 30 teeth, which gives motion to the endless screw O, and the fly-wheel P. On the axis of the wheel KL is fixed the pulley DG, which by means of a rope gives motion to the spit. The axis ET is fixed in the barrel AC; and as this axis is hollow, both it and the barrel turn round upon the axis FD, so that the rope may be coiled round the barrel by the winch H without moving the wheel K.\n\n9. Loading and Unloading Machine.\n\n484. This portable machine, invented by Mr Davis of Windsor, is put in motion by the winch A, which drives the two endless screws C, C. These screws move the wheels E, E, and consequently the barrels connected with them, so that the ropes F, F passing over the pulleys G, G are coiled round the barrels, and the load H which these ropes support is raised into the frame R, R, which shows a part of the cart. The barrels and wheels are contained in an iron box L, the sides of which are removed in the figure.\n\n10. Vauleux's Pile Engine.\n\n485. The horses which work this engine are yoked at S, S, and by moving the wheel B and drum C, which are locked together, raise the follower GH, carrying the ram Q by the handle R, by means of the rope HH which coils round the drum. When the follower G reaches the top of the frame, the upper legs of the tongs H are closed by pressing against the adjacent beams; and their lower legs are opened, so that they drop the ram Q, which falls and strikes the pile. When G is at the top of the frame, the crooked handle 6, of the follower G, presses against the cords a, a, which raise the end of the lever L (see fig. 2) round m as a centre, and by depressing the extremity N, and consequently the bar S, S, unlock the drum C and the wheel B, so that the follower G falls by its weight and seizes the ram R. As soon as the follower drops, the Description of Machines would tumble down, having no resistance to overcome, were not this prevented by the fly O, which is moved by the wheel B and trundle X, and opposes a sufficient resistance to the horses till the follower again seizes the ram. When the follower falls, the weight L (fig. 2.) pushes up the bolt Y into the drum C, and locks the wheel and the drum;—and the same operation is afterwards repeated. See Ferguson's Lect. vol. i. p. 118.\n\n11. Bunce's Pile Engine.\n\n486. A side view of this engine is shown in fig. 3, 4. Bunce's It consists of two endless ropes or chains A, connected pile engines by cross pieces of iron B, B, &c. (fig. 4.) which pass Fig. 3, 4. round the wheel C, the cross pieces falling into corresponding cross grooves, cut in the periphery of the wheel. When the man at S, therefore, drives the wheel m by means of the pinion p, he moves also the wheel C fixed on the axis of m, and makes the double ropes revolve upon the wheels C, D. The wheel D is fixed at the end of a lever DHK, whose centre of motion is H, a fixed point in the beam FT. Now, when the ram L (fig. 3, 5.) is fixed to one of the cross pieces B by the hook M, the weight of the ram, acting by the rope, moves the lever DK round H, and brings the wheel D to G, so that, by turning the winch, the ram L (fig. 3.) is raised in the vertical line LRG. But when it reaches R, the projecting piece R disengages the ram from the cross piece B, by striking the bar Q; and as the weight is removed from the extremity D of the lever, the counterpoise I brings it back from G to its old position at F, and the ram falls without interfering with the chain. When the hook is descending, it is prevented from catching the rope by means of the piece of wood N suspended from the hook M at O; for being specifically lighter than the iron weight L, and moving with less velocity, it does not come in contact with L till the ram is stopped at the end of its path. When N, therefore falls upon L, it depresses the extremity M of the hook, and therefore brings the hook over one of the cross pieces B, by which the ram is again raised.\n\n487. For the description of a great variety of useful machines, the reader is referred to the second volume of Mr Gregory's Mechanics, and to Dr Young's Natural Philosophy, a work of great merit, which would have been more particularly noticed if it had reached us before the historical part of this article was printed off.—See also Hydrodynamics, Marly, Machine at Mill, Ramsden, and Water Works.\n\nIndex\n\nA.\n\nABUTMENTS, construction of, No 336\nArchimedes' principle of dynamics, 22\nArches, equilibrium of, catenarian, 316\nof equilibration, 334\nArwood's machine 460\n\nB.\n\nBalance, its properties, 142\n\nC.\n\nBalance, Kubne's, Magellan's, Ludlam's, Tidler's improvement on it, Bevelled wheels, Borelli, works of, Carriage, wheel, on the construction of, 459\n\nN° 151 Cellar crane,\nCentre of inertia, or gravity, how to find it, No 4, 154, 201\nCentrobarge method, 206, 208\nCollision, laws of, discovered by Wren, &c., 12\nof hard bodies, 248—258\nof elastic bodies, 258—279\nof imperfectly elastic bodies, 279\n\nConical!\nMECHANICS.\n\nConical pendulum, No 394\nConservation of active forces discovered by Huygens, 19\ngenerally by D.

It is about 200 miles in circumference. The soil is exceedingly fertile; and the climate so wholesome, that the Spaniards imagine it to be possessed of some peculiarly restorative quality; for which reason the sick and infirm flock to it from all quarters. The commodities are sulphur, indigo, farasparilla, sassafras, cacao, vanellos, ambergris, hides, wool, cotton, silk, sugar, the root mechoacan or white jalap, and silver. This province formed an independent kingdom at the time Mexico was reduced by Cortez. The sovereign had long been the inveterate enemy of the Mexicans, and was considered, next to the republic of Tlalcalca, as the most formidable barrier against the extension of the imperial frontier. However, he submitted to Cortez without striking a blow, being intimidated by the wonders he had performed with a handful of men; and thus Mechoacan became a province of the Spanish empire, and a valuable addition to Mexico. The country at that time was exceedingly populous, but the natives are now much thinned; and that rather by the luxury and effeminacy introduced by the Spaniards, than by their tyranny. The capital of the province is also called Mechoacan by the natives, but Valladolid by the Spaniards.\n\nMECHOCAN, or White Jalap, in the materia medica, the root of an American species of convolvulus brought from Mechoacan, a province of Mexico, in thin slices like jalap, but larger, and of a whitish colour. It was first introduced into Europe about the year 1524 as a purgative: but since jalap became known, mechoacan has been little employed.\n\nMECKLENBURG, a duchy of Germany, containing those of Schwerin and Gutfro, is bounded by Pomerania on the east, by part of the marquise of Brandenburg and the duchy of Lunenburg on the south, the Baltic on the north, and Holstein and Saxe Lawenburg on the west. Their greatest length is about 135 miles, and greatest breadth upwards of 90. With respect to the soil, much cannot be said in favour of it, as it consists in general, either of sand, or large and defoliate heaths interspersed with moors, woods, fens, and lakes. It yields very little wheat, and not a great deal of oats, rye, and barley; but breeds a considerable number of sheep and cattle, has plenty of fish, with stone quarries, salt springs, alum, iron, and some copper. The principal rivers here are the Elde and Stor, which fall into the Elbe as it glides along the borders of this country to the southwest; the Reckenitz, which discharges itself into the Baltic; as do the Peene, the Warno, and the Stope-nitz. This country has only one harbour on the Baltic, namely that of Rostock. In both duchies, exclusive of Rostock, are 45 great and small cities, with three convents, and a great number of manors and farms, belonging either to the duke, the nobility, or convents. The peasants are in a state of villainage; but the nobility enjoy very considerable privileges.\n\nThe states are composed of the nobility and towns; and the diets, which are summoned annually, are held alternately at Sternberg and Malehain. The duchy of Schwerin appoints four provincial counsellors, and that of Gutfro as many; who rank according to seniority, with the duke's actual privy counsellors, as their marshals do with the colonels. The lesser committee represents the whole body of the nobility and commons, by whom the members are chosen freely and without control, and no edict relative to the whole country can be published without their consent, or in prejudice of their rights. The inhabitants of this country are mostly Lutherans, under their superintendents. There are also some Calvinists and Roman Catholics. Besides the grammar schools in the towns, there is an university at Rostock. The commodities of the duchy are corn, flax, hemp, hops, wax, honey, cattle, butter, cheese, wool, and wood, a part of which is exported; but hardly any manufactures.\n\nOf the house of Mecklenburg, there are two lines still subsisting, viz. that of Schwerin and that of Strelitz. The latter commenced in Duke Adolphus Frederick II., younger brother of the duke of Schwerin, and grandfather of Adolphus Frederick IV., who entered on the government in 1752, and whose family received a great additional lustre by his Britannic majesty's taking his second sister for his consort, and by her own great merit and noble deportment in that high station. Besides the duchy of Strelitz, to this duke belong the principality of Ratzeburg, with the lordship of Stargard, the ancient commanderies of Mire and Nemo, and a yearly pension of 9000 dollars out of the Boitzenburg toll. The title assumed by both the dukes is duke of Mecklenburg; prince of Wenden, Schwerin, and Ratsburg; count of Schwerin and the country of Rostock, and lord of Stargard. By the agreement concluded at Wittstock in 1442, the elector of Brandenburg, on the extinction of the male line of the dukes of Mecklenburg, is entitled to their whole succession. The duke of Schwerin has two votes both in the diet of the empire and that of the circle. The matricular affluence for the duchies of Schwerin and Gutfro is 40 horse and 67 foot, or 748 florins monthly, including what is paid by Sweden for Wismar, and the bailiwicks of Poll and Neukloster. To the chamber of Wetzlar, these two duchies pay each 243 rix dollars, 43 kruittzars. For the government of Mecklenburg, the administration of justice, and the management of the revenue, there is the privy council of regency, the demeine chamber, the high and provincial court of justice, to which appeals lie in most causes, both from the consistory and the inferior civil courts, and which are common to both the dukes. As to the revenues, those of the Schwerin line must be very considerable, those arising from the demeine bailiwicks and regalia alone amounting to 300,000 rix dollars per annum. There is a tax on land that produces no contemptible sum, and that called the prince's tax is fixed at 20,000 rix dollars: besides all these, there are also free gifts. The whole revenues of the Strelitz branch are estimated at 120,000 rix dollars. Each of these princes maintains a body of troops.\n\nMECONIUM, the excrement contained in the intestines of an infant at its birth.\nUtility of MEDAL, denotes a piece of metal in the form of coin, such as was either current money among the ancients, or struck on any particular occasion, in order to preserve to posterity the portrait of some great person, or the memory of some illustrious action. Scaliger derives the word medal from the Arabic methalia; a sort of coin with a human head upon it. But the opinion of Voelius is generally received; viz. that it comes from metallum, \"metal;\" of which substance medals are commonly made.\n\nSect. I. Utility of Medals in History, and various other Sciences.\n\nThere are few studies of more importance to history than that of medals; the sole evidence we can have of the veracity of a historian being only such collateral documents as are evident to everybody, and cannot be falsified. In modern times, these are found in public memoirs, instructions to ambassadors, and state papers of various kinds. Such memorials, however, are subject to various accidents, and besides commonly remain in the countries where they are first published, and cannot therefore give to the world at large that perfect and entire satisfaction which ought to be derived from genuine history; so that more durable and widely diffused monuments are still to be wished for. Such are public buildings, inscriptions, and statues; but these, excepting a few instances of the two last, are always confined to particular countries; so that medals alone remain as infallible documents of truth, capable of being diffused over all countries in the world, and of remaining though the latest ages.\n\nThe first who showed the importance of medals in ascertaining the dates, and arranging the order of events, in ancient history, by means of medals, was Vaillant, in his History of the Kings of Syria, printed at Paris in 1681. By medals alone, he has been enabled to fix the chronology and important events of history, in the three most ancient kingdoms of the world, viz. Egypt, Syria, and Parthia. Many coins have been discovered since his time, which confirm the accounts he has given. He was followed in this method by Father Hardouin, though with less success. Hardouin's best work is his Herodiades, or Series of Successors to Herod king of Judea. The same plan was pursued by Noris, in his learned Treatise on the Syro-Macedonian princes, and by Bayer in his History of Othoene, as well as by Froelich, in the work entitled Annales Regum et Rerum Syriac, Vien. 1754, and another named Kevenhullers Regum veterum Numismata Anekdota, auct. Perrara, Vien. 1752, 4to, of which Froelich was properly the author. Corfini and Cary likewise published works of a similar nature; the former in 1741, De Minifarii, alicrumque Armeniae Regum, Nummis, &c.; the latter in 1752, Histoire des Rois de Thrace, et du Bosphore Cimmerien, eclaircie par les Medailles.\n\nThe study of the Greek coins does not show the utility of dates of events, though it illustrates the chronology of reigns. This defect, however, is abundantly supplied by those of Rome, which commonly mark the date of the prince's consulship, the year of his tribunician power; giving also, upon the reverse, the representation or poetical symbol of some grand event.\n\nThe year of the tribunician power is sometimes imagined by antiquaries to be synonymous with that of the emperor's reign; but this is not the case; and Mr Pinkerton is at some pains to set them right in this respect. He finds fault with Julius Caesar, when he assumed the sovereign authority, for taking upon him the title of Perpetual Dictator, as being synonymous with that of king or absolute governor, which the Romans abhorred. \"He ought (says our author), under the disguise of some supreme magistrate of annual election, to have lulled the people with a dream, that they might terminate his power when they pleased; or that he himself would resign it, when the necessities of state which had required his temporary elevation had subsided.\" To this error Mr Pinkerton attributes the assumption of the dictator, and commends the policy of Augustus, who, with far inferior abilities, continued in possession of the most absolute authority as long as he lived. The tribuneship was an office of annual election; and if put into the hands of any others than plebeians, must have been the supreme power of the state, as it belonged to that office to put a negative upon every public measure whatever. Augustus, being of senatorial rank, could not assume this office; but he invested himself with the tribunician power, which had the advantages of appearing to be only a temporary supremacy, though in truth it was continued during his whole lifetime. Towards the end of his reign, he frequently assumed his defined successor, Tiberius, for his colleague, though in the beginning he had enjoyed it alone. This, with his artifice of resigning his power every ten years, and reaffirming it at the desire, as was pretended, of the senate, secured his sovereignty as long as he lived.—His example was followed by his successors; so that most of them have the inscription Tribunicia Potestate upon their medals, with the date affixed to it thus, Tr. Pot. VII. Yet though this date generally implies the year of the emperor's reign, it sometimes happens that the emperor, by special favour from a former prince, had been endowed with this title before he came to the throne, as being the successor to that prince, of which we have already given an instance in Tiberius. Besides the tribunician power, the emperors very frequently enjoyed that of the consul; and the date of their consulship is frequently expressed in their coins.\n\nThe office of Pontifex Maximus was likewise assumed by the Roman emperors, in order to secure themselves in their authority; which, Mr Pinkerton observes, was one of the most efficacious artifices they could have fallen upon. \"In the Greek heroic times\nUtility of (says he), king and priest were carefully united in one person; and when sovereigns arose in Denmark and Sweden, the same plan was followed, as appears from Snorro, and other writers. Nothing could lend more security to the person of the monarch than an office of supreme sanctity, which also confirmed his power by all the terrors of superstition. Even the Christian system was afterwards debased by a mock alliance with government; though it be clear from the whole New Testament, that such an alliance is subversive of its genuine institution, and the greatest of all its corruptions. But the Roman Catholic clergy, in the dark ages, were the authors of 'no church no king,' for their own interest; while the Roman emperors only fought to strengthen their power by the dark awe of superstition. The title of Pontifex Maximus was so important, that it was retained even by the Christian emperors till the time of Gratian. Its influence in the state was, indeed, prodigious. Cicero observes, that to this office were subject, temples, altars, pontes, gods, houses, wealth, and fortune of the people.—That of augur is also borne by many emperors; and its authority was such, that by the law of the twelve tables no public business could be transacted without a declaration from the augur concerning its event.—The proconsular power was also given to Augustus and the other emperors. It conferred a direct authority over all the provinces, and implied the emperor to be chief proconsul, or governor of each, and of all. Another special power assigned to the emperors, but not occurring on coins, was the jus Relatiores Tertiae, Quarta, &c., or the right of making three or four motions in the senate on the same day, while the senators could only propose one.\n\nHence our author infers, that medals afford the most authentic documents of the Roman history, in particular, that could have been invented by man.—The histories of Nerva and Trajan are much better elucidated by medals than by authors; for the history of Suetonius ends with Domitian, and the Historiae Auguile Scriptores begin with Adrian: so that the reigns of the two emperors just mentioned are almost unknown; and Mr Pinkerton is surprised that none of the learned have attempted to supply the defect.—\"Capitolinus (says he), in his life of Maximinus Junior, is quite puzzled to know if Maximus and Pupienus were two emperors, or two names for the same. Had it happened on any of those coins which bear M. CL. PUPIENUS MAXIMUS AUG. he would have seen at once that Maximus was only another name for Pupienus.\"\n\nMedals are useful in other sciences besides history. In geography, we find the situation of towns determined by their vicinity to some noted river, mountain, &c. Thus, ΜΑΓΝΗΤΩΝ ΣΙΠΥΛΟΥ shows that Magnesia was situated under Mount Sipylus. In like manner, it is shown from a medal, that Ephesus stood on the river Cayster; and there is extant a medal, bearing an inscription, which signifies Alexandria on the Scamander; a name given to Troy by Alexander the Great. The reverse has upon it the famous Apollo Smiltheus of Homer. In natural history also, medals are useful chiefly from the coins struck on the celebration of the secular games, in which the figures of various animals are preserved; and thus it may very often be determined whether any animal be known to Utility of the ancients or not. On many of the Greek medals they are several uncommon plants and animals. Thus, on most of the medals of Cyrene is the figure of the celebrated Sulphurium; and on those of Tyre, the shell-fish from which the famous Tyrian purple was procured. By means of medals, also, the exact delineations of many noble edifices are preserved, though not even a vestige of their ruins be now existing; so that the uses of them to the architect are very considerable. To the fine connoisseur they are absolutely necessary; because by them alone he is enabled to ascribe ancient busts and statues to their proper persons, with multitudes of other points of knowledge which cannot be otherwise determined. The elucidations of obscure pages in ancient authors by means of medals are so numerous and well known, that it is needless to insist upon them.\n\nMr Addison has treated the connexion betwixt medals and poetry at considerable length; but Mr Pinkerton finds fault with him for preferring the Latin to the Greek poets. He observes also, that the knowledge of Greek medals is most necessary for a sculptor, and perhaps an architect; but an acquaintance with Latin ones is preferable for a poet, or perhaps a dale of life painter. The reason of this difference is, that the former generally have on the obverse the head of some king, god, or goddess, of exquisite relief and workmanship; but the reverse seldom affords much fancy of symbol in the early Greek coins; and in the imperial Greek coins, is chiefly impressed with the temples of their deities. To a person of poetical imagination, however, the Roman coins afford the greatest entertainment, from the fine personifications and symbols to be found on their reverses; of which our author gives the following instances:\n\n\"Happiness has sometimes the caduceus, or wand Periconification of Mercury, which Cicero, i. Offic. tells us was thought to procure every wish. She has, in a gold coin of Severus, heads of poppy, to express that our prime bliss lies in oblivion of misfortune.\n\nHope is represented as a sprightly girl, walking quickly, and looking straight forward. With her left hand she holds up her garments, that they may not impede the rapidity of her pace; while in her right hand she holds forth the bud of a flower; an emblem infinitely more fine than the trite one of an anchor, which is the symbol of Patience, and not of Hope. This personification, with some others, must have been very familiar to the ancients; for often in this, and in a few more instances, no name, as SPES AUG. or the like, is inserted in the legend.\n\nAbundance is imagined as a fedate matron, with a cornucopia in her hands, of which she scatters the fruits, and does not hold up her cornucopiae and keep the contents to herself, as many modern poets and painters make her do.\n\nThe emperor Titus, having cause to import a great supply of corn during a scarcity at Rome, that supply, or the Annona, is finely represented as a fedate lady, with a filled cornucopiae in her left hand, which she holds upright, to indicate that she does not, however, mean to scatter it, as Abundance has a title to do, but to give it to Equity to deal out. This last particular is shown by her holding a little image of Equity,\nUtility of Equity, known by her scales, and haflo pura, or point them in the leaf spear, in her right hand, over a basket filled with wheat. Behind the Annona is the prow of a ship decked with flowers, to imply that the corn was brought by sea (from Africa), and that the ships had had a prosperous voyage. The best poet in the world would not have given us a finer train of imagery; the best painter would have been puzzled to express so much matter in so small a compass.\n\n\"Security stands leaning upon a pillar, indicative of her being free from all designs and pursuits; and the posture itself corresponds to her name. Horace, in describing the wife man, mentions his being teres atque rotundus; round and polished, against all the rules of chance: an idea seemingly derived from the column upon which this ideal lady reclines.\n\n\"The emblems of Piety, Modesty, and the like, are equally apposite and poetical.\n\n\"The happiness of the state is pictured by a ship sailing before a prosperous breeze: an image than which the superlative genius of Gray could find none more exquisite; and he has accordingly used it in his most capital production \"The Bard,\" with due success.\n\n\"The different countries of the then known world are also delineated with great poetical imagery. It affords patriotic satisfaction in particular to a Briton, to see his native island often represented upon the earliest imperial coins sitting on a globe, with a symbol of military power, the labarum, in her hand, and the ocean rolling under her feet. An emblem almost prophetic of the vast power which her dominion over the sea will always give her, provided she exerts her element of empire with due vigour and perseverance.\n\n\"Coins also present us with Achaea, Africa, Alamania, Alexandria, Arabia, Armenia, Asia, Bithynia, Cappadocia, Dacia, Dardania, Egypt, Gallia, Hispania, Italia, Judea, Macedon, Mauritania, Pannonia, Parthia, Phrygia, Sarmatia, Sicily, Scythia, Syria, and the rivers Danube, Nile, Rhine, Tyber. This personification of provinces seems to have arisen from the figures of provinces carried in triumphs; as the personification of our old poets sprung from the ideal persons actually represented in the mythical plays.\n\n\"There is one colonial medal of rude execution of Augustus and Agrippa, which has a high claim to merit in displaying the ancient poetical imagery. It is inscribed IMP. and DIVI, F., and on the reverse, the conquest of Egypt is represented by the metaphor of a crocodile, an animal almost peculiar to that country, and at that period esteemed altogether so; which is chained to a palm tree, at once a native of the country, and symbolic of victory.\n\n\"As the reverses are so useful for knowledge of personification, symbols of countries and actions, and the like; so the portraits to be seen on old coins are no less important to a painter; the high merit of a great number of them, in every character, justly entitling them to be regarded as the best studies in the world. Not to mention, that, to an historic painter, the science of ancient medals is absolutely necessary, that he may delineate his personages with the features they really bore while in existence. This can only be attained in this way, or from statues and busts; any one of which will cost as much as hundreds of medals; and indeed a collection of such is only attainable by princes.\n\nThe same things which render the study of medals important to a painter, do still more so to a sculptor; and in this particular, the study of the Greek coins is remarkably useful. The skill of the Greeks in the art of sculpture has always been admired throughout the world; and on their coins the heads of several deities are represented in the most exquisite alto relievo. Our author therefore thinks it strange, that the Grecian coins should have hitherto been so little attended to by men of learning and taste. They may have been looked upon, he supposes, as belonging only to the province of the antiquary; but he assures us, that the Greek medals will afford satisfaction to the persons who value them only as pieces of workmanship. In most respects, they greatly excel those of Rome even in its best times: which our author supposes to have been from the days of Augustus to Adrian. \"In the days of Adrian, in particular (says he), the Roman mint seems to have been the very seat of art and genius; witness the vast number of exquisite personifications, engraved with equal workmanship, which swarm on the medals of that prince. Yet from his time down to Posthumus, coins of admirable workmanship are to be found. Those of the Faustinas and Lucilla deserve particular mention. There is one, and not an uncommon one, of the latter in great bras, which yields to nothing of the kind. The reverse is a Venus with the name around her. The portrait of the obverse seems to spring from the field of the coin; it looks and breathes, nay talks, if you trust your eyes. The coins of Tarlius are extremely remarkable for a kind of perspective in the figures, as Froelich observes. On others are found triumphal arches, temples, fountains, aqueducts, amphitheatres, circi, hippodromes, palaces, basilicas, columns and obelisks, baths, sea-ports, pharos, and the like. These furnish much pleasure and instruction to the architect, and serve to form his taste to the ancient manner; that manner which unites perfect simplicity with sublimity and grace; that manner which every age admires, in proportion as it has genius to imitate.\"\n\nSect. II. Entertainment arising from the Study of Medals.\n\nBesides the purposes which the study of medals affords in the useful arts, a great variety of sources of entertainment are to be found in it. Mr Pinkerton observes, that the most barbarous nations are more pleased with the rudest efforts of art, than with the most admirable works of nature; and that in proportion as the powers of the mind are large and various, such are also the pleasures which it receives from those superlative productions of art, which can only be the offspring of vast genius. Hence works of art are agreeable both to the enlightened and to the ignorant. The chief amusement, therefore, which attends the study of medals, originates from the strength and spirit, the fineness and beauty, which the engraver has displayed in the execution of them. Besides gives a kind of personal acquaintance with the persons of whom they are the representations. Portraits have always been...\nbeen highly entertaining to mankind; and our author is of opinion, that the love of them gave rise both to painting and sculpture. They are nowhere to be found so ancient, so numerous, and so well preserved as in medals. Amusement is also derived even from the representations of ideal heads and persons; nay, even from the minute symbols. Thus the Greek coins of cities present us with heads of deities of exquisite workmanship, apparently copied from statues or paintings; so that we may even guess at the works of Apelles and Praxiteles from some of the Greek medals. Their reverses afford still greater variety; there being scarce an object either in art or nature which is not represented upon some of them; and to the satisfaction arising from a view of these, we may likewise add that of beholding, in a lively manner, the dresses, manners and customs, religious and civil ceremonies, of the ancients: so that from medals we may obtain an interesting history of manners; which, though very lately cultivated, may perhaps afford the most useful and entertaining of all the provinces of history.\n\nThere is a very considerable difference between the study of medals and that of a mere antiquary. The latter frequently seems to take delight in coins merely in proportion to their rarity and deformity; so that it is often a recommendation of some of their pieces, that neither portrait, reverse, nor legend, can be discovered; at least in such manner as can be intelligibly explained. \"The delight of the antiquary (says Mr Pinkerton), may be called a depraved appetite of the mind, which feeds on trash, and fills itself with emptiness. It is perhaps a mere childish curiosity mingled with caprice and hypochondriasm. Against this character the ridicule of Severus is particularly hot, but with little effect; for our antiquaries exceed in visions and novelties. I say antiquaries; for the name of antiquary is sacred. By antiquary, in foreign countries, is implied a man who illustrates their ancient laws, manners, poetry; but especially their ancient history. There, men of the most elevated minds are antiquaries; as Muratori, Leibnitz, Montefquieu, Du Bos. Here men of talents will not stoop, forsooth, to studies the most important to their country, but leave its antiquities to chance. Everything is important but our history; and we are profound in every ancient matter that is superficial; and superficial in what is profound. Even England cannot boast of one general historian, but trifles to the inaccuracy of Rapin, and the ignorant neatness of Hume. It is therefore no wonder that the study of antiquity is here ridiculous, though most important in other countries; none requiring greater talents, learning, or industry. But the historic antiquary has the pleasure of benefiting society, and enlightening whole nations, while the medallist has only an innocent amusement. This amusement, considered merely as rising from antiquarian objects, has not been explained, though felt by most people, and more by the learned. It seems analogical with that which we derive from an extensive prospect: for as the mind delights to expand itself into distant places, so also into distant times. We connect ourselves with these times, and feel as it were a double existence. The passions are singularly affected by minute circumstances, though mute to generalities; and the relics of antiquity impress us more than its general history.\"\n\nThe study of medals is not of very ancient date: None of the classic writers give any account of collections of them; though indeed many little particulars are passed without notice by them. In the times of the Greeks, a collection of such coins as then existed must have been but little regarded, as consisting only of those struck by the numerous little states which at that time used the Greek characters and language. Hence they would have had an air of domestic coinage, and no attention would have been paid to them, however exquisite their workmanship might have been. The little intercourse at that time carried on between the different provinces also greatly impeded any communication of knowledge to those who wrote histories; so that it is no wonder to find any small collections that might then have existed altogether unnoticed by them.\n\nAlmost as soon as any communication was opened between the Greeks and Romans, the latter treated the arts of the Greeks with all due respect and applause. Their coins were imitated by the Romans, and preserved in cabinets by the senators among their choicest treasures. Suetonius informs us, that on solemn occasions Augustus was accustomed to present his friends with medals of foreign states and princes, along with other valuable testimonies of his friendship. In a more advanced period of the Roman empire, however, individuals would undoubtedly form collections of coins peculiar to their own state; for Dr Stukeley, in his Medallic History of Carausius, informs us, that a complete series of silver coins was lately found in Britain, containing all the emperors down to Carausius inclusively. From Banduri we also know, that certain Greek coins were specially preserved by the Romans; and it appears from their code, that ancient gold and silver coins were made use of instead of gems; to which distinction those of Sicily were particularly entitled. From the decline of the Roman empire till towards the end of the fifth century, almost all branches of literature were involved in darkness, and the medallistic science among the rest. While the Christian dominion of Constantinople lasted, indeed, almost all the arts and sciences may be said to have been kept within its own boundaries; though the Arabs and eastern nations had some arts and sciences of their own: but after the destruction of the imperial city by the Turks, the Greeks were once more compelled to become fathers to the European science. Even before this time, indeed, some vestiges of a revival of literature had appeared in Italy; \"and to intimate and necessary a connexion (says Mr Pinkerton), has now the study of medals with that of ancient erudition, that on the earliest appearance of a revival of the latter, the former was also disclosed.\"\n\nThe first among the moderns who began to study collectors the metallic science was Petrarch. Being desired by the emperor Charles IV. to compose a book containing the lives of eminent men, and to place him in the list, he replied, that he would do so whenever the emperor's life and conduct deserved it. In consequence of this conversation, he afterwards sent the emperor a collection of gold and silver coins bearing the representations.\nsentations of eminent men, with an address suitable to his former declaration. A collection of coins was made in the next age by Alphonso king of Arragon; but though this monarch collected all that could be found throughout Italy, we know that there could not have been very many, as the whole were contained in an ivory cabinet, and carried always about with him.\n\nA very considerable collection was made by Anthony Cardinal St Mark, nephew to Eugene IV, who ascended the pontifical chair in 1431; and soon after the grand museum at Florence was begun by Cosimo de Medici, where a collection of ancient coins and medals had a place among other curiosities. Corvinus king of Hungary about the same time formed a noble collection of coins along with ancient manuscripts and other valuable relics of antiquity.\n\nMr Pinkerton considers Agnolo Poliziano, more commonly known by the name of Angelus Politianus, as the first writer who adduced medals as vouchers of ancient orthography and customs. He cites different coins of the Medicean collection in his Miscellanea written about the year 1490. By means of a cabinet of medals collected by Maximilian I, emperor of Germany, Joannes Hutichius was enabled to publish a book of the lives of the emperors, enriched with their portraits, delineated from ancient coins. It is generally supposed that this book, which appeared in 1525, was the first work of the kind; but Labbe, in his Bibliotheca Nummaria, mentions another named Illybrisum Imagines, by one Andreas Fulvius, printed in 1517, in which most of the portraits seem to be from medals.\n\nAbout the year 1512 also, Guillaume Bude, a French author, had written his treatise De Affe, though it was not printed till many years afterwards. M. Grollier, treasurer of the French armies in Italy, during part of the 16th century, had a great collection of coins of different kinds of metals. After his death, his brass medals were sent to Provence, and were about to be sent into Italy; when the king of France, having got information of the transaction, gave orders to stop them, and purchase the whole at a very high price for his own cabinet of antiquities. M. Grollier had an assortment of gold and silver as well as of brass medals; the cabinet in which they were contained fell two centuries afterwards into the hands of M. l'Abbe de Rothelin; and was known to have been that of Grollier from some flaps of paper, on which was his usual inscription for his books, Joannis Grollieri, et amicorum.\n\nContemporary with Grollier was Guillaume de Choul, who was likewise a man of rank and fortune. He had a good collection of medals, and published many in his Treatise on the Religion of the ancient Romans in 1557. In the Low Countries we know, from the letters of Erasmus, that the study of medals was begun about the beginning of the 16th century. About the middle of that century, Hubertus Goltzius, a printer and engraver, travelled over most countries in Europe searching for coins and medals, in order to publish books concerning them. From one of these works it appears, that there were then in the Low Countries 200 cabinets of medals; 175 in Germany, upwards of 380 in Italy, and 200 in France. It is probable, however, that there are now four times as many in these countries, besides 500 in Britain; but we are not to imagine that all these were grand collections, for of such there are not above a dozen even in Italy; most of those just mentioned were of the class named cabinets of medals, containing from 100 to 1000 or 2000.\n\nThere are few countries, Italy excepted, in which a greater number of coins have been found than in Britain; though we are by no means well acquainted with the time when the study of them commenced. Mr Pinkerton suspects that Camden was one of the first, if not the very first British author, who produced medals in his works, and who must have had a small collection. Speed's Chronicle, published in the 17th century, was illustrated with coins from Sir Robert Cotton's cabinet. Gorzeus's collection was purchased by Henry prince of Wales, brother to Charles I., to whom he left it at his death. According to Joseph Scaliger, it consisted of 30,000 coins and medals. A collection of 3500 coins was purchased by Archbishop Laud for 600l. and given to the Bodleian library. Thomas earl of Arundel, earl-marshal of England, well known from the Arundelian tables and other antiquities which he imported from Greece and Italy into Britain, had a rich cabinet of medals collected by Daniel Nifum. The dukes of Buckingham and Hamilton, Sir William Paulet, Sir Thomas Fanshaw of Ware-Park, Sir Thomas Hamner, Ralph Sheldon, Esq.; Mr Selden, &c. are enumerated by Evelyn as collectors of medals. Charles I., as well as his historian the earl of Clarendon, were also collectors. The king had a very fine cabinet; which, however, was dissipated and lost during the civil commotions. Oliver Cromwell had a small collection; and the cabinet of Charles II. is mentioned by Vaillant in the preface to his treatise entitled Nummi in Colonitis,\" &c. This branch of magnificence has not been much attended to by succeeding British monarchs; though his present majesty has a very good collection of ancient gold coins.\n\nA great number of fine cabinets have been formed in Britain since the time of Evelyn. About the year 1720 Haym makes mention of those of the duke of Devonshire, the earls of Pembroke and Winchelsea, Sir Hans Sloane, Sir Andrew Fontaine, Mr Sadler, Mr Abdy, Mr Wren, Mr Chicheley, and Mr Kemp. At present there are many remarkable collections; but that of the late Dr William Hunter is deservedly esteemed the most remarkable in Europe, excepting that of the late French king. It was not only formed at a great expense, but with much care and ability; many foreign medals offered to it having been rejected (A). The other remarkable collections are those of the duke of Devonshire, the earl of Pembroke, Earl Fitzwilliam, formerly the marquis of Rockingham's, the honourable Horace Walpole, the reverend Mr Crackrode, the reverend Mr Southgate, Mr Townley, Mr R. P.\n\n(A) This collection, as well as the rest of Dr Hunter's Museum, is now in the possession of the university of Glasgow, to which it was bequeathed by the doctor's will.\nMEDALS.\n\nOf what R. P. Knight, Mr Edward Knight, Mr Tylon, Mr Barker, Mr Brown, and several others. The British museum and universities in England have also collections; as well as the Advocates library, the Antiquarian Society, and the universities in Scotland.\n\nSECT. IV. Materials of which Medals are constructed.\n\nMedals are formed of gold, silver, and the various modifications of copper. The gold usually made use of in coinage is about the fineness of 22 carats; and as the art of purifying this metal was very much unknown in former times, the most ancient medals are for this reason much more impure than the modern coins. Gold is never found in its native state above 22 carats fine; and the very ancient medals are much under that standard. Many of them are composed of a mixture of gold and silver, called by the ancients electrum. The gold medals were made of much finer metal after Philip of Macedon became possessed of the gold mines of Philippi in Thrace, and the medals of his son Alexander the Great are equally fine; as well as those of some other princes of that age. Those of the Egyptian Ptolemies are of the fineness of 23 carats three grains, with only one grain of alloy. The Roman coins are very pure even from the earliest times; the art of refining gold being well known before any was coined at Rome. Some authors are of opinion, that the Roman coins begin to fall short of their purity after the time of Titus; but Mr Pinkerton denies that any thing of this kind takes place till the time of the emperor Severus; and even then only in a very few instances. Most of the Roman gold was brought from Dalmatia and Dacia, where that metal is still to be met with. A very remarkable circumstance is observed in the eastern part of Hungary, which belonged to the ancient Dacia. It germinates in the vines of Tokay, and is found in their stems; as it is elsewhere in the straw of corn.\n\nPliny informs us, and indeed it is generally known, that gold and silver are found mixed together in the earth. Where the silver amounted to one-fifth part of the gold, the metal was called electrum; but sometimes the quantity of silver was added artificially. The gold was in those days as well as at present refined by means of mercury; and the ancient artists had certainly attained to great perfection in this branch of metallurgy; as Bodin tells us, that the goldsmiths of Paris upon melting one of Vespasian's gold coins found only $\\frac{1}{5}$ part of alloy.\n\nMost of the ancient silver, particularly that of Greece, is less pure than that of succeeding times; even the Roman silver is rather inferior to the present standard, and that from the very beginning; but in the time of Severus, the silver appears very bad, and continues so until the time of Diocletian. Many writers upon this subject have mistaken the denarii aerati, \"coins of brass washed with silver,\" for silver currency. Silver coins are extremely scarce from the time of Claudius Gothicus to that of Diocletian, or from the year 270 to 284; in which short space no fewer than eight emperors reigned. Silver at that time was found mostly in Spain; and the commerce with that country was disturbed by the usurpers who arose in Gaul; and such were the troubles of the times, that not only the silver but also the gold coins of those eight emperors, are extremely scarce. There is still, however, some silver extant of these eight emperors; and it is certain, that copper washed was never used as silver currency, but was entirely a distinct coinage. Occasional deprivations of silver had taken place long before; as Pliny tells us, that Mark Antony mixed iron with his silver denarii; and Mr Pinkerton informs us, that he has seen a denarius of Antony, which was attracted by a magnet.\n\nThe ancient bras coins consist of two kinds: the Ancient red or Cyprian, which indeed is no other than copper; and the common yellow bras. Our author observes, that in the Roman coinage bras was of double the value of copper, and he is of opinion, that it was the fame among the Greeks; and the latter is the metal most commonly made use of in the Greek coinage. The Roman sesterces are always of bras; the middling-sized kind are partly copper and partly bras; the former being double the value of the latter, which are the aes.\n\nMr Pinkerton next proceeds to give an account of Mixed metals used among the Romans. In Britain, all kinds of coins made of mixed metal are without hesitation alleged to be forgeries; although it is certain that the variety of mixed metals used in coinage was very considerable. The most valuable mixture was that of gold or silver, already mentioned, named electrum; the silver commonly amounting to one-fifth part of the gold made use of, or perhaps more. Of this mixture are many of the early coins of Lydia, and some other Asiatic states; also those of the kings of the Bosporus Cimmerius, during the imperial ages of Rome. Next to the electrum were the coins of Corinthian bras; but Mr Pinkerton informs us, that Corinthians did not a single coin was ever struck of this metal by the ancients; it having been constantly employed only in the fabrication of vases or toys. It was in use at any rate only for a very short time; being altogether unknown in the days of Pliny the Elder. Our author therefore ridicules those who pretend not only to find out imperial coins of this metal, but to discover three kinds of it; viz. one in which the gold predominates, another in which the silver prevails, and a third where the bras is most conspicuous. He gives Encius Vico, one of the most ancient writers on medals, as the author of this idea; but whose opinions were confuted by one Savot, a writer in the 17th century. Vico mentions a coin of this kind struck under Augustus, another of Livia, and a third of Claudius. The mistake, he is of opinion, arose from the circumstance of the first propagator not being able to account for the various mixtures and modifications of bras observable in ancient coins of the large size; and which in so common a metal appear very odd to the moderns. Besides the authority of Pliny and other antiquaries of more modern a date, who all declare that they never saw a single medal of Corinthian bras, or of that metal mixed with silver and gold, our author adduces another evidence which he looks upon to be superior to either; viz. that those who have given into this supposition, imagine, that the large pieces called sesterces, and others called dupondiarii, worth about twopence or a penny, are said to have been composed of this precious metal. It is unreasonable to think, that any proportion of gold\ngold or silver could have been made use of in these. The coins said to have been struck upon Corinthian brafs are only done upon a modification of common brafs; of which we know, that in proportion to the quantity of zinc made use of in conjunction with the copper, the metal assumes a variety of hues. On the authority of Pliny he informs us, that the coins mistaken for Corinthian brafs were no other than prince's metal.\n\nThe Egyptian silver coins struck under the Roman emperors are at first of tolerably pure silver; but afterwards degenerate into a mixture of copper and tin with a little silver. They are very thick, but many of them are elegantly struck, with uncommon reverses. There are likewise three sets of brafs coins belonging to this country from the earliest times of the Roman emperors there. Some of these are of bell-metal or pot-metal; and, after the time of Gallienus and Valerian, the coinage of brafs with a small addition of silver becomes authorized by the state; the coins struck upon it being called denarii æret. Those of lead or copper plated with silver have been fabricated by Roman forgers. Some coins of lead, however, have been met with of undoubted antiquity: and an ancient writer informs us, that tin money was coined by Dionysius; but none has been found. The lead coins of Tigranes king of Armenia, mentioned as genuine by Jobert, are accounted forgeries by Mr Pinkerton and other modern medalists. Plautus, however, makes mention of leaden coins, and several of them have been found; but our author looks upon them to have been chiefly effay pieces, struck in order to let the artist judge of the progress of the die. Others are the plated kind already mentioned, fabricated by ancient forgers, but having the plating worn off. A great number of leaden coins are mentioned by Ficorini in a work entitled Piombi Antichi, in which he supposes them to have served as tickets for guests; and coins of the same kind are also mentioned by Passeri. In the work entitled Notitia Imperii Romani, there is mention of coins made of leather, but none of them have ever been found.\n\nSect. V. Of Ancient Money.\n\nIn considering the different sizes, values, &c. of the Greek and Roman coins, our author treats of the medals as money; a knowledge of which, he says, is essentially necessary to every reader of the classics; inasmuch that it may almost dispute the preference with the studies of ancient geography and chronology. Notwithstanding all that has been written upon the subject, however, our author is of opinion, that the science is still in its infancy, in as far as it relates to the real money of the ancients. \"The ideal (says he), which is indeed the most important province of discussion, has been pretty clearly ascertained; and we are almost as well acquainted with the Attic mna or mina, and the perplexing progress of the Roman sestertia, as with our own pounds.\" But with the actual coin of the ancients the case is different; and the ignorance even of the learned in this point is wonderful.\"\n\nOur author now goes on, with great asperity of language, to particularize the ignorant manner in which modern authors have treated the subject of medals. \"Arbuthnot and Clarke (says he), are, if possible, more ignorant of medals than Budéus the very first. The latter professes his love of medals, but quotes a confular coin with the head of Cicero; and looks upon one of the 30 pieces of silver, the reward of the treachery of Judas, and which was said to be preserved among some relics at Paris, to be worthy of reference and commemoration. Arbuthnot, if we may judge from his book, had never seen any ancient coins; and Clarke, it is well known, was quite ignorant of them. The latter, with all his labour, seems even to have known nothing of the theoretic part of the real ancient money. Indeed Dr Mead's catalogue seems to have been almost the only book on medals which had undergone his perusal. On the other hand, the ignorance of medallists on this score is no less profound. To this day they look upon the didrachms of Ægina, so celebrated in antiquity, as tridrachms of Ægium; and upon the early obolus as a brafs coin. In the Roman coins the large brafs is esteemed the as, while it shall be proved that it is the sestertius, and worth four qæs. The denarius is reckoned at ten æs even in the imperial times; whereas it only went at that rate for the first 90 years after the coinage of silver at Rome. The denarius serenus is taken for silver currency; with other mistakes, which evince that medallists are as ignorant of the theory, as the others are of the practice.\"\n\nIn his account of the ancient Greek money, Mr Money first Pinkerton observes, that the light of science, like that coined in the sun, has proceeded from east to west. \"It is the east most probable (says he), that the first invention of money arose like the other arts and sciences; and spread from thence into the western parts of the world. In its first shape it appeared as mere pieces of metal, without any stated form or impression; in lieu of rude state, which, it was regulated by weight. Even down to the Saxon government in England, large sums were regulated by weight; and in our own times every single piece is weighed in gold; though with regard to silver this nicety is not minded, nor indeed does it seem practicable. Among the ancients, whose commercial transactions were less important and extensive than those of the moderns, silver was weighed as well as gold; nay even brafs, in some cases.\n\nIn Greece, large sums were determined by minæ or Greek minæ; and the most capital sums by talents. In every country the mina is supposed to have contained 100 drachme, or small silver coins, of that country, and the talent 60 minæ. The mina is supposed to be a pound weight of the country to which it belonged. The Attic pound, according to Dr Arbuthnot, contained 16 ounces, equal to our avoirdupois pound; but Mr Pinkerton looks upon this as a very absurd opinion, and accuses the doctor of having adopted it merely that he may explain a passage in Livy. He is of opinion, that the Attic pound is very nearly the same with the pound Troy. The mina of Athens had at first 73 drachms; but by Solon it was fixed at 100. The ancient drachm weighed the same which it does at present in medical weight, viz. the eighth part of an ounce. The mina or pound of 12 ounces had consequently 96 of these drachms; but four of them were given to the round sum to supply defects in the alloy; and indeed (says our author), in consequence of a common\ncommon practice in all ages and in all countries, of giving some addition to a large weight. Thus the pound in weight had but 96 drachmae in fact, while the pound in tale had 100; as the Roman libra in weight had but 84 denarii, in tale 108; and as our pound in tale, by an inverse progress, is not a third of our pound in common weight.\n\nNotwithstanding the very severe criticism on Dr Arbuthnot just mentioned, however, we find our author adopting his account of the talents used in coinage in several countries. Thus, according to the doctor,\n\n| The Syrian talent had | 15 Attic minae |\n|-----------------------|---------------|\n| Ptolemaic             | 20            |\n| Antiochian            | 60            |\n| Euboean               | 60            |\n| Babylonian            | 70            |\n| Larger Attic          | 80            |\n| Tyrian                | 80            |\n| Egyptian              | 80            |\n| Aeginean              | 100           |\n| Rhodian               | 100           |\n\nNotwithstanding the concession made here by Mr Pinkerton to the doctor, he tells us, that he very much questions this list of talents, and that many ancient writers are little to be relied upon. \"Writers on this subject confess, that the numbers in all ancient manuscripts are the parts most subject to error, as being almost always contracted. They ought to allow that the authors themselves must often be liable to wrong information.\n\n\"Herodotus mentions, that King Darius ordered gold to be paid into his treasury by the Euboic talent, and silver by the Babylonian. The Euboic is esteemed the same with that called afterwards the Attic; and as we estimate gold by carats, so it is natural to suppose, that the most precious metal would be regulated by the most minute weight. But I confess, I take the Babylonian talent to be the same with that of Aegina. Mr Raper has proved the first coins of Macedon to be upon the standard of Aegina. Now the early Persian coins are upon that very scale, the largest tetradrachms weighing from 430 to 440 grains. Hence it follows, that the Persian silver coins were of the Aeginean standard; and the payment was certainly to be made according to the standard of the money. The larger Attic talent was of 80 lesser minae; because the larger Attic mina was of 16 ounces. The Alexandrian talent, according to Festus, consisted of 12,000 denarii, being the same with that used by the Egyptian kings in their coins; and is shown by Mr Raper to have been the same with the talent of Aegina. Perhaps the whole of the ancient coins of Asia, Africa, Greece, Magna Graecia, and Sicily, are reducible to three talents or standards. 1. That of Aegina, used in most of the more ancient silver coinages; as would seem in even the later of Egypt, Carthage, Cyrene, &c. 2. The Attic (being the Asiatic gold standard, afterwards used by Phidon king of Argos in estimating gold, and called Euboic from Euboea, one of the quarters of the city of Argos), used in Athens and the greater part of the world as the standard both of gold and silver. 3. The Doric or Sicilian talent of 24 nummi, each worth an obolus and an half; whence the talent is estimated at six Attic drachms or three darics. These weights continued to be the standard of money after it began to be distinguished by imposition; nay, to the fall of Greece and prevalence of the Roman empire.\"\n\nCoinage, according to Herodotus, was first invented by the Lydians, from whom the Greeks quickly received it. The former could not have received it from the Persians, whose empire did not begin till 570 B.C., though our author supposes that it might have proceeded from the Syrians, who carried on commerce in very ancient times. The most ancient Greek coins of most ancient Greek silver have an indented mark upon one side, and a tortoise upon the other; and those of greatest antiquity have no letters upon them. Those of later date have ΑΙΤΕΙΩΝ marked upon them, which medallists interpret of Aegium in Achaea; being led into that supposition by the tortoise, which they look upon as the sure mark of the Peloponnesus. But though our author agrees that the tortoise was so, he thinks that they are otherwise very far wrong in their conclusions. Aegium in Achaea was a place of no consequence till the times of Aratus and the Achaean league; but there are 11 of these coins in Dr Hunter's cabinet, which show that they must have been struck in times of the most remote antiquity, and that the place where they were struck was rich and flourishing at the time. The coins we speak of are not common; but those which have the name ΑΙΤΕΙΩΝ at full length, and which may perhaps belong to Aegium in Achaea, are extremely scarce; inasmuch that in all Dr Hunter's vast collection there are not above one or two. They are likewise constructed upon a scale quite different from all other Grecian money; being of 8, 13, 15½, 90, and about 186 grains. The Grecian drachma at an average is 66 grains; and Mr Pinkerton thinks it would have been strange if pieces had been struck of eight-tenths of an obolus, of an obolus and a half, or of a drachma and a half. Aegium being originally an obscure village, could not be the first which coined money; so that Mr Pinkerton supposes the name ΑΙΤΕΙΩΝ to have stood for Aegialus, the ancient name of Sycon, a wealthy and powerful city; or rather Aegina, the mint of which was much celebrated, and perhaps the most ancient in Greece.\n\nOther arguments in favour of these coins being derived from Aegina, are drawn from their weight as well as their workmanship, which are quite different from those bearing the name of Aegium at full length. The coinage of Aegina is known to have been different from that of the rest of Greece; inasmuch that its drachma was worth 10 Attic oboli, while the Attic drachma was valued only at five. Hence the drachmas of Aegina were named by the Greeks παχεῖα, or thick; a name very applicable to the coins in question. From these observations, our author is of opinion, that we may even distinguish the precise weight of the ancient coins of Aegina. According to the exact proportion, the drachma of this place should weigh exactly 110 grains; and one of them very much rubbed weighed above 90. The others of larger size, which seem to be didrachms of Aegina, weigh from 181 to 194 grains; but the latter being the only one he could meet with in good preservation, it was impossible to form any just medium. Even in those best preserved,\nhe thinks that 10 grains may be allowed for a waste of the metal in so long a time as 2400 years, which would bring the drachma of Aegina near its proper standard. The obolus of Aegina was in proportion to its drachma of six oboli. It is the piece of 15½ grains, and 13 when very much rubbed. The hemiobolon is that of eight, but when rubbed it falls short of this weight.\n\nThe drachma is the most general denomination of the Greek money; it is the drachma, or eighth part of an ounce; which to this day is retained in the medical weights, the Grecian coins receiving their names from the weights they bore; though in some instances the weights received their appellations from the coins. The silver drachma, according to Mr Pinkerton, was about ninepence sterling; and he finds fault with those who make the drachma and denarius both equal to one another, the latter being no more than threepence. The didrachm of silver, according to the same calculation, was worth 18d.; but the tridrachm occurs very rarely: and Mr Pinkerton is even of opinion, that medallists give this name to the didrachm of Aegina. The largest of all the Grecian coins is the tetradrachm, which on the Aeginean standard is worth five shillings; but in those of the other states only four. There are, however, many subdivisions in the silver drachma; the highest being the triobolion or coin of four oboli; being in proportion to the drachma as our groat to a sixpence, weighing about 44 grains, and being in value about sixpence. The hemiobolion or triobolion comes next in value, weighing about 33 grains, and worth fourpence halfpenny. The silver diobolion, or third of the drachma, weighs about 22 grains, and is worth threepence. The obolus of silver weighs about 11½ grains, and is worth only three halfpence. There is likewise a hemiobolion in silver, or half the obolus, of five grains and a half, value three farthings: and another called tetraobolion dichalceos or quarter obolus, which is the most minute coin yet met with; and by reason of its extreme smallness, weighing only two grains and a quarter, is now very scarce; but there is one in the cabinet of Dr Hunter, and some more have been lately brought from Athens by Mr Stuart. Some of them are likewise met with at Tarentum. It would appear, however, that there were some still smaller, and of value only three-fourths of a farthing. None of these have been met with; and the smallness of the size renders it improbable that any will ever be met with; as the peasants, who commonly discover coins, would probably either not observe them at all, or if they did, would neglect them as things of no value.\n\nMany different names have been imposed on the coins belonging to the different states of Greece: thus Koep, the maiden, was a name often applied to the tetradrachm, and which would seem to apply to those of Athens; though there are coins of other cities with the head of Proserpine, and the word Koep, to which it would appear more applicable in our author's opinion. Khaon, the bull, was the name of another coin, from its type. A Sicilian coin was named Damaegetos, from Gelen's wife. A tetradrachm was named Kepantakos, and had eight oboli or hemiobolions. The Tereus, so called from its country Troizene, had Pallas on one side and a trident on the reverse.\n\nThe hemiobolion was the πιλατος of Lacedemon; and Ancient Money. the καρυκες is supposed to have been equal to the Roman sextertius or quarter drachma. The cyzicopori were coins with the mystic chest or hamper of Bacchus upon them, out of which a serpent rises; and are much celebrated in antiquity. We are told by Livy, that Marcus Acilius, in his triumph over Antiochus and the Etruscans, carried off 248,000 of them; Cnecus Manlius Vullo in that over Gallo-Grecia had 250,000; and Lucius Emilius Regillus, in his naval triumph over the fleets of Antiochus, had 131,300. Cicero likewise mentions his being possessed of a vast sum in them. The most probable opinion concerning them seems to be, that they are all silver tetradrachms; such as belong to the cities of Apamea and Laodicea in Phrygia; Pergamus in Mytilene; Sardis and Tralles in Lydia; and Ephesus: but it is a mistake to ascribe any to Crete. Mr Pinkerton thinks it absurd to imagine that Crete, a small island, should strike such vast numbers of coins; though Cicero mentions his being in possession of an immense treasure in them at the time he was governor of Asia Minor. \"It is most likely (says Mr Pinkerton), that his wealth should be in the coin of the country to which he belonged. But what had these triumphs or Cicero's government to do with Cretan money? But indeed the coins themselves, as above noticed, establish the fact.\"\n\nAnother set of coins famous in antiquity were those coins of Cyzicus in Mytilene, which were of gold; but they Cyzicus are now almost entirely vanished by being recoined in other forms. The Αγριανον νομισμα, or money of Agrigentum, who was made governor of Egypt by Cambyses, is made mention of by Hesychius; but none of them, as far as is known, have reached our times. They must have been marked with Persian characters, if with any. The coin of Queen Philistis is mentioned by the same writer, and many of these pieces are still extant; but we know not where this queen reigned, nor does there seem to be any method of finding it out. Mr Pinkerton inclines to believe, that the prefect over Sicily; and as a confirmation of that supposition, mentions some inscriptions of ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΑΣ ΦΙΛΙΠΠΟΣ or the Gradini of the theatre at Syracuse; but which appear not older than the Roman times. Some authors are of opinion, that she reigned in Cosara or Malta; which our author thinks much more improbable.\n\nThe most particular attention with regard to the Athenian names and standard of coins is due to those of Athens; coins, and it is remarkable, that most of them which have reached us are of a very late period, with the names of magistrates inscribed upon them. Some of these bear the name of Mithridates; and few are older than the era of that prince; who, it is well known, took the city of Athens in his war with the Romans. I suspect (says Mr Pinkerton), that no Athenian coins of silver are posterior to Sylla's infamous destruction of that city; an event the more remarkable, as Sallust tells us, that Sylla was learned in Greek. Indeed Caligula, Nero, and most of the pests of society, have been learned men, in spite of a noted axiom of Ovid,\n\nSed ingenuas didicisse feliciter artes\nEmollit mores, nec finit effe feros.\n\nIt is still more remarkable, that the fabric of Athenian\nnian coins is almost universally very rude: a singular circumstance, if we reflect how much the arts flourished there. It can only be accounted for from the excellence of their artists being such as to occasion all the good ones to be called into other countries, and none but the bad left at home. In like manner, the coins struck at Rome in the imperial times are excellent, as being done by the best Greek artists; while those of Greece, though famous at that time for producing miraculous artists, are during that period commonly of very mean execution. The opulence of Athens in her days of glory was very great; owing in an eminent degree to her rich commerce with the kingdoms on the Euxine sea, carried on chiefly from Delos, which belonged to Athens, and was the grand centre of that trade.\" Hence it has become matter of surprise to Neumann, that when there are so many coins of Mycene, an island even proverbially poor, there should be none of Delos. But Mr Pinkerton accounts for this from Mycene's being a free state, and Delos subject to Athens. \"It may be well supposed (says he), that Athens had a mint at Delos; and such Athenian coins as have symbols of Apollo, Diana, or Latona, were struck in this island.\"\n\nThe copper money of the Greeks is next in antiquity to the silver. Mr Pinkerton is of opinion, that it was not used at Athens till the 26th year of the Peloponnesian war; about 404 years before Christ, and 300 after silver was first coined there. The first copper coins were those of Gelo of Syracuse, about 490 B.C.\n\nThe chalcos of brass, of which eight went to the silver obolus, seems to have been the first kind of Greek coin. At first it was looked upon as of so little consequence, that it became proverbial; and to say that a thing was not worth a chalcos, was equivalent to saying that it was worth nothing. As the Greeks became poor, however, even this diminutive coin was subdivided into two, four, nay eight lepta or small coins; but our author censures very severely those who have given an account of those divisions. \"Pollux, and Suidas copying from him (says he), tell us, that there were seven lepta to one chalcos; a number the most unlikely that can be, from its indivisibility and incapacity of proportion.\n\nPollux lived in the time of Commodus, so was too late to be of the smallest authority: Suidas is four or five centuries later, and out of the question. Pliny tells us, that there were ten chalci to the obolus; Diodorus and Cleopatra that there were six; Ifidorus says there were four: and if such writers differ about the larger denomination, we may well imagine that the smaller equally varied in different states; an idea supported by these undeniable witnesses, the coins which remain. Most of the Greek copper coin which has reached our times consists of chalci; the lepta being so small as to be much more liable to be lost.\" In Dr Hunter's cabinet, however, there are several of the dilepta of Athens: and from being stamped with the representation of two owls, seem to be the same with the silver diobolus: \"a circumstance (says Mr Pinkerton), of itself sufficient to confute Pollux; for a dilepton can form no part of seven; a number indeed which never appeared in any coinage of the same metals, and is contradictory to common sense. It may be observed, that the whole brass coins of Athens published by Dr Combe are reducible to four sizes, which may be the lepton, dilepton, teiralepton or hemichalcos, and chalcos. The first is not above the size of one of King Lepton, James I.'s farthing tokens; the last about that of our dilepton, common farthing.\" The lepta was also called xiphoi, &c., as being change for the poor. The xiphoi, perhaps so called from the figure of a wolf upon it, was the coin of a particular state, and if of brass must have weighed three chalci. The other names of the copper coins of Greece are but little known. Lycurgus ordered iron money to be coined at Sparta; but perishable is this metal, that none of that kind of money has reached our times.\n\nAfter the conquest of Greece by the Romans, most of the coins of that country diminished very much in their value, the gold coinage being totally discontinued: though some of the barbarous kings who used the Greek character were permitted to coin gold, but they used the Roman model; and the standard used by the few cities in Asia who spoke the Greek language in the times of the emperors is entirely unknown. Copper seems to have been the only metal coined at that time by the Greeks themselves; and that upon the Roman standard, then universal through the empire, that there might be no impediment to the circulation of currency. They retained, however, some of their own terms, using them along with those of the Romans. The assarion or assarium of Rome, the name of the diminished as, being 16 to the drachma or denarius, the obolus was so much diminished in value as to be struck in brass not much larger than the old chalcus, and valued at between two and three assaria; which was indeed its ancient rate as to the drachma. This appears from the copper coins of Chios, which have their names marked upon them. The brass obolus, at first equal in size to the Roman sestertius or large brass, lessens by degrees to about the size of a silver drachma. From the badness of the imperial coinage in Greece also, it appears that brass was very scarce in that country, as well as in all the cities using the Greek characters; being found mostly in the western countries of the Roman empire. The Era of the time of this declension in size of the Greek coins is declension by Mr Pinkerton supposed to have been from A.D. 150, the copper obolus, at first above the size of large brass, was used in Greece about the time of its first subjection to Rome; and that the lepta ceasing, the chalci came in their room, with the dichalcus and the hemibolion of brass.\n\nWith respect to the gold coins of the Greeks, Mr Gold coins Pinkerton is of opinion that none of that metal was of Greece, coined before the time of Philip of Macedon, as none have reached our times prior to the reign of that monarch. From a passage in Thucydides our author concludes, that in the beginning of the Peloponnesian war the Athenians had no gold coin. Mentioning the treasure in the Acropolis or citadel of Athens, at the commencement of that war, the historian mentions silver coin, and gold and silver in bullion; and had any of the gold been in coin, he would certainly have mentioned it. Philip began his reign about 68 years after the beginning of the Peloponnesian war; and we can scarce suppose that any city would have preceeded\nceded the elegant and wealthy Athens in the coining of gold.\n\nNotwithstanding, however, this deficiency of gold coin among the Greeks, it is certain that the coinage of gold had taken place in Sicily long before; as we have gold coins of Gelo about 491 B.C. of Hiero I., 478, and of Dionysius I. in 404, all using the Greek characters; though not to be ranked among the gold coins of Greece, as Philip caused his to be. Gold coins of Syracuse even appear of the third class of antiquity, or with an indented square, and a small figure in one of its segments. Gold coins are used in the cities of Brettium, Tarentum, and throughout Magna Graecia; also in Panticapaeum in Thrace, and likewise Eusa in that country; but not in Tuscany, as is commonly believed, though Neumann proves that they were struck by Brutus, and are unquestionably as ancient as the Greek coins. The Thebans and Athenians probably coined the first gold after Philip had set them the example, and when they were attempting to resist the projects of that enterprising monarch. The Aetolians probably coined their gold during the time of their greatest power, about a century after Philip, and when they were combating the power of Aratus and the Achaean league. \"There is (says Mr Pinkerton) but one ἐπικοίνωνις of Thebes, much worn, in Dr Hunter's cabinet, and weighing but 59 grains; and perhaps not above two or three χεῖροι or gold didrachms of Athens in the world; one of which is also in the collection of Dr Hunter, and weighs 132½ grains. It appears to be more modern than the reign of Philip. That monarch having got possession of the mines of Philippi in Thrace, improved them so much, that they produced him annually above a thousand talents of gold, or 2,880,000l. of our money. From this gold the first coins named from the monarch, Philippus, were struck. They were marked with his portrait; and for many ages after were so numerous, that they were common in the Roman empire; whence the name Philippus became at length common to gold, silver, and at last even brass coins of their size. Even in the time of Philip gold was very scarce in Greece; but after the Phocians had plundered the temple of Delphos, this precious metal which had been valued as gems, and consecrated only to the decoration of the temples of the gods, began to be known among the Greeks. The comparative value of gold and silver, however, seem to have been at that time very different from what they are now. Herodotus values gold at 13 times its weight in silver; Plato in his Hipparchus at 12; and even the low value of 10 to 1 seems to have been the stated value in Greece, though in Rome the plenty of silver from the Spanish mines made the value of gold to be much higher; and there is no reason to think that it was ever valued in that city at less than 12 times its weight in silver. The Philippus χεῖροι, gold piece, or flater, is a didrachm, and is the most common of all the ancient coins. Mr Pinkerton is of opinion that it went for 20 silver drachms on its first appearance; but in latter times for 25 Greek drachmas or Roman denarii. There are proofs of the Philippus being didrachms, both from the writings of ancient authors and from numbers of the coins themselves, which remain to this day; and that the χεῖροι, or principal gold coin of Greece, was of the same weight, is also evident from ancient writings. It was anciently worth about 15s. but valuing gold now at the medium price of 4l. per ounce, it is worth about 20s. The ἐπικοίνωνις, or half the former coin, scarcely occurs of the coinage of Philip and Alexander, though it does of Hiero I. of Syracuse and of King Pyrrhus. It palled for ten silver drachmas, and was valued only at 7s. 6d. though now worth 10s. There was another division of this kind worth about 5s. There were besides some lesser divisions of gold coins, which could not be worth above two drachmas. These were coined in Cyrene; and there were besides several old gold coins of Asia Minor, the value of which is now unknown. Our author supposes that they were coined not with relation to their weight as parts of the drachma, but merely to make them correspond with too many silver pieces as was necessary. There are also larger coins than the χεῖροι, the ἐπικοίνωνις of Alexander and Lydius being double its value. Some others are met with of Lydius, Antiochus III. and some of the Egyptian monarchs, weighing four times the χεῖροι, and now worth about 4l. sterling. Some weigh even more; but this our author supposes owing to a difference in the purity of the gold.\n\nIn Rome, as well as in Greece, the money was at Roman first estimated by weight; and the first metal coined money, by that people was copper, silver being long unknown in Rome; nor is it certainly known that any silver has ever been found in the Italian mines. In Rome the first valuation of money was by the libra gravis argiri, or pound of heavy brass; and in the progress of their conquests, the little silver and gold that came in their way was regulated by the same standard, as appears from the story of Brennus. The weights made of the Rose of were the same with those which continue to this man pound, day. The pound consisted of 12 ounces of 458 grains each; but the pound by which the money was weighed appears to have consisted only of 420 grains to the ounce, or to have contained in all 5040 grams. This became the standard of copper; and when silver came to be coined, seven denarii went to the ounce as eight drachmas did in Greece. Gold was regulated by the scrupulum or scrupulus, the third part of a denarius, and by the larger weights just mentioned. The number 10 was at first used by the Romans in counting their money; but finding afterwards that a smaller number was more convenient, they divided it into quarters; and as the quarter of 10 is 2½, they for this reason bestowed upon it the name of sestertius or \"half Sesterius,\" the third;\" to express that it was two of any weights, measures, &c. and half a third; whence the sestertius came at last to be the grand estimate of Roman money. The as being at first the largest, and indeed the only Roman coin, the word sestertius means sestertius ar, or \"two ases and an half.\" On the first coining of silver, the denarius of ten ases was struck in the most common and convenient denary division of money, or that by tens; the sestertius being of course two ases and an half. But the denarius being afterwards estimated at 16 ases, the name sestertius was still applied to a quarter of the denarius, though it now contained four ases. The term sestertius was applied to all sums not exceeding 1000 sestertii, or 8l. 6s. 8d.; but for greater sums the mode of the sestertius was likewise altered, though not to exclude the former. Very large sums\nAncient sums of money were estimated by the hundred weight of brafs; for the Romans were at first unacquainted with the talent. The hundred weight, by way of eminence, was distinguished by the name of pondus, and felfertium pondus became a phrase for two hundred weight and an half. Mr Pinkerton is of opinion, that we may value the as libralis of ancient Rome at about eightpence English. Estimating the as therefore at a pound weight, the felfertium pondus was equal to 1000 felfertii, or 8l. 6s. 8d.; and by coincidence which our author supposes to have been the effect of design, as soon as the silver coinage appeared, the felfertium centum denariorum was always equal to 8l. 6s. 8d. also. The word felfertium itself, however, seems to have been unknown prior to the coinage of silver money at Rome: the pondera gravis eris being sufficient before that time for all the purposes of a state in which money was so scarce. But however this may be, the pondus or hundred weight of brafs was precisely worth 100 denarii, or a pound of silver.* As the great felfertium was always valued at 1000 of the smaller, or 8l. 6s. 8d. we never find one felfertium mentioned in authors, but two, three, or more; ten thousand of them being equal to 83,333l. 6s. 8d.\n\nThe states from which the Romans may be supposed first to have derived their coinage, were the Etruscans and the Greek colonies in Magna Graecia and Sicily. Joseph Scaliger, Gronovius, &c. contend that it was from the Sicilians that the Romans first derived their knowledge of money; but Mr Pinkerton argues that it was from the Etruscans. In confirmation of his opinion, he appeals to the state of the Roman territories in the time of Servius Tullius, who is looked upon to have been the first who coined money at Rome. At that time the whole Roman dominion did not extend beyond ten miles round the city; and was entirely surrounded by the Etruscan and Latin states; Cumae being the next Greek colony to it that was of any consequence, and which was in the neighbourhood of Naples, at about the distance of 150 miles. Our author asks, Is it reasonable to think that the Romans received the use of money from the Etruscans and Latins who were their neighbours, or from the Greeks, who were at a distance, and at that time, as far as appears from their history, absolutely unknown to them? \"If this argument (adds he), is strong with regard to the nearest Grecian colonies, what must it be with respect to Sicily, an island 300 miles distant from Rome, where it was not known, at that time, if a boat went by land or water?\" Arguments, however, for this opinion have been derived from the similarity between the Sicilian and Roman coins; which Mr Pinkerton now proceeds to examine. The Greek pound in Sicily was called λίρα, and consisted, like the Roman, of 12 στεράγματα, or ounces; and Mr Pinkerton grants that the Roman libra was derived from the Greek λίρα, but denies that the as, or libra, a coin, was from Sicilian model. The Sicilians had indeed a coin named λίρα; but it was of silver, and of equal value to the Αἰγύπτιον standard, ten of which went to the Sicilian διαλυτήριον. He differs from Gronovius, that the standard of Αἰγύπτιον was used at Corinth, and of course at Syracuse; and it appears from Aristotle, that the Sicilians had a talent or standard of their own. The Sicilian obolus or λίρα contained all fo 12 ounces or χαλκί, so named at first because they weighed an ounce weight; but the στεράγματα of Hiero weigh more than a Troy ounce; and the brafs coins of Agrigentum are marked with cyphers as far as six: the largest weighing only 186 grains, or about one-third of the primitive ounce. Our author denies that even the Roman denarius took its rise from the Sicilian διαλυτήριον, as many authors assert. Were this the case, it would have weighed 180 grains; whereas the Roman denarii are not above the third part of the quantity.\n\nFrom all these considerations, our author is of opinion that the Sicilians borrowed the division of their Sicilian λίρα from the Etruscans, or possibly from the Romans themselves; which our author thinks is more probable than that the Romans had it from Sicily. The strongest argument, however, against the Roman coinage being borrowed from the Sicilian is, that though great numbers of Sicilian coins are to be found in the cabinets of medallists, yet none of them resemble the as libralis of the Romans in any degree. In most cabinets also there are Etruscan coins upon the exact scale of the as libralis, and several of its divisions; from whence Mr Pinkerton concludes, that \"these, and these alone, must have afforded a pattern to the primitive Roman coinage.\" The Etruscans were a colony from Lydia, to which country Herodotus ascribes the first invention of coinage. \"Those colonists (says Mr Pinkerton), upon looking round their settlements, and finding that no silver was to be had, and much less gold,\" supplied the mercantile medium with copper; to which the case of Sweden is very similar, which, as late as the last century, had copper coins of such magnitude, that wheelbarrows were used to carry off a sum not very considerable.\n\nSome coins are found which exceed the as libralis in weight; and these are supposed to be prior to the time of Servius Tullius. Some of them are met with of 34 man coins, and of 53 Roman ounces; having upon one side the figure of a bull rudely impressed, and upon the other the bones of a fish. They are most commonly found at Tuder, or Tudertum, in Umbria; but they appear always broken at one end: so that Mr Pinkerton is of opinion that perhaps some might be struck of the decussis form, or weighing ten pounds. These pieces, in our author's opinion, make it evident, that the Romans derived their large brafs coins from the Etruscans and the neighbouring states: they are all cast in moulds; and the greater part of them appear much more ancient than the Roman ases, even such as are of the greatest antiquity.\n\nMr Pinkerton agrees with Sir Isaac Newton as to the time that Servius Tullius reigned in Rome, which he supposes to be about 460 B.C. His coinage seems to have been confined to the as, or piece of brafs having the impression of Janus on the one side, and the prow of a ship on the other; because Janus arrived in Italy by sea. Varro, however, informs us, that the very first coins of Tullius had the figure of a bull or other cattle upon them, like the Etruscan coins, of which they were imitations. Those with the figure of Janus and the prow of a ship upon them may be supposed first to have appeared about 400 B.C. but in a short time, various subdivisions of the as were coined. The Subdivided semis, or half, is commonly stamped with the head of Jupiter.\nJupiter laureated; the triens or third, having four cyphers, as being originally of four ounces weight, has the head of Minerva; the quadrans or quarter, marked with three cyphers, has the head of Hercules wrapt in the lion's skin; the sextans or sixth, having only two cyphers, is marked with the head of Mercury with a cap and wings; while the uncia having only one cypher, is marked with the head of Rome. All these coins appear to have been cast in moulds, by a considerable number at a time; and in the British museum there are four of them all united together as taken out of the mould in which perhaps dozens were cast together. In process of time, however, the smaller divisions were struck instead of being cast; but the larger still continued to be cast until the as fell to two ounces. Even after this time it was still called libra, and accounted a pound of copper; though there were now larger denominations of it coined, such as the bissas or double as; treffris and quadrufliss of three and four ases; nay, as far as decussis or ten ases, marked X. Olivier mentions one in his own cabinet weighing upwards of 25 ounces, and cast when the as was about three ounces weight. There is likewise in the Museum Etruscum a decussis of 40 Roman ounces, cast when the as was at four ounces. There was likewise a curious decussis in the Jesuits library at Rome, for which an English medallist offered 20l.; but it was seized by the pope along with every other thing belonging to the society.\n\nMr Pinkerton contests the opinion of Pliny that the as continued of a pound weight till the end of the first Punic war. His opinion (he says), is confirmed by the coins which still remain; and it appears probable to him that the as decreased gradually in weight; and, from one or two of the pieces which still exist, he seems to think that the decrease was slow, as from a pound to eleven ounces, then to ten, nine, &c.; but neither the as nor its parts were ever correctly fixed. During the time of the second Punic war, when the Romans were sore pressed by Hannibal; the as was reduced to a single ounce. It is said to have taken place in the 215th year before our era, being about 36 years after the former change. This as libralis, with the face of Janus upon it, is the form most commonly met with previous to its being reduced to two ounces. Our author supposes that the as libralis continued for at least a century and a half after this coinage of Tullius, down to 300 B.C. about the year of Rome 452, between which and the 502nd year of Rome a gradual diminution of the as to two ounces must have taken place. The following table of the dates of the Roman coinage is given by Mr Pinkerton.\n\n| As libralis with Janus and the prow of a ship | 400 |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----|\n| As of ten ounces                             | 300 |\n| Eight                                       | 290 |\n| Six                                         | 280 |\n| Four                                        | 270 |\n| Three                                       | 260 |\n| Two, according to Pliny                     | 250 |\n| One, according to the same author           | 214 |\n| About 175 B.C., also, we are informed by Pliny, |     |\n\nthat the as was reduced to half an ounce by the Papyrian law, at which it continued till the time of Pliny himself, and long after.\n\nAfter the Romans began to have an intercourse with Greece, a variety of elegant figures appear upon the parts of the as, though not on the as itself till after the time of Sylla. Towards the latter end of the republic also, dupondii, or double ases, were coined, together with the sestertii aurei, which came in place of the quadruplex, when the denarius began to be reckoned at 16 ases; probably at the time the latter was reduced to half an ounce. In some instances it is to be observed, the Greek that the Romans accommodated their coins to the count-scale money where their army was stationed; whence we have so many coins marked as Roman, which have been coined in Magna Graecia and Sicily, and are evidently upon the Greek and not the Roman scale. In the latter part of the republican times, also, the types begin to vary; so that we have a bras coin supposed to be struck by Sextus Pompeius in Sicily, having upon it a double head of that warrior, representing a Janus. Mr Pinkerton supposes it to have been a dupondius; which indeed appears to be the case from the double head. This coin is of copper, and still weighs an ounce, notwithstanding its antiquity.\n\nThe largest imperial copper coin was the sestertius, of the value worth about twopence of our money. Mr Pinkerton censures severely the opinion of other medallists, all of whom lay that the sestertius was of silver. \"In fact (says he), it would be as rational in any antiquary, a thousand years hence, to contend that the halfpenny and farthing are of silver, because they were so in the reign of Henry VIII.\" In confirmation of his own opinion, he quotes the following passage from Pliny: \"The greatest glory of bras is now due to the Marian, called also that of Cordova. This, after the Livian, most absorbs the lapis calaminaris, and imitates the goodness of native orichalcum in our sestertii and dupondiarii, the ases being contented with their own copper.\" Gronovius confesses that he does not know what to make of this passage, and that it causes him hesitate in his opinion. The Livian mine mentioned here by Pliny, is supposed to have got its name from Livia the wife of Augustus; and it is probable that the pieces marked with her portrait, entitled Justitia, Salus, Virtus, &c. were dupondii from this very mine, the metal being exceedingly fine, and of the kind named Corinthian bras by the ancient medallists. \"Perhaps (says Mr Pinkerton), the mine received its name from this very circumstance of her coins being struck in the metal taken from it.\"\n\nNo change took place in the Roman coinage from the time that the as fell to half an ounce to the days of Pliny: but Mr Pinkerton observes, that before the time of Julius Caesar yellow bras began to be used, and was always looked upon to be double the value of Cyprian or red copper. There are but few coins in large bras immediately before Julius Caesar, or even belonging to that emperor; but from the time of Augustus downward, the large coins are all found of bras, and not one of them copper. The largest of what are called the middle size are all of yellow bras; and the next size, which is the as, and weighs half an ounce, is universally copper. What the ancients named\nAncient med orichalcum, or what we call brafs, was always looked upon to be greatly superior in value to the as; Cyprus. Procopius speaking of a statue of Justinian, tells us, that brafs inferior in colour to gold is almost equal in value to silver. The mines of native brafs were very few in number, and were owing entirely to the singular combination of copper and lapis calaminaris in the bowels of the earth, which very seldom occurs; and the ancients were far from being well acquainted with the method of combining these two bodies artificially; so that yellow brafs was always esteemed at double the value of copper; and hence, in the ancient coinages, the brafs and copper pieces were kept as distinct as those of gold and silver.\n\nMr Pinkerton challenges himself the discovery that the imperial festerius was of brafs; and is at considerable pains to bring proofs of it. Besides the testimony of Pliny, which of itself would be decisive, this is supported by the strongest collateral evidence of other authors. From a passage in Julius Africanus, who wrote the Tertius, or Treatise on Medicine, it appears that the nummus, or festerius, weighed an ounce, and of consequence that it could not be silver but brafs; and all the large imperial Roman coins weigh an ounce. We know not the age in which Julius Africanus lived; and as he makes the denarius to contain 16 ases, he must have been before the age of Gallienus, when it had 60. Gronovius supposes him to have been the same mentioned by Eusebius. This author speaks of a Julius Africanus who lived in the time of Hellogabalus, and whom Mr Pinkerton supposes to have been the same with him above-mentioned.\n\nThe festerius underwent no change till the time of Alexander Severus, when it was diminished by one-third of its weight. Trajan Decius was the first who coined double festerii, or quinarii, of brafs; but from the time of Trebonianus Gallus to that of Gallienus, when the first brafs ceased, the festerius does not weigh above the third part of an ounce; the larger coins are accounted double festerii; and after the time of Gallienus it totally vanishes. In the times of Valerian and Gallienus we find a new kind of coinage, mentioned by the name of denarii aurei, or Philippus aurei. Two sizes of denarii began to be used in the time of Caracalla; the larger of six festerii, or 24 assaria; the smaller of four festerii, or 16 assaria as usual. In the time of Pupienus, the latter was reduced to such a small size as not to weigh more than 36 grains; though in Caracalla's time it weighed 60. After the time of Gordian III., the smaller coin fell into disuse, as breeding confusion. The larger denarius of six festerii, though diminished at last to the size of the early denarius, still retained its value of six festerii, or 24 assaria. The Philippus aureus came at length in place of the festerius. It was also called denarius; from which we may learn not only their size, but that they were in value ten assaria as the first denarius. In the reign of Diocletian, the place of the festerius was supplied by the follis, that emperor having restored the silver coin to its purity, and likewise given this form to the copper; but it would seem that this restoration of the coinage only took place towards the end of his reign; whence we have but few of his silver coins, and still fewer of the follis, though the denarius aureus continue quite common down to the time of Constantine. The follis of Diocletian seems to have weighed above half an ounce; and Mr Pinkerton is of opinion, that Diocletian designed this coin to supply the place of the denarius aureus; which of course was worth ten assaria, and five of them went to the silver denarius. From this time the assarium diminishes to the size of 30 grains; and soon after the follis appeared, the denarius aureus was entirely dropped, the former having gradually supplied its place. Some mints appear to have retained the use of the denarius longer than others; and in some the change was preceded, and gradually brought in, by raising the follis with silver or tin, as the denarius had formerly been. Pieces of this kind occur in the times of Diocletian, Maximian I. and II. and Constantius I.; that is, for about ten years after the follis made its appearance. Some countries, however, retained the denarius aureus; others the follis; and some had a medium between the two, or the follis raised in imitation of the denarius.\n\nTowards the end of the reign of Constantine I., a new coinage was introduced throughout the whole empire. The follis coined by this prince was of half an ounce weight; 24 of them going to the milliarenum. The word follis signifies also a purse, in which sense we sometimes find it mentioned in the Byzantine history. The common follis of silver, when it occurs by itself, means a purse of 250 milliarenes, as the festerius was 250 denarii; and by a law of Constantine I., every man paid to the state a follis or purse according to his income. The method of counting by purses continues in Turkey to this day.\n\nThe dupondius was only half the value of the festerius, or about one penny sterling; and before the pontificate of Julius Caesar, yellow brafs appeared it seems to have been struck upon copper, and double the size of the as. There are some of this coin, struck in the time of Julius Caesar, in yellow brafs, weighing half an ounce, with a head of Venus Victrix upon one side; on the reverse, a female figure, with serpents at her feet: while others have a Victory on the reverse, with Q. Oppius Pr. After the time of Augustus, the dupondius was struck in yellow brafs; which Pliny tells us was also the case in his time. The word dupondiarus seems to have been used by Pliny, and adopted, not to express that the coin was dupondius, but that it was of dupondial value. Neither was the former word confined to signify double weight, but was used also for double length or measure, as in the instance of dupondius pes, or two feet, &c. In the imperial times, therefore, dupondius was used, not to signify a coin of double the weight of the as, but of double the value. It was one of the most common of the Roman coins; and seems to have been very common even in Constantinople. In the time of Justinian, it seems there was a custom of nicknaming young students of the law dupondii, against which the emperor made a law; but it is not known what gave rise to the name. The dupondius, though of the same size with the as, is commonly of finer workmanship, the metal being greatly superior in value. It continues to be of yellow brafs, as well as the festerius, to the time of Gallienus; but the as is always in copper.\n\nThe imperial as, or assarium, was worth only a halfpenny.\nhalfpenny. At first it weighed half an ounce, and was always of copper till the time of Gallienus, when it was made of brass, and weighed only the eighth part of an ounce. From the time of Gallienus to that of Diocletian, it continued to diminish still more, the size being then twenty to an ounce. This was the same with the lepta, or smallest coins but the nummus, which weighed only ten grains.\n\nThe parts of the as occur but seldom; which may, indeed, be well expected, considering the low value of it; though there still occur some of those called semis, triens, quadrans, sextans, and uncia, coined in the times of Nero and Domitian. There is no small brass from the time of Pertinax to that of Gallienus, excepting that of Trajan Decius; but in the time of Gallienus it becomes extremely common; and the coins of small brass, as well as the larger, are always marked S.C. such as want it being universally accounted forgeries, and were plated with silver, though the plating be now worn off. The small pieces struck for slaves during the time of the satura, must also be distinguished from the parts of the as. The S.C. upon these most probably signifies Saturni Confutto, and were struck in ridicule of the true coins, as the slaves on that occasion had every privilege of irony.\n\nThe sestertius diminishes from Pertinax to Gallienus so fast, that no parts of the as are struck, itself being so small. Trajan Decius, indeed, coined some small pieces, which went for the semis of the time. The small brass coins under Gallienus were called affaria, sixty of which went to the silver denarius. They are about the size of the denarius, and some of them occur in the coinage of Gallus and his family, of half that size, which appear to have been struck during the latter part of his reign, when the affarium was diminished to a still smaller size. It is probable, however, that some of these very small coins had been struck in all ages of the empire, in order to scatter among the people on solemn occasions. Mr Pinkerton is of opinion that they are the miliaria, though most other medallists think that they are medallions. \"But if so (says our author), they were certainly called miliaria a non mitiendo; for it would be odd if fine medallions were scattered among the mob. It is a common custom just now to strike counters to scatter among the populace on such occasions, while medals are given to peers of the kingdom; and we may very justly reason from analogy on this occasion.\"\n\nThe affarian or lepton of the Constantinopolitan empire was, as we have already observed, one of the smallest coins known in antiquity, weighing no more than 20 grains; and the nummia were the very smallest which have reached our times, being only one half of the former. By reason of their extreme smallness, they are very scarce; but Mr Pinkerton informs us, that he has in his possession a fine one of Theodosius II., which has on it the emperor's head in profile. Theodosius P.F.A.V.; on the reverse a wreath, having in the centre VOT.XX.:MULT.XXX.\n\nThe principal coin of the lower empire was the follis, which was divided into an half and quarter, named bisseptem and tergat; the latter of which is shown by Du Cange to have been a small brass coin, as the other is supposed to have been by Mr Pinkerton.—Besides these, the follis was divided into eight oboli, 16\n\naffaria or lepta, and 32 nummia, though in common computation it contained 40 of these last. This coin, notwithstanding so many divisions, was of no more value than a halfpenny.\n\nMr Pinkerton controverts an opinion, common among medallists, that the largest brass coin or follis of the lower empire had 40 small coins, expressed by the letter M upon it; the next had 30, expressed by the letter A; the half by the letter K; and the quarter marked I, which contained only 10. Mr Pinkerton informs us, that he has three coins of Anastasius, all marked M in large; one of them weighs more than half an ounce; the second 40 grains less; and the third of 160 grains, or one third of an ounce; but the size is so very unequal, that the last, which is very thick, does not appear above half the size of the first. There are pieces of Justinian which weigh a whole ounce; but the size of copper was increased as the silver became scarcer; and the value of the coinage cannot be deduced from the weight of the coins, as it is plain that our own coinage is not of half the value with regard to the metal. A great number of medallions were struck by Constantius II., but there is no other copper larger than the half ounce, excepting that of Anastasius, when the follis began to be struck larger. All medallists allow the others to be medallions.\n\nThe metal employed in these very small coins, though at first of brass, was always a base and refuse kind; but copper is generally made use of in the parts of the as from the earliest times to the latest; and if brass be sometimes employed, it is never such as appears in the sesterces and dupondiarii, which is very fine and beautiful, but only the refuse. \"Yellow brass of the right sort (says Mr Pinkerton), seems totally to have ceased in the Roman coinage with the sesterces, under Gallienus, though a few small coins of very bad metal appear under that hue as late as Julian II.\"\n\nSilver was coined in Rome only as late as the 48th year of the city, or 266 B.C. Varro indeed speaks of silver having been coined by Servius Tullius, and the libella having been once in silver; but Pliny's authority must be accounted of more weight than that of this author, as he mistakes the λευκα of Sicily for Roman coins, having been current at Rome during the time of the first Punic war. Even Pliny, according to our author, very frequently mistakes with regard to matters much antecedent to his own time; and among the moderns he criticizes severely Erasmus and Hume. \"Erasmus (says he), who had been in England for some time, talks of leaden money being used here.\" Not even a leaden token was struck in the reign of Henry VIII.; yet his authority has been followed with due deference to so great a name; for how could Erasmus, who must have seen the matter with his own eyes, assert a direct falsehood? To give a later instance in a writer of reputation, Mr Hume, in Vol. VI. of his history, has these words, in treating of the reign of James I. \"It appears that copper halfpence and farthings began to be coined in this reign. Tradesmen had commonly carried on their retail business by leaden tokens. The small silver penny was soon lost; and at this time was nowhere to be found.\" Copper halfpence and farthings were not struck till Charles II. 1672; there were small tokens\nfor farthings struck in copper by James I. but not one for the halfpenny. The silver farthings had ceased with Edward VI. but the silver halfpence continued the sole coins till Charles II. It was by copper tokens that small business was carried on. The silver penny was much used till the end of the reign of George I.; and so far from being nowhere to be found, is superabundant of every reign since that period, not excepting even the present reign of George III. From these instances the reader may judge how strangely writers of all ages blunder, when treating a subject of which they are entirely ignorant.\"\n\nThe first silver denarii coined at Rome, are supposed by our author to have been those which are impressed with the ROMA; and he inclines to account those the most ancient which have a double female head on the one side, and on the reverse Jupiter in a car, with Victory holding the reins, and the word ROMA indented in a rude and singular manner. The double female head seems to denote Rome, in imitation of the Janus then upon the as. There are 15 of these in the cabinet of Dr Hunter; one of the largest weighs 98½ grains; and the rest, which seem to be of greatest antiquity, are of various weights between that and 84½; the smaller and more modern weigh 58 or 59 grams; but Mr Pinkerton is of opinion, that the large ones are of the very first Roman coinage, and struck during that interval of time between the coinage of the first silver denarius and the as of two ounces. He takes the indentation of the word ROMA to be a mark of great antiquity; such a mode being scarcely known anywhere else, except in Caulonia, Crotona, and other towns of Italy; all of them allowed to be struck at least 400 B.C. As these large coins are not double denarii, they must have been struck prior to the small ones; and Neumann has given an account of one of them recollected by Trajan, in which the indentation of ROMA is carefully preserved. The first denarius was in value 10 ases, when the as weighed three ounces; and allowing 90 grams at a medium for one of these large denarii, the proportion of copper to silver must have been as 1 to 160; but when the as fell to one ounce, the proportion was as 1 to 80; when it fell to half an ounce, so that 16 ases went to the denarius, the proportion was as 1 to 64, at which it remained. Copper with us, in coinage, is to silver as 1 to 40; but in actual value as 1 to 72.\n\nAt Rome the denarius was worth 8d.; the quinarius 4d.; and the sesterius, whether silver or brass, 2d. The denarius is the coin from which our penny is derived, and was the chief silver coin in Rome for 600 years. According to Celsus, seven denarii went to the Roman ounce, which in metals did not exceed 430 grams; but as all the denarii hitherto met with weigh at a medium only 60 grams, this would seem to make the Roman ounce only 420 grams; though perhaps this deficiency may be accounted for from the unavoidable waste of metal even in the best preserved of these coins. According to this proportion the Roman pound contained 84 denarii; but in tale there was a very considerable excess; for no fewer than 100 denarii went to the Roman pound. The Greek ounce appears to have been considerably larger than that of Rome, containing about 528 grams; yet notwithstanding this apparently great odds, the difference in the coins was so small, that the Greek money went current in Rome, and the Roman in Greece. The denarius at first went for 10 ases, and was marked X; it was afterwards raised to 16; which Mr Pinkerton supposes to have been about 175 B.C. Some are met with bearing the number XVI. nay, with every number up to CCCCLXXVI. These large numbers are supposed to have been mint-marks of some kind or other. After being raised to 16 ases, it continued at the same value till the time of Gallienus; so that till that time we are to look upon its constituent parts to be 16 ases or afferia, eight dupondii, four bras festerii, and two silver quinarii. Under the emperor Severus, however, or his successor Caracalla, denarii were struck of two sizes, one of them a third heavier than the common; which we must of consequence suppose to have borne a third more value. This large piece obtained the name of argentus, and argentus Philippus, or the \"silver Philip;\" the name of Philip having become common to almost every coin. The common denarii now began to be termed minutus and argentus Philippus minutuli, &c., to express their being smaller than the rest. Some have imagined that the large denarii were of the same value with the small, only of worse metal; but Mr Pinkerton observes, that among the few which have any difference of metal, the smallest are always the worst. The first mention of the minutus is in the time of Alexander Severus, who reduced the price of pork from eight minutus at Rome to two and to one. The minutus argentus of that age was about 40 grams; and from the badness of the metal was not worth above 4d. of our money. Thus the price of meat was by this prince reduced first to 8d. and then to 4d.\n\nAccording to Zozimus and other writers, the purity of the Roman coin was restored by Aurelian; but Mr Pinkerton contests this opinion; thinking it more probable, that he only made the attempt without success; or that his reformation might be entirely confined to gold, on which there is an evident change after the time of this emperor. His successor Tacitus is said to have allowed no bras to be mixed with silver upon any account; yet the few coins of this emperor are very much alloyed. We are certain, however, that the emperor Diocletian restored the silver to its ancient purity; the denarii struck in his reign being very small indeed, but of fine silver as the most ancient coins of the empire. After Gordian III. the small denarius entirely vanished, while the large one was so much diminished, that it resembled the minutus, or small one of Caracalla, in size. Gallienus introduced the denarius æreus instead of the sesterius. The argentus, though reduced more than one third in size, contained five denarii æreus, the old standard of sesterius. According to the writers of this period, and some time afterwards, the denarius or argentus contained 60 afferia; whence it follows, that each denarius æreus had 10; and from this it probably had its name. The afferia are of the size of the argentus already mentioned; and show the copper to have retained nearly its old proportion of value to the silver, viz. 1 to 60.\n\nA larger silver coin was introduced by Constantine I. who accommodated the new money to the pound of gold in such a manner, that 1000 of the former in tale were equal to the latter in value; so that this new piece from thence obtained the name of the milliarensis.\nmillarenfs or \"thousand.\" Its weight at a medium is 70 grains, or 70 to the pound of silver; but Mr Pinkerton is of opinion, that it might have contained 72 grains, of which two have now perished by the softness of the silver; that the pound contained 72; or that two of the number might be allowed for coinage; while the alloy alone would pay for coining gold. The code says, that 60 went to the pound; but the numbers of this are quite corrupt. The millarenfs was worth about a shilling sterling. The argentei or denarii, however, were still the most common currency; and having been originally rated at 100 to the pound of silver in tale, from thence began to be called centenionalces, or \"hundreders.\" Those of Constantine I. and II. Constans, and Constantius, weigh from 50 grains down to 40; those of Julian and Jovian, from 40 to 30, and of the succeeding emperors from that time to Justinian, from 30 to 20. Under Heraclius they ceased entirely; and, from Justinian to their total abolition, had been brought down from 15 to 10 grains. A like decrease of weight took place in the millarenfs; those of Constantine and Constans being above 70 grains in weight; those of Arcadius not above 60; and the millarenfs of Justinian not more than 30 grams; but, from the weight of those in Dr Hunter's cabinet, Mr Pinkerton deduces the medium to have been exactly 70-71 grams. These coins were also called majorinae.\n\nThe smaller silver coins of Rome were, 1. The quinarius, at first called victoriatus, from the image of Victory on its reverse; and which it continued to bear from first to last. Its original value was five ases, but it was afterwards raised to eight, when the value of the denarius increased to 16. According to Pliny, it was first coined in consequence of the lex Clodia, about the 52nd year of Rome. Some are of opinion, that it was called sequens under the Constantinopolitan empire, because it was worth a sequens of gold, 144 of which went to the ounce; but this is denied by Mr Pinkerton, because, at the time that the word sequens first appears in history, the denarius did not weigh above 30 grams; and of consequence, as 25 must have gone to the gold solidus, of which there were five in the ounce, 130 denarii must have gone to the ounce of gold. He is therefore of opinion, that the word sequens was only another name for the denarius when much reduced in size; probably owing to the great scarcity of silver in Constantinople, though in the same city there was plenty of gold; and of consequence, the gold solidus was never diminished. \"For Montefquieu (says our author) has well observed, that gold must be common where silver is rare. Hence gold was the common regulation of accounts in the Eastern empire.\" The sequens met with in ancient authors, according to Mr Pinkerton, was merely an improper name for the millarenfs; when, on account of the scarcity of silver, the denarius was reduced, and no millarenfs coined: so that the current millarenfs of former reigns happened to be double to the denarius or centenionalces. The quinarius diminishes in size along with the other coins: those of Augustus weighing 30 grams, of Severus 25, of Constantine I. 20, of Justinian 12, and of Heraclius only 5. A new silver coinage seems to have taken place after the days of this emperor; as the little we then meet with, which in the best cabinets scarce exceeds a dozen of coins, consists entirely of large unhappily pieces of coarse metal.\n\n2. The consular denarius had also four silver sesterces, till the as fell to half an ounce, when it was thought the denarius proper to coin the sesterces in brass, as it continued to be ever afterwards. \"The very last silver sesterces (says Mr Pinkerton) which appears, is one with a head of Mercury, and H. S.; on the reverse a caduceus P. SEPVLLIVS; who appears to be the P. SEPVLLIVS MACER of the denarii of Julius Caesar. If so, as is most probable, the sesterces was coined in silver down to Augustus; and it is of course not to be expected that any of brass can appear till Augustus, under whom they are actually quite common. I have indeed seen no coin which could be a consular brass sesterces; and though we have certainly brass dupondii of Caesar, yet it is reasonable to infer, that the brass sesterces was first coined by Augustus. Not one silver sesterces appears during the whole imperial period, yet we know that the sesterces was the most common of all silver coins. The consular sesterces of silver, marked H. S. are not uncommon, nor the quinarii; but the latter are very scarce of all the emperors, if we except one instance, the ASIA RECEPTA of Augustus.\n\n\"The Roman gold coinage was still later than that Roman of silver. Pliny tells us, that \"gold was coined 600 years after silver; and the scuple went for 60 sesterces. It was afterwards thought proper to coin 40 pieces out of the pound of gold. And our princes have by degrees diminished their weight to 45 in the pound.\" This account is confirmed by the pieces which still remain; for we have that very coin weighing a scuple, which went for 20 sesterces. On one side is the head of Mars, and on the other an eagle; and it is marked xx. We have another coin of the same kind, but double, marked xxxx; and its triple, marked lxx or 60; the l being the old numeral character for 50.\" Mr Pinkerton, the discoverer of this, treats other medallists with great asperity. Savot and Hardouin are mentioned by name; the latter (he says) is \"ignorant of common sense;\" and neither he nor Savot could explain it but by reading backward; put the l for the Roman V, and thus making it xv. Other readings have been given by various medallists, but none have hit upon the true one excepting our author, though the coin itself led to it; being just three times the weight of that marked xx. We have likewise half the largest coin, which is marked xxx, and which weighs 26 grams; the smallest is only 17½; the xxxx weighs 34; and the lx or drachma 53. There is also the didrachm of this coinage, of 106 grams.\n\nThe aurei, or Roman gold coins, were at first 48 in number to 40, owing to an augmentation in the weight of each coin. In the time of Sylla, the aureus weighed no less than from 164 to 168 grams, and there were only 30 in the pound; but such confusion in the coinage was introduced by that conqueror, that no person could know exactly what he was worth. Till this time the aureus seems to have continued of the value of 30 silver denarii, about one pound sterling; for about that time it was enlarged a whole third,\nthat it might still be equivalent to the full number of denarii. But after Sylla had taken Athens, and the arts and manners of Greece became objects of imitation to the Romans, the aureus fell to 40 in the pound, probably when Sylla had abdicated his dictatorship. Thus, being reduced near to the scale of the Greek ἀργυρεύς, it palled for 20 denarii, as the latter did for as many drachmas, being in currency 13s. 4d. sterling. \"This (says Mr Pinkerton) is the more probable, because we know from Suetonius, that the great Cæsar brought from Gaul so much gold, that it fold for nine times its weight of silver; but the Gallic gold was of a very base sort.\"\n\nIn the time of Claudius, the aureus was valued at 100 sesterces, or 25 silver denarii, at which it continued till the time of Heliogabalus, when it fell to about 92 grains at a medium, or role in number to 55 in the pound. In the reign of Philip, during which the city completed its thousandth year, the aureus was coined of two or three sizes. There are impressed with a head of Rome on one side, and various figures on the other; but the workmanship is so rude, that they are supposed to have been struck in some of the more uncivilized provinces of the empire. The practice of having different gold coins, however, continued under Valerian, Gallienus, and his successors. In the time of Gallienus, they were of 30, 65, and from 86 to 93 grains; the double aurei being from 172 to 183½ grains; but the aureus properly so called was from 86 to 93; those of 30 and 32 being the trientes aurei of the Historia Auguflae Scriptores; while the larger, from 62 to 65, are to be accounted double trientes, and were perhaps called minuti aurei. The value of these different sizes of aurei is not known.\n\nThat Aurelian made some alteration in the coin is certain; but Mr Pinkerton supposes it to have been only in the gold; because under him and his successor Probus, the common aureus was of 100 grains, a size confined to those emperors: there are likewise halves of about 50 grains; and double aurei, commonly of very fine workmanship, of upwards of 200 grains. In the time of Gallienus, the precious metal was so common, that this emperor died in magnificence with Nero and Heliogabalus. Aurelian, who plundered the rich city of Palmyra, and thus became master of the treasures of the east, obtained such a profusion of gold, that he looked upon it to be produced by nature in greater plenty than silver. It is remarkable, that during this emperor's reign there was a rebellion among the money coiners, which could not be quelled but by the destruction of several thousands; which Mr Pinkerton attributes to his having ordered the gold to be restored to its former size, but to go for no more silver than it formerly did. \"So very little silver (says he) occurs of this period, that it is plain no alteration in the silver produced the war with the moneyers; and in the bras he made no change; or if he had, it were strange that such commotions should arise about so trifling a metal. But if, as appears from the coins, he ordered the aureus, which had fallen to 80 grains, to be raised to about 100, it is no wonder that the contractors should be in an uproar; for a whole quarter of their coinage, amounting as would seem, to all their profits, was lost. Aurelian judged, that when he found gold so common in the east, it was equally so in the west; and that the moneyers must have made a most exorbitant profit; but his ideas on this subject were partial and unjust: and after his short reign, which did not exceed five months after the alteration, the gold returned to its former course; though a few pieces occur of Aurelian's standard, struck, as would seem, in the commencement of the reign of Probus his successor.\n\nFrom this time to that of Constantine I. the aureus weighed between 70 and 80 grains; but in his reign it was changed for the solidus, of which fix went to the ounce of gold, which went for 14 millirenses, and 25 denarii as before; the value of silver being now to gold as 14 to 1. This new coin continued of the same value to the final downfall of the Constantinopolitan empire; gold being always very plentiful in that city, though silver became more and more scarce. The solidus was worth 12s. sterling. Here again our author most fervently criticizes Mr Clarke and Mr Raper: the former (he says) with respect to the value of gold in the time of Constantine I. \"has left all his senses behind him. In page 267, he absurdly affirms, that 25 denarii went to the solidus in the time of Theodosius I. and proceeds with this deplorable error to the end of his work. He then tells us, that only 14 denarii went to the solidus under Constantine I. &c.\"\n\nTo Mr Raper, however, he is a little more merciful, as he owns, that \"though he (Mr Raper) has strangely confounded the millirenses with the denarius, he has yet kept common sense for his guide.\" Mr Pinkerton, indeed, argues with great probability, \"that had any change in the coinage taken place between the time of Constantine and Theodosius I. that is, in less than 50 years, the laws of that period, which are all in the Theodosian code, must have noticed it.\" To this and other arguments upon the subject, Mr Pinkerton adds the following observation upon the value of gold and silver: \"As a flate advances to its height, gold increases in value; and as a flate declines, it decreases, providing the metals are kept on a par as to purity. Hence we may argue, that gold decreased in its relation to silver perhaps four or five centuries, furnished most European kingdoms with gold in coin, which otherwise would, from their want of arts and of intercourse with the east, then the grand seminary of that metal, have almost been ignorant of what gold was. These gold coins were called Byzants in Europe, because sent from Byzantium or Constantinople; and were solidi of the old scale, six to the ounce. In Byzantine writers, the solidus is also called nomisma, or \"the coin;\" crysmos, because of gold; hyperperos, from its being refined with fire, or from its being of bright gold flaming like fire. The solidi also, as the aurei formerly, received names from the princes whose portraits they bore; as Michelati, Manuelati. Solidus is a term used also for the aureus by Apuleius, who lived in the time of Antoninus the Philosopher; nay, as early as in the praetorian edicts of the time of Trajan. It was then a distinction from the semis or half. In the time of Valerian, when aurei of different sizes had been introduced, it became necessary to distinguish the particular aurei meant. Hence in the Imperial Rescripts, published by the Historia Auguflae Scriptores, Valerian uses the term Philippoeus nobri vulgus, for the common aurei. Aurelian uses the same term aurei\nPhilippei, for the aurei which he had restored to their size in some degree. Gallienus uses aurei Valeriani for his father's coins. Aurei Antoniniani are likewise put by Valerian for coins of the early Antonini, of superior standard to any then used.\n\nIn the first gold coinage at Rome, the aureus was divided into four parts; the semifliss of 60 sestertii; the tremissis, or third, of 40; the fourth, the name of which is not mentioned, of 30; and the terpulum of 20. But in a short time all of these fell into disuse, except the semifliss or half, which is extremely scarce; so that it is probable that few have been struck. It is an erroneous opinion (according to Mr Pinkerton), that the semifliss was called a denarius aureus. The aureus itself indeed had this name; but the name of quinarius is applied to the semifliss with greater propriety than the former. Trientes, or tremisses of gold, are found of Valerian and his son Gallienus, and weigh about 30 grains. Those of Salonina the wife of Gallienus weigh 33 grains. Under the Constantinopolitan empire, tremisses again make their appearance; and from the time of Valentinian downwards, the thirds are the most common coins of gold, being worth about 4s. sterling. The semifliss is likewise mentioned, but none occur earlier than the time of Basiliscus. The gold tremisses was the pattern of the French and Spanish gold coins; as the silver denarius, in its diminished state, was of the Gothic and Saxon penny.\n\nWe shall close this account of the Roman money with some remarks concerning the mint, and method of coining. This at first seems to have been under the direction of the quaestor. About the time that silver was first coined in Rome, viz. about 266 B.C., the triumviri monetales were created. They were at first of senatorial rank, but were by Augustus chosen from among the equites; and the title of triumvir was continued till after the time of Caracalla; but under Aurelian there was probably but one master of the mint, called rationalis; and Mr Pinkerton is of opinion that the change took place under Gallienus. He seems also to have permitted the provincial cities to coin gold and silver, as well as to have altered the form of the mints in the capital, and to have ordered them all to strike money with Latin legends, and of the same forms; as in his time we first meet with coins with mint marks of cities and offices. The violent insurrection which took place in his reign has already been mentioned, as well as its probable cause; and Mr Gibbon has shown, that the concealed enemies of Aurelian took such advantage of this insurrection, that it cost 7000 of his best troops before it could be quelled. About this time the procurator monetarum seems to have succeeded the rationalis as director of the mint. In the colonies, the direction of the mint seems to have been given to the decemviri, whose names frequently occur on colonial coins; \"which (says Mr Pinkerton), though generally of rude invention, and ruder execution, are yet often interesting and important.\"\n\nThe engraving of the ancient dies used in coining was a work of much genius and labour; and at Rome Greek artists were generally employed in it; but it has been thought a matter of great surprize, that scarcely any two ancient coins are to be found exactly the same. Hence some antiquaries have imagined, that only a single coin was thrown off from each die. M.\n\nBeauvais informs us, that the only two Roman imperial coins of the first times which he had seen perfectly alike were those of the emperor Galba. It is, however, the opinion of the best judges, that a perfect similarity between two medals is a very great reason for supposing one of them to be forged. \"It must also be observed (says Mr Pinkerton), that the differences in coins, apparently from the same die, are often so minute as to escape an eye not used to microscopic observations of this sort. But it would be surprising if any two ancient coins were now found struck with the same die; for out of each million issued, not above one has reached us. Dies soon give way by the violence of the work; and the ancients had no punchers nor matrices, but were forced to engrave many dies for the same coin. Even in our mint, upon sending for a threepence's worth of new halfpence, it will appear that three or four dies have been used. Sometimes the obverse of the die gives way, sometimes the reverse; but among us it is renewed by punchers, though with variations in the lettering or other minute strokes; while the ancients were forced to recur to another die differently engraved. The engravers of the die were called calatores; other officers employed in the mint were the spectatores, spectatores, or nummularii. The melters were styled fufarii, flatuarii, and flaturarii; those who adjusted the weight were called aquatores monetarii; those who put the pieces into the die suppositorii, and those who struck them malleatores. At the head of each office was an officer named primicerius, and the foreman was named optio et exactor.\"\n\nIn order to assist the high relief on the coins, the metal, after being melted and refined, was cast into bullets, as appears from the ancient coins not being cut or filed on the edges, but often cracked, and always rough and unequal. These bullets were then put into the die, and received the impression by repeated strokes of the hammer, though sometimes a machine appears to have been used for this purpose; for Boiterue informs us, that there was a picture of the Roman mintage in a grotto near Baiae, where a machine was represented holding up a large stone as if to let it fall suddenly, and strike the coin at once. None of the ancient money was cast in moulds, excepting the most ancient and very large Roman brats, commonly called weights, and other Italian pieces of that sort; all the rest being mere forgeries of ancient and modern times. Some Roman moulds which have been found are a proof of this; and from these some medallists have erroneously imagined that the ancients first cast their money in moulds, and then stamped it, in order to make the impression more clear and sharp.\n\nThe ancients had some knowledge of the method of creasing the edges of their coins, which they did by cutting out regular notches upon them; and of this kind we find some of the Syrian and ancient confular coins, with a few others. The former were cast in this shape, and then struck; but the latter were creased by incision, to prevent forgery, by showing the inside of the metal; however, the ancient forgers also found out a method of imitating this; for Mr Pinkerton informs us, that he had a Roman confular coin, of which the incisions, like the rest, were plated with silver over the copper.\nSect. VI. Of the Preservation of Medals.\n\nWe now come to consider what it is that distinguishes one medal from another, and why some are so highly prized more than others. This, in general, besides its genuineness, consists in the high degree of preservation in which it is. This, by Mr Pinkerton, is called the conservation of medals, and is by him regarded as good and as perfect. In this, he says that a true judge is so nice, that he will reject even the rarest coins if in the least defaced either in the figures or legend. Some, however, are obliged to content themselves with those which are a little rubbed, while those of superior taste and abilities have in their cabinets only such as are in the very state in which they came from the mint; and such, he says, are the cabinets of Sir Robert Austen, and Mr Walpole, of Roman silver, at Strawberryhill. It is absolutely necessary, however, that a coin be in what is called good preservation; which in the Greek or Roman emperors, and the colonial coins, is supposed to be when the legends can be read with some difficulty; but when the conservation is perfect, and the coin just as it came from the mint, even the most common coins are valuable.\n\nThe fine rust, like varnish, which covers the surface of brails and copper coins, is found to be the best preserver of them; and is brought on by lying in a certain kind of soil. Gold cannot be contaminated but by iron mold, which happens when the coin lies in a soil impregnated with iron; but silver is susceptible of various kinds of rust, principally green and red; both of which yield to vinegar. In gold and silver coins the rust must be removed, as being prejudicial; but in brails and copper it is preservative and ornamental; a circumstance taken notice of by the ancients. \"This fine rust (says Mr Pinkerton), which is indeed a natural varnish not imitable by the art of man, is sometimes a delicate blue, like that of a turquoise; sometimes of a bronze brown, equal to that observable in ancient statues of bronze, and so highly prized; and sometimes of an exquisite green, a little on the azure hue, which last is the most beautiful of all. It is also found of a fine purple, of olive, and of a cream colour or pale yellow: which last is exquisite, and shows the impression to be as much advantage as paper of cream colour, used in all great foreign presses, does copperplates and printing. The Neapolitan patina (the rust in question) is of a light green; and when free from excrement or blemish is very beautiful. Sometimes the purple patina gleams through an upper coat of another colour, with as fine effect as a variegated silk or gem. In a few instances a rust of a deeper green is found; and it is sometimes spotted with the red or bronze flake, which gives it quite the appearance of the East Indian stone called the bloodstone. These rusts are all, when the real product of time, as hard as the metal itself, and preserve it much better than any artificial varnish could have done; concealing at the same time not the most minute particle of the impression of the coin.\"\n\nThe value of medals is lowered when any of the letters of the legend are misplaced; as a suspicion of forgery is thus induced. Such is the case with many of those of Claudius Gothicus. The same, or even greater, diminution in value takes place in such coins as have not been well fixed in the die, which has occasioned their slipping under the strokes of the hammer, and thus made a double or triple image. Many coins of this kind are found in which the one side is perfectly well formed, but the other blundered in the manner just mentioned. Another blemish, but of smaller moment, and which to some may be rather a recommendation, is when the workmen through inattention have put another coin into the die without taking out the former. Thus the coin is convex on one side, and concave on the other, having the same figure upon both its sides.\n\nThe medals said by the judges in this science to be countermarked are very rare, and highly valued. They marked have a small stamp impressed upon them, in some an head, in others a few letters, such as Aug: N. Probus, &c., which marks are supposed to imply an alteration in the value of the coin; as was the case with the countermarked coins of Henry VIII. and Queen Mary of Scotland. Some have a small hole through them; sometimes with a little ring fastened in it, having been used as ornaments; but this makes no alteration in their value. Neither is it any diminution in the value of a coin that it is split at the edges; for coins of undoubted antiquity have often been found in this state, the cause of which has been already explained. On the contrary, this cracking is generally considered as a great merit; but Mr Pinkerton supposes that one of these cracked coins has given rise to an error with respect to the wife of Carausius who reigned for some time in Britain. The inscription is read Oriuna Aug: and there is a crack in the medal just before the O of oriuna. Without this crack Mr Pinkerton supposes that it would have been read Fortuna Aug.\n\nSome particular soils have the property of giving silver a yellow colour as if it had been gilt. It naturally acquires a black colour through time, which any sulphurous vapour will bring on in a few minutes. From its being so susceptible of injuries, it was always mixed by the ancients with much alloy, in order to harden it. Hence the impressions of the ancient silver coins remain perfect to this day, while those of modern coins are obliterated in a few years. On this account Mr Pinkerton expresses a wish, that modern states would allow a much greater proportion of alloy in their silver coin than they usually do. As gold admits of no rust except that from iron above-mentioned, the coins of this metal are generally in perfect conservation, and fresh as from the mint.\n\nTo cleanse gold coins from this rust, it is best to steep them in aquafortis, which, though a very powerful solvent of other metals, has no effect upon gold. Silver may be cleansed by steeping for a day or two in vinegar, but more effectually by boiling in water with three parts of tartar and one of sea salt; on both these metals, however, the rust is always in spots, and never forms an entire incrustation as on brails or copper. The coins of these two metals must never be cleansed, as they would thus be rendered full of small holes eaten by the rust. Sometimes, however, they are found to totally obscured with rust, that nothing can be discovered upon them; in which case it is best to clear them with a graver; but it may also be done by boiling them for 24 hours in water with...\nHow to distinguish true Medals from counterfeits.\n\nThe most difficult and the most important thing in the whole science of medals is the method of distinguishing the true from the counterfeit. The value put upon ancient coins made the forgery of them almost coeval with the science itself; and no laws inflict a punishment upon such forgers, men of great genius and abilities have undertaken the trade: but whether to the real detriment of the science or not, is a matter of some doubt; for if only exact copies of genuine medals are sold for the originals, the imposition may be deemed trifling: but the case must be accounted very different, if people take it upon them to forge medals which never existed. At first the forgeries were extremely grofs; and medals were forged How to di- of Priam, of Aristotle, Artemisia, Hannibal, and most gins with of the other illustrious personages of antiquity. Most of these were done in such a manner, that the fraud could easily be discovered; but others have imposed even upon very learned men. Mr Pinkerton mentions a remarkable medal of the emperor Heraclius, representing him in a chariot on the reverse, with Greek and Latin inscriptions, which Joseph Scaliger and Lipsius imagined to have been struck in his own time, but which was certainly issued in Italy in the 15th century. Other learned men (says our author) have been strangely misled, when speaking of coins; for to be learned in one subject excludes not grofs ignorance in others. Budaeus, de Arte, quotes a denarius of Cicero, M. Tull. Erasmus, in one of his Epistles, tells us with great gravity, that the gold coin of Brutus struck in Thrace, ΚΟΣΜΗ, bears the patriarch Noah coming out of the ark with his two sons, and takes the Roman eagle for the dove with the olive branch. Winkelman, in his letters informs us, that the small bras piece with Virgil's head, reverse ERO, is undoubtedly ancient Roman; and adds, that no knowledge of coins can be had out of Rome; but Winkelman, so conversant in statues, knew nothing of coins. It is from other artists and other productions that any danger of deceit arises. And there is no wonder that even the skilful are misled by such artists as have used this trade; for among them appear the names of Victor Gambello, Giovanni del Cavino, Coins called the Paduan, and his son Alessandro Baffiano, ged by ex-wife of Padua, Benvenuto Cellini, Alessandro cellent arti Greco, Leo Aretino, Jacobo da Frezzo, Federigo Bonzagna, and Giovanni Jacopo, his brother; Sebastiano Plumbo, Valerio de Vizenza, Gorlaeus, a German, Carteron of Holland, and others, all or most of them of the 16th century; and Cavino the Paduan, who is the most famous, lived in the middle of that century. The forgeries of Cavino are held in no little esteem, being of wonderful execution. His and those of Carteron are the most numerous, many of the other artists here mentioned not having forged above two or three coins. Later forgers were Dervici of Florence who confined himself to medallions, and Cogorner who gave coins of the 30 tyrants in small bras. The chief part of the forgeries of Greek medals which have come to my knowledge are of the first mentioned, and a very grofs kind, representing persons who could never appear upon coin, such as Priam, Æneas, Plato, Alcibiades, Artemisia, and others. The real Greek coins were very little known or valued till the works of Goltzius appeared, which were happily posterior to the era of the grand forgers. Why later forgers have seldom thought of counterfeiting them cannot be easily accounted for, if it is not owing to the masterly workmanship of the originals, which sets all imitation at defiance. Forgeries, however, of most ancient coins may be met with, and of the Greek among the rest.\n\n\"The forgeries are more conspicuous among the Roman forgeries than any other kind of coins; but we are yet more not to look upon all these as the work of modern confusions artists. On the contrary, we are assured that many of them were fabricated in the times of the Romans themselves, some of them being even held in more estimation than the genuine coins themselves, on account of\nHow to distinguish true from counterfeits.\n\nCaracalla is said to have coined money of copper and lead plated with silver; and plated coins, the work of ancient forgers, occur of many Greek cities and princes; nay, there are even forgeries of barbaric coins. \"Some Roman coins (says Mr Pinkerton), are found of iron or lead plated with bras, perhaps trials of the skill of the forger. Iron is the most common; but one decursio of Nero is known of lead plated with copper. Neumann justly observes, that no historic faith can be put in plated coins, and that most faulty reverses, &c., arise from plated coins not being noticed as such. Even of the Roman consular coins of Brutus, not very many have ever been forged. The celebrated silver denarius of Brutus, with the cap of liberty and two daggers, is the chief instance of a consular coin of which a counterfeit is known. But it is easily rejected by this mark: in the true coin the cap of liberty is below the guard or hilt of the daggers; in the false, the top of it rises above that hilt.\"\n\nThe imperial series of medals is the grand object of modern medallie forgeries; and the deception was at first extended to the most eminent writers upon the subject. The counterfeits are by Mr Pinkerton divided into six classes.\n\nI. Such as are known to be imitations, but valued on account of the artists by whom they are executed. In this class the medals of the Paduan rank highest; the others being so numerous, that a complete series of imperial medals of almost every kind, nay almost of every medallion, may be formed from among them. In France, particularly, by far the greater part of the cabinets are filled with counterfeits of this kind. They are distinguished from such as are genuine by the following marks: 1. The counterfeits are almost universally thinner. 2. They are never worn or damaged. 3. The letters are modern. 4. They are either deficient of varnish entirely, or have a false one, which is easily known by its being black, shining, and greasy, and very easily hurt with the touch of a needle, while the varnish of ancient medals is as hard as the metal itself. Instead of the greasy black varnish above mentioned, indeed, they have sometimes a light green one, spotted with a kind of iron marks, and is composed of sulphur, verdigris, and vinegar. It may frequently be distinguished by the hairstrokes of the pencil with which it was laid on being visible upon it. 5. The sides are either filed or too much smoothed by art, or bear the marks of a small hammer. 6. The counterfeits are always exactly circular, which is not the case with ancient medals, especially after the time of Trajan.\n\nThe Paduan forgeries may be distinguished from those of inferior artists by the following marks: 1. The former are seldom thinner than the ancient. 2. They very seldom appear as worn or damaged, but the others very frequently, especially in the reverse, and legend of the reverse, which sometimes, as in forged Othos, appear as half-consumed by time. 3. The letters in moulds taken from the antique coins have the rudeness of antiquity. 4. False varnish is commonly light green or black, and shines too much or too little. 5. The sides of forged coins are frequently quite smooth, and undistinguishable from the ancient, though to accomplish this requires but little art. 6. Counterfeit medals are frequently as irregular in their form as the genuine; but the Paduan are generally circular, though false coins have often little pieces cut off, in perfect imitation of the genuine. 7. In calf coins the letters do not go sharp down into the medal, and have no fixed outline; their minute angles, as well as those of the drapery, are commonly filled up, and have not the sharpness of the genuine kind. Where the letters or figures are faint, the coin is greatly to be suspected.\n\nThe letters form the great criterion of medals, the letters the ancient being very rude, but the modern otherwise; principal the reason of which, according to Cellini, is, that the criterion of ancients engraved all their matrices with the graver or burin, while the modern forgers strike theirs with a punch.\n\nAccording to Vico, the false patina is green, black, Vico's rufset, brown, gray, and iron colour. The green is made of verdigris, the black is the smoke of fulphur, the gray is made of chalk steeped in urine, the coin being left for some days in the mixture. The rufset is next to the natural, by reason of its being a kind of froth which the fire forces from ancient coins; but when false, it shines too much. To make it they frequently took the large bras coins of the Ptolemies, which were often corroded, and made them red hot in the fire; put the coins upon them, and a fine patina adhered. Our author does not say in what manner the iron-coloured patina was made. \"Sometimes (adds he) they take an old defaced coin, covered with real patina, and stamp it anew; but the patina is then too bright in the cavities, and too dull in the protuberances. The trial of bras coins with the tongue is not to be defiled; for if modern the patina tastes bitter or pungent, while if ancient it is quite tasteless.\"\n\nMr Pinkerton informs us, that all medallions from Julius Caesar to Adrian are much to be suspected of forgery; the true medals of the first 14 emperors being exceedingly valuable, and to be found only in the cabinets of princes.\n\nII. The second class of counterfeit medals contains those cast from moulds taken from the Paduan forges, and others done by eminent masters. These are sometimes more difficult to be discovered than the former, because in casting them they can give any degree of thickness they please; and, filling the small fandholes with mastic, they retouch the letters with a graver, and cover the whole with varnish. The instructions already given for the former class, however, are also useful for those of the second, with this addition, that medals of this class are generally lighter than the genuine, because fire rarifies the metal in some degree, while that which is struck is rather condensed by the strokes. In gold and silver medals there cannot be any deception of this kind; because these metals admit not of patina, and consequently the varnish betrays the imposition. The marks of the file on the margin of those of the second class are a certain sign of forgery; though these do not always indicate the forgery to be of modern date, because the Romans often filed the edges of coins to accommodate them to the purposes of ornament, as quarter guineas are sometimes.\nHow to distinguish true from counterfeits.\n\nMedals cast in moulds from an antique.—In this mode some forgers, as Beauvais informs us, have been so very careful, that they would melt a common medal of the emperor whom they meant to counterfeit, lest the quality of the metal should betray them. \"This (says Mr Pinkerton), has been done in the silver Septimius Severus, with the reverse of a triumphal arch, for which a common coin of the same prince has been melted; and in other instances. Putting metals in the fire or upon hot iron to cleanse them, gives them an appearance of being cast; for some spots of the metal being softer than the rest will run, which makes this one of the worst methods of cleaning medals.—The directions given for discovering the two former deceptions hold good also in this.\n\nIV. Ancient medals retouched and altered.—This is a class of counterfeits more difficult to be discovered than any other. \"The art (says Mr Pinkerton) exerted in this class is astonishing; and a connoisseur is the least apt to suspect it, because the coins themselves are in fact ancient. The acute minds of the Italian artists exerted themselves in this way, when the other forgeries became common and known. With graving tools they alter the portraits, the reverses, and the inscriptions themselves, in a surprising manner. Of a Claudius struck at Antioch they make an Otho; of a Faustina, a Titiana; of a Julia Severa, a Didia Clara; of a Macrinus, a Pelcennius, &c. Give them a Marcus Aurelius, he flirts up a Pertinax, by thickening the beard a little, and enlarging the nose. In short, wherever there is the least resemblance in persons, reverses, or legends, an artist may from a trivial medal generate a most scarce and valuable one. This fraud is distinguishable by the false varnish which sometimes marks it; but, above all, by the letters of the legend, which are always altered. Though this be sometimes done with an artifice almost miraculous, yet most commonly the characters straggle, are disunited, and not in a line.\"\n\nIn counterfeits of this kind sometimes the obverse is not touched, but the reverse made hollow, and filled with mastic coloured like the coin, and engraved with such device and legend as was most likely to bring a great price; others are only retouched in some minute parts, by which, however, the value of the coin is much diminished. \"Against all these arts (says Mr Pinkerton), severe scrutiny must be made by the purchaser upon the medal itself; and the investigation and opinion of eminent antiquaries had upon its being altered, or genuine as it is issued from the mint.\n\nV. Medals impressed with new devices, or foldered.—In the first article of this class the reverses have been totally filed off, and new ones impressed with a die and hammer. This is done by putting the face or obverse, whichever is not touched, upon different folds of pasteboard, afterwards applying the die and striking it with a hammer. The forgery in this class is very easily discovered, as the devices and inscriptions on the counterfeits are known not to exist on true medals: as the Pons Aelius on the reverse of Adrian; the Expeditio Judaica of the same emperor, &c. The difference of fabrication in the face or reverse will be discovered at the first glance by any person of skill.\n\nThe foldered medals consist of two halves belonging to different medals, faced through the middle and then joined with folder. This mode of counterfeiting is common in silver and brass coins. \"They will take an Antoninus, for example, and saw off the reverse, then folder to the obverse which they have treated in the same manner. This makes a medal, which, from an unknowing purchaser, will bring a hundred times the price of the two coins which compose it. When the deceit is used in brass coins, they take care that the metals be of one hue; though indeed some pretenders in this way sometimes folder copper and brass together, which at once reveals the deceit. Medals which have a portrait on each side, and which are generally valuable, are the most liable to a suspicion of this fraud. To a very nice eye the minute ring of folder is always visible; and upon inserting a graver, the fabrication falls into halves.\"\n\nIn the same manner reverses are sometimes foldered to faces not originally belonging to them; as one mentioned by Pere Jobert, of Domitian, with an amphitheatre, a reverse of Titus joined to it. Another art is sometimes made use of in this kind of counterfeits, of which there is an instance of the temple of Janus upon Nero's medals; where the middle brass is taken off, and inserted in a cavity made in the middle of a large coin of that prince. In the coins of the lower empire, however, the reverses of medals are sometimes so connected with their obverses, that a suspicion of forgery sometimes occurs without any foundation. They are met with most commonly after the time of Gallienus, when such a number of usurpers arose, that it was difficult to obtain an exact portrait of their features; the coiners had not time, therefore, to strike a medal for these as they could have done for other emperors who reigned longer. Hence, on the reverse of a medal of Marius, who reigned only three days, there is PACATOR ORBIS, which shows that at that time they had reverses ready fabricated, to be applied as occasion might require.\n\nVI. Plated medals, or those which have clefts.—It has already been remarked, that many true medals are dented, cracked in the edges; owing to the repeated strokes of the hammer, and the little degree of ductility which the metal possesses. This the forgers attempt to imitate by a file; but it is easy to distinguish between the natural and artificial cleft by means of a small needle. The natural cleft is wide at the extremity, and appears to have a kind of almost imperceptible filaments; the edges of the crack corresponding with each other in a manner which no art can imitate.\n\nThe plated medals which have been forged in ancient times were long supposed to be capable of resisting every effort of modern imitation; but of late years, \"some ingenious rogues (says Mr Pinkerton), thought of piercing false medals of silver with a red-hot needle, which gave a blackness to the inside of the coin, and made it appear plated to an injudicious eye. This fraud is easily distinguished by scraping the inside of the metal.\" It is, however, very difficult to distinguish\nHow to distinguish the forgeries of rude money when not cast; and our author gives no other direction than to consult a skilful medallist. Indeed, notwithstanding all the directions already given, this seems to be a resource which cannot by any means with safety be neglected.\n\nA real and practical knowledge of coins \"is only to be acquired (says he) by seeing a great number, and comparing the forged with the genuine.\" It cannot therefore be too much recommended to the young connoisseur, who wishes to acquire some knowledge in this way, to visit all the fairs and cabinets he can, and to look upon all ancient medals with a very microscopic eye. By these means only is to be acquired that ready knowledge which enables at first glance to pronounce upon a forgery, however ingenious. Nor let the science of medals be from this concluded to be uncertain; for no knowledge is more certain and immediate, when it is properly studied by examination of the real objects. A man who buys coins, trifling merely to his theoretic perusal of medallical books, will find himself woefully mistaken. He ought to study coins first, where only they can be studied, in themselves. Nor can it be matter of wonder or implication of caprice, that a medallist of skill should at one perception pronounce upon the veracity or falsehood of a medal; for the powers of the human eye, employed in certain lines of science, are amazing. Hence a student can distinguish a book among a thousand similar, and quite alike to every other eye; hence a shepherd can discern, &c.; hence the medallist can say in an instant, \"this is a true coin, and this is a false,\" though to other people no distinction be perceptible.\"\n\nForgeries of modern coins and medals, Mr Pinkerton observes, are almost as numerous as of the ancient. The satiric coin of Louis XII., PERDAM BALYONIS NOMEN, is a remarkable instance: the false coin is larger than the true, and bears date 1512. The rude coins of the middle ages are very easily forged, and forgeries have accordingly become common. Forged coins of Alfred and other early princes of England have appeared, some of which have been done with great art. \"The two noted English pennies of Rich. I., says our author, are of this stamp; and yet have imposed upon Messrs Folkes and Snelling, who have published them as genuine in the two best books upon English coins. But they were fabricated by a Mr White of Newgate-street, a noted collector, who contaminated another wife fair character by such practices. Such forgeries, though easy, require a skill in the history and coinage of the times, which luckily can hardly fall to the lot of a common Jew or mechanic forger. But the practice is detectable, were no gain proposed: and they who stoop to it must suppose, that to embarrass the path of any science with forgery and futility, implies no infamy. In forgeries of ancient coin, the fiction is perhaps sufficiently atoned for by the vast skill required; and the artist may plausibly allege, that his intention was not to deceive, but to excite his utmost powers, by an attempt to rival the ancient masters. But no possible apology can be made for forging the rude money of more modern times. The crime is certainly greater than that which leads the common coiner to the gallows; inasmuch as it is committed with more ease, and the profit is incomparably larger.\"\n\nSect. VIII. Of the Value of Medals.\n\nAll ancient coins and medals, though equally genuine, are not equally valuable. In medals as well as in everything else, the scarcity of a coin stamps a value upon it which cannot otherwise be derived from its intrinsic worth. There are four or five degrees of rarity reckoned up; the highest of which is called unique. The cause is generally ascribed to the smallness of number thrown off originally, or to their having been called in, and recoined in another form. To the former cause Mr Pinkerton ascribes the scarcity of the copper of Otho and the gold of Pescennius Niger; to the latter that of the coinage of Caligula; \"though this last (says he) is not of singular rarity;\" which shows that even the power of the Roman senate could not annihilate an established money; and that the first cause of rarity, arising from the small quantity originally struck, ought to be regarded as the principal.\"\n\nIn the ancient cities Mr Pinkerton ascribes the scarcity of coin to the poverty or smallness of the state; of medals but the scarcity of ancient regal and imperial coins arises principally from the shortness of the reign; and cities sometimes from the superabundance of money before, which rendered it almost unnecessary to coin any money during the reign of the prince. An example of this we have in the scarcity of the threepence of George III., which shows that shortness of reign does not always occasion a scarcity of coin; and thus the coins of Harold II., who did not reign a year, are very numerous, while those of Richard I., who reigned ten, are almost unique.\n\nSometimes the rarest coins lose their value, and become common. This our author ascribes to the high price given for them, which tempts the possessors to bring them to market; but chiefly to the discovering and sale of hoards of them. The former cause took place with very Queen Anne's farthings, some of which formerly sold at five guineas; nay, if we could believe the newspapers, one of them was some years ago sold for 90l. the latter with the coins of Canute, the Danish king of England; which were very rare till a hoard of them was discovered in the Orkneys. As discoveries of this kind, however, produce a temporary plenty, so when they are dispersed the former scarcity returns; while, on the other hand, some of the common coins become rare through the mere circumstance of neglect.\n\nAs double the number of copper coins of Greek silver coins cities are to be met with that there are of silver, the latter are of consequence much more esteemed: but the reverse is the case with those of the Greek princes. All the Greek civic coins of silver are very rare, excepting those of Athens, Corinth, Miletus, Dyrrhachium, Malia, Syracusa, and some others. Of the Greek monarchic coins, the most rare are the tetradrachms of the kings of Syria, the Ptolemies, the sovereigns of Macedon and Bithynia, excepting those of Alexander the Great and Lydius. Those of the kings of Cappadocia are of a small size, and scarce to be met with. Of those of Numidia and Mauritania, the coins of Juba, the father, are common; but those\nValue.\n\nof the son, and nephew Ptolemy, scarce. Coins of the kings of Sicily, Parthia, and Judaea, are rare; the last very much so. We meet with no coins of the kings of Arabia and Comagene except in brats; those of the kings of Bosphorus are in electrum, and a few in brats, but all of them rare; as are likewise those of Philetis king of Pergamus, and of the kings of Pontus. In the year 1777, a coin of Mithridates sold for 26l. 5s. Didrachms of all kings and cities are scarce excepting those of Corinth and her colonies; but the gold coins of Philip of Macedon, Alexander the Great, and Lydiachus, as has already been observed, are common. The silver tetradrachms of all kings bear a very high price. The didrachm of Alexander the Great is one of the rarest of the smaller Greek silver coins; some of the other princes are not uncommon.\n\nGreek copper coins.\n\nIn most cases the copper money of the Greek monarchs is scarce; but that of Hiero I. of Syracuse is uncommonly plenty, as well as that of several of the Ptolemies.\n\nRoman con-\n\nfolar coins.\n\nThe most rare of the confular Roman coins are those restored by Trajan: of the others the gold confular coins are the most rare, and the silver the most common; excepting the coin of Brutus with the cap of liberty, already mentioned, with some others. Some of the Roman imperial coins are very scarce, particularly those of Otho in brats; nor indeed does he occur at all on any coin struck at Rome: but the reason of this may with great probability be supposed to have been the shortness of his reign. His portrait upon the brats coins of Egypt and Antioch is very bad; as well as almost all the other imperial coins of Greek cities. The best likeness is on his gold and silver coins; the latter of which are very common. The Greek and Egyptian coins are all of small or middling sizes, and have reverses of various kinds: those of Antioch have Latin legends, as well as most of the other imperial coins of Antioch. They have no other reverse but the SC in a wreath; excepting in one instance or two of the large and middle brats, where the inscriptions are in Greek. Latin coins of Otho in brats, with figures on the reverse, are certainly false; though in the cabinet of D'Ennery at Paris there was an Otho in middle brats restored by Titus, which was esteemed genuine by connoisseurs.\n\nLeaden Roman coins.\n\nThe leaden coins of Rome are very scarce: Most of them are pieces struck or cast on occasion of the Saturnalia; others are tickets for festivals and exhibitions, both private and public. The common tickets for theatres were made of lead, as were the contorniati; perpetual tickets, like the English silver tickets for the opera. Leaden medallions are also found below the foundations of pillars and other public buildings, in order to perpetuate the memory of the founders. From the time of Augustus also we find that leaden seals were used. The work of Tocorini upon this subject, entitled Piombi Antiochici, is much recommended by Mr Pinkerton.\n\nOf coins blundered in the mintage.\n\nThe Roman coins, which have been blundered in the manner formerly mentioned, are very rare, and undeservingly valued by the connoisseurs. The blunders in the legends of these coins, which in all probability are the mere effects of accident, have been so far mistaken by some medallists, that they have given rise to imaginary emperors who never existed. A coin of Purchafe, Faustina, which has on the reverse SOUSTI. S. C. puzzled all the German antiquaries, till at last Klotz gave it the following facetious interpretation: Sine omni utilitate seclamini tantas ineptias.\n\nThe heptarchic coins of England are generally rare, Heptarchic except those called /year, which are very common, as coins of Alfred which bear his bust are scarce, and his other money much more so. Those of Hardyknot are so rare, that it was even denied that they had an existence; but Mr Pinkerton informs us, that there are three in the British museum, upon all of which the name HARDCANUT is quite legible. No English coins of King John are to be met with, though there are some Irish ones; and only French coins of Richard I. \"Leake (says Mr Pinkerton), made a strange blunder in ascribing coins of different kings with two faces, and otherwise spoiled in the stamping, to this prince; in which, as usual, he has been followed by a misled number.\"\n\nCoins of Alexander II. of Scotland are rather scarce, Scottish but those of Alexander III. are more plentiful. Those coins of John Baliol are rare, and none of Edward Baliol are to be found.\n\nSect. IX. Of the Purchase of Medals.\n\nMedals are to be had at the shops of goldsmiths and silversmiths, with those who deal in curiosities, &c. But in great cities there are professed dealers in them. The best method of purchasing medals, however, is that of buying whole cabinets, which are every year exposed to auction in London. In these the rare medals are sold by themselves; but the common ones are put up in large lots, so that the dealers commonly purchase them. Mr Pinkerton thinks it would be better that medals were sold one by one; because a lot is often valued and purchased for the sake of a single coin; while the others separately would sell for perhaps four times the price of the whole lot. \"If any man of common sense and honesty (says Mr Pinkerton), were to take up the trade of selling coins in London, he would make a fortune in a short time. This profitable business is now in the hands of one or two dealers, who ruin their own interest by making an elegant study a trade of knavery and imposition. If they buy 300 coins for 10s. they will ask 3s. for one of the worst of them! nay, sell forged coins as true to the ignorant. The simpletons complain of want of business. A knave is always a fool.\"\n\nThe gold coins of Carthage, Cyrene, and Syracuse, Price of are worth about twice their intrinsic value as metal; gold coins but the other gold civic coins from 5l. to 30l. each. of Carthage, &c. The only gold coins of Athens certainly known to exist are two lately procured by the king. One of these remains in possession of his majesty, but the other was given by the queen to Dr Hunter. There was another in the British museum, but suspected not to be genuine. Dr Hunter's coin, then, if sold, would bear the highest price that could be expected for a coin.\n\nThe silver coins of Syracuse, Dyrrhachium, Malta-Of silver lia, Athens, and a few other places, are common; the coins drachmas and coins of lesser size are worth about five\nPurchase five shillings; the didrachms, tetradrachms, &c., from five to ten, according to their size and beauty; the largest, as might naturally be expected, being more valuable than the small ones. The tetradrachms, when of cities whose coins are common, are worth from 7s. 6d. to 1l. 1s.; but it is impossible to put a value upon the rare civic coins; ten guineas have been given for a single one.\n\nGreek copper coins are common, and are almost all of that kind called small bras; the middle size being scarce, and the largest in the ages prior to the Roman emperors extremely so. The common Greek coins of bras bring from 3d. to 18d. according to their preservation; but when of cities, whose coins are rare, much higher prices are given. \"The want of a few cities, however (says Mr Pinkerton), is not thought to injure a collection; as indeed new names are discovered every dozen of years, so that no effortment can be perfect. To this it is owing that the rarity of the Grecian civic coins is not much attended to.\"\n\nThe gold coins of Philip and Alexander the Great being very common, bear but from five to ten shillings above their intrinsic value; but those of the other princes, being rare, sell from 3l. to 30l. each, or even more.\n\nThe tetradrachms are the dearest of the silver monarchic money, selling from five to ten shillings; and if very rare, from 3l. to 30l. Half these prices may be obtained for the drachmas, and the other denominations in proportion.\n\nGreek copper coins are for the most part scarcer than the silver, except the Syro-Grecian, which are common, and almost all of the size called small bras. \"They ought (says Mr Pinkerton), to bear a high price; but the metal and similarity to the copper civic coins, which are common, keep their actual purchase moderate, if the seller is not well instructed, and the buyer able and willing to pay the price of rarity.\"\n\nThe name of weights given to the ancient Roman aes is, according to our author, exceedingly improper; as that people had weights of lead and brass fides, without the least appearance of a portrait upon them. These denote the weight by a certain number of knobs; and have likewise small fleurettes engraved upon them. According to Mr Pinkerton, whenever we meet with a piece of metal flamped on both fides with busts and figures, we may lay it down as a certain rule that it is a coin; but when slightly ornamented and marked upon one side only, we may with equal certainty conclude it to be a weight.\n\nThe ancient Roman aes are worth from 2s. to 2l. according to the singularity of their devices. Confucian gold coins are worth from 1l. to 5l. Pompey with his sons 2l. and the two Bruti 2l. The silver coins are universally worth from a shilling to half a crown, excepting that of the cap of liberty and a few others, which, if genuine, will bring from 10s. to 3l. The confucian copper bears an equal price with the silver, but is more rare; the confucian silver coins restored by Trajan are worth 20s. each.\n\nWith regard to the Roman imperial coins, it is to be observed, that some of those which belong to princes whose coins are numerous, may yet be rendered extremely valuable by uncommon reverses. Mr Pinkerton particularly points out that of Augustus, with the arrangement C. Marius Trogus, which is worth three guineas, though the silver coins of that prince in general are not worth above a shilling. In like manner, the common gold coins of Trajan are not worth above twenty shillings; while those with Basilica Ulpia, Forum Trajani, Divi Nerva et Trajanus, Pater, Divi Nerva et Platinus Aug. Profectio Aug. Regina Affigata, Rex Parthus, and some others, bear from three to six pounds. The ticket medals belong to the Roman senate, and are worth from three to ten shillings. The forged coins and medallions of the Paduan sell from one to three shillings each.\n\nOf the coins of other nations, those of Hilderic Barbaric king of the Vandals are in silver, and worth 10s. coins. The small bras of Athanaric, 3s.; the gold of Theodoric 2l.; the second bras of Theodahat 5s.; the second bras of Badueta rare, and worth 10s.; the third bras, 3s. The British coins are very rare, and worth from ten shillings to two guineas each, sometimes much more. Medals with unknown characters are always scarce and dear. Saxon pennies of the heptarchy are rare, and worth from ten shillings to ten pounds, according to their scarcity and preservation. The coins of the English kings are common; those of Edward the Confessor, in particular; others are rare, and worth from ten shillings to two guineas, while two of Hardyknotte are worth no less than ten guineas. The gold medals of Henry, in 1345, and the coronation of Edward, are worth 20l. each; the Mary of Trezzo, 3l.; Simon's head of Thurloe in gold is worth 12l.; his oval medal in gold upon Blake's naval victory at sea is worth 30l.; and his trial piece, if brought to a sale, would, in Mr Pinkerton's opinion, bring a still higher price. The medals of Queen Anne, which are intrinsically worth about two guineas and a half, sell for about 3l. each; the silver, of the size of a crown piece, sell for 10s. and the copper from five to ten shillings. Daffier's copper pieces fell from two to five shillings, and a few bear a higher price.\n\nThe Scottish gold coins sell higher than the English, but the others are on a par. The shilling of Mary of Scotland, with the bust is rare, and sells for no less than 3l.; the half 3l.; and the royal 5l. 5s. The French tell-toon of Francis and Mary brings 10l. 10s. and the Scottish one of Mary and Henry would bring 50l. as would also the medal of James IV. The coronation medal of Francis and Mary is worth 20l. Briot's coronation medal sold in 1755 only for two guineas at Dr Mead's sale; but would now bring 20l. if sold according to rarity.\n\nThe English coins struck in Ireland are of much the same price with those of the native country; but the coins struck St Patrick's halfpence and farthings are rather scarce, in Ireland, and the rare crown of white metal is worth 4l. The gun-money of James II. and all other Irish coins are very common.\n\nSect. X. Arrangement of Medals, with the Instruction to be derived from them.\n\nHaving thus given a full account of everything in general relative to medals, we must now come to some particulars respecting their arrangement, and the entertain-\ntainment which a medallist may expect from the trouble and expense he is at in making a collection.\n\nIt has already been observed, that one of the principal uses of medals is the elucidation of ancient history. Hence the arrangement of his medals is the first thing that must occur in the formation of a cabinet. The most ancient medals with which we are acquainted are those of Alexander I. of Macedon, who began to reign about 351 years before Christ. The series ought of consequence to begin with him, and to be succeeded by the medals of Sicily, Caria, Cyprus, Heraclea, and Pontus. Then follow Egypt, Syria, the Cimmerian Bosphorus, Thrace, Bithynia, Parthia, Armenia, Damascus, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, Pergamus, Galatia, Cilicia, Sparta, Peonia, Epirus, Illyricum, Gaul, and the Alps, including the space of time from Alexander the Great to the birth of Christ, and which is to be accounted the third medallic series of ancient monarchs. The last series goes down to the fourth century, including some of the monarchs of Thrace, Bosphorus, and Parthia, with those of Comagene, Edessa or Oghouse, Mauritania, and Judaea. A most distinct series is formed by the Roman emperors, from Julius Caesar to the destruction of Rome by the Goths; nay, for a much longer period, were it not that towards the latter part of it the coins become so barbarous as to destroy the beauty of the collection. Many series may be formed of modern potentates.\n\nBy means of medals we can with great certainty determine the various ornaments worn by ancient princes as badges of distinction. The Grecian kings have generally the diadem, without any other ornament; and though in general the side of the face is presented to view, yet in some very ancient Greek and Roman coinage, full faces of excellent workmanship are met with. On several coins also two or three faces are to be seen, and these are always accounted very valuable.\n\nThe diadem, which was no more than a ribbon tied round the head with a floating knot behind, adorns all the Grecian princes from first to last, and is almost an infallible mark of sovereign power. In the Roman coinage it is seen in conjunction with Numa and Ancus, but never afterwards till the time of Licinius, the colleague of Constantine. Diocletian, indeed, according to Mr Gibbon, first wore the diadem, but his portrait upon coins is never adorned with it. So great an aversion had the Romans to kingly power, that they rather allowed their emperors to assume the radiated crown, the symbol of divinity, than to wear a diadem; but, after the time of Constantine, it becomes common. The radiated crown appears first on the posthumous coins of Augustus as a mark of deification, but in somewhat more than a century became common.\n\nThe laurel crown, at first a badge of conquest, was afterwards permitted by the senate to be worn by Julius Caesar, in order to hide the baldness of his head. From him all the emperors appear with it on their medals, even to our own times. It is the lower empire the crown is sometimes held by a hand above the head, as a mark of piety. Besides these, the naval, mural, and civic crowns appear on the medals both of emperors and other eminent men, to denote their great achievements. The laurel crown is also sometimes worn by the Greek princes. The Arsacidæ of Parthia wear a kind of fall round the head, with their hair in rows of curls like a wig. The Armenian kings have the tiara, a kind of cap which was esteemed the badge of imperial power in the east. Conical caps are seen on the medals of Xerxes, a petty prince of Armenia, and Juba the father, the former having a diadem around it.\n\nThe impious vanity of Alexander and his successors in affuming divine honours is manifest on their medals, where various symbols of divinity are met with. Some of them have an horn behind their ear, either to denote their strength, or that they were the successors of seers. Alexander, to whom this badge might be applied as the son of Jupiter Ammon. This, however, Mr Pinkerton observes, is the only one of these symbols which certainly denotes an earthly sovereign, it being doubted whether the rest are not all figures of gods. According to Eckhart, even the horn and diadem belong to Bacchus, who invented the latter to cure his headaches; and, according to the same author, the only monarch who appears on coins with the horn is Lydiachus. We are informed, however, by Plutarch, that Pyrrhus had a crest of goats' horns to his helmet; and the goat, we know, was a symbol of Macedon. Perhaps the successors of Alexander wore this badge of the horn in consequence. The helmet likewise frequently appears on the heads of sovereigns, and Constantine I. has helmets of various forms curiously ornamented.\n\nThe diadem is worn by most of the Greek queens, by Orodelitis, daughter of Lycomedes, king of Bithynia; and though the Roman empresses never appear with it, yet this is more than compensated by the variety of their headdresses. Sometimes the bust of an empress is supported by a crescent, to imply that she was the moon, as her husband was the sun of the state. The toga, or veil drawn over the face, at first implied that the person was invested with the pontifical office; and accordingly we find it on the busts of Julius Caesar, while pontifex maximus. It likewise implies the augurship, the augurs having a particular kind of gown called lana, with which they covered their heads when observing an omen. In latter times this implies only consecration, and is common in coins of empresses. It is first met with on the coins of Claudius Gothicus as the mark of consecration of an emperor. The nimbus, or glory, now appropriated to saints, has been already mentioned. It is as ancient as Augustus, but is not to be met with on many of the imperial medals, even after it began to be appropriated to them. There is a curious coin, which has upon the reverse of the common piece, with the head of Rome, Urbs Roma, in large bras, Constantine I. sitting amid Victories and genii, with a triple crown upon his head for Europe, Asia, and Africa, with the legend SECURITAS ROMÆ.\n\nIn general only the bust is given upon medals, though sometimes half the body or more; in which latter case the hands often appear with ensigns of majesty in them; such as the globe, said to have been introduced by Augustus as a symbol of universal dominion; the sceptre, sometimes confounded with the consular staff; a roll of parchment, the symbol of legislative\nMedals likewise afford a good number of portraits of illustrious men; but they cannot easily be arranged in chronological order, so that a series of them is not to be expected. It is likewise vain to attempt the formation of a series of gods and goddesses to be found on ancient coins. Mr Pinkerton thinks it much better to arrange them under the several cities or kings whose names they bear. A collection of the portraits of illustrious men may likewise be formed from medals of modern date.\n\nThe reverses of ancient Greek and Roman coins afford an infinite variety of instruction and amusement. They contain figures of deities at full length, with their attributes and symbols, public symbols and diversions, plants, animals, &c., &c., and in short almost every object of nature or art. Some have the portrait of the queen, son, or daughter of the prince whose image appears on the face obverse; and these are esteemed highly by antiquaries, not only because every coin stamped with portraits on both sides is accounted valuable, but because they render it certain that the person represented on the reverse was the wife, son, or daughter of him who appears on the obverse; by which means they assist greatly in the adjusting of a series. Some, however, with two portraits are common, as Augustus, the reverse of Caligula; and Marcus Aurelius, reverse of Antoninus Pius.\n\nWe find more art and design in the reverses of the Roman medals than of the Greek; but on the other hand, the latter have more exquisite relief and workmanship. The very ancient coins have no reverses, excepting a rude mark struck into the metal, resembling that of an instrument with four blunt points on which the coin was struck; and was owing to its having been fixed by such an instrument on that side to receive the impression upon the other. To this succeeds the image of a dolphin, or some small animal, in one of the departments of the rude mark, or in a hollow square; and this again is succeeded by a more perfect image, without any mark of the hollow square. Some of the Greek coins are hollow in the reverse, as those of Caulonia, Crotona, Metapontum, and some other ancient cities of Magna Graecia. About 500 B.C., perfect reverses appear on the Greek coins, of exquisite relief and workmanship. \"The very muscles of men and animals (says Mr Pinkerton), are seen, and will bear inspection with the largest magnifier as ancient gems. The ancients certainly had not eyes different from ours; and it is clear that they must have magnified objects. A drop of water forms a microscope; and it is probable this was the only one of the ancients. To Greek artists we are indebted for the beauty of the Roman imperial coins; and these are so highly finished, that on some reverses, as that of Nero's decurion, the adventus and progressio of various emperors, the fundator pacis of Severus, the features of the emperor, riding or walking, are as exact as on the obverse. But though the best Greek artists were called to Rome, yet the Greek coins under the Roman emperors are sometimes well executed, and always full of variety and curiosity. No Roman or Etruscan coins have been found of the globular form, or indented on the reverse like the early Greek. The first Greek are small pieces of silver, while the Roman are large masses of copper. The former are struck; the latter cast in moulds. The reverses of the Roman coins are very uniform, the prow of a ship, a car, or the like, till about the year 100 B.C., when various reverses appear on their conular coins in all metals. The variety and beauty of the Roman imperial reverses are well known. The medalist much values those which have a number of figures; as the Puella Faustinae, of Faustina, a gold coin no larger than a sixpence, which has 12 figures; that of Trajan, regna affigentia, has four; the congiarium of Nerva five; the allocution of Trajan seven; of Hadrian ten; of Probus 12. Some Roman medals have small figures on both sides, as the Apollini faneto of Julian II. Such have not received any peculiar name among the medalists. Others have only a reverse, as the noted Spintriae, which have numerals I., II., &c., on the obverse.\"\n\nThe names of the deities represented on the reverses of Greek coins are never expressed; perhaps, as Mr Pinkerton supposes, out of piety, a symbolical representation of their attributes being all that they thought proper to delineate; but the Roman coins always express the name, frequently with an adjunct, as Veneri Victori, &c. In others, the name of the emperor or empress is added; as Pudicitiae Augustae, round an image of modesty; Virtus Augusti, a legend for an image of virtue.\n\nThe principal symbols of the divine attributes to be met with on the Greek medals are as follows:\n\n1. Jupiter is known on the coins of Alexander the Great by his eagle and thunderbolts; but when the figure occurs only on the obverses of coins, he is distinguished by a laurel crown, and placid bearded countenance. Jupiter Ammon is known by the ram's horn twisting round his ear; a symbol of power and strength, assumed by some of the successors of Alexander the Great, particularly by Lycurgus.\n\n2. Neptune is known by his trident, dolphin, or being drawn by sea horses; but he is seldom met with on the Grecian coins.\n\n3. Apollo is distinguished by an harp, branch of laurel, or tripod; and sometimes by a bow and arrows. In the character of the sun, his head is surrounded with rays; but when the bull only occurs, he has a fair young face, and is crowned with laurel. He is frequent on the coins of the Syrian princes.\n\n4. Mars is distinguished by his armour, and sometimes by a trophy on his shoulders. His head is armed with a helmet, and has a ferocious countenance.\n\n5. Mercury is represented as a youth, with a small cap on his head, wings behind his ears and on his feet. He is known by the cap, which resembles a small hat, and the wings. He appears also with the caduceus, or wand twined with serpents, and the marufipium, or purse, which he holds in his hand.\n\n6. Asclepius is known by his bushy beard, and his leaning on a club with a serpent twisted round it.\nHe sometimes occurs with his wife Hygeia or Health, with their son Telephorus or Convalescence between them.\n\n7. Bacchus is known by his crown of ivy or vine, his diadem and horn, with a tiger and satyrs around him.\n\n8. The figure of Hercules is common on the coins of Alexander the Great, and has frequently been mistaken for that of the prince himself. He appears sometimes as a youth and sometimes with a beard. He is known by the club, lion's skin, and remarkable apparent strength; sometimes he has a cup in his hand; and a poplar tree, as a symbol of vigour, is sometimes added to the portrait.\n\n9. The Egyptian Serapis is known by his bushy beard, and a miter upon his head.\n\n10. Apis is delineated in the form of a bull, with a flower of the lotos, the water lily of the Nile, supposed by Macrobius to be a symbol of creation; and Jamblichus tells us, that Osiris was thought to have his throne in it.\n\n11. Harpocrates, the god of Silence, appears with his finger on his mouth; sometimes with the sistrum in his left hand; a symbol common to most of the Egyptian deities.\n\n12. Canopus, another Egyptian deity, appears in the shape of a human head placed on a kind of pitcher. \"This deified pitcher (says Mr Pinkerton), seems to refer to an anecdote of ancient superstition, which, I believe, is recorded by Plutarch. It seems some Persian and Egyptian priests had a contest which of their deities had the superiority. The Egyptian said, that a single vase, sacred to Serapis, would extinguish the whole power of the Persian deity of fire. The experiment was tried; and the wily Egyptian, boring holes in the vase and stopping them with wax, afterwards filled the vase with water; which, seeping through the holes as the wax melted, extinguished the Persian deity. Hence the vase was deified.\"\n\n13. The Holy Senate and Holy People, appear frequently on the Greek imperial coins, sometimes represented as old men with beards, at others as youths.\n\nThe goddesses represented on medals are,\n\n1. Juno, represented by a beautiful young woman, sometimes with a diadem, sometimes without any badge, which is reckoned a sufficient distinction, as the other goddesses all wear badges. Sometimes she appears as the goddess of marriage; and is then veiled to the middle, and sometimes to the toes. She is known by the peacock, a bird sacred to her from the fable of Argus.\n\n2. Minerva is very common on the coins of Alexander the Great; and her bust has been mistaken by the celebrated painter Le Brun for the hero himself. She is very easily distinguished by the helmet. Her symbols are, her armour; the spear in her right hand, and the aegis, with a Medusa's head, in her left; an owl commonly standing by her.\n\n3. Diana of Ephesus is commonly represented on the Greek imperial coins; and appears with a great number of breasts, supposed to denote universal Nature. She is supported by two deer, and carries a pannier of fruit upon her head. The bust of this goddess is known by the crescent on her brow, and sometimes by the bow and quiver at her side.\n\n4. Venus is known by an apple, the prize of beauty, in her hand. Sometimes she is distinguished only by her total want of drapery; but is always to be known by her extraordinary beauty, and is sometimes adorned with pearls about the neck.\n\n5. Cupid is sometimes met with on the Syrian coins, and is known by his infancy and wings.\n\n6. Cybele is known by a turreted crown and lion; or is seen in a chariot drawn by lions.\n\n7. Ceres is known by her garland of wheat, and is common on the Sicilian coins; that island being remarkable for its fertility. Sometimes she has two serpents by her, and is sometimes drawn in a chariot by them. She carries in her hands the torches with which she is fabled to have gone in search of her daughter Proserpine.\n\n8. Proserpine herself is sometimes met with on coins, with the name of nea, or the girl.\n\n9. The Egyptian Isis has a bud or flower on her head; a symbol of the perpetual bloom of the inhabitants of heaven. She carries also a sistrum in her hand.\n\n10. The Sidonian Altarite appears on a globe supported on a chariot with two wheels, and drawn by two horses.\n\nThese are the deities most commonly represented on the Greek coins. The more uncommon are, Saturn with his scythe, or with a hook on the Heraclian coins; Vulcan with his tongs on the reverse of a coin of Thyatira, represented at work in the presence of Minerva. Adranus, a Sicilian god, is sometimes represented on coins with a dog. Anubis, an Egyptian deity, has a dog's head. Atis is known by his Phrygian bonnet; Caflor and Pollux by a star on the head of each; Dis, by his old face, dishevelled hair and beard, and a hook; Flora by her crown of flowers; Nemesis by her wheel; and Pan by his horns and ears belonging to some kind of beast.\n\nThere are likewise to be found on medals many different symbols by themselves; of the most remarkable of which we shall give the following table, with their significations:\n\n| Symbols | Signification |\n|---------|---------------|\n| 1. Vases with sprigs | Solemn games. |\n| 2. Small chest or hamper, with a serpent leaping out | Mystical rites of Bacchus. |\n| 3.

This, however, is greater in the Roman than in the Greek medals; for the Greeks commonly insert as much of the word as is sufficient to enable us easily to understand its meaning; but it is common for those who attempt to explain letters that do not often occur, to fall into very ridiculous errors. Of this Mr Pinkerton gives a most remarkable instance in Fortunius Licetius, a learned man, who finding upon a coin of Adrianus the letters, Π. Δ. Δ., signifying the 14th year of that emperor's reign, imagined that they signified Lucernas invenit Delta; \"Delta invented lanthorns;\" and thence ascribed the origin of lanthorns to the Egyptians. Tables explaining the meaning of the abbreviations found upon medals have been published by Patin, Uralius, and others.\n\nSect. XI. Of Medallions, Medalets, &c.\n\nBesides the ordinary coins of the ancients, which passed in common circulation through the country, there were others of a larger size, which are now termed medallions. These were struck on the commencement of the reign of a new emperor and other solemn occasions: frequently also, by the Greeks in particular, as monuments of gratitude or of flattery. Sometimes they were mere trial or pattern pieces; and those abound after the time of Maximian, with the words Tres Monetae on the reverse. The common opinion is, that all the Roman pieces of gold exceeding the denarius aureus, all in silver exceeding the denarius, and all in brads exceeding the sestertius, went under the denomination of medallions: but Mr Pinkerton thinks that many of these large pieces went in circulation, though not very commonly, as our five and two guinea pieces, silver crowns, &c. do in this country. The finest medallions were presented by the mint masters to the emperor, and by the emperor to his friends, as specimens of fine workmanship. The best we have at present are of brads, and many of them composed of two sorts of metal; the centre being copper, with a ring of brads around it, or the contrary; and the inscription is sometimes confined to one of the metals, sometimes not. There is a remarkable difference between the Greek and Roman medallions in point of thickness; the latter being frequently three or four lines thick, while the other seldom exceed one. Very few medallions, however, were struck by the Greeks before the time of the Roman emperors; but the Greek medallions of the emperors are more numerous than\n\n---\n\n(a) This appears on the early coins of Byzantium, with the legend BYZANTIN. ΣΩΤ. \"the preserver of Byzantium.\" The reason of this was, that when Philip of Macedon besieged the city, and was about to storm it in a cloudy night, the moon shone out on a sudden and discovered him; by which means the inhabitants had time to collect their forces and repulse him. The Turks on entering Constantinople, found this badge in many places; and suspecting some magical power in it, assumed the symbol, and its power, to themselves; so that the crescent is now the chief Turkish ensign.\nthole of the Romans themselves. All these pieces, however, are of such high price that few private persons are able to purchase them. In the last century Christina queen of Sweden procured about 300. In the king of France's collection there are 1200; a number formerly supposed not to exist; and Dr Hunter's collection contains about 400, exclusive of the Egyptian.\n\nBesides these large pieces, there are smaller ones, of a size somewhat larger than our half-crowns; and by Italian medallists are called medaglioni cini, or small medallions. They are still scarcer than the large kind.\n\nThere is still a third kind, which have almost escaped the notice of medallists, viz. the small coins or millia scattered among the people on solemn occasions; such as those struck for the slaves on account of the saturnalia; counters for gaming; tickets for baths and feasts; tokens in copper and in lead, &c. These are distinguished by Mr Pinkerton by the name of medalets. Many, or perhaps almost all, of those struck for the saturnalia were satirical; as the slaves had then a license to ridicule not only their masters but any person whatever. Mr Pinkerton mentions one of the most common pieces of this kind, which has on the reverse the head of an old woman veiled, with a laurel crown; the reverse only s. c. within a wreath. Baudelot is of opinion that it is the head of Acca Laurentia, the nurse of Romulus, to whom a festival was ordained. \"Perhaps (says Mr Pinkerton), it was struck in ridicule of Julius Caesar; for the manner of the laurel crown, and its high appearance over the head, perfectly resemble that of Julius on his coins.\" Some have a ship upon one side; on the reverse T, or a crois, which was the image of Priapus; and occasioned many false invectives against the first Christians, who paid such respect to the crois. Some pieces have the heads of the emperors upon one side; on the reverse only numerals, III. IV. V. &c. and the noted spintriai of Tacitus. Both these kinds appear tickets for the baths, as the number seems to denote the particular bath. Some have the head of a girl, with a veil used at the baths in her hand. The spintriai are so immodest, that few will bear mention. But some are merely ludicrous; as one which has an ass with a bell about his neck, and a folder riding him; another with two figures hoisting a woman in a basket into the air. Of those that will just bear mention, is a man with titles around him, as chief of the games; and a woman in ridicule of the modest bath-girl above mentioned. There is also one marked XIX., on which appears an imperator triumphing in a car: this car is placed on the back of a camel; and behind the imperator is a monkey mimicking him.\n\nA fourth class of medals are called contorniati from the Italian contorniato, \"encircled;\" because of the hollow circle which commonly runs around them. They are distinguished from medallions by their thinness, faint relief, reverses sometimes in relief, sometimes hollow; and in general by the inferiority in their workmanship. The opinions of medallists concerning these pieces are very various; some suppose them to have been struck by Gallicius to the memory of illustrious men and celebrated athletes, at the time that he caused all the consecration coins of his predecessors to be restored; others ascribe their invention to Greece, &c. but Mr Pinkerton is of opinion that they were only tickets for places at public games. Many of them, notwithstanding their inferior workmanship, are very valuable on account of their preserving the portraits of some illustrious authors of antiquity, nowhere else to be found. Much dependence, however, cannot be put on the portraits of Greek authors and eminent men found upon some of them; for though we know that the busts of Sallust, Horace, &c. must have been struck when their persons were fresh in the memory of the artists, yet it was otherwise with Homer, Solon, Pythagoras, &c. which are to be found on some of them. Even these, however, are valuable, as being ancient and perhaps traditional portraits of these great men. The last whose portraits are supposed to have been delineated in this way, are Apollonius Tyaneus who flourished in the time of Domitian, and Apuleius in that of Marcus Antoninus. Mr Pinkerton thinks it a confirmation of his opinion concerning these medals, that the reverses always contain some device alluding to public games, as that of a charioteer driving a chariot, &c.\n\nSect. XII. Directions for making Cabinets.\n\nWe must now proceed to the last part of our subject, viz. that of giving directions for the formation of cabinets. As we have already seen that the formation of any one must be attended with very considerable expense, it is necessary for every one who attempts this to proportion the cabinet to his own circumstances. There are, properly speaking, three kinds of cabinets. 1. Those meant to contain a coin of every sort that has been issued from the mint in every age and country; but this, which may be called the large and complete cabinet, is not to be purchased by private persons. That of Dr Hunter already mentioned is perhaps one of the best private cabinets ever known; and cost £2,000, but as many duplicates were sold as cost £200, by which means the expense was reduced to £1,800. The vast collection made by the king of France cost upwards of £10,000. 2. The smaller cabinet may be supposed to consist only of middle and small Roman brats, English pennies, groats, &c. with a few medals of the more valuable kind, and may be supposed to incur an expense of from £200. to £100. 3. The smallest kind is called a cabinet of medals, and does not consist of above £50 at most of various kinds; and consequently the expense must depend on the pleasure of the proprietor.\n\nIn the formation of the grand cabinet, it must be observed that the Greek medals of every denomination do not admit of any arrangement by the metals like the Romans; nor any regular series of this kind being met with even in the most opulent cabinets. Hence in all collections the civic coins are ranged according to an alphabetical order; and the monarchic in a chronological one. The same rule is to be observed in the Roman consular medals; they are ranged, like the coins of the Greek cities, in an alphabetical series of the families. The Roman imperial coins are only\nMEDALS.\n\nDirections only those capable of being arranged according to sizes for making and metals. Even from this must be excepted the Cabinets minimi, or very smallest coins; which are so scarce, that the only regular series of them in the world is that belonging to the king of Spain, which was formed by a most skilful French medallist, and consists of all the metals. The arrangement of a grand cabinet, according to Mr Pinkerton, is as follows.\n\n\"I. The coins of cities and of free states in alphabetical order: whether using Greek, Roman, Punic, Etruscan, or Spanish characters.\n\n\"II. Kings in chronological series, both as to foundation of empire and seniority of reign.\n\n\"III. Heroes, heroines, founders of empires, and cities.\n\n\"IV. Other illustrious persons.\n\n\"V. Roman aces.\n\n\"VI. Coins of families, commonly called consular.\n\n\"VII. Imperial medallions.\n\n\"VIII. Imperial gold.\n\n\"IX. Imperial minimi of all metals.\n\n\"X. Imperial silver.\n\n\"XI. Imperial first brats.\n\n\"XII. Second brats.\n\n\"XIII. Third brats.\n\n\"XIV. Colonial coins, which are all of brats.\n\n\"XV. Greek cities under the emperors, of all metals and sizes. In a smaller cabinet they may be put with the Roman, according to their metal and size. Those without the emperor's head go to class I., though struck in Roman times.\n\n\"XVI. Egyptian coins struck under the Roman emperors, of all metals and sizes. They are mostly of a base metal called by the French patin; it is a kind of pot-metal or brittle brats.\n\n\"XVII. Contorniati, or ticket medals.\n\n\"XVIII. Coins of Gothic princes, &c., inscribed with Roman characters.\n\n\"XIX. Coins of southern nations using uncommon alphabets; as the Persian, Punic, Etruscan, and Spanish.\n\n\"XX. Coins of northern nations using uncommon characters, as the Runic and German.\n\n\"In the modern part no series can be formed of copper that will go back above two centuries; but sequences (chronological series) of gold and silver may be arranged of all the different empires, kingdoms, and states, as far as their several coining will allow. Those of England and France will be the most perfect. Modern silver is commonly arranged in three sequences; the dollar, the groat, and the penny sizes. The medals of each modern country ought of course to be separated; though it is best to arrange each set in chronological order, let their size of metal be what they will. It may be remarked here, that our modern medals, of the size of a tea-saucer, are only so many monuments of barbarism. The ancient medallions are almost universally but little larger than our crown-piece, though three or four of them may extend to about two inches diameter, but very many modern medals to four inches and more. A large medal always declares an ignorant prince or an ignorant artist. Into the size of a crown-piece the ancients threw more miracles in this way than will ever appear in these monstrous productions.\"\n\nVol.XIII. Part I.\n\nThese directions will likewise apply to the formation of a cabinet of the second kind: but if the collector means to form a series of large Roman brats, he will find the coins of four or five emperors to scarce as not to be attainable in that series, even at any price. He must therefore supply their places with middle brats, as is allowed with regard to Otto, even in the best cabinets; there not being above three coins of that emperor in large brats known in the world: whereas of the middle brats, two or three hundred may exist. For this reason Mr Pinkerton concludes, that in cabinets of the second class, the collector may mingle the large and second brats together as he thinks proper, in order to save expense; though it would not do so well to unite such disproportionate sizes as the large and small. \"In the small sequence, however (says he), there can be no harm in his mixing gold, silver, and brats, as chance or curiosity may lead him to purchase any of these metals. And though your starched bigotted medallist may sneer because such a sequence would controvert his formal and narrow way of thinking, common sense will authorize us to laugh at the pedant in our turn, and to pronounce such a series more various, rich, and interesting, than if the collector had arranged only one metal, and rejected a curious article because he did not collect gold or silver. In like manner, if, in the modern part of the smaller cabinet, any coin of a series is of high price, or of bad impression, there can be no impropriety in putting another of the same reign, which is cheaper, or better executed, though of a different denomination or of a little larger size. In short, the collector has no rules but in the Greek cities and Roman families, to observe alphabetical order and chronology in every thing else.\n\nTABLES OF ANCIENT COINS.\n\nThe most ancient coins, according to Froelich, are distinguished by the following marks, which he accounts infallible. 1. Their oval circumference, and globulous swelling shape. 2. Antiquity of alphabet. 3. The characters being retrograde, or the first division of the legend in the common style, while the next is retrograde. 4. The indented square already described. 5. The simple structure of the mintage. 6. Some of the very old coins are hollowed on the reverse, with the image impressed on the front. 7. The dyes, symbols, &c., frequently of the rudest design and execution.\n\nTABLE I. ANCIENT GREEK COINS.\n\n1. Those without impression.\n2. With one or more hollow indented marks on one side, and an impression in relief on the other.—Of Chalcedon on the Hellefoint, Lebos, Abdera in Thrace, Acanthus in Macedon, those said to belong to Egius in Achaia. This class continues from about 900 to 700 B.C.\n3. With an indented square divided into segments, having a small figure in one of them; the rest blank, with a figure in relief on the obverse.—Of Syracuse and other places adjacent.—Continue from 700 to 600 B.C.\n4. Coins hollow on the reverse, with figures in relief on the obverse.—Of Caulonia, Crotona, Metapontum, &c. Supposed by some to be a local coinage of Magna Graecia; but probably of equal antiquity with the former.\n\n5. Coins in which a square die is used on one or both sides.—Of Athens, Cyrene, Argos, &c.—Of Alexander I. and Archelaus I. of Macedon. Diffused in the reign of the latter about 420 B.C.\n\n6. Complete coins, both in obverse and reverse, occur first in Sicily in the time of Gelo, about 491 B.C.\n\n7. Coins of Alexander the Great and his successors. About the time of this hero the Greek coins began to attain to perfection, and were struck of uncommon beauty. It is remarkable, that on the coins of this monarch his own image seldom occurs. The only one yet found of Alexander with his portrait upon it, and struck during his reign, is a silver hemidrachm in Dr Hunter's cabinet, which is represented Plate CCCXXXI. No. 3. After his death many coins bear his portrait. Trebellius Pollio informs us, that some coins, particularly those of Alexander, used to be worn as amulets; and many medals are met with in cabinets, bored seemingly with that intention.\n\n8. Coins of the Successors of Alexander.—Those of the Syrian monarchs almost equi the coins of Alexander himself in beauty. Those of Antiochus VI. are supposed to be the most perfect patterns of male beauty to be met with anywhere. The Egyptian Ptolemies are somewhat inferior.\n\n9. The coins of the Arsacidæ of Parthia done by Greek workmen.\n\n10. The Greek imperial coins, being such as have the head of an emperor or empress: such as have not these imperfections being clasped with the civic coins, though struck under the Roman power. None of the imperial coins occur in gold. Of silver there are those of Antioch, Tyre, Sidon, Tarsus, Berytus, Caesarea. Egyptian silver coins of base metal. Syrian silver coins, which sometimes bear on the reverse the club of Hercules, or the Tyrian shell-fish. Those of Sidon bear the image of the goddess Astarte, or her chariot. Those of Caesarea in Cappadocia of better work than the Syrian Lycian coins of good workmanship: on the reverse two harps and an owl fitting upon them. Silver coins of Gelon in Sarmatia resembling the Syrian. The situation of this town is very much unknown. It seems to have been situated on the north of the Euxine sea, where some Sarmatic or Slavonic tribes were mingled with the Scythians or Goths. The Greek imperial brats coins are very numerous. A series of almost all the emperors may be had from those of Antioch, with a Latin legend on the obverse and Greek on the reverse. Those of Bithynia and Phrygia remarkable for good workmanship. The coins of Tarsus remarkable for their curious views of objects, almost in perspective. The Egyptian coins, from the time of Augustus to Nero, are worse executed than afterwards. From Nero to Commodus they are frequently of admirable workmanship, and in a peculiar style, distinct both from the Greek and Roman. From the time of Commodus they decline, and are lost after the reign of Constantius I. The Egyptian brats coins of the Roman period are likewise of excellent workmanship, especially in the time of Antoninus Pius.\n\n**Table II. Roman Coins.**\n\nI. The consular coins, called also the coins of families, and arranged alphabetically in cabinets, according to the names of the families which appear on them. They are,\n\n1. **Brass Coins.**—These consist chiefly of large pieces of rude workmanship without any interesting imagery. In cabinets they are generally kept in boxes apart by themselves. The as bears the head of Janus; the semis of Jupiter with S; the triens of Minerva with four cyphers; the quadrans of Hercules with three cyphers; the sextans of Mercury with two cyphers; and the uncia bears the head of Rome with one cypher. In all these pieces the prow of a ship is constantly the figure on the reverse, with very few exceptions. Sometimes indeed they have a shell, two heads of barley, a frog, an anchor, or a dog, on the reverse. About the time of Julius Caesar both the obverses and the reverses of the coins began to be altered.\n\n2. **Silver.**—Of this the denarius was the first and principal coin. It was stamped originally with X, denoting that the value was ten ases. On the reverse was Caius and Pollux, or a chariot of Victory. Afterwards the busts of various deities make their appearance; and in the seventh century of Rome the portraits of illustrious persons deceased are met with; but till the time of Julius Caesar no figure of any living person is to be met with; Julius himself being the first who assumed that honour. The workmanship on the best and worst silver is much the same. The reverses are very curious, and point out many remarkable events in Roman history; but none of these occur till about a century before the Christian era. The large denarii, with Roma, are the most ancient; and some of these bear the Pelasgic A, not the Roman. The silver sestertii have a head of Mercury, with a caduceus on the reverse. The quinarii have always a head of Jupiter, with a Victory on the reverse.\n\n3. **Gold.**—Most of these are of great value. The number of these exceeds not 100; those of brass 200; and of silver 2000. The aureus is the general gold coin; but two or three gold sestertii of families likewise occur.\n\nII. Roman imperial coins.\n\n1. **Brass.**—This is of three sizes; large, middle, and small. The first forms a most beautiful series, but very expensive. The various colours of the patina have the finest effect. It is the most important of all the Roman coins, and exceeds even the gold in value.\n\nThe middle brass is next in value to the former; and in it are many rare and curious coins, particularly interesting to Britons, as elucidating the history of the island. Of these are the triumphal arch of Claudius; the Exerc. Britannicus of Adrian; the coins of Antoninus Pius, Commodus, Severus, with a Victory, Victoria Britan.; but especially those personifying the country Britannia. \"The number of Roman coins relating to Britain (says Mr Pinkerton) is remarkable; more than 20 having been struck at various times; while those personifying Italy, Gaul, Spain,\nSpain, and other regions of the empire, exceed not four or five at most for each country.\" Only one country vies with Britain, and that is Dacia on the extreme north east of the empire, as Britain on the extreme north-west. No doubt this circumstance of remoteness in these two countries recommended them to this particular attention; as more expressive of the Roman power.\n\nThe small brass series abounds also with curious coins. They are scarce till the time of Valerian and Gallienus, but very common afterwards. Mr Pinkerton recommends, therefore, to form a series in silver as well as brass; both being the cheapest of all the Roman coins. \"In this series (says he), it is a common fault to arrange many coins which have been plated with gold or silver, the forgeries of ancient times, but which time has worn off either wholly or in part.\" All real brass coins have the s.c. till the time of Gallienus; as the senate alone had the power of striking brass, while the emperor himself had that of gold and silver. When the s.c. therefore, is wanting, the coin was certainly once plated; as, in general, the different type and fabric, being those of gold and silver, sufficiently show themselves. With Pertinax, A.D. 192, there is a temporary cessation of small brass; nor after him do any princes occur in that series till Valerian, A.D. 254, excepting Trajanus Decius, A.D. 250 only. After Valerian the series is continuous and common. The brass coinage gradually declined in size from the time of Severus; so that parts of the as could not be struck, or at least it was held unnecessary to strike them. Trajanus Decius attempted in vain to restore the coinage; and Valerian and Gallienus were forced to issue denarii scrii and small auriarii. The series of large and of middle brass are of two fixed and known sizes; the former about that of our crown, the latter of the half crown; though after Severus they gradually lessen. But the small brass takes in all parts of the as; and every brass coin not larger than our shilling belongs to this series. The minims, indeed, or very smallest, it is proper to keep apart. The coins of Julius Caesar in this size are of peculiarly fine workmanship. They bear his portrait reverse of Augustus, or the reverse a crocodile.\n\nThere are several with Mark Antony, and some with Cleopatra; but the more common pieces are those with only numerals on the obverse, which go the length of XIII; probably tickets for the baths. A great many occur in the time of Nero; of which Mr Pinkerton particularizes one which has \"on the reverse a table ornamented with griffins and other devices. Upon it is placed a wreath of laurel, and a beautiful vale, of which the embossed human figures are so minute, and finished so surprisingly, as to stamp these coins the most exquisite productions of the ancient mint.\" From the time of Nero to that of Vespasian no small brass occurs: but there are many of this emperor and of his son Titus; while Domitian has as many as Nero, and Domitia his wife has almost as many. Succeeding emperors to the time of Pertinax have also many brass coins; but from his time to that of Valerian there are no real small brass, excepting those of Trajanus Decius. After Gallienus there are a great many coins of this kind; and Mr Pinkerton mentions one in Dr Hunter's cabinet, of an unknown person named Nigrianus. The coin seems to have been struck at Carthage; and our author concludes that he was an African usurper, father to Nigrianus.\n\n2. Silver.—This series is very complete, and the cheapest of any; especially as the small brass becomes a fine supplement to it; the latter being had in plenty when the silver became scarce, and the silver being plentiful when the brass is scarce.\n\n3. Gold.—The Roman imperial gold coins form a series of great beauty and perfection; but on account of their great price, are beyond the purchase of private persons.\n\n4. The colonial coins occur only in brass; none, excepting that of Nemausus, having a right to coin silver. They begin in Spain with Julius Caesar and Antony, and cease with Caligula, who took away the privilege of coining from the Spanish colonies. The most beautiful are those of Corinth. The other remarkable colonial coins are those of Emerita, Illice, Terraco, Caesandra, Babba, Berytus, Caesarea, Patrae, Emilia, Heliopolis or Balbec, Ptolemais, Sidon, Tyre, Deultum, Dium, Troas, Rhenaina, Neapolis of Samaria, which bears a representation of Mount Gerizzim with the temple on it, Hippo in Africa, &c. On many of these coins we meet with fine representations of temples, triumphal arches, gods, goddesses, and illustrious persons. But coins with these representations are by no means common; the colonial coins till the time of Trajan bearing only a plough, or some other simple badge of a colony. Camelodunum is the only colony in Britain of which we have any coins.\n\n5. The minims.—This includes the smallest coins of all denominations, most of which do not exceed the size of a silver penny. They are the most curious of all; but no series of them was ever formed by any person except the abbé Rothelin, whose collection formed of all metals passed to the queen of Spain. The reason of the scarcity of these small coins is probably their diminutive size; by reason of which they are mostly lost.\n\nIt is surprising that numbers of Roman coins are found through all countries once subject to that powerful people. Some have been met with in the Orkneys, and many in the most remote parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, known to the ancients.\n\nTable III. Coins of other ancient Nations.\n\n1. The Lydians appear to have invented coinage; though, perhaps, this honour may be disputed with them by the Greeks.\n\n2. The Assyrians, Medes, Babylonians, Phoenicians, and Egyptians, had no coins. In the mouths of the mummies are only thin, unstamped, and round pieces of gold, to pay Charon's fare.\n\n3. No Indian or Chinese coins are to be met with till a very late period; and even then so rude as scarce to be worth notice. Voltaire mentions a collection of ancient Chinese and Indian coins made by the emperor of China in 1700; but Mr Pinkerton supposes it to have consisted only of the Greek and Roman money which had been introduced into these countries.\n\n4. The Lydian coins have no legends; so that mere conjecture only determines the ancient coins of electrum and\nAncient Coins.\n\nand silver found in Asia, and different from the Persian, to belong to Lydia. Croesus coined gold into a form which he called staters; and Mr. Pinkerton mentions a very ancient gold coin in Dr Hunter's cabinet, which he supposes to have been one of these. It has a globous figure, with indented marks on one side, and on the other a man kneeling, with a fish held out in the left hand, and a sword depending in the right. It weighs four drachms; which Josephus tells us was the weight of the Lydian gold coins. In the same collection are other gold coins little inferior in antiquity; the most ancient of which, our author supposes, may have been coined by the cities of Asia Minor, as coinage passed through them to Greece. They are admirable workmanship, and as much superior to the best Sicilian coins, as the latter are to all the rest in the world. These gold coins are all extremely pale; owing to the want of knowledge in refining gold.\n\n5. Persian coins.—These were first struck by Darius Hyrcan, whence they had the name of darics. They are of gold, and generally have the figure of an archer: they weigh about four drachms; and some occur with the indented mark on one side, while others have figures upon both. The silver coins have generally a king in a chariot of two horses, with a charioteer, and sometimes another figure on foot behind, on the obverse; while the reverse presents a ship, sometimes a ram, bull, or other animal. The gold coins, which only had the title of darics, are extremely scarce, having been melted down, as is supposed, and recoinied by Alexander the Great on his conquest of Asia.\n\nThere is a second series of Persian coins beginning with Artaxares, or Artaxerxes, who overthrew the Parthian monarchy about the year 210. These are large and thin, with the king's bust on one side and the altar of Mithras on the other; generally with a human figure on each side. These coins continue till the year 636, when Persia was conquered by the Saracens. These have only Persian letters upon them, which have never been explained by any antiquaries. Mr Pinkerton says that they seem to partake of the ancient Greek, Gothic, and Alanic.\n\n6. The Hebrew shekels, originally didrachms, but after the time of the Maccabees tetradrachms, are almost all forgeries of modern Jews, as well as the brafs coins with Samaritan characters upon them. They have all a sprig upon one side and a vase on the other. Mr Pinkerton says, that the admission of one of them into a cabinet would almost be a disgrace to it.\n\n7. Phoenician and Punic coins are very interesting on account of the great power and wealth of these nations. The alphabets have been cleared by their relation to the Hebrew and Syriac languages.\n\n8. The coins of Palmyra come under the same denomination with the former, Palmyra being a Syrian city.\n\n9. The Etruscan coins have the characters of that nation, which have been explained by their affinity to the Pelasgic, or oldest Greek and Latin.\n\n10. The Spanish coins are inscribed with two or three alphabets allied to the old Greek or Punic; but the inscriptions have not been sufficiently explained.\n\n11. Gaulish coins.—These are numerous; but the most ancient have no legends; and even after the Greek letters were introduced into Gaul by a colony at Marfelles, the legends are very difficult to be explained.\n\n12. British coins.—From a passage in Caesar's Commentaries, it has been inferred that the Britons used some kind of coins even in his time. Mr Pinkerton informs us, that some rude coins of copper very much mingled with tin are frequently found in England; which, he supposes, may be some of the ancient British money. They are of the size of a didrachm, the common form of the nummus aureus among the ancients. After the time of Caesar, coinage increased among the Britons; and there are many found of Cunobelinus mentioned in the Roman history. Most of these have on one side CUNO, with an ear of wheat, a horse, a kind of head of Janus, or other symbol; and have frequently also the letters CAMU, supposed to mean Camelodunum. Sometimes the word TASCIA occurs; the meaning of which has not yet been explained.\n\n13. Gothic coins of France, Italy, and Spain, to the time of Charles the Great. These have the Roman characters upon them. The Italian coins are mostly of the size of small brafs; and in this way we meet with coins of Athalaric, Theodahat, Wittigez, and other Gothic princes. Many others occur, the inscriptions of which, though meant for Roman, are so perverted as to be illegible.\n\nTable IV. Modern Coins.\n\n1. Of Japan.—These are thin plates of gold and silver, of an oval figure, with small marks or figures stamped on them.\n\n2. China.—These are only copper, about the size of a farthing, with a square hole in the middle to put them on strings. The inscriptions on them do not express the name of the sovereign, but the year of his reign; as the happy year, the illustrious year, &c.\n\n3. The Tartarian coins are rude, having only inscriptions upon them; and they are all posterior to the time of Jenghiz khan.\n\n4. Coins of Thibet, Pegu, and Siam, are much the same, presenting only inscriptions without any figures. They are all of late date.\n\n5. India.—Some old coins have been found in the neighbourhood of Calcutta, of gold, silver, copper, and tin, all mixed together. These have commonly a warrior with a sword on one side, and an Indian female idol on the other, of the same form with the celebrated sculptures in the island of Elephanta; but it is impossible to tell what antiquity they are of. The modern coins are the pagoda of gold, worth little more than six shillings; the rouppee of silver upwards of two shillings; and the cash, of copper. There is a remarkable set of rouppees, which show the twelve signs; a lion on one, a bull on another, &c., but the occasion on which they were struck is unknown. The other coins of India have generally Persian inscriptions upon them.\n\n6. Persia.—The Peric coins since its conquest by the Arabs continue on the Arabian model.\n\n7. Arabia.—Some coins of the petty princes of Arabia are met with as old as the imperial ages of Rome; but till the time of Haroun Alraflhid, no regular\nModern coinage appears in the vast empire of the Saracens. Even then the reverse has only an inscription, and the obverse is copied from any Greek or Syrian coin which happened to fall in the moneyer's way. The later Arabian coins are mostly silver, with the name and titles of the prince on one side, and some inscription from the Koran on the other. The more modern coins of this country are in the shape of a fishhook, with Arabic inscriptions.\n\n8. Turkey.—No regular coinage was formed by the Turks till they became masters of Constantinople. They resemble those of Persia and Arabia, having merely inscriptions on both sides.\n\n9. The coins of the African states, at least such as profess the Mohammedan religion, have merely inscriptions without any figures; those of the internal parts are unknown; and no coinage was used among the Mexicans and Peruvians, the only civilized nations in America; but La Hontan mentions an American savage who had a square medal of copper depending from his neck. Mr Pinkerton supposes it to have come from Japan.\n\n10. Modern Italic coins. Besides the Gothic princes mentioned in the former table, the archbishops of Ravenna coined money with the inscription Felix Ravenna, &c. The Lombards issued no coins, but there are some still extant of Charlemagne. The following list shows the origin of the coinage in various Italian states.\n\nRome.—Papal coinage originates with Hadrian I. Size of silver pennies, with the Pope's name on one side, and Scos Petrus on the other. No coins appear from 975 to 1099, excepting of Leo IX. In 1323 appear pennies of the senate and people of Rome, with Peter on the one side and Paul on the other. There are groats of Clement V. with his portrait three quarters length; but the side-head begins with Sixtus V. in 1470. Gold was first coined by John XXII. in 1316. The coins of Alexander VI., Julius II., and Leo X. are remarkable for beauty and elegance.\n\nMilan.—Coinage began with Charlemagne. The first coin of the family of Visconti occurs in 1330 under Azo. The first florins with Louis XII.\n\nNaples.—Coinage begins in 840 and 880, with Duke Sergius and Bishop Athanasius. The next coins are of Roger of Sicily, and Roger II. in 1130, William I., II., and Tancred. Naples and Sicily were subdued in 1194 by the emperor of Germany; in 1255 Manfred appears; in 1266 Charles of Provence; and others till John in 1414; after which follow the house of Arragon, and later kings.\n\nVenice begins in the 10th century. The first coins are silver pennies marked Veneti. Then follow the coins of Henrico Dandulo in 1192, of Ziani in 1255, &c. Gold was first coined at Venice in 1283, and copper in 1471; but the silver groats are as old as 1192.\n\nFlorence.—Silver was coined here in the 12th century, or before; but in 1252 the first gold coins struck in Europe after the 8th century made their appearance, and were named florins from the flower of the lily upon them. They were imitated by the popes, by France, and England. They have on one side St John the Baptist standing, on the other a large fleur de lis, and it is not doubted that the French fleurs de lis took their origin from these coins. They weigh a drachm, and are no less than 24 carats fine, according to Italian writers, and are worth about 12 shillings.\n\nGeneva first began to coin money in 1129, under the government of Conrad. Those of the dukes of Savoy began in the same century.\n\nAquitania. Coins were issued from this city by the patriarchs from 1204 to 1440.\n\nFerrara. Coins of the marquises from 1340.\n\n11. French coins. During the race of Clovis, from 490 till 751, the coins are chiefly gold trientes, with some solidi and semissis. The former are of good workmanship, with the heads of kings. The reverse has a crois, with the name of the town where they were struck.\n\nThe coins of the second race begin with Pepin in 751, and continue till Hugh Capet in 987. The coins of the first race are elegant, but those of the second entirely the reverse, being almost all silver pennies, and seldom bearing the portrait of the king. Those of Charlemagne have only Carolus in the field; while the reverse bears R. F., or some such inscription; though one piece struck at Rome has a rude bust of him. The coins of Louis le Debonnaire are better done.\n\nThe third race begins with Hugh Capet in 987, and extends to this time. The coinage did not begin to improve till 1226 under St Louis, when the groat appears. Its name in Italian is groto, in French grois, in English groat, or great coin; so called from its size in comparison with the penny; and it passed from Italy to France, to Germany, and to England. After the conquest of France by the English, base coins of many kinds were introduced; and in the year 1574, in the time of Henry III., copper was first introduced into the French coinage. Besides these, the other remarkable coins of France are, the blancs or billon groats, first issued in 1348; the ecus a la couronne, or crowns of gold, so called from the crown on one side, and begun by Charles VI. in 1384; those of Ann of Bretagne in 1498; the tefton, or piece with the king's head, of Louis XII.; the Henri of Henry II., with Gaul sitting in armour, and a Victory in her hand. There are many coins of Cardinal Bourbon, elected king in 1589; and in 1642, Louis XIV. takes the title of Catalonian Princeps. The first louis d'or made its appearance in 1640; but such was the poverty of France, if we believe certain authors, that in 1719 the duke of Orleans regent struck copper for silver.\n\n12. Spanish coins. The most early series of these coins is almost entirely of trientes, finely done. On one side they have the head of the king with his name, and on the other a crois, with the name of the town, commonly in Bética, or the fourth part of Spain, where there were a great many Roman colonies, and which was fertile to a proverb. The Moorish coins of Spain, like those of the rest of the Mohammedan states, present us only with insipid inscriptions on both sides. Indeed the Mohammedan religion, by its absolute refusal to allow the representation of any living creature, has prevented the progress of coinage in any degree throughout those regions which it has overpread.\nThe inscriptions on the ancient Spanish coins are in the Cufic or old Arabic characters.\n\n13. Portugal. No description of the coins of this kingdom has yet appeared.\n\n14. Germany. No account of the German coins has been published; though it is well known that not only the emperors, but many of the cities, particularly those called Hansa-towns, issued money; and many of the coins issued by the cities were superior in elegance even to those issued by the emperors.\n\n15. Denmark. Here the coinage begins with Canute the Great in 1014. The pieces are at first extremely rude, ornamented only with rings and Runic characters. These are succeeded by copper pieces, some of which have a cross, others a pastoral staff, on one side, with the letter A on the other. Later coins have strokes IIII, &c., all round them; but those of Harold, Hardicanute, and Magnus Bonus, in 1041, are of neat workmanship, and have the portraits of the princes at half length. The coins of Nicolas, or Niel, as he is called by the Danes, are rude, as well as those of Waldemar I. and the celebrated Margaret. In 1376 Olaf caused money to be struck with a grinning full face, with a crowned O upon the other side.\n\n\"The Swedes (says Mr Pinkerton) took these coins extremely ill, as they thought they grinned at them.\"\n\nSilver was first coined in Denmark by Philippa queen of Eric, and daughter to Henry IV. of England.\n\n16. Sweden. The coinage of this kingdom began in 818 under Biorino, on the plan of Charlemagne. The coins are marked with a cross. Next follow those of Olaf in 1019; which Mr Pinkerton supposes to have been the first true Swedish coins; and that the art of coinage first passed from England into Denmark in the time of Canute the Great, and from Denmark into Sweden. These coins were struck on the English model. During the time that Sweden was subject to Denmark, or miserably harassed by the Danes, the coins of both kingdoms were the same; but after the time of Gustavus Vasa many elegant pieces appear. In 1634, dollars were coined with the portrait of Gustavus Adolphus, who was killed two years before: on the reverse they have the arms of Sweden, with the chemical marks of mercury and sulphur. In 1716, 1717, and 1718, Charles XII. being in extreme want of money, issued small copper coins with Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, &c., upon them, to go for dollars; and on account of this scheme, Baron Goertz, the suggestor of it, was brought to the block.\n\n17. Norway. The coins of this country begin with Olaf in 1006; after which time there are various coins of other princes; but copper was not coined till the year 1343.\n\nBesides the coins already mentioned, there are ecclesiastic coins of France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, &c. Those of Denmark and Sweden are numerous, but the Norwegian coins of this denomination are rare. Mr Pinkerton describes a silver one in his possession as having arms and a mitre, with the inscription on one side, Sanctus Olaws Rex Norvegy; on the reverse, Olaws Dei Gra. Arcep. Nid'sen, meaning Nidrosiensis, or archbishop of Nidros, now Drontheim.\n\n18. Bohemia. The coinage of this kingdom appears at a very early date, viz. in the year 929, under Duke Boleslaus I. These coins are followed by others of Boleslaus II. and Emma his wife in 970; of Boleslaus III. in 1002; Jaromir in 1020; Udalrich in 1030; and other princes. The bracteate money of Ottocar I. was coined in 1197.\n\n19. Poland. The coinage of this country is nearly as ancient as that of Bohemia. The coins are on the German model, but no particular account of them has been published.\n\n20. Russia. None of the Russian money appears to be more ancient than the 13th century. The first are the kopkeks or silver pennies, which have upon them rude figures of animals on one side, and a man standing with a bow or spear on the other. There are likewise coins of Mofcow struck by Aribozotes the architect in 1482. The roubles or dollars and their allies. There are some of the impostor Demetrius in 1605, which are very scarce.\n\n21. Prussia. The first Prussian coins were struck at Culm by the Teutonic knights in 1230. They were silver pennies, and upon the German plan. In the next century were struck shillings, groats, and schots; the last were the largest, and are extremely rare. They have the Prussian shield, an eagle surmounting a cross, with a rose-shaped border, MONETA DOMINORUM PRUSSIAE: on the reverse is a cross fleur-de-lis, within a border of a similar kind, having the inscription HONOR MAGISTRI, JUSTITIAM DILIGET.—Gold coins were struck in the same century. In the time of Copernicus the money was so debased, that 12 or 13 marks were worth but one of pure silver.\n\n22. England. The English coins are of various kinds.\n\n1st. Heptarchie. These are only of two sorts, viz. the fleatta or penny of silver, and the flyca of copper. Few of the pennies appear till after the year 700; though some are met with which bear the name of Ethelbert I. king of Kent, as old as 560. At first they had only rude figures of serpents, but in latter times legends were likewise added. Most of these pennies have pagan symbols upon them. The flyca was only coined in Northumberland, and was a very small piece, about the value of half a farthing.\n\n2nd. Coins of the chief monarchs of England. Mr Pinkerton denies that an end was put to the heptarchy by Egbert in 832, as is commonly supposed; though he owns that he was chief monarch of the country, as several others had been before him. Edgar, who reigned in 959, according to him, was the first king of England; and the coins of the chief monarchs form almost a complete series from the time of Egbert to Edgar. The only chief monarch of whom there are no coins is Ethelbald, who reigned in 857. Most of these coins bear rude portraits; but the reverses are sometimes curious and interesting. Some have views of cathedrals and other buildings; particularly one of Edward the Elder in 900; which has the cathedral of York with three rows of windows, round arched as the other Saxon and Norman buildings: the Gothic arch being quite unknown till after the 12th century. Some coins of Anlaf king of Northumberland have the famous raven, the Danish ensign: and\nthose of other princes have frequently very curious reverses.\n\n3rd. Ecclesiastic coins appear of the archbishops of Canterbury, Wulfred in 804, Ceolnoth in 830, and Plegmund in 889.\n\n4th. Coins of the kings of England. The silver penny, which had begun during the heptarchy, continued to be the general coin after the kingdom had been united under one head; and extends in a continued series from Egbert almost to the present reign. The only kings wanting are Edmund Ironside, Richard I., and John. At first the penny weighed 22½ grains; but towards the close of the reign of Edward III. it fell to 18 grams; and in that of Edward IV. to 12. In the time of Edward VI. it was diminished to 8 grams; and in Queen Elizabeth's reign to 7½; at which it still continues.\n\nHalfpennies and farthings were first struck in silver by Edward I. in 1280; the former continued to the time of the commonwealth, but the latter ceased with Edward VI. The groat was introduced by Edward III. in 1354, and continues to this day, though not in common circulation. The half-groat or two-pence is of the same date, and also continues to the present time.\n\nShillings were first coined by Henry VII. in 1503. At first it was called teloon, from the teote, tete, or head of the king upon it; the name shilling being derived from the German schilling; under which appellation coins had been struck at Hamburgh in 1407. The crown was first coined in its present form by Henry VIII. Formerly it had appeared only in gold, whence the phrase of crowns of gold; though these indeed were the largest gold coins known for a long time in France and other countries on the continent, being worth about 10s. sterling. They had their name from the crown stamped on one side, and were first coined by Charles VI. in 1384, and continued till the time of Louis XIV. The half-crown, sixpence, and threepence, were coined by Edward VI. In 1558 Queen Elizabeth coined three halfpenny, and in 1561 three farthing pieces; but they were discontinued in 1582. From the year 1601 to the present time the coins of England remain the same.\n\nGold was coined in England by Henry III. in 1257; the piece was called a gold penny, and was larger than the silver one; and the execution is by no means bad for the time. The series of gold coinage, however, commences properly from Edward III. In 1344, this monarch first struck florins, in imitation of those in Italy; and it is remarkable, that though these coins at the time they were first issued bore only five shillings value, they are now intrinsically worth 19½; so much has the value of gold increased since that time. The half and quarter florin were struck at the same time, but only the last has been found. The florin, however, being found inconvenient, gave place to the noble of 6s. 8d. value, and exactly half a mark. The latter had its name from being a limited sum in accounts; and was eight ounces in weight, two thirds of the money pound. It is sometimes also called solidus, as being one half of the commercial pound of 16 ounces. The noble had its name from the nobility of the metal; the gold of which it was coined being of the finest sort. Sometimes it was called rofe noble, from both sides being impaled in an undulating circle. It continued with the half and quarter noble to be the only gold coin till the angels of Edward IV. appeared in 1465. These had their name from being stamped with the image of Michael and the dragon. The angels of 3s. 4d. value were substituted in their place. In 1527 Henry VIII. added to the gold coined the crown and half-crown at their present value; and the same year he gave sovereigns of 2½s. 6½l. and ryals of 1½s. 3½d. angels at 7½. 6½d. and nobles at their old value of 6s. 8½d. In 1546 he caused sovereigns to be coined of the value of 2½s. and half-sovereigns in proportion. His gold crown is about the size of our threepence, and the half-crown of sixpence, but thin. All his coins, however, gold as well as silver, are much debased; and it was not without much labour and trouble that Edward VI. brought it back to its former standard. On the union of the two crowns, James gave the sovereign the name of unite; the value continuing of 2½s. as before. He coined also rofe-ryals of 3½s. value, spurials of 1½s. angels of 1½s. and angelets of ½s. Under the commonwealth, the sovereign got the name of the twenty-shilling piece, and continued current till the coinage of guineas. These were so called from their being coined of Guinea gold, and were at first only to go for 2½s. though by an universal but tacit consent they always passed for 2½s. Half-guineas, double guineas, and five guinea pieces, were also coined during the same reign; which still continue, though the two latter are not in common circulation. Quarter guineas were coined by George I. and likewise by his present majesty; but they were found too troublesome on account of their small size, that they were stopped within a year or two, when received at the bank of England, and thus are not to be met with at present. A few pieces of ½s. value have likewise been coined, and are known by the lion above the helmet; but none have been issued. In 1688 the guinea rose to 2½s. 6½d. and continued to increase in value till 1696, when it was as high as 3½s.; but after the recoinage in 1697 and 1698 it fell by degrees, and in 1717 was at its old standard of 2½s. and at that time silver was fixed at its present standard value, viz. as 1 to 15½ in weight.\n\nThough the first money coined in Britain, as we have already observed, was copper, yet, excepting the Northumbrian sycas, no copper coin was found in England from the time of the Saxon conquest till the year 1672. An aversion to a copper coinage it seems was prevalent throughout the nation; and Queen Elizabeth, who without hesitation used base money for Ireland, yet scrupled at coining copper for England. This want of small coin occasioned such an increase of private tokens for halfpennies and farthings, that it became a serious object to government; and in 1594 a copper coinage was seriously thought of. This year a small copper coin was struck about the size of a silver twopence, with the queen's monogram on one side, and a rofe on the other; the running legend on both sides being THE PLEDGE OF A HALFPENNY. Of this there are patterns both in copper and silver, but both of them soon fell into disuse. On the 19th of May 1613, King James by royal proclamation issued farthing tokens. They are generally of the same size with the two pence, with two sceptres in falier surmounted\nwith a crown, and the harp upon the other; with an intention, as it would seem, that if they were refused in England they might pass in Ireland. In 1635 Charles I. coined those with the roe instead of the harp; but the circulation of these was entirely stopped by the vast number of counterfeits which appeared, and by the king's death in 1648. After this the private tokens began again to be circulated, till put a stop to by the coinage of farthings in 1672. The workmanship of the tokens is quite contemptible. In 1672 the halfpence as well as the farthings which had been struck two years before began to circulate. They were of pure Swedish copper, the dies engraved by Roettier; and they continued till the year 1684, when some disputes arose about the copper lately obtained from the English mines. Tin farthings were coined with a flud of copper in the centre, and inscribed round the edge as the crown pieces, with NUMMORUM FAMULUS. In 1685 or 1686, halfpence of the same kind were coined; and the tin coinage continued till the year 1692, to the value of more than 65,000l.; but next year the tin was all called in by government, and the copper coinage recommenced. The farthings of Queen Anne are all trial pieces, excepting those of 1714, the last year of her reign. \"They are (says Mr Pinkerton) of exquisite workmanship, exceeding most copper coins either ancient or modern, and will do honour to the engraver Mr Cracker to the end of time.\" The one, whose reverse is Peace in a car, Pax Missa Per Orbem, is the most esteemed; and next to it the Britannia under a portal. The other halfpence and farthings are less valuable.\n\n23. Scotland. Silver pennies of Alexander I. who reigned in 1107, are believed to exist; and there certainly are some of Alexander II. in 1214. There are likewise coins of David in 1124; but perhaps none of Malcom IV. his successor, whose reign was very short. There are many coins of William I. in 1165; and a large hoard of his pennies was found at Inverness in 1780.\n\nThe money of Scotland continued to be of the same value with that of England till the country was drained by the vast ransoms of David II. after which it became necessary to reduce its size; and so much did this diminution affect England, that Edward III. found himself obliged to lessen the English coin also. The diminution of the Scottish coin, however, continued still to go on until it became impracticable to keep par with that of England. In the first year of Robert III. it passed only for one half of its nominal value in England: in 1393, Richard II. ordered it only to go for the weight of the genuine metal it contained. In 1600 it had sunk to such a degree as to pass only for a twelfth part of the English money, and continued at that low ebb till the coinage of Scotland was entirely cancelled by the union of the two kingdoms.\n\nOf silver coins we have only pennies till the year 1293, when Edward I. having coined halfpence and farthings, Alexander III. of Scotland coined also halfpence, of which we have a few, but no farthings are to be met with; but there are silver farthings of Robert I. and David II. The latter introduced the groat and half-groat, which completed the set of Scottish silver. It continued unaltered till the time of Queen Mary, when they all ceased to be coined in Modern silver, on account of the high price of that metal. In 1553 shillings were first coined, with the bust of the queen on one side and the arms of France and Scotland on the other. The silver crown was first coined in 1565, which went for 30s. Scots; lesser pieces of 20s. and 10s. having likewise been struck, and marks of silver, worth 3s. 4d. English, were also coined about the same time. These coins have upon them the marks xxx. xx. x. to denote their value. They are commonly called Cruickstone dollars, from the palm-tree upon them, mistaken for a remarkable view at Cruickstone near Glasgow, where Henry Darnly resided. It is described, however, in the act as a palm, with a \"shell padoc\" (a tortoise) crawling up. This alludes to Darnly's marriage with the queen, as the motto from Propertius DAT GLORIA VIRES also implies. The motto NEMO ME IMPUNE LACESSET first appears on the Scottish coins in 1578, and the invention is given to the celebrated Buchanan. In 1582, the crown of an ounce weight went for 40s. Scots, and was accordingly marked XL.; in 1597 the mark was L., the Scottish money being then only one-tenth of the English: the mark was LX in 1601, the value being then reduced to one twelfth, at which it has ever since continued. In the time of Charles I. half marks, 40 and 20 penny pieces, were coined. In 1675, the Scottish dollars first appeared, in value 50s. Scots, with halves and quarters of proportional value. In 1686, James VII. coined 60s. 40s. 20s. 10s. and 5s. pieces; but only those of 40s. and 10s. are known, with these numbers under the bust. At the union of the kingdoms, all the Scottish coins were called in, and recoloured at Edinburgh, with the mark E under the bust to distinguish it: since which there has been no coinage in Scotland. The Scottish silver coins are in general equal, if not superior, in the workmanship to the English.\n\nGold was first issued by Robert II. about 30 years after Edward III. of England had coined the same metal in that country. The pieces were at first called St Andrews, from the figure of that tutelar saint upon the crofs, and who appears on the obverse with the arms of Scotland, and on the reverse a lion in a shield. The Lion was another name for the largest gold coin in Scotland, from the arms of the kingdom upon it. The next was the unicorn, under James III.; which were followed by the bonnet-pieces of James V. These last are of admirable workmanship, being almost equal to the ancient coins in this respect. In imitation of the French, the monarch we speak of diminished the size of the coin without lessening its weight; an improvement not adopted by the English for a whole century. The last gold coined in Scotland was the pittole and half-pittole, of twelve and six pounds Scots. These coins have the sun under the head. The gold coins of Scotland fell in the same proportion with the silver.\n\nThe copper coinage of Scotland is of more early date than that of England. It was preceded by money of billon, or copper washed with silver, called black money. James III. first coined black farthings in 1466; and this is recorded by historians as one of his greatest faults. This kind of coinage, however, continued as late as the reign of James VI. In his time\nthe true copper coinage began; but as the value of Scottish money had now declined almost to the utmost, the pieces suddenly assumed a form almost resembling that of the French coins. The bolofo called from Bothwell the mintmaster, being equal in size to the hard, and worth two pennies Scottish, was struck. The billon coin, formerly called bas piece, and worth five pennies Scots, was now coined in copper, and termed the baw-bee. Thus it corresponded with the French half sol and English halfpenny, the Scots penny being now equivalent to the French denier. Some pieces named Atkinson's were coined by James VI. in 1582, when the Scottish money was to the English as 1 to 8; but on its being still farther reduced, they went for 8 pennies, a third more than the value of the baw-bee. Besides these there were the hardie and plack, the former being worth three and the latter four pennies Scots. This coinage continued through the reigns of Charles I. and II., but Scottish coins of the former are, perhaps, the rarest of any.\n\n24. Ireland. The first coins introduced into this kingdom seem to have been those of the Danes, and which have only a number of strokes around them instead of letters. In the tenth century, however, this coinage had been considerably improved; and in 930 and 994 there are pennies struck in Dublin, with the inscription on Dufli or Dyfli, Dublin or Duflin being the Danish name of that city. There are likewise coins of the Irish princes themselves, and of the English monarchs, struck in Ireland as early as the ninth century; and it is asserted by some, that Ireland even in these days had been conquered by England; of which indeed, these coins seem to be a proof. None of the Irish coins of Henry II. are to be met with, but we have some of the coins of John; and from his time to that of Henry V., the Irish coins are known by a triangle enclosing the king's head, which appears also upon the coins of other nations at this period. The harp does not appear upon the Irish coins till the time of Henry VIII. Till the time of this monarch, the English and Irish coins are the same; but the same debasement of the coin which at that time took place in England extended also to Ireland; but in 1601 copper halfpence and farthings were coined also for this kingdom. These circulated in Ireland when James VI. issued his farthing-tokens of copper, the latter being of two sizes, that if they failed in England they might be sent to Ireland as pennies and halfpence. In 1635 a mint was established in Dublin by Charles I., but it was stopped by the Irish massacre, and the many disturbances which followed; since which time the scheme has not been resumed. After the massacre, St Patrick's halfpence and farthings were coined by the Papists, bearing the legends Floreat Rex, and on the reverse Ecce Grex; or the farthing Quiescat Plenus. Copper tokens were struck by towns and tradesmen, as in England and Scotland. In 1682, halfpence and farthings were issued by authority, with the harp and date. In 1689, James II., having invaded Ireland, instituted a mint, and coined threepence and half-crowns of all the refuse metal he could find, particularly some brass guns were employed, whence the coinage is commonly called gun-money. Even this metal, however, soon became so scarce, that a diminution in its size is quite apparent from June 1689 to July 1690; and as the month of their mintage is marked upon them, this decrease is easily perceived. In March 1690, pennies of lead mixed with tin were issued; and on the 15th of June the same year, crowns of white metal were coined; but these are now very scarce. In 1722, the patent for coining halfpence and farthings was given to William Wood, which excited much discontent in Ireland. From the small size allowed by the patent to these pieces, it was supposed that the patentee would have gained £10,000, but as he caused them to be struck of a size still smaller, his gains were estimated at £100,000. The coins, however, are of admirable workmanship, and very fine copper, bearing the best portrait of King George I. to be found anywhere. Sir Isaac Newton, at that time at the head of the mint, declared that they were superior to the English coins in everything except the size. In 1737 the Irish halfpence and farthings, with the harp on the reverse, were coined, and continue to the present time. In 1760, there was such a scarcity of copper coin, that some private persons applied for leave to coin halfpence, which appeared with a very bad portrait of George II., and the words Voce Populi around it. No gold or silver has been coined in Ireland since the massacre of 1641.\n\nTable V. Modern Medals, properly so called.\n\n1. Scottish medals. These take the lead in the present article, the first modern medals of gold being those of David II., struck between the years 1330 and 1370. Only two of them are known to exist; one in the collection of Mr Barker of Birmingham, and the other in that of Dr Hunter. In 1487, there is a medal of James III., sent to the shrine of St Ambroise in France. It is described as of two inches and a third in diameter; the weight near two ounces; having on the obverse a beardless king, with long hair, sitting on a throne, holding in one hand a naked sword; in the other a shield, with the Scottish arms. On the borders of the canopy above the throne is an inscription in Gothic letters, IN MI DEFEN, being corrupt French for In my defense; a common motto in the Scottish arms. Above the canopy is VILLA BERWICH: the reverse bears St Andrew and his cross, SALVUM FAC POPULUM TUUM DOMINE. There is also a medal of James IV., in the collar of St Michael, having on the reverse a Doric pillar surmounted by a young Janus, standing on a hill, beyond which is the sea, and land on either side. This, however, is by some suspected to be a forgery.\n\nThe most remarkable Scottish medals are those of the unfortunate Mary. The first is properly French, having been issued at her coronation as queen of France, along with her husband King Francis II. On the obverse of this piece there are portraits of Francis and Mary, face to face, with three legends around them, the outermost containing their titles; the middle one the following sentence: HORA NONA DOMINUS J. H. S. EXPIRATI NELLI CLAMANS; the innermost the name of the city (Paris). On the reverse are the arms of France and Scotland. Fine teelons were also coined upon the same plan, and are now so rare that Dr Hunter gave ten guineas for one which\nwhich is in his collection. The same portraits appear on the fine crown of Mary and Henry, in 1565, which is so rare as to be esteemed a medal of the highest value; and Mr Pinkerton imagines, that if offered to sale it would bring 40 or 50 guineas.\n\nAnother remarkable medal of Mary represents her full faced, and weeping, with the inscription, O God grant patience in that I suffer wrong. The reverse has in the centre, Quo can compare with me in grief, I die and dar nocht seek relief; with this legend around, Hourt not the (figure of a heart) quhais joy thou art. There are also many counters of this unfortunate princess, being thin silver pieces of the size of a shilling. \"They all appear (says Mr Pinkerton) to have been done in France by the direction of Mary, who was fond of devices. Her cruel captivity could not debar her from intercourse with her friends in France, who must with pleasure have executed her orders, as affording her a little consolation.\"\n\nThe coronation medal of Charles I. struck at Edinburgh for his inauguration, June 18, 1663, is remarkable as being the only one ever coined of Scottish gold, and the first in Britain struck with a legend on the edge. With respect to the workmanship, it is inferior to Simon's. Of these medals only three are known to exist, of which one is in the Museum. It is not uncommon in silver; in which case it sometimes wants the legend on the edge.\n\n2. Italian medals. These appear in the 15th century, and from that time successively in most European countries. Vittore Pisano, a painter of Verona, is celebrated as the restorer of the art, but it remains to be accounted for how the medals of King David, already mentioned, came to exist so long before. Mr Pinkerton considers this artist rather as an inventor than a restorer, his medals having no resemblance to the ancient coins, as being large, and all cast. They were first modelled in wax, then a mould taken from the model in fine sand and other ingredients. After a good cast was procured, it was touched up, and made a model for the rest. These medals of Pisano, are almost always inscribed Opus Pifani Pictoris. The portraits of a great number of illustrious men were done by him in this manner; and in the British Museum is a large brass medal of Pisano by himself.—Other artists were Boldu, Marecotto, Matthaeus de Paffus, Sperandes, Mifaldone, &c. Towards the end of the century, however, the medals began to assume a more elegant appearance; and the papal ones are not only the most elegant but the most ancient series of all the modern medals. The improvement began in the reign of Alexander VI. so famous for his own crimes, and those of his nephew Cesar Borgia. His successors, Julius II. Leo X. Hadrian VI. and Clement VII., had many of their medals designed by Raphael, Julio Romano, and other eminent painters, and the engraving executed by artists of equal merit. Among these were the celebrated Cellini, and the noted Paduan forgers of Roman coins, Cavino and Baffiano. In 1644, Cormanni, a medallist artist, was imprisoned on account of a piece which represented the Pope upon one side, and Olympia Maidalchina, the relation of his holiness, on the other. The unfortunate Cormanni poisoned himself. About this time the family of the Hamerani, originally from Germany, began to engrave the papal medals; which they did with surprising merit for several generations. Each of the daughters did a fine medal, as we are informed by Venuti.\n\nBesides the papal medals, many have been issued by the various states of Italy. There are medals of Frederic II. of Sicily in 1501, of several Venetian generals in 1509, of Alfonso duke of Ferrara in 1511, and of the celebrated Andrew Doria in 1528.\n\n3. French medals. Till the reign of Louis XIV., the medals of this country are neither fine nor numerous; but this monarch exceeds all modern princes in this way. Many of his pieces are well designed and executed, though objectionable on account of their falsehood.\n\n4. Danish medals. These appear of Christian II. in 1516, of Frederic and Sophia in 1532, of Frederic I. and Christian III. in bonnets worn in the 16th century. The elephant of the house of Oldenburg is frequent upon Danish medals.\n\n5. Swedish medals. These begin with Gustavus Vasa; and several of Christina are likewise to be met with. There are also some curious ones of Charles XII.\n\n6. Dutch medals. These begin in 1566; and many of them are remarkable for maps and plans, which must be very interesting to posterity. \"Had the Greeks and Romans (says Mr Pinkerton) given us maps and plans, what a fine system of ancient geography and topography a cabinet of medals must have been!\"\n\n7. Medals of Spain, Portugal, and Germany. The Spanish medals began with Gondalo in 1503, many of which are curious and interesting. Under Charles V., there are many curious Spanish medals; but those of Germany begin with Frederic in 1453. They are extremely numerous; as we may easily suppose from the greatness of the empire, and the various states which compose it. There is a famous medal of Sebastian king of Portugal, famous for his unfortunate expedition into Africa in 1578; with his bust, full face, and three quarters in length. On the reverse is a shell-fish in the sea, with the moon and seven stars, bearing the inscription SERENA CALSA FAVENT. There is also a curious lozenge-shaped coin of the same with the arms of Portugal, and the king's name and title: On the reverse is a crois with the inscription IN HOC SIGNO VINCES, 1578.\n\n8. Satiric medals. These began almost as soon as the knowledge of the art of coining medals was revived. They seem to have been almost unknown to the ancients. One indeed of the emperor Gallienus is supposed to have been satiric. It has on the front the emperor's bust, with the inscription GALLIENÆ AUG.; the reverse is Peace in a car, PAX UBIQUE; but this has been proved to be only a blundered coin. Some other ancient medals, however, are not liable to this objection. The first modern satiric medal published was that of Frederic king of Sicily in 1501, against his antagonist Ferdinand king of Spain. It has on one side the head of Ferdinand, with the inscription FERDINANDUS R. AR. VETUS VULPES ORBIS; on the reverse, a wolf carrying off a sheep, JVCVM MEVM SVAVE EST ET ONVS MEVM LEVE. Many others have been struck, of which the wit would now perhaps be difficult.\ndifficult to be found out: but of all nations the Dutch have most distinguished themselves in this way; and paid very dear for their conduct, as they brought upon themselves by one or two satiric medals the whole power of France under Louis XIV.\n\n9. English medals. The first of these is in the duke of Devonshire's collection. It is of a large size, and done on the plan of the early Italian medals. It has on the reverse the arms of Kendal, with the inscription TEMPORIS OBSIDIONIS TURCORUM, MCCCCLXXX. On the other side is a portrait with IO KENDAL RHODI TYRCVPPELLERIVS. It was found last century in Knareborough forest; but Mr Pinkerton has no doubt of its having been done in Italy. The next is that of Henry VIII. in 1545, and is of gold, larger than the crown-piece, with the king's head upon the obverse, and three legends within each other, including his titles, &c. The reverse contains two inscriptions, declaring him to be the head of the church; the one in Hebrew, the other in Greek. It was imitated exactly by Edward VI. whose coronation medal is the first we have. There are two medals of Philip and Mary, whose execution is tolerably good; but those of Elizabeth are very poor. There are good medals of James I. and his queen; with a fine one of Charles I. and Henrietta, though the workmanship is much inferior to the antique. There are many good medals of Charles, with various devices upon their reverses.\n\nUnder the commonwealth the celebrated Simon produced medals which are deservedly reckoned the most admirable pieces of modern workmanship. There are many good medals of Charles II., James II., and William III. Some are also found of James after his abdication. Some fine gold, silver, and copper medals, were issued in the time of Queen Anne; the two last affording a series of all the great actions of the duke of Marlborough. About the year 1740, a series of medals was engraved in London by Daffier, a native of Geneva, containing all the kings of England; being 36 in number. They are done upon fine copper, and executed with great taste. There are besides many medals of private persons in England; so that it may justly be said, that this country for medals exceeds almost every other in Europe.\n\nTo this account of modern coins and medals we shall add that of another set called siege pieces, and which were issued during the time of a siege in cases of urgent necessity. These were formed of any kind of metal; sometimes of no metal; and Patin mentions a remarkable one struck at Leyden in 1574, when the place was besieged by the Spaniards. It was of thick paper or pasteboard, having a lion rampant, with this inscription, FVGNO PRO PATRIA, 1574; and on the reverse, LVGDVNUM BATAVORVM. There are various siege-pieces of Charles I. both in gold and silver, some of the latter being of the value of 20 shillings.\n\nThe nummi bracteati are a species of modern coins somewhat between counters and money; and have their name from the word BRACTEA, a spangle or thin bit of metal. They are commonly little thin plates of silver, stamped as would seem with wooden dies up-\n\non one side only, with the rude impression of various figures and inscriptions. Most of them are ecclesiastic, and were struck in Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and a few in Poland. They continued to be in use in Germany till the end of the 15th century; and some are still used in Switzerland at this day.\n\nTable of Abbreviations used in the Legends of Medals; from Mr Pinkerton.\n\nGREEK COINS.\n\nA.\n\nA.

I is io; add A to I, and IA makes II; so IB, 12; II, 13, &c. K is 20, KA, 21, &c. PIA makes IIII. The English word AIR marks the grand initial numerals. On coins the numerals are often placed in retrograde order; which makes no difference in the value, as every letter is appropriated to its number. Thus TAI or FAT imply the same, 333. But this advantage being unknown to the Roman numerals and Arabic cyphers, is apt to puzzle the beginner.\n\nROMAN COINS.\n\nA\nA. AULUS: in the exergue it implies the first mint, as ANT.

See Casting.\n\nMEDALLION, or MEDALION, a medal of an extraordinary size, supposed to be anciently struck by the emperors for their friends, and for foreign princes and ambassadors. But, that the smallness of their number might not endanger the loss of the devices they bore, the Romans generally took care to stamp the subject of them upon their ordinary coins.\n\nMedallions, in respect of the other coins, were the same as modern medals in respect of modern money: they were exempted from all commerce, and had no other value than what was set upon them by the fancy of the owner. Medallions are so scarce, that there cannot be any set made of them, even though the metals and sizes should be mixed promiscuously.\n\nMEDEA, in fabulous history, a celebrated sorceress, daughter of Æetes king of Colchis. Her mother's name, according to the more received opinion of Hesiod and Hyginus, was Idyia, or, according to others, Ephyre, Hecate, Asterodia, Antiope, and Neara. She was the niece of Circe. When Jason came to Colchis in quest of the golden fleece, Medea became enamoured of him, and it was to her well-directed labours that the Argonauts owed their preservation. Medea had an interview with her lover in the temple of Hecate; where they bound themselves by the most solemn oaths to eternal fidelity. No sooner had Jason overcome all the difficulties which Æetes had placed in his way, than Medea embarked with the conquerors for Greece. To stop the pursuit of her father, she tore pieces her brother Abyrtus, and left his mangled limbs in the way through which Æetes was to pass. This act of barbarity, some have attributed to Jason, and not to her. When Jason reached Iolchos his native country, the return and victories of the Argonauts were celebrated with universal rejoicings: but Ælon the father of Jason was unable to affix at the solemnity on account of the infirmities of his age. Medea, at her husband's request, removed the weakness of Ælon; and by drawing away the blood from his veins, and filling them again with the juice of certain herbs, she restored him to the vigour and sprightliness of youth. This sudden change in Ælon astonished the inhabitants of Iolchos; and the daughters of Pelias were also desirous to see their father restored by the same power to the vigour of youth. Medea, willing to revenge the injuries which her husband's family had suffered from Pelias, increased their curiosity; and betrayed them into the murder of their father as preparatory to his rejuvenescence, which he afterwards refused to accomplish. This action greatly irritated the people of Iolchos; and Medea with her husband fled to Corinth to avoid their resentment. Here they lived for ten years with mutual attachment, when the love of Jason for Glauce the king's daughter interrupted their harmony, and Medea was divorced. Medea revenged the infidelity of Jason, by causing the death of Glauce, and the destruction of her family. She also killed two of her children in their father's presence; and when Jason attempted to punish the barbarity of the mother, she fled through the air upon a chariot drawn by winged dragons. From Corinth Medea came to Athens, where, after she had undergone the necessary purification of her murder, she married King Ægeus, or (according to others) lived in an adulterous manner with him. From her conduct with Ægeus, Medea had a son who was called Medus. Soon after, when Theseus wished to make himself known to his father, Medea, jealous of his fame and fearful of his power, attempted to poison him at a feast which had been prepared for his entertainment. Her attempts, however, failed of success, and the sight of the sword which Theseus wore by his side convinced Ægeus that the stranger against whose life he had so basely conspired was his own son. The father and the son were reconciled; and Medea, to avoid the punishment which her wickedness deserved, mounted her fiery chariot and disappeared through the air. She came to Colchis; where, according to some, she was reconciled to Jason, who had fought her in her native country after her sudden departure from Corinth. She died at Colchis, as Justin mentions, when she had been restored to the confidence of her family. After death she married Achilles in the Elysian fields, according to the tradition mentioned by Simonides. The murder of Mermerus and Pheres, the youngest of Jason's children by Medea, is not to be attributed to the mother, according to Elian; but to the Corinthians, who assassinated them in the temple of Juno Acraea. To avoid the resentment of the gods, and to deliver themselves from the pestilence which visited their country after so horrid a massacre, they engaged the poet Euripides for five talents to write a tragedy, which cleared them of the murder, and represented Medea as the cruel assassin of her own children. And besides, that this opinion might be the better credited, festivals were appointed, in which the mother was represented with all the barbarity of a fury murdering her own sons.\n\nMEDEOLA, CLIMBING AFRICAN ASPARAGUS, a genus of plants belonging to the hexandria class, and in the natural method ranking under the 11th order, Sarmenitaceae. See Botany Index.\n\nMEDIA, now the province of Ghilan in Persia, once the seat of a potent empire, was bounded, according to Ptolemy, on the north by part of the Caspian sea; on the south by Persia, Susiana, and Atrypia; on the east by Parthia and Hyrcania, and on the west by Armenia Major. It was anciently divided into several provinces, viz. Tropatene, Charomithrene, Dara, etc.\nrites, Marciane, Amariace, and Syro-Media. By a later division, however, all these were reduced to two; the one called Media Magna, the other Media Atropatene, or simply Atropatene. Media Magna was bounded by Persia, Parthia, Hyrcania, the Hyrcanian sea, and Atropatene, and contained the cities of Ecbatan, Laodicea, Apamea, Raga, Ragaia or Ragen, &c. Atropatene lay between the Caspian mountains and the Caspian sea.\n\nThis country originally took its name from Madai, the third son of Japhet; as is plain from Scripture, where the Medes are constantly called Madai. Among profane authors, some derive the name Media, from one Medus the son of Jason and Medea; others from a city called Media. Sextus Rufus tells us that in his time it was called Medena, and from others we learn that it was also called Ari. The most probable history of the Medes is as follows.\n\nThis people lived in subjection to the Assyrians till the reign of Sennacherib, when they threw off the yoke, and lived for some time in a state of anarchy. But at last, rapine and violence, the natural consequences of such a situation, prevailed so much that they were constrained to have recourse to some kind of government, that they might be enabled to live in safety. Accordingly, about 699 B.C., one Dejoces having procured himself to be chosen king, united the scattered tribes into which the Medes were at that time divided; and having applied himself as much as possible to the civilization of his barbarous subjects, left the throne to his son Phraortes, after a reign of 53 years.\n\nThe new king, who was of a warlike and enterprising disposition, subdued almost all the Upper Asia lying between Mount Taurus and the river Halys which runs through Cappadocia into the Euxine sea. Elated with this good success, he invaded Assyria, the empire of which was now much declined, and greatly weakened by the revolt of many nations which had followed the example of the Medes. Nebuchadnezzar or Chyniladan, however, the reigning prince, having assembled what forces he could, engaged Phraortes, defeated, took him prisoner, and put him to death; after which, entering Media, he laid waste the country, took the metropolis of Ecbatan itself, and levelled it with the ground.\n\nOn the death of Phraortes, his son Cyaxares was placed on the throne. He was no less valiant and enterprising than his father, and had better success against the Assyrians. With the remains of that army which had been defeated under his father, he not only drove the conquerors out of Media, but obliged Chyniladan to shut himself up in Nineveh. To this place he immediately laid close siege; but was obliged to give over the enterprise on account of an irruption of the Scythians into his own country. Cyaxares engaged these new enemies with great resolution; but was utterly defeated; and the conquerors overran not only all Media, but the greatest part of Upper Asia, extending their conquests into Syria, and as far as the confines of Egypt. They continued masters of all this vast tract of country for 28 years, till at last Media was delivered from their yoke by a general massacre at the instigation of Cyaxares.\n\nAfter this deliverance, the Medes soon repopulated themselves of the territories they had lost; and once more extended their frontiers to the river Halys, their ancient boundary to the westward. After this we find the Medes engaged in a war with the Lydians; which, however, ended without any remarkable transaction: but on the conclusion of it, Cyaxares having entered into a strict alliance with Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, returned in conjunction with the Babylonians before Nineveh; which they took and levelled with the ground, putting most of the inhabitants to the sword.\n\nAfter this victory the Babylonian and Median empires seem to have been united; however, after the death of Nebuchadnezzar, or rather in his lifetime, a war ensued, which was not extinguished but by the dissolution of the Babylonian empire. The Medes, under Alyages the son of Cyaxares I., withstood the power of the Babylonian monarchs; and under Cyrus and Cyaxares II., utterly destroyed their empire by the taking of Babylon, as is related under that article. After the death of Cyaxares, the kingdom fell to Cyrus, by whom the seat of the empire was transferred to Persia, under which article the history of Media now falls to be considered, as also the manners, &c., of the inhabitants.\n\nMEDIANA, the name of a vein or little vessel, made by the union of the cephalic and basilic, in the bend of the elbow.\n\nMEDIASTINUM, in Anatomy, a double membrane, formed by a duplicature of the pleura; serving to divide the thorax and the lungs into two parts, and to sustain the viscera, and prevent their falling from one side of the thorax to the other.

But without adopting any supposition of which no probable evidence can be given, we may conclude that mankind were naturally led to it from casual observation on the diseases to which they found themselves subjected; and that therefore, to a certain degree at least, it is as ancient as the human race. But at what period it began to be practised as an art, by particular individuals following it as a profession, is not known. The most ancient physicians we read of were those who embalmed the patriarch Jacob by order of his son Joseph. The sacred writer styles these physicians servants to Joseph; whence we may be assured that they were not priests, as the first physicians are generally supposed to have been; for in that age we know the Egyptian priests were in such high favour, that they retained their liberty, when, through a public calamity, all the rest of the people were made slaves to the prince.\n\nIt is not probable, therefore, that among the Egyptians religion and medicine were originally confounded; and if we suppose the Jews not to have invented the art, but received it from some other nation, it is as little probable that the priests of that nation were their physicians as those of Egypt.\n\nThat the Jewish physicians were absolutely distinct from their priests, is very certain. Yet as the Jews resided for such a long time in Egypt, it is probable they would retain many of the Egyptian customs, from which it would be very difficult to free them. We read, however, that when King Asa was diseased in his feet, \"he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians.\" Hence we may conclude, that among the Jews the medical art was looked upon as a mere human invention; and it was thought that the Deity never cured diseases by making people acquainted with the virtues of this or that herb, but only by his miraculous power. That the same opinion prevailed among the nations who were neighbours to the Jews, is also probable from what we read of Ahaziah king of Judah, who having sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub god of Ekron concerning his disease, he did not define any remedy from him or his priests, but simply to know whether he should recover or not.\n\nWhat seems most probable on this subject therefore is, that religion and medicine came to be mixed together only in consequence of that degeneracy into ignorance and superstition which took place among all nations. The Egyptians, we know, came at last to be sunk in the most ridiculous and absurd superstition; and then, indeed, it is not wonderful that we should find their priests commencing physicians, and mingling charms, incantations, &c. with their remedies. That this was the case, long after the days of Joseph, we are very certain; and indeed it seems as natural for ignorance and barbarism to combine religion with physic, as it is for a civilized and enlightened people to keep them separate. Hence we see, that among all modern barbarians their priests or conjurors are their only physicians.\n\nWe are so little acquainted with the state of physic among the Egyptians, that it is needless to say much concerning them. They attributed the invention of medicine, as they did also that of many other arts, to Thoth, the Hermes or Mercury of the Greeks. He is said to have written many things in hieroglyphic characters upon certain pillars, in order to perpetuate his knowledge, and render it useful to others. These were transcribed by Agathodemon, or the second Mercury, the father of Tat, who is said to have composed books of them, that were kept in the most sacred places of the Egyptian temples. The existence of such a person, however, is very doubtful, and many of the books ascribed to him were accounted forgeries as long ago as the days of Galen; there is also great reason to suspect that those books were written many ages after Hermes, and when physic had made considerable advances. Many of the books attributed to him are trifling and ridiculous; and though sometimes he is allowed to have all the honour of inventing the art, he is on other occasions obliged to share it with Osiris, Isis, and Apis or Serapis.\n\nAfter all, the Egyptian physic appears to have been little else than a collection of absurd superstitions. Origin informs us, that they believed there were 36 demons, or gods of the air, who divided the human body among them; that they had names for each of them; and that by invoking them according to the part affected, the patient was cured. Of natural medicines we hear none recommended by the father of Egyptian physic; except the herb moly, which he gave to Ulysses in order to secure him from the enchantments of Circe; and the herb mercury, of which he first discovered the use. His successors made use of venefication, cathartics, emetics, and clysters. There is no proof, however, that this practice was established by Hermes; on the contrary, the Egyptians themselves pretended that the first hint of those remedies was taken from some observations on brute animals. Venefication was taught them by the hippopotamus, which is said to perform this operation upon itself. On certain occasions, he comes out of the river, and strikes his leg against a sharp-pointed reed. As he takes care to direct the stroke against a vein, the consequence must be a considerable effusion of blood; and this being suffered to run as long as the creature thinks proper, he at last stops up the orifice with mud. The hint of clysters was taken from the Ibis, a bird which is said to give itself clysters with its bill, &c. They used venefication, however, but very little, probably on account of the warmth.\nwarmth of the climate; and the exhibition of the remedies above mentioned, joined with abstinence, formed the most of their practice.\n\nThe Greeks too had several persons to whom they attributed the invention of physic, particularly Prometheus, Apollo or Paeon, and Aesculapius; which last was the most celebrated of any. But here we must observe, that as the Greeks were a very warlike people, their physic seems to have been little else than what is now called surgery, or the cure of wounds, fractures, &c. Hence Aesculapius, and his pupils Chiron, Machaon, and Podalirius, are celebrated by Homer only for their skill in curing these, without any mention of their attempting the cures of internal diseases. We are not, however, to suppose that they confined themselves entirely to surgery. They no doubt would occasionally prescribe for internal disorders; but as they were most frequently conversant with wounds, we may naturally suppose the greatest part of their skill to have consisted in knowing how to cure these. If we may believe the poets, indeed, the knowledge of medicine seems to have been very generally diffused. Almost all the heroes of antiquity are reported to have been physicians as well as warriors. Most of them were taught physic by the centaur Chiron. From him Hercules received instructions in the medicinal art, in which he is said to have been no less expert than in feats of arms. Several plants were called by his name; from which some think it probable that he found out their virtues, though others are of opinion that they bore the name of this renowned hero on account of their great efficacy in removing diseases. Aristaeus king of Arcadia was also one of Chiron's scholars; and is supposed to have discovered the use of the drug called filipium, by some thought to be afaetida. Theseus, Telamon, Japon, Peleus, and his son Achilles, were all renowned for their knowledge in the art of physic. The last is said to have discovered the use of verdigris in cleansing foul ulcers. All of them, however, seem to have been inferior in knowledge to Palamedes, who hindered the plague from coming into the Grecian camp after it had ravaged most of the cities of the Hellespont, and even Troy itself. His method was to confine his soldiers to a spare diet, and to oblige them to use much exercise.\n\nThe practice of these ancient Greek physicians, notwithstanding the praises bestowed on them by their poets, seems to have been very limited, and in some cases even pernicious. All the external remedies applied to Homer's wounded heroes were fomentations; while inwardly their physicians gave them wine, sometimes mingled with cheese scraped down. A great deal of their physic also consisted in charms, incantations, amulets, &c., of which, as they are common to all superstitious and ignorant nations, it is superfluous to take any farther notice.\n\nIn this way the art of medicine continued among the Greeks for many ages. As its first professors knew nothing of the animal economy, and as little of the theory of diseases, it is plain, that whatever they did must have been in consequence of mere random trials, or empiricism, in the strict and proper sense of the word. Indeed, it is evidently impossible that this or almost any other art could originate from another source than trials of this kind. Accordingly, we find, that some ancient nations were accustomed to expose their sick in temples, and by the sides of highways, that they might receive the advice of every one who passed. Among the Greeks, however, Aesculapius was reckoned the most eminent practitioner of his time, and his name continued to be revered after his death. He was ranked amongst the gods; and the principal knowledge of the medical art remained with his family to the time of Hippocrates, who reckoned himself the seventeenth in a lineal descent from Aesculapius, and who was truly the first who treated of medicine in a regular and rational manner.\n\nHippocrates, who is supposed to have lived 400 years before the birth of Christ, is the most ancient author whose writings expressly on the subject of the medical art are preserved; and he is therefore justly considered as the father of physic. All the accounts which we have prior to this time, if not evidently fabulous, are at the utmost highly conjectural. Even the medical knowledge of Pythagoras, so much celebrated as a philosopher, can hardly be considered as resting on any other foundation. But from the time of Hippocrates, medicine, separated from philosophy and religion, seems to have assumed the form of a science, and to have been practised as a profession. It may not, therefore, be improper to give a particular account of the state of medical science as transmitted to us in his writings. The writings of Hippocrates, however, it may be remarked, are even more than preserved. Many things have been represented as written by Hippocrates which are probably spurious. Nor is it wonderful that attempts should have been made to increase the value of manuscripts, by attributing them to a name of such eminence. But although his writings are transmitted to us under the title of his works, what are written by different hands, yet the presumption is, that most, if not all of them, are of nearly as early a date, and contain the prevailing opinions of those times.\n\nAccording to the most authentic accounts, Hippocrates was a native of the island of Cos, and born in the beginning of the 88th Olympiad. In the writings transmitted to us as his, we find a general principle adopted, to which he gives the name of Nature. To this principle he ascribes a mighty power. \"Nature (says he) is of itself sufficient to every animal. She performs every thing that is necessary to them, without needing the least instruction from any one how to do it.\" Upon this footing, as if Nature had been a principle endowed with knowledge, he gives her the title of judicium; and ascribes virtues or powers to her, which are her servants, and by means of which she performs all her operations in the bodies of animals; and distributes the blood, spirits, and heat, through all parts of the body, which by these means receive life and sensation. And in other places he tells us, that it is this faculty which gives nourishment, preservation, and growth, to all things.\n\nThe manner in which nature acts, or commands her sublunary power to act, is by attracting what is of nature, good and agreeable to each species, and by retaining, preparing, and changing it; and on the other side in rejecting whatever is superfluous or hurtful, after she has separated it from the good. This is the foundation of the doctrine of depuration, concoction, and crisis in fevers.\nfevers, so much insisted upon by Hippocrates and many other physicians. He supposes also, that every thing has an inclination to be joined to what agrees with it, and to remove from every thing contrary to it; and likewise that there is an affinity between the several parts of the body, by which they mutually sympathize with each other. When he comes to explain what this principle called nature is, he is obliged to resolve it into heat, which, he says, appears to have something immortal in it.\n\nAs far as he attempts to explain the causes of diseases, he refers much to the humours of the body, particularly to the blood and the bile. He treats also of the effects of sleep, watchings, exercise, and rest, and all the benefit or mischief we may receive from them. Of all the causes of diseases, however, mentioned by Hippocrates, the most general are diet and air. On the subject of diet he has composed several books, and in the choice of this he was exactly careful; and the more so, as his practice turned almost wholly upon it. He also considered the air very much; he examined what winds blew ordinarily or extraordinarily; he considered the irregularity of the seasons, the rising and setting of stars, or the time of certain constellations; also the time of the solstices, and of the equinoxes; those days, in his opinion, producing great alterations in certain distempers.\n\nHe does not, however, pretend to explain how, from these causes, that variety of distempers arises which is daily to be observed. All that can be gathered from him with regard to this is, that the different causes above mentioned, when applied to the different parts of the body, produce a great variety of distempers. Some of these distempers he accounted mortal, others dangerous, and the rest easily curable, according to the cause from whence they spring, and the parts on which they fall. In several places also he distinguishes diseases, from the time of their duration, into acute or short, and chronic or long. He likewise distinguishes diseases by the particular places where they prevail, whether ordinary or extraordinary. The first, that is, those that are frequent and familiar to certain places, he called endemic diseases; and the latter, which ravaged extraordinarily sometimes in one place, sometimes in another, which seized great numbers at certain times, he called epidemic, that is, popular diseases; and of this kind the most terrible is the plague. He likewise mentions a third kind, the opposite of the former; and these he calls sporadic, or straggling diseases; these last include all the different sorts of distempers which invade at any one season, which are sometimes of one sort, and sometimes of another. He distinguished between those diseases which are hereditary, or born with us, and those which are contracted afterwards; and likewise between those of a kindly and those of a malignant nature, the former of which are easily and frequently cured, but the latter give the physicians a great deal of trouble, and are seldom overcome by all their care.\n\nHippocrates remarked four stages in distempers; viz. the beginning of the disease, its augmentation, its state or height, and its declination. In such diseases as terminate fatally, death comes in place of the declination. In the third stage, therefore, the change is most considerable, as it determines the fate of the sick person; and this is most commonly done by means of a crisis. By this word he understood any sudden change in sickness, whether for the better or for the worse, whether health or death succeed immediately. Such a change, he says, is made at that time by nature, either abolishing or condemning the patient. Hence we may conclude, that Hippocrates imagined diseases to be only a disturbance of the animal economy, with which Nature was perpetually at variance, and using her utmost endeavours to expel the offending cause. Her manner of acting on these occasions is to reduce to their natural state those humours whose discord occasions the disturbance of the whole body, whether in relation to their quantity, quality, mixture, motion, or any other way in which they become offensive. The principal means employed by nature for this end is what Hippocrates calls conception. By this he understood bringing the morbid matter lodged in the humours to a crisis, such a state, as to be easily fitted for expulsion by whatever means nature might think most proper. When matters are brought to this pass, whatever is superfluous or hurtful immediately empties itself, or nature points out to physicians the way by which such an evacuation is to be accomplished. The crisis takes place either by bleeding, stool, vomit, sweat, urine, tumors or abscesses, scabs, pimples, spots, &c. But these evacuations are not to be looked upon as the effects of a true crisis, unless they are in considerable quantity; small discharges not being sufficient to make a crisis. On the contrary, small discharges are a sign that nature is deprived by the load of humours, and that she lets them go through weaknesses and continual irritation. What comes forth in this manner is crude, because the distemper is yet too strong; and while matters remain in this state, nothing but a bad or imperfect crisis is to be expected. This shows that the distemper triumphs, or at least is equal in strength to nature, which prognosticates death, or a prolongation of the disease. In this last case, however, nature often has an opportunity of attempting a new crisis more happy than the former, after having made fresh efforts to advance the conception of the humours.—It must here be observed, however, that, according to Hippocrates, conception cannot be made but in a certain time, as every fruit has a limited time to ripen; for he compares the humours which nature has digested to fruits come to maturity.\n\nThe time required for conception depends on the differences among distempers mentioned above. In those which Hippocrates calls very acute, the digestion or crisis happens by the fourth day; in those which are only acute, it happens on the 7th, 11th, or 14th day; which last is the longest period generally allowed by Hippocrates in distempers that are truly acute; though in some places he stretches it to the 20th or 21st, nay, sometimes to the 40th or 60th day. All diseases that exceed this last term are called chronic. And while in those diseases that exceed 14 days, he considers every fourth day as critical, or at least remarkable, by which we may judge whether the crisis on the following fourth day will be favourable or not; so in those which run from 20 to 40 he reckons only the sevenths, and in those that exceed 40 he begins to reckon by 20. Beyond the 120th he thinks that the number of days has no power over the crisis. They\nare then referred to the general changes of the seasons; some terminating about the equinoxes; others about the solstices; others about the rising or setting of the stars of certain constellations; or if numbers have yet any place, he reckons by months, or even whole years. Thus (he says), certain diseases in children have their crises in the seventh month after their birth, and others in their seventh or even their 14th year.\n\nThough Hippocrates mentions the 21st as one of the critical days in acute distempers, as already noticed; yet, in other places of his works, he mentions also the 26th. The reason he gives for this in one of those places of his work is, that the days of sickness were not quite entire. In general, however, he is much attached to the odd days: insomuch that in one of his aphorisms he tells us, \"The fevers that come out upon the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 17th, 21st, 27th, 31st, or 34th days, are beneficial; but those that come out upon other days signify that the sick shall be brought low, that his disease shall be very tedious, and that he shall be subject to relapses.\" He further says, \"That the fever which leaves the sick upon any but an odd day is usually apt to relapse.\" Sometimes, however, he confesses that it is otherwise; and he gives an instance of a salutary crisis happening on the sixth day. But these are very rare instances, and therefore cannot, in his opinion, overthrow the general rule.\n\nBesides the crisis, however, or the change which determines the fate of the patient, Hippocrates often speaks of another, which only changes the species of the distemper, without restoring the patient to health; as when a vertigo is turned to an epilepsy, a tertian fever to a quartan, or to a continued, &c.\n\nBut what has chiefly contributed to procure the great respect generally paid to Hippocrates, is his industry in observing the most minute circumstances of diseases, and his exactness in nicely describing everything that happened before, and every accident that appeared at the same time with them; and likewise what appeared to give ease, and what to increase the malady: which is what we call writing the history of a disease.—Thus he not only distinguished one disease from another by the signs which properly belonged to each; but by comparing the same sort of distemper which happened to several persons, and the accidents which usually appeared before and after, he could often foretell a disease before it began, and afterwards give a right judgement of the event of it. By this way of prognosticating, he came to be exceedingly admired; and this he carried to such a height, that it may justly be said to be his masterpiece; and Celsus, who lived after him, remarks, that succeeding physicians, though they found out several new things relating to the management of diseases, yet were obliged to the writings of Hippocrates for all that they knew of signs.\n\nThe first thing Hippocrates considered, when called to a patient, was his looks.—It was a good sign with him to have a visage resembling that of a person in health, and the same with what the sick man had before he was attacked by the disease. As it varied from this, so much the greater danger was apprehended. The following is the description which he gives of the looks of a dying man.—\"When a patient (says he) has his nose sharp, his eyes sunk, his temples hollow, his ears cold and contracted, the skin of his forehead tense and dry, and the colour of his face tending to a pale-green, or lead colour, one may pronounce for certain that death is very near at hand; unless the strength of the patient has been exhausted all at once by long watchings, or by a loofenefs, or being a long time without eating.\" This observation has been confirmed by succeeding physicians, who have, from him, denominated it the Hippocratic face. The lips hanging relaxed and cold, are likewise looked upon by Hippocrates as a confirmation of the foregoing prognostic. He took also his signs from the disposition of the eyes in particular. When a patient cannot bear the light; when he sheds tears involuntarily; when, in sleeping, some part of the white of the eye is seen, unless he usually sleeps after that manner, or has a loofenefs upon him: these signs, as well as the foregoing ones, prognosticate danger. The eyes deadened, as it were with a mist spread over them, or their brightness lost, likewise prelages death, or great weakness. The eyes sparkling, fierce, and fixed, denote the patient to be delirious, or that he soon will be seized with a frenzy. When the patient sees anything red, and like sparks of fire and lightning pass before his eyes, you may expect an hemorrhagy; and this often happens before those crises which are to be attended by a loss of blood.\n\nThe condition of the patient is also shown by his posture in bed. If you find him lying on one side, posture in his body, neck, legs, and arms, a little contracted, which is the posture of a man in health, it is a good sign: on the contrary, if he lies on his back, his arms stretched out, and his legs hanging down, it is a sign of great weakness; and particularly when the patient slides or lets himself fall down towards the feet, it denotes the approach of death. When a patient in a burning fever is continually feeling about with his hands and fingers, and moves them up before his face and eyes as if he was going to take away something that passed before them; or on his bed-covering, as if he was picking or searching for little straws, or taking away some filth, or drawing out little flocks of wool; all this is a sign that he is delirious, and that he will die. Amongst the other signs of a prevalent or approaching delirium he also adds this: When a patient who naturally speaks little begins to talk more than he used to do, or when one that talks much becomes silent, this change is to be reckoned a sort of delirium, or is a sign that the patient will soon fall into one. The frequent trembling or starting of the tendons of the wrist, prelages likewise a delirium. As to the different sorts of delirium, Hippocrates is much more afraid of those that run upon mournful subjects, than such as are accompanied with mirth.\n\nWhen a patient breathes fast, and is oppressed, it is a sign that he is in pain, and that the parts above the diaphragm are inflamed. Breathing long, or when the patient is a great while in taking his breath, shows him to be delirious; but easy and natural respiration is always a good sign in acute diseases. Hippocrates depended much on respiration in making his prognostics; and therefore has taken care in several places to describe the different manner of a patient's breathing. Continual watchings in acute diseases, are signs of present pain, or a delirium near at hand.\nHippocrates also drew signs from all excrements, whatever they are, that are separated from the body of man. His most remarkable prognostics, however, were from the urine. The patient's urine, in his opinion, is best when the sediment is white, soft to the touch, and of an equal consistence. If it continue so during the course of the distemper, and till the time of the crisis, the patient is in no danger, and will soon be well. This is what Hippocrates called concocted urine, or what denotes the concoction of the humours; and he observed, that this concoction of the urine seldom appeared thoroughly, but on the days of the crisis which happily put an end to the distemper. \"We ought (said Hippocrates) to compare the urine with the purulent matter which runs from ulcers. As the pus, which is white, and of the same quality with the sediment of the urine we are now speaking of, is a sign that the ulcer is on the point of closing; so that which is clear, and of another colour than white, and of an ill smell, is a sign that the ulcer is virulent, and in the same manner difficult to be cured: the urines that are like this we have described are only those which may be named good; all the rest are ill, and differ from one another only in the degrees of more and less. The first never appear but when nature has overcome the disease; and are a sign of the concoction of humours, without which you cannot hope for a certain cure. On the contrary, the last are made as long as the crudity remains, and the humours continue unconcocted. Among the urines of this last sort, the best are reddish, with a sediment that is soft and of an equal consistence; which denotes, that the disease will be somewhat tedious, but without danger. The worst are those which are very red, and at the same time clear and without sediment; or that are muddy and troubled in the making. In urine there is often a sort of cloud hanging in the vessel in which it is received; the higher this rises, or the farther distant it is from the bottom, or the more different from the colour of the laudable sediment abovementioned, the more there is of crudity. That which is yellow, or of a sandy colour, denotes abundance of bile; that which is black is the worst, especially if it has an ill smell, and is either altogether muddy or altogether clear. That whole sediment is like large ground wheat, or little flakes or scales spread one upon another, or bran, prefigures ill, especially the last. The fat or oil that sometimes swims upon the top of the urine, and appears in a form something like a spider's web, is a sign of a consumption of the flesh and solid parts. The making of a great quantity of urine is the sign of a crisis, and sometimes the quality of it shows how the bladder is affected. We must also observe, that Hippocrates compared the state of the tongue with the urine; that is to say, when the tongue was yellow, and charged with bile, the urine he knew must of course be of the same colour; and when the tongue was red and moist, the urine was of its natural colour.\n\nAmong his prognostics from the excretions by stool are the following. Those that are soft, yellowish, of some consistence, and not of an extraordinary ill smell, that answer to the quantity of what is taken inwardly, and that are voided at the usual hours, are the best of all. They ought also to be of a thicker consistence when the distemper is near the crisis; and it ought to be taken for a good prognostic, when some worms, particularly the round and long, are evacuated at the same time with them. The prognosis, however, may still be favourable, though the matter excreted be thin and liquid, provided it make not too much noise in coming out, and the evacuation be not in a small quantity nor too often; nor in so great abundance, nor so often, as to make the patient faint. All matter that is watery, white, of a pale green or red colour, or frothy and viscid, is bad. That which is blackish, or of a livid hue, is the most pernicious. That which is pure black, and nothing else but a discharge of black bile, always prognosticates very ill; this humour, from what partsoever it comes, showing the ill disposition of the intestines. The matter that is of several different colours, denotes the length of the distemper; and, at the same time, that it may be of dangerous consequence. Hippocrates places in the same class the matter that is bilious or yellow, and mixed with blood, or green and black, or like the dregs or scumings of the guts. The stools that consist of pure bile, or entirely of phlegm, he also looks upon to be very bad.\n\nMatter ejected by vomiting ought to be mixed with bile and phlegm; where one of these humours only is observed, it is worse. That which is black, livid, green, or of the colour of a leek, indicates alarming consequences. The same is to be said of that which smells very ill; and if at the same time it be livid, death is not far off. The vomiting of blood is very often a mortal symptom.\n\nThe spittings which give ease in diseases of the lungs, expectoration, and in pleurics, are those that come up readily and spontaneously without difficulty; and it is good if they be mixed at the beginning with much yellow: but if they appear of the same colour, or are red, a great while after the beginning of the distemper, if they are salt and acrimonious, and cause violent coughings, they are not good. Spittings purely yellow are bad; and those that are white, viscid, and frothy, give no ease. Whiteness is a good sign of concoction in regard to spittings; but they ought not at all to be viscid, nor too thick, nor too clear. We may make the same judgment of the excretions of the nose according to their concoction and crudity. Spittings that are black, green, and red, are of very bad consequence. In inflammations of the lungs, those that are mixed with bile and blood presage well if they appear at the beginning, but are bad if they arise not about the seventh day. But the worst sign in these distempers is, when there is no expectoration at all, and the too great quantity of matter that is ready to be discharged this way makes a rattling in the breast. After spitting of blood, the discharge of purulent matter often follows, which brings on a consumption, and at last death.\n\nA kind good sweat is that which arises on the day of the crisis, and is discharged in abundance all over the body, and at the same time from all parts of the body, and thus carries off the fever: A cold sweat is alarming, especially in acute fevers, for in others it is only a sign of long continuance. When the patient sweats nowhere but on the head and neck, it is a sign that the disease will be long and dangerous. A gentle sweat in some particular part, of the head and breast, for instance, gives no relief, but denotes the seat of the distemper, or the weakness of the part.\nThis kind of sweat was called by Hippocrates ephidrosis.\n\nThe hypochondria, or the abdomen in general, ought always to be soft and even, as well on the right side as on the left. When there is any hardness or unevenness in those parts, or heat and swellings, or when the patient cannot endure to have it touched, it is a sign the intestines are indispersed.\n\nHippocrates also inquired into the state of the pulse, or the beating of the arteries. The most ancient physicians, however, and even Hippocrates himself, for a long time, by this word understood the violent pulsation that is felt in an inflamed part, without putting the fingers to it. It is observed by Galen, and other physicians, that Hippocrates touches on the subject of the pulse more slightly than any other on which he treats. But that our celebrated physician understood something even on this subject, is easily gathered from several passages in his writings; as when he observes, that in acute fevers the pulse is very quick and very great; and when he makes mention, in the same place, of trembling pulses, and those that beat slowly. He likewise observes, that in some diseases incident to women, when the pulse strikes the finger faintly, and in a languishing manner, it is a sign of approaching death. He remarks also, in the Coaca Pronoiones, that the whole vein, that is to say, whose artery of the elbow, beats, is just going to run mad, or else that the person is at that time very much under the influence of anger.\n\nFrom this account of Hippocrates, it will appear, that he was not near so much taken up with reasoning on the phenomena of diseases, as with reporting them. He was content to observe these phenomena accurately, to distinguish diseases by them, and judged of the event by comparing them exactly together. For his skill in prognostics he was indeed very remarkable, as we have already mentioned, inasmuch that he and his pupils were looked upon by the vulgar as prophets. What adds very much to his reputation is, that he lived in an age when physic was altogether buried in superstition, and yet he did not suffer himself to be carried away by it; on the contrary, on many occasions, he expresses his abhorrence of it.\n\nHaving thus seen in what Hippocrates makes the difference between health and sickness to consist, and likewise the most remarkable signs from whence he drew his prognostics, we must now consider the means he prescribed for the preservation of health, and the cure of diseases. One of his principal maxims was this, That, to preserve health, we ought not to overcharge ourselves with too much eating, nor neglect the use of exercise and labour. In the next place, That we ought by no means to accustom ourselves to too nice and exact a method of living; because those who have once begun to act by this rule, if they vary in the least from it, find themselves very ill; which does not happen to those who take a little more liberty, and live somewhat more irregularly. Notwithstanding this he does not neglect to inquire diligently into the articles which those who were in health used for food in his time. Here we cannot help taking notice of the prodigious disparity between the delicacy of the people in our days and in those of Hippocrates; for he takes great pains to tell the difference between the flesh of a dog, a fox, a horse, and an ass; which he would not have done if at that time they had not been used for victuals, at least by the common people. Besides these, however, Hippocrates speaks of all other kinds of provision that are now in use; for example, salads, milk, whey, cheese, flesh as well of birds as of four-footed beasts; fresh and salt fish, eggs, all kinds of pulse, and the different kinds of grain we feed on, as well as the different sorts of bread that are made of it. He also speaks very often of a sort of liquid food, or broth, made of barley-meal, or some other grain, which they steeped for some time, and then boiled in water. With regard to drink, he takes a great deal of pains to distinguish the good waters from the bad. The best, in his opinion, ought to be clear, light, without smell or taste, and taken out of the fountains that turn towards the east. The salt waters, those that he calls hard, and those that rise out of fenny ground, are the worst of all; he condemns also those that come from melted snow. But though Hippocrates makes all those distinctions, he advises those who are in health to drink of the first water that comes in their way. He speaks also of alum waters, and those that are hot; but does not enlarge upon their qualities. He advises to mix wine with an equal quantity of water; and this (he says) is the just proportion; by using which the wine will expel what is hurtful to the body, and the water will serve to temper the acrimony of the humours.\n\nFor those that are in health, and likewise for such exercises as are tick, Hippocrates advises exercise. The books, however, which treat on this subject, M. Le Clerc conjectures to have been written by Herodicus, who first introduced gymnastic exercise into medicine, and who is said by Hippocrates himself to have killed several people by forcing them to walk while they were afflicted with fevers and other inflammatory disorders. The advice given in them consists chiefly in directions for the times in which we ought to walk, and the condition we ought to be in before it; when we ought to walk slowly, and when to run, &c.; and all this with design to bring the body down, or dissipate the humours. Wrestling, although a violent exercise, is numbered with the rest. In the same place also mention is made of a play of the hands and fingers, which was thought good for health, and called chronomie; and of another diversion which was performed round a sort of ball hung up, which they called coryceus, and which they struck forward with both their hands.\n\nWith regard to those things which ought to be separated from, or retained in the human body, Hippocrates observes, that people ought to take great care not to load themselves with excrements, or keep them in too long; and besides the exercise above-mentioned, which carries off one part of them, and which he prescribes chiefly on this account, he advises people to excite and rouse up nature when she flagged, and did not endeavour to expel the red, or take care of the impediments by which she was resisted. For this reason he prescribed meats proper for loosening the belly; and when these were not sufficient, he directed the use of clysters and suppositories. For thin and emaciated persons he directed clysters composed only of milk and oily unctuous substances, which they mixed with a decoction.\nHippocrates advised in the first place, That contraries, or opposites, are the remedies for each other; and this maxim he explains by an aphorism; in which he says, that evacuations cure those distempers which come from repletion, and repletion those that are caused by evacuation. So heat is destroyed by cold, and cold by heat, &c. In the second place, he asserted that phytic is an addition of what is wanting, and a subtraction or retrenchment of what is superfluous: an axiom which is thus explained, that there are some juices or humours, which in particular cases ought to be evacuated, or driven out of the body, or dried up; and some others which ought to be restored to the body, or caused to be produced there again. As to the method to be taken for this addition or retrenchment, he gives this general caution, That you ought to be careful how you fill up, or evacuate, all at once, or too quickly, or too much; and that it is equally dangerous to heat or cool again on a sudden; or rather, you ought not to do it: every thing that runs to an excess being an enemy to nature.\n\nIn the fourth place, Hippocrates allowed that we ought sometimes to dilate, and sometimes to lock up: to dilate, or open the passages by which the humours are voided naturally, when they are not sufficiently opened, or when they are closed; and, on the contrary, to lock up or straiten the passages that are relaxed, when the juices that pass there ought not to pass, or when they pass in too great quantity. He adds, that we ought sometimes to smooth, and sometimes to make rough; sometimes to harden, and sometimes to soften again; sometimes to make more fine or supple; sometimes to thicken; sometimes to rouse up, and at other times to stupify or take away the senses; all in relation to the solid parts of the body, or to the humours. He gives also this farther lesson, That we ought to have regard to the course the humours take, from whence they come, and whither they go; and in consequence of that, when they go where they ought not, that we make them take a turn about, or carry them another way, almost like the turning the course of a river: or, upon other occasions, that we endeavour if possible to recall, or make the same humours return back again; drawing upward such as have a tendency downward, and drawing downward such as tend upward. We ought also to carry off, by convenient ways, that which is necessary to be carried off; and not let the humours once evacuated enter into the vessels again. Hippocrates gives also the following instruction, That when we do any thing according to reason, though the success be not answerable, we ought not easily, or too hastily, to alter the manner of acting, as long as the reasons for it are yet good. But as this maxim might sometimes prove deceitful, he gives the following as a corrector to it: \"We ought (says he) to mind with a great deal of attention what gives ease, and what creates pain; what is easily supported, and what cannot be endured.\" We ought not to do anything rashly; but ought often to pause, or wait, without doing anything: by this way, if you do the patient no good, you will at least do him no hurt.\n\nThese are the principal and most general maxims of the practice of Hippocrates, and which proceed upon the supposition laid down at the beginning, viz., that nature cures diseases. We next proceed to consider particularly the remedies employed by him, which will serve to give us further instructions concerning his practice.\n\nDiet was the first, the principal, and often the only remedy made use of by this great physician to answer dieting most of the intentions above mentioned: by means of it he opposed the moist to dry, hot to cold, &c.; and what he looked upon to be the most considerable point was, that thus he supported nature, and assisted her to overcome the malady. The dietetic part of medicine was so much the invention of Hippocrates himself, that he was very desirous to be accounted the author of it; and the better to make it appear that it was a new remedy in his days, he says expressly, that the ancients had wrote almost nothing concerning the diet of the sick, having omitted this point, though it was one of the most essential parts of the art.\n\nThe diet prescribed by Hippocrates for patients labouring under acute distempers, differed from that which he ordered for those afflicted with chronic ones. In the former, which require a more particular exactness in relation to diet, he preferred liquid food to that which was solid, especially in fevers. For these he used a sort of broth made of cleansed barley; and to this he gave the name of pifan. The manner in which the ancients prepared a pifan was as follows:\n\nThey\nThey first steeped the barley in water till it was plumped up; and afterwards they dried it in the sun, and beat it to take off the hulls. They next ground it; and having let the flour boil a long time in the water, they put it out into the sun, and when it was dry they pressed it close. It is properly this flour to prepared that is called pifan. They did almost the same thing with wheat, rice, lentils, and other grain; but they gave these pifans the name of the grain from whence they were extracted, as pifan of lentils, rice, &c., while the pifan of barley was called simply pifan, on account of the excellency of it. When they wanted to use it, they boiled one part of it in 10 or 15 of water; and when it began to grow plump in boiling, they added a little vinegar, and a very small quantity of anise or leek, to keep it from clogging or filling the stomach with wind. Hippocrates prescribed this broth for women that have pains in their belly after delivery. \"Boil some of this pifan (says he), with some leek, and the fat of a goat, and give it to the woman in bed.\" This will not be thought very singular, if we reflect on what has been hinted above concerning the indelicate manner of living in those times. He preferred the pifan to all other food in fevers, because it softened and moistened much, and was besides of easy digestion. If he was concerned in a continual fever, he would have the patient begin with a pifan of a pretty thick consistence, and go on by little and little, lessening the quantity of barley-flour as the height of the distemper approached; so that he did not feed the patient but with what he called the juice of the pifan; that is, the pifan strained, where there was but very little of the flour remaining, in order that nature being discharged in part from the care of digesting the aliments, she might the more easily hold out to the end, and overcome the distemper, or the cause of it. With regard to the quantity, he caused the pifan to be taken twice a day by such patients as in health used to take two meals a day, not thinking it convenient that those who were sick should eat oftener than when they were well. He also would not allow eating twice a day to those who ate but once in that time when in health. In the paroxysm of a fever he gave nothing at all; and in all distempers where there are exacerbations, he forbade nourishment while the exacerbations continued. He let children eat more; but those who were grown up to man's estate, or were of an advanced age, less; making allowance, however, for the custom of each particular person, or for that of the country.\n\nBut though he was of opinion that too much food ought not to be allowed to the sick, he did not agree with some physicians who prescribed long abstinence, especially in the beginning of fevers. The reason he gave for this was, that the contrary practice weakened the patients too much during the first days of the distemper, by which means their physicians were obliged to allow them more food when the illness was at its height, which in his opinion was improper. Besides, in acute distempers, and particularly in fevers, Hippocrates made choice of refreshing and moistening nourishment; and amongst other things prescribed orange, melon, spinach, gourd, &c. This sort of food he gave to those that were in a condition to eat, or could take something more than a pifan.\n\nThe drink he commonly gave to his patients was made of eight parts of water and one of honey. In some distempers he added a little vinegar; but besides these, they had another sort named mixtura, or mixture. One prescription of this sort we find intended for a consumptive person; it consisted of rue, anise, celery, coriander, juice of pomegranate, the roughest red wine, water, flour of wheat and barley, with old cheese made of goats milk. Hippocrates did not approve of giving plain water to the sick; but though he generally preferred the drinks above mentioned, he did not absolutely forbid the use of wine, even in acute distempers and fevers, provided the patients were not delirious nor had pains in their head. Besides, he took care to distinguish the wines proper in these cases; preferring to all other sorts white-wine that was clear and had a great deal of water, with neither sweetness nor flavour.\n\nThese are the most remarkable particulars concerning the diet prescribed by Hippocrates in acute distempers; in chronic ones he made very much use of milk and whey; though we are not certain whether this was done on account of the nourishment expected from them, or that he accounted them medicines.\n\nThere were many diseases for which he judged the bath was a proper remedy; and he takes notice of bathing all the circumstances that are necessary in order to cause the patient receive benefit from it, among which the following are the principal. The patient that bathes himself must remain still and quiet in his place without speaking while the assistants throw water over his head or are wiping him dry; for which last purpose he desired them to keep sponges, instead of that instrument called by the ancients frigil, which served to rub off from the skin the dirt and naushefs left upon it by the unguents and oils with which they anointed themselves. He must also take care not to catch cold; and must not bathe immediately after eating and drinking, nor eat or drink immediately after coming out of the bath. Regard must also be had whether the patient has been accustomed to bathe while in health, and whether he has been benefited or hurt by it. Lastly, he must abstain from the bath when the body is too open, or too costive, or when he is too weak; or if he has an inclination to vomit, a great loss of appetite, or bleeds at the nose. The advantage of the bath, according to Hippocrates, consists in moistening and refreshing, taking away weariness, making the skin soft and the joints pliant; in provoking urine, and opening the other excretories. He allows two baths in a day to those who have been accustomed to it in health.\n\nIn chronic distempers Hippocrates approved very much of exercise, though he did not allow it in acute ones; but even in these he did not think that a patient ought always to lie in bed; but tells us, that \"we must sometimes push the timorous out of bed, and rouse up the lazy.\"\n\nWhen he found that diet and exercise were not sufficient to ease nature of a burden of corrupted humours, he was obliged to make use of other means, of purgation, which purgation was one. By this word he understood all the contrivances that are made use of to discharge the stomach and bowels; though it commonly signifies only\nonly the evacuation by stool. This evacuation he imagined to be occasioned by the purgative medicines attracting the humours to themselves. When first taken into the body, he thought they attracted that humour which was most similar to them, and then the others, one after another.—Most of the purgatives used in his time were emetics also, or at least were very violent in their operation downwards. These were the white and black hellebore; the first of which is now reckoned among the poisons. He used also the Cnidian berries, eneornis, peplum, thaplia; the juice of hippophae, a sort of rhamnus; elaterium, or juice of the wild cucumber; flowers of bras, coloquintida, scammony, the magnesian stone, &c.\n\nAs these purgatives were all very strong, Hippocrates was extremely cautious in their exhibition. He did not prescribe them in the dog-days; nor did he ever purge women with child, and very seldom children or old people. He principally used purgatives in chronic distempers; but was much more wary in acute ones. In his books entitled \"Of Epidemical Distempers,\" there are very few patients mentioned to whom he gave purgative medicines. He also takes notice expressly, that these medicines having been given in cases of the distempers of which he was treating, had produced very bad effects. We are not, however, from this to conclude, that Hippocrates absolutely condemned purging in acute distempers; for in some places he expressly mentions his having given them with success. He was of opinion, for instance, that purging was good in a pleurisy when the pain was seated below the diaphragm; and in this case he gave black hellebore, or some peplum mixed with the juice of lauripitium.\n\nThe principal rule Hippocrates gives with relation to purging is, that we ought only to purge off the humours that are concocted, and not those that are yet crude, taking particular care not to do it at the beginning of the distemper, lest the humours should be disturbed or stirred up, which happens pretty often. He was not, however, the first who remarked that it would be of ill consequence to stir the humours in the beginning of an acute distemper. The Egyptian physicians had before observed the same thing. By the beginning of a distemper, Hippocrates understood all the time from the first day to the fourth complete.\n\nHippocrates imagined that each purgative medicine was adapted to the carrying off some particular humour; and hence the distinction of purgatives into hydragogue, cholagogue, &c., which is now justly exploded. In consequence of this notion, he contended that we knew if a purgative had drawn from the body what was fit to be evacuated according as the patient was found well or ill upon it. If we found ourselves well, it was a sign that the medicine had effectually expelled the offending humour. On the contrary, if we were ill, he imagined, whatever quantity of humour came away, that the humour which caused the illness still remained; not judging of the goodness or badness of a purge by the quantity of matters that were voided by it, but by their quality and the effect that followed after it.\n\nVomits were also pretty much used as medicines by Hippocrates. We have already seen what those were which he prescribed to people in health by way of preventives. With regard to the sick, he sometimes advised them to the same, when his intentions were only to cleanse the stomach. But when he had a mind to recall the humours, as he termed it, from the inmost recesses of the body, he made use of bitter remedies. Among these was white hellebore; and this indeed he most frequently used to excite vomiting. He gave this root particularly to melancholy and mad people; and from the great use made of it in these cases by Hippocrates and other ancient physicians, the phrase to have need of hellebore, became a proverbial expression for being out of one's senses. He gave it also in delusions, which come, according to him, from the brain, and throw themselves on the nostrils or ears, or fill the mouth with saliva, or that cause stubborn pains in the head, and a weariness or an extraordinary heaviness, or a weakness of the knees, or a swelling all over the body. He gave it to consumptive persons in broth of lentils, to such as were afflicted with the dropy called leucocephalognathia, and in other chronic disorders. But we do not find that he made use of it in acute distempers, except in the cholera morbus, where he says he preferred it with benefit. Some took this medicine fasting; but most took it after supper, as was commonly practised with regard to vomits taken by way of prevention. The reason why he gave this medicine most commonly after eating was, that by mixing with the aliment, its acrimony might be somewhat abated, and it might operate with less violence on the membranes of the stomach. With the same intention also he sometimes gave a plant called seismoides, and sometimes mixed it with hellebore. Lastly, in certain cases he gave what he called soft or sweet hellebore. This term had some relation to the quality of the hellebore, or perhaps the quantity he gave.\n\nWhen Hippocrates intended only to keep the body open, or evacuate the contents of the intestines, he made use of simples; as for example, the herb mercury, or cabbage; the juice or decoction of which he ordered to be drank. For the same purpose he used whey, and also cows and asses milk; adding a little salt to it, and sometimes letting it boil a little. If he gave asses milk alone, he caused a great quantity of it to be taken, so that it must of necessity loosen the body. In one place he prescribes no less than nine pounds of it to be taken as a laxative, but does not specify the time in which it was to be taken. With the same intention he made use of suppositories and clysters. The former were compounded of honey, the juice of the herb mercury, of nitre, powder of colocynth, and other sharp ingredients, to irritate the anus. These they formed into a ball, or into a long cylindrical mass like a finger. The clysters he made use of for sick people were sometimes the same with those already mentioned as preventives for people in health. At other times he mixed the decoction of herbs with nitre, honey, and oil, or other ingredients, according as he imagined he could by that means attract, wash, irritate, or soften. The quantity of liquor he ordered was about 35 ounces; from which it is probable he did not intend that it should all be used at one time.\n\nOn some occasions Hippocrates proposed to purge the head alone. This practice he employed, after purging the rest of the body, in an apoplexy, invertebrate pains...\npains of the head, a certain sort of jaundice, a consumption, and the greatest part of chronical distempers. For that purpose he made use of the juices of several plants, as celery; to which he sometimes added aromatic drugs, making the patients snuff up this mixture into their nostrils. He used also powders compounded of myrrh, the flowers of balsam, and white hellebore, which he caused them put up into the nose, to make them sneeze, and to draw the phlegm from the brain. For the same purpose also he used what he calls tetragonon, that is, \"something having four angles;\" but what this was, is now altogether unknown, and was so even in the days of Galen. The latter physician, however, conjectures it to be antimony, or certain flakes found in it.\n\nIn the distemper called empymema (or a collection of matter in the breast), he made use of a very rough medicine. He commanded the patient to draw in his tongue as much as he was able; and when that was done, he endeavoured to put into the hollow of the lungs a liquor that irritated the part, which raising a violent cough, forced the lungs to discharge the purulent matter contained in them. The materials that he used for this purpose were of different sorts; sometimes he took the root of arum, which he ordered to be boiled with a little salt, in a sufficient quantity of water and oil; dissolving a little honey in it. At other times, when he intended to purge more strongly, he took the flowers of copper and hellebore; after that he shook the patient violently by the shoulders, the better to loosen the pus. This remedy, according to Galen, he received from the Cnidian physicians; and it has never been used by the succeeding ones, probably because the patients could not suffer it.\n\nBlood-letting was another method of evacuation pretty much used by Hippocrates. Another aim he had in this, besides the mere evacuation, was to divert or recall the course of the blood when he imagined it was going where it ought not. A third end of bleeding was to procure a free motion of the blood and spirits.\n\nHippocrates had also a fourth intention for bleeding, and this was refreshment. So in the iliac passion, he orders bleeding in the arm and in the head; to the end, says he, that the superior venter, or the breast, may cease to be overheated. With regard to this evacuation, his conduct was much the same as to purging, in respect of time and persons. We ought, says he, to let blood in acute distempers, when they are violent, if the party be lusty and in the flower of his age. We ought also to have regard to the time, both in respect to the disease and to the season in which we let blood. He also informs us, that blood ought to be let in great pains, and particularly in inflammations. Among these he reckons such as fall upon the principal viscera, as the liver, lungs, and spleen, as also the quinsy and pleurisy, if the pain of the latter be above the diaphragm. In these cases he would have the patients bled till they faint, especially if the pain be very acute; or rather he advises that the orifice should not be closed till the colour of the blood alters, so that from livid it turn red, or from red livid. In a quinsy he bled in both arms at once. Difficulty of breathing he also reckons among the distempers that require bleeding; and he mentions another sort of inflammation of the lungs, which he calls a swelling or tumor of the lungs arising from heat; in which case he advises to bleed, in all parts of the body; and directs it particularly by the arms, tongue, and nostrils. To make bleeding the more useful in all pains, he directed to open the vein nearest the part affected; in a pleurisy he directs to take blood from the arm of the side affected; and for the same reason, in pains of the head, he directs the veins of the nose and forehead to be opened. When the pain was not urgent, and bleeding was advised by way of prevention, he directed the blood to be taken from the parts farther off, with a design to divert the blood insensibly from the seat of pain. The highest burning fevers, which show neither signs of inflammation nor pain, he does not rank among those distempers which require bleeding. On the contrary, he maintains that a fever itself is in some cases a reason against bleeding. If any one, says he, has an ulcer in the head, he must bleed, unless he has a fever. He says further, those that lose their speech of a sudden must be bled, unless they have a fever. Perhaps he was afraid of bleeding in fevers, because he supposed that they were produced by the bile and pituita, which grew hot, and afterwards heated the whole body, which is, says he, what we call fever, and which, in his opinion, cannot well be evacuated by bleeding. In other places also he looks upon the presence or abundance of bile to be an objection to bleeding; and he orders to forbear venefication even in a pleurisy, if there be bile. To this we must add, that Hippocrates distinguished very particularly between a fever which followed no other distemper, but was itself the original malady, and a fever which came upon inflammation. In the early ages of physic, the first only were properly called fevers: the others took their names from the parts affected; as pleurisy, peripneumony, hepatitis, nephritis, &c., which names signify that the pleura, the lungs, the liver, or the kidneys, are diseased, but do not intimate the fever which accompanies the disease. In this latter sort of fever Hippocrates constantly ordered bleeding, but not in the former. Hence, in his books on Epidemic Distempers, we find but few directions for bleeding in the acute distempers, and particularly in the great number of continual and burning fevers there treated of. In the first and third book we find but one single instance of bleeding, and that in a pleurisy; in which, too, he laid till the eighth day of the distemper. Galen, however, and most other commentators on Hippocrates, are of opinion that he generally bled his patients plentifully in the beginning of acute disorders, though he takes no notice of it in his writings. But had this been the case, he would not perhaps have had the opportunity of seeing so many fevers terminate by crises, or natural evacuations, which happen of themselves on certain days. Hippocrates, in fact, laid so much weight upon the affluence of nature and the method of diet, which was his favourite medicine, that he thought if they took care to diet the patients according to rule, they might leave the rest to nature. These are his principles, from which he never deviates; so that his writings on Epidemical Diseases seem to have been composed only with an intention to leave to posterity an exact model of management in pursuance of these principles.\nWith regard to the rules laid down by Hippocrates for bleeding, we must farther take notice, that in all diseases which had their seat above the liver, he bled in the arm, or in some of the upper parts of the body; but for those that were situated below it he opened the veins of the foot, ankle, or ham. If the belly was too loose, and bleeding was at the same time thought necessary, he ordered the loofenels to be slopped before bleeding.\n\nAlmost all these instances, however, regard scarce anything but acute distempers; but we find several concerning chronical diseases. \"A young man complained of great pain in his belly, with a rumbling while he was fasting, which ceased after eating; this pain and rumbling continuing, his meat did him no good; but, on the contrary, he daily walked and grew lean. Several medicines, as well purges as vomits, were given him in vain. At length it was resolved to bleed him by intervals, first in one arm and then in the other, till he had scarcely any blood left, and by this method he was perfectly cured.\"\n\nHippocrates let blood also in a dropfy, even in a tympany; and in both cases he prescribes bleeding in the arm. In a disease occasioned by an overgrown spleen, he proposes bleeding several times repeated at a vein of the arm which he calls the splenic; and in one species of jaundice, he proposes bleeding under the tongue. On some occasions he took away great quantities of blood, as appears from what we have already observed. Sometimes he continued the bleeding till the patient fainted; at other times he would bleed in both arms at once; at others, he did it in several places of the body, and at several times. The veins he opened were those of the arm, the hands, the ankles on both sides, the hams, the forehead, behind the head, the tongue, the nose, behind the ears, under the breasts, and those of the arms; besides which, he burnt others, and opened several arteries. He likewise used cupping-vessels, with intent to recol or withdraw the humours which fell upon any part. Sometimes he contented himself with the bare attraction made by the cupping-vessels, but sometimes also he made incisions.\n\nWhen bleeding and purging, which were the principal and most general means used by Hippocrates for taking off a plethora, proved insufficient for that purpose, he had recourse to diuretics and sudorifics. The former were of different sorts, according to the constitution of the persons: sometimes baths, and sometimes sweet wine, were employed to provoke urine; sometimes the nourishment which we take contributes to it; and amongst those herbs which are commonly eaten, Hippocrates recommends garlic, leeks, onions, cucumbers, melons, gourds, fennel, and all other things which have a biting taste and a strong smell. With these he numbers honey, mixed with water or vinegar, and all salt meats. But, on some occasions, he took four cantharides, and, pulling off their wings and feet, gave them in wine and honey. These remedies were given in a great number of chronic distempers after purging, when he thought the blood was overcharged with a sort of moisture which he calls ichor; or in suppressions of urine, and when it was made in less quantity than it ought. There were also some cases in which he would force sweat as well as urine; but he neither mentions the diseases in which sudorifics are proper, nor lets us know what medicines are to be used for this purpose, except in one single passage, where he mentions sweating, by pouring upon the head a great quantity of water till the feet sweat; that is, till the sweat diffuses itself over the whole body, running from head to foot. After this he would have them eat boiled meat, and drink pure wine, and being well covered with clothes, lay themselves down to rest. The disease for which he proposes the above mentioned remedy is a fever; which is not, according to him, produced by bile or phlegm, but by mere latitude, or some other similar cause; from whence we may conclude that he did not approve of sweating in any other kind of fever.\n\nOther remedies which Hippocrates tells us he made use of were those that purged neither bile nor phlegm, but act by cooling, drying, heating, moistening, or by closing and thickening, revolting and dissipating. These medicines, however, he does not particularly mention; and it is probable they were only some particular kinds of food. To these he joined hypnotics, or such things as procure sleep; but these last were used very seldom, and, it is most probable, were only different preparations of poppies.\n\nLastly, besides the medicines already mentioned, which acted in a sensible manner, Hippocrates made use of others called specifics; whose action he did not understand, and for the use of which he could give no reason but his own experience, or that of other physicians. These he had learned from his predecessors the descendants of Aëtulapius, who, being empirics, did not trouble themselves about inquiring into the operation of remedies, provided their patients were cured.\n\nOf the external remedies prescribed by Hippocrates, fomentations were the chief. These were of two kinds. The one was a sort of bath, in which the patient sat in a vessel full of a decoction of simples appropriated to his malady; so that the part affected was soaked in the decoction. This was chiefly used in distempers of the womb, of the arms, the bladder, the reins, and generally all the parts below the diaphragm. The second way of fomenting was, to take warm water and put it into a skin or bladder, or even fomenta into a copper or earthen vessel, and to apply it to the part affected; as, for example, in a pleurisy. They used likewise a large sponge, which they dipped in the water or other hot liquor, and squeezed out part of the liquor before they applied it. The same use they made of barley, vetches, or bran, which were boiled in some proper liquor, and applied in a linen bag. These are called moist fomentations. The dry ones were made of oat or millet, heated considerably, and applied to the part. Another kind of fomentation was the vapour of some hot liquor; an instance of which we find in his first book of the Distempers of Women. He casts, at several times, bits of red-hot iron into urine, and, covering up the patient close, caused her to receive the steam below. His design in these kinds of fomentations was to warm the part, to resolve or dissipate, and draw out the peccant matter, to mollify and allay pain, to open the passages, or even to shut them, according as the fomentations were emollient or astringent.\n\nFumigations\nFunigations were likewise very often used by Hippocrates. In the quinsy, he burned hyssop with sulphur and pitch, and caused the smoke to be drawn into the throat by a funnel; and by this means he brought away abundance of phlegm through the mouth and through the nose. For this purpose he took nitre, marjoram, and cress-seeds, which he boiled in water, vinegar, and oil, and, while it was on the fire, caused the patient to draw in the steam by a pipe. In his works we find a great number of fumigants for the distempers of women, to promote the menstrual flux, to check it, to help conception, and to ease pains in the matrix, or the suffocation of it. On these occasions he used such aromatics as were then known, viz. cinnamon, cassia, myrrh, and several odoriferous plants; likewise some minerals, such as nitre, sulphur, and pitch, and caused the patient to receive the vapours through a funnel into the uterus.\n\nGargles, a kind of fomentations for the mouth, were also known to Hippocrates. In the quinsy he used a gargle made of marjoram, savory, celery, mint, and nitre, boiled with water and a little vinegar. When this was strained, they added honey to it, and washed their mouths frequently with it.\n\nOils and ointments were likewise much used by Hippocrates, with a view to mollify and abate pain, to ripen boils, resolve tumours, refresh after weariness, make the body supple, &c. For this purpose, sometimes pure oil of olives was used; sometimes certain simples were infused in it, as the leaves of myrtle and roses; and the latter kind of oil was in much request among the ancients. There were other sorts of oils sometimes in use, however, which were much more compounded. Hippocrates speaks of one named Sulfur, which was made of the flowers of the iris, of some aromatics, and of an ointment of narcissus made with the flowers of narcissus and aromatics infused in oil. But the most compounded of all his ointments was that called natropo, which he made particularly for women; and consisted of a great number of ingredients. Another ointment, to which he gave the name of ceratum, was composed of oil and wax. An ointment which he recommends for the softening a tumor, and the cleansing a wound, was made by the following receipt: \"Take the quantity of a nut of the marrow or fat of a sheep, of mastic or turpentine the quantity of a bean, and as much was; melt these over a fire, with oil of roses, for a ceratum.\" Sometimes he added pitch and wax, and, with a sufficient quantity of oil, made a composition somewhat more consistent than the former, which he called ceroplasma.\n\nCataplasm were a sort of remedies less consistent than the two former. They were made of powders or herbs steeped or boiled in water or some other liquor, to which sometimes oil was added. They were used with a view to soften or resolve tumors, ripen abscesses, &c., though they had also cooling cataplasms made of the leaves of beets or oak, fig or olive-trees, boiled in water.\n\nLastly, To complete the catalogue of the external remedies used by Hippocrates, we shall mention a sort of medicine called collyrium. It was compounded of powders, to which was added a small quantity of some ointment, or juice of a plant, to make a solid or dry mass; the form of which was long and round, which was kept for use. Another composition of much the same nature was a sort of lozenge of the bigness of a small piece of money, which was burnt upon coals for a perfume, and powdered for particular uses. In his works we find likewise descriptions of powders for several uses, to take off fungous flesh, and to blow into the eyes in ophthalmies, &c.\n\nThese were almost all the medicines used by Hippocrates for external purposes. The compound medicines given inwardly were either liquid, solid, or lambative. The liquid ones were prepared either by decoction or infusion in a proper liquor, which, when strained, were kept for use; or by macerating certain powders in such liquors, and so taking them together, or by mixing different kinds of liquors together. The solid medicines consisted of juices insipidated; of gums, resins, or powders, made up with them or with honey, or something proper to give the necessary consistence to the medicine. These were made up in a form and quantity fit to be swallowed with ease. The lambative was of a consistence between solid and fluid; and the patients were obliged to keep it for some time to dissolve in the mouth, that they might swallow it leisurely. This remedy was used to take off the acrimony of those humours which sometimes fall upon this part, and provoke coughing and other inconveniences. The basis of this last composition was honey. It is worth our observation, that the compound medicines of Hippocrates were but very few, and composed only of four or five ingredients at most; and that he not only understood pharmacy, or the art of compounding medicines, but prepared such as he used himself, or caused his servants prepare them in his house by his directions.\n\nWe have thus given some account of the state of medicine as practised and taught by Hippocrates, who, as we have already observed, has for many ages been justly considered as the father of physic. For when we attend to the state in which he found medicine, and the condition in which he left it, we can hardly believe sufficient admiration on the judgement and accuracy of his observations. After a life spent in unrewarded industry, i.e. is said to have died at Larissa, a city in Thessaly, in the 101st year of his age, 361 years before the birth of Christ.\n\nAfter the days of Hippocrates, medicine in ancient Greece gradually derived improvement from the labour of other physicians of eminence. And we may particularly mention three to whom its future progress seems to have been not a little indebted, viz. Praxagoras, Erasistratus, and Herophilus.\n\nThe first physician of eminence who differed considerably in his practice from Hippocrates was Praxagoras. Celsus Aurelius acquaints us, that he made great use of vomits in his practice, infomuch as to exhibit them in the iliac passion till the excrements were discharged by the mouth. In this distemper he also advised, when all other means failed, to open the belly, cut the intestine, take out the indurated faeces, and then to sew up all again; but this practice has not probably been followed by any subsequent physician.\n\nErasistratus was a physician of great eminence, and flourished in the time of Seleucus, one of the successors of Alexander the Great. According to Galen,\nEndistratus Galen, he entirely banished venesection from medicine; though some affirm that he did not totally discard it, but only used it less frequently than other physicians. His reasons for disapproving of venesection are as follows: It is difficult to succeed in venesection, because we cannot always see the vein we intend to open, and because we are not sure but we may open an artery instead of a vein. We cannot ascertain the true quantity to be taken. If we take too little, the intention is by no means answered; if we take too much, we run a risk of destroying the patient. The evacuation of the venous blood also is succeeded by that of the spirits, which on that occasion he supposes to pass from the arteries into the veins. It must likewise, he contends, be observed, that as the inflammation is formed in the arteries by the blood coagulated in their orifices, venesection must of course be useless and of no effect.\n\nAs Endistratus did not approve of venesection, so neither did he of purgatives, excepting very rarely, but exhibited clysters and vomits; as did also his master Chrylippus. He was of opinion, however, that the clysters should be mild; and condemned the large quantity and acid quality of those used by preceding practitioners. The reason why purgatives were not much used by him was, that he imagined purging and venesection could answer no other purpose than diminishing the fulness of the vessels; and for this purpose he asserted that there were more effectual means than either phlebotomy or purging. He asserted that the humours discharged by cathartics were not the same in the body that they appeared after the discharge; but that the medicines changed their nature, and produced a kind of corruption in them. This opinion has since been embraced by a great number of physicians. He did not believe that purgatives acted by attraction; but substituted in the place of this principle what Mr Le Clerc imagines to be the same with Aristotle's *fuga vacui*. The principal remedy substituted by him in place of purging and venesection was abstinence. When this, in conjunction with clysters and vomits, was not sufficient to eradicate the disease, he then had recourse to exercise. All this was done with a view to diminish plenitude, which, according to him, was the most frequent cause of all diseases. Galen also informs us, that Endistratus had so great an opinion of the virtues of succory in diseases of the visceræ and lower belly, and especially in those of the liver, that he took particular pains to describe the method of boiling it, which was, to boil it in water till it was tender; then to put it into boiling water a second time, in order to destroy its bitterness; afterwards to take it out of the water, and preserve it in a vessel with oil; and lastly, when it is to be used, add a little weak vinegar to it. Nay, to minute and circumstantial was Endistratus with regard to the preparation of his favourite succory, that he gave orders to tie several of the plants together, because that was the more commodious method of boiling them. The rest of Endistratus's practice consisted almost entirely of regimen; to which he added some topical remedies, such as cataplasms, fomentations, and unctions. In short, as he could neither endure compound medicines, nor fine-flavoured and fine-spun reasonings, he reduced medicine to a very simple and compendious art.\n\nWith regard to surgery, Endistratus appears to have been very bold; and as an anatomist he is said to have been exceedingly cruel, inasmuch that he is represented by some as having dissected criminals while yet alive. In a scirrous liver, or in tumors of that organ, Cælius Aurelianus observes, that Endistratus made an incision through the skin and integuments, and having opened the abdomen he applied medicines immediately to the part affected. But though he was thus bold in performing operations on the liver, yet he did not approve of the paracentesis or tapping in the dropsy; because (said he) the waters being evacuated, the liver, which is inflamed and become hard like a stone, is more pressed by the adjacent parts which the waters kept at a distance from it, so that by this means the patient dies. He declared also against drawing teeth which were not loose; and used to tell those who talked with him on this operation, That in the temple of Apollo there was to be seen an instrument of lead for drawing teeth; in order to instruct that we must not attempt the extirpation of any but such as are loose, and call for no greater force for their extirpation than what may be supposed in an instrument of lead.\n\nHerophilus, the disciple of Praxagoras, and contemporary of Endistratus, followed a less simple practice: he made so great use of medicines both simple and compound, that neither he nor his disciples would undertake the cure of any disorder without them. He seems also to have been the first who treated accurately of the doctrine of pulses, of which Hippocrates had but a superficial knowledge. Galen, however, affirms, that on this subject he involved himself in difficulties and advanced absurdities; which indeed we are not greatly to wonder at, considering the time in which he lived. He took notice of a disease at that time pretty rare, and to which he ascribes certain sudden deaths. He calls it a *palpy of the heart*; and perhaps it may be the same disease with what is now termed the *angina pectoris*.\n\nAccording to Celsus, it was about this time that medicine was first divided into three branches, viz. the dietetic, the pharmaceutical, and the surgical medicine. The first of these employed a proper regimen in the cure of diseases; the second, medicines; and the third, the operation of the hands. The same author informs us, that these three branches became now the business of as many distinct classes of men; so that from this time we may date the origin of the three professions of physicians, apothecaries, and surgeons.—Before this division, those called physicians discharged all the several offices belonging to the three professions; and there were only two kinds of them, viz. one called *ἀκτιστήριον*, who only gave their advice to the patients, and directions to those of an inferior class, who were called *δημιουργοί*, and worked with their hands either in the performing operations, or in the composition and application of remedies.\n\nThe first grand revolution which happened in the medicinal art after the days of Herophilus and Endistratus was occasioned by the founding of the empiric sect by Serapion of Alexandria about 287 years before Christ. The division into dogmatists and empirics had indeed subsisted before; but about this time the latter party began to grow strong, and to have cham-\npions publicly afflicting its cause. Galen informs us, that Scapton used Hippocrates very ill in his writings, in which he discovered an excess of pride, self-sufficiency, and contempt for all the physicians that went before him. We have some sketches of his practice in Cælius Aurelianus, from which we may infer that he retained the medicines of Hippocrates and the other physicians who went before him, though he rejected their reasoning. We know not what arguments he advanced for the support of his sentiments, since his works are lost, as well as those of the other empirics; and we should know nothing at all of any of them, if their adversaries had not quoted them in order to confute them.\n\nThe empirics admitted only one general method of obtaining skill in the medical art, which was by experience, called by the Greeks ἐμπειρία. From this word they took their name, and refused to be called after the founder or any champion of their sect. They defined experience a knowledge derived from the evidence of sense. It was either fortuitous, or acquired by design. For acquiring practical skill they recommended what they called ἐμπειρίας, or one's own observation, and the reading of histories or cases faithfully related by others. Hence they thought that we might be enabled to know a disease by its resemblance to others; and, when new diseases occurred, to conclude what was proper to be done from the symptoms they had in common with others that were before known. They asserted, that observation ought principally to be employed in two different ways; first in discovering what things are salutary, and what are of an indifferent nature; and, secondly, what particular disease is produced by a certain concurrence of symptoms; for they did not call every symptom a disease, but only such a combination of them as from long experience they found to accompany each other, and produced such disorders as began and terminated in the same manner.\n\nOn the other hand, the dogmatists affirmed, that there was a necessity for knowing the latent as well as the evident causes of diseases, and that the physician ought to understand the natural actions and functions of the human body, which necessarily presupposes a knowledge of the internal parts. By secret or latent causes they meant such as related to the elements or principles of which our bodies are composed, and which are the origin of a good or bad state of health. They asserted that it was impossible to know how to cure a disease without knowing the cause whence it proceeded; because undoubtedly it behoved diseases to vary prodigiously in themselves according to the different causes by which they were produced.\n\nThe next remarkable person in the history of physic is Asclepiades, who flourished in the century immediately preceding the birth of Christ. He introduced the philosophy of Democritus and Epicurus into medicine, and ridiculed the doctrines of Hippocrates. He asserted, that matter considered in itself was of an unchangeable nature; and that all perceptible bodies were composed of a number of smaller ones, between which there were interposed an infinity of small spaces totally void of all matter. He thought that the soul itself was composed of these small bodies. He laughed at the principle called Nature by Hippocrates, and also at the imaginary faculties said by him to be subservient to her; and still more at what he called Attraction. This last principle Asclepiades denied in every instance, even in that of the loadstone and steel, imagining that this phenomenon proceeded from a concourse of corpuscles, and a particular disposition or modification of their pores. He also maintained, that nothing happened or was produced without some cause; and that what was called nature was in reality no more than matter and motion. From this last principle he inferred that Hippocrates knew not what he said when he spoke of Nature as an intelligent being, and ascribed qualities of different kinds to her. For the same reason he ridiculed the doctrine of Hippocrates with regard to crises; and asserted that the termination of diseases might be as well accounted for from mere matter and motion. He maintained, that we were deceived if we imagined that nature always did good; since it was evident that she often did a great deal of harm. As for the days particularly fixed upon by Hippocrates for crises, or those on which we usually observe a change either for the better or the worse, Asclepiades denied that such alterations happened on those days rather than on others. Nay, he asserted that the crises did not happen at any time of its own accord, or by the particular determination of nature for the cure of the disorder, but that it depended rather on the address and dexterity of the physician; that we ought never to wait till a difference terminates of its own accord, but that the physician by his care and medicines must hasten on and advance the cure.—According to him, Hippocrates and other ancient physicians attended their patients rather with a view to observe in what manner they died than in order to cure them; and this under pretence that Nature ought to do all herself, without any assistance.\n\nAccording to Asclepiades, the particular assemblage of the various corpuscles above mentioned, and represented as of different figures, is the reason why there are several pores or interfaces within the common mass, formed by these corpuscles; and why these pores are of a different size. This being taken for granted, as these pores are in all the bodies we observe, it must of course follow that the human body has some peculiar to itself, which, as well as those of all other bodies, contain certain minute bodies, which pass and repass by these pores that communicate with each other; and as these pores or interfaces are larger or smaller, so the corpuscles which pass through them differ proportionally as to largeness and minuteness. The blood consists of the largest of these corpuscles, and the spirits, or the heat, of the smallest.\n\nFrom these principles he infers, that as long as the corpuscles are freely received by the pores, the body remains in its natural state; and on the contrary, it begins to recede from that state, when the corpuscles find any obstacle to their passage. Health therefore depends on the just proportion between the pores and the corpuscles they are destined to receive and transmit; as diseases, on the contrary, proceed from a disproportion between these pores and the corpuscles. The most usual obstacle on this occasion proceeds from the corpuscles embracing each other, and being retained in some of their ordinary passages, whether these corpuscles\ncles arrive in too large a number, are of irregular figures, move too fast or too slow, &c.\n\nAmong the diseases produced by the corpules slopping of their own accord, Aesculapiades reckoned phrenies, lethargies, pleurifies, and burning fevers. Pains, in particular, are clasped among the accidents which derive their origin from a stagnation of the largest of all the corpules of which the blood consists. Among the disorders produced by the bad state and disposition of the pores, he placed deliquiums, languors, extenuations, leanness, and droppings. These last disorders he thought proceeded from the pores being too much relaxed and opened; the droppings in particular, he thinks, proceeds from the flesh being perforated with various small holes, which convey the nourishment received into them into water. Hunger, and especially that species of it called *fames canina*, proceeds from an opening of the large pores of the stomach and belly; and thirst from an opening of their small ones. Upon the same principles he accounted for intermittent fevers. According to him, quotidian fevers are caused by a retention of the largest corpules, those of the tertian kind by a retention of corpules somewhat smaller, and quartan fevers are produced by a retention of the smallest corpules of all.\n\nThe practice of Aesculapiades was suited to remove these imaginary causes of disorders. He composed a book concerning common remedies, which he principally reduced to three, viz. gestation, friction, and the use of wine. By various exercises he proposed to render the pores more open, and to make the juices and small bodies, which cause diseases by their retention, pass more freely; and while the former physicians had not recourse to gestation till towards the end of long-continued disorders, and when the patients, though entirely free from fever, were yet too weak to take sufficient exercise by walking, Aesculapiades used gestation from the very beginning of the most burning fevers. He laid it down as a maxim, that one fever was to be cured by another; that the strength of the patient was to be exhausted by making him watch and endure thirst to such a degree, that, for the two first days of the disorder, he would not allow them to cool their mouths with a drop of water. Celsus also observes, that though Aesculapiades treated his patients like a butcher during the first days of the disorder, he indulged them so far afterwards as even to give directions for making their beds in the softest manner. On several occasions Aesculapiades used frictions to open the pores. The droppings was one of the distempers in which this remedy was used; but the most singular attempt was, by this means, to lull frenetic patients asleep. But though he enjoined exercise so much to the sick, he denied it to those in health; a conduct not a little surprising and extraordinary. He allowed wine freely to patients in fevers, provided the violence of the distemper was somewhat abated. Nor did he forbid it to those who were afflicted with a phreny; nay, he ordered them to drink it till they were intoxicated, pretending by that means to make them sleep; because, he said, wine had a narcotic quality and procured sleep, which he thought absolutely necessary for those who laboured under that disorder. To lethargic patients he used it on purpose to excite them, and rouse their senses: he also made them smell strong-scented substances, such as vinegar, saffron, and rue, in order to make them freeze; and applied to their heads cataplasms of mustard made up with vinegar.\n\nBesides these remedies, Aesculapiades enjoined his patients abstinence to an extreme degree. For the first three days, according to Celsus, he allowed them no aliment whatever; but on the fourth began to give them victuals. According to Cælius Aurelianus, however, he began to nourish his patients as soon as the acuteness of the disease was diminished, not waiting till an entire remission; giving to some aliments on the first, to some on the second, to some on the third, and so on to the seventh day. It seems almost incredible to us, that people should be able to fast till this last mentioned term; but Celsus affirms us, that abstinence till the seventh day was enjoined even by the predecessors of Aesculapiades.\n\nThe next great revolution which happened in the medicinal art, was brought about by Themison, the disciple of Aesculapiades, who lived not long before the time of Celsus, during the end of the reign of Augustus, or beginning of that of Tiberius. The sect founded by him was called *methodic*, because he endeavoured to find a method of rendering medicine more easy than it formerly.\n\nHe maintained, that a knowledge of the causes of diseases was not necessary, provided we have a due regard to what diseases have in common and analogous to one another. In consequence of this principle, he divided all diseases into two, or at most three, kinds. The first included diseases arising from stricture; the second, those arising from relaxation; and the third, those of a mixed nature, or such as partook both of stricture and relaxation.\n\nThemison also affirmed, that diseases are sometimes acute, and sometimes chronic; that for a certain time they increase; that at a certain time they are at their height; and that at last they were observed to diminish. Acute diseases, therefore, according to him, must be treated in one way, and chronic diseases in another; one method must be followed with such as are in their augmentation, another with such as are at their height, and a third with such as are in their declension. He affirmed, that the whole of medicine consisted in the observation of that small number of rules which are founded upon things altogether evident. He said, that all disorders, whatever their nature was, if included under any of the kinds above mentioned, ought to be treated precisely in the same way, in whatever country and with whatever symptoms they happen to arise. Upon these principles, he defined medicine to be a method of conducting to the knowledge of what diseases have in common with each other.\n\nThemison was old when he laid the foundation of the methodic sect; and it was only brought to perfection by Thebalus, who lived under the emperor Nero. Thebalus, Galen and Pliny accuse this physician of intolerable insolence and vanity, and report that he gave himself the air of despising all other physicians; and so intolerable was his vanity, that he assumed the title of the conqueror of physicians, which he caused to be put upon his tomb in the Appian way. Never was mountebank (says Pliny) attended by a greater number of spectators.\nThessalus, spectators than Thessalus had generally about him; and this circumstance is the least to be wondered at, if we consider that he promised to teach the whole art of medicine in less than six months. In reality, the art might be learned much sooner if it comprehended no more than what the methodics thought necessary: for they cut off the examination of the causes of diseases followed by the dogmatics; and substituted in the room of the laborious observations of the empirics, indications drawn from the analogy of diseases, and the mutual resemblance they bear to each other. The most skilful of all the methodic sects, and he who put the last hand to it, was Soranus. He lived under the emperors Trajan and Adrian, and was a native of Ephesus.\n\nOne of the most celebrated medical writers of antiquity was Celsus, whom we have already had occasion to mention. Most writers agree that he lived in the time of Tiberius, but his country is uncertain. It is even disputed whether or not he was a professed physician. Certain it is, however, that his books on medicine are the most valuable of all the ancients next to those of Hippocrates. From the latter, indeed, he has taken so much, as to acquire the name of the Latin Hippocrates; but he has not attached himself to him so closely as to reject the assistance of other authors. In many particulars he has preferred Asclepiades. With him he laughs at the critical days of Hippocrates, and ascribes the invention of them to a foolish and superstitious attachment to the Pythagorean doctrine of numbers. He also rejected the doctrine of Hippocrates with regard to venefication, of which he made a much more general use; but did not take away so much blood at a time, thinking it much better to repeat the operation than weaken the patient by too great an evacuation at once. He used cupping also much more frequently, and differed from him with regard to purgatives. In the beginning of disorders, he said, the patients ought to endure hunger and thirst; but afterwards they were to be nourished with good aliments; of which, however, they were not to take too much, nor fill themselves suddenly, after having fasted long. He does not specify how long the patient ought to practise abstinence; but affirms, that in this particular it is necessary to have regard to the disease, the patient, the season, the climate, and other circumstances of a like nature. The signs drawn from the pulse he looked upon to be very precarious and uncertain. \"Some (says he) lay great stress upon the beating of the veins or the arteries; which is a deceitful circumstance, since that beating is slow or quick, and varies very much, according to the age, sex, and constitution of the patient. It even sometimes happens that the pulse is weak and languid when the stomach is disordered, or in the beginning of a fever. On the contrary, the pulse is often high, and in a violent commotion, when one has been exposed to the sun, or comes out of a bath, or from using exercise; or when one is under the influence of anger, fear, or any other passion. Besides, the pulse is easily changed by the arrival of the physician, in consequence of the patient's anxiety to know what judgement he will pass upon his case. To prevent this, the physician must not feel the patient's pulse on his first arrival: he must first sit down by him, assume a cheerful air, inform himself of his condition; and if he is under any dread, endeavour to remove it by encouraging discourse; after which he may examine the beating of the artery. This nevertheless does not hinder us from concluding, that if the sight of the physician alone can produce so remarkable a change in the pulse, a thousand other causes may produce the same effect.\" But although Celsus thought for himself, and in not a few particulars differed from his predecessors, yet in his writings, which are not only still preserved, but have gone through almost innumerable editions, we have a copious view of the practice of almost all his predecessors; and he treats of the healing art in all its branches, whether performed manu, visu, vel medicamentis. His writings, therefore, will naturally be consulted by every one who wishes either to become acquainted with the practice of the ancients prior to the fall of the Roman empire, or to read medical Latin in its greatest purity.\n\nAbout the 13th year after Christ, in the reign of Galen, the emperor Adrian, lived the celebrated Galen, a native of Pergamus, whose name makes such a conspicuous figure in the history of physic. At this time the dogmatic, empiric, methodic, and other sects, had each their abettors. The methodics were held in great esteem, and looked upon to be superior to the dogmatics, who were strangely divided among themselves, some of them following Hippocrates, others Eratitus, and others Asclepiades. The empirics made the least considerable figure of any. Galen undertook the reformation of medicine, and restored dogmatism. He seems to have been of that sect which was called eclectic, from their choosing out of different authors what they esteemed good in them, without being particularly attached to any one more than the rest. This declaration he indeed sets out with; but notwithstanding this, he follows Hippocrates much more than any other, or rather follows nobody else but him. Though before his time several physicians had commented on the works of Hippocrates, yet Galen pretends that none of them had understood his meaning. His first attempt therefore was to explain the works of Hippocrates; with which view he wrote a great deal, and after this set about composing a system of his own. In one of his books entitled, \"Of the establishment of medicine,\" he defines the art to be one which teaches to preserve health and cure diseases. In another book, however, he proposes the following definition: \"Medicine (says he) is a science which teaches what is found, and what is not so; and what is of an indifferent nature, or holds a medium between what is found and what is the reverse.\" He affirmed, that there are three things which constitute the object of medicine, and which the physician ought to consider as found, as not found, or of a neutral and indifferent nature. These are the body itself, the signs, and the causes. He esteems the human body found, when it is in a good state or habit with regard to the simple parts of which it is composed, and when besides there is a just proportion between the organs formed of these simple parts. On the contrary, the body is reckoned to be unfound, when it recedes from this state, and the just proportion above mentioned. It is in a state of neutrality or indifference, when it is in a medium between soundness and its opposite state. The salutary signs.\nGalen. signs are such as indicate present health, and prognosticate that the man may remain in that state for some time to come. The insalubrious signs, on the contrary, indicate a present disorder, or lay a foundation for fulfilling the approach of one. The neutral signs, or such as are of an indifferent nature, denote neither health nor indisposition, either for the present, or for the time to come. In like manner he speaks of causes salutary, unsalutary, and indifferent.\n\nThese three dispositions of the human body, that is, soundness, its reverse, and a neutral state, comprehend all the differences between health and disorder or indisposition; and each of these three states or dispositions has a certain extent peculiar to itself. A sound habit of body, according to the definition of it already given, is very rare, and perhaps never to be met with; but this does not hinder us to suppose such a model for regulating our judgment with respect to different constitutions. On this principle Galen establishes eight other principal constitutions, all of which differ more or less from the perfect model above mentioned. The four first are such as have one of the four qualities of hot, cold, moist, or dry, prevailing in too great a degree; and accordingly receive their denomination from that quality which prevails over the rest. The four other species of constitutions receive their denominations from a combination of the above mentioned; so that, according to his definition, there may be a hot and dry, a hot and moist, a cold and moist, and a cold and dry, constitution. Besides these differences, there are certain others which result from occult and latent causes, and which, by Galen, are said to arise from an idiosyncrasy of constitution. It is owing to this idiosyncrasy that some have an aversion to one kind of aliment and some to another; that some cannot endure particular smells, &c. But though these eight last-mentioned constitutions fall short of the perfection of the first, it does not thence follow, that those to whom they belong are to be classed among the valetudinary and diseased. A disease only begins when the deviation becomes so great as to hinder the due action of some parts.\n\nGalen describes at great length the signs of a good or bad constitution, as well as those of what he calls a neutral habit. These signs are drawn from the original qualities of cold, hot, moist, and dry, and from their just proportion or disproportion with respect to the bulk, figure, and situation, of the organical parts. With Hippocrates he establishes three principles of an animal body; the parts, the humours, and the spirits. By the parts he properly meant no more than the solid parts; and these he divided into similar and organical. Like Hippocrates, he also acknowledged four humours; the blood, the phlegm, the yellow bile and black bile. He established three different kinds of spirits; the natural, the vital, and the animal. The first of these are, according to him, nothing else but a subtle vapour arising from the blood, which draws its origin from the liver, the organ or instrument of sanctification. After these spirits are conveyed to the heart, they, in conjunction with the air we draw into the lungs, become the matter of the second species, that is, of the vital spirits, which are again changed into those of the animal kind in the brain. He supposed that these three species of spirits served as instruments to three kinds of faculties, which reside in the respective parts where these faculties are formed. The natural faculty is the first of these, which he placed in the liver, and imagined to preside over the nutrition, growth, and generation, of the animal. The vital faculty he lodged in the heart, and supposed that by means of the arteries it communicated warmth and life to all the body. The animal faculty, the noblest of all the three, and with which the reasoning or governing faculty was joined, according to him, has its seat in the brain; and, by means of the nerves, distributes a power of motion and sensation to all the parts, and presides over all the other faculties. The original source or principle of motion in all these faculties, Galen, as well as Hippocrates, defines to be Nature.\n\nUpon these principles Galen defined a disease to be \"such a preternatural disposition or affection of the parts of the body, as primarily, and of itself, hinders their natural and proper action.\" He established three principal kinds of diseases: the first relates to the similar parts; the second, to the organical; and the third is common to both these parts. The first kind of disease consists in the intemperature of the similar parts; and this is divided into an intemperature without matter, and an intemperature with matter. The first discovers itself when a part has more or less heat or cold than it ought to have without that change of quality in the part being supported and maintained by any matter. Thus, for instance, a person's head may be overheated and indisposed by being exposed to the heat of the sun, without that heat being maintained by the continuance or congestion of any hot humour in the part. The second sort of intemperature is when any part is not only rendered hot or cold, but also filled with a hot or cold humour, which are the causes of the heat or cold felt in the part. Galen also acknowledged a simple intemperature: that is, when one of the original qualities, such as heat or cold, exceeds the natural standard alone and separately; and a compound intemperature, when two qualities are joined together, such as heat and dryness, or coldness and humidity. He also established an equal and unequal temperature. The former is that which is equally in all the body, or in any particular part of it, and which creates no pain, because it is become habitual, such as dryness in the hectic constitution. The latter is distinguished from the former, in that it does not equally subsist in the whole of the body, or in the whole of a part. Of this kind of intemperature we have examples in certain fevers, where heat and cold, equally, and almost at the same time, attack the same part; or in other fevers, which render the surface of the body cold as ice, while the internal parts burn with heat; or lastly, in cases where the stomach is cold and the liver hot.\n\nThe second kind of disorders, relating to the organical parts, results from irregularities of these parts, with respect to the number, bulk, figure, situation, &c.; as when one has six fingers, or only four; when one has any part larger or smaller than it ought to be, &c. The third kind, which is common both to the similar and the organical parts, is a solution of continuity, which happens when any similar or compound part is cut, bruised, or corroded.\nLike Hippocrates, Galen distinguished diseases into acute and chronic; and, with respect to their nature and genius, into benign and malignant; also into epidemic, endemic, and sporadic.\n\nAfter having distinguished the kinds of diseases, Galen comes to explain their causes; which he divides into external and internal. The external causes of diseases, according to him, are six things, which contribute to the preservation of health when they are well disposed and properly used, but produce a contrary effect when they are imprudently used or ill disposed. These six things are, the air, aliments and drink, motion and rest, sleeping and watching, retention and excretion, and lastly the passions. All these are called the proemiarctic or beginning causes, because they put in motion the internal causes; which are of two kinds, the antecedent and the conjunct. The former is discovered only by reasoning; and consists for the most part in a peccancy of the humours, either by plenitude or cacochymy, i.e. a bad state of them. When the humours are in too large a quantity, it is called a plethora; but we must observe, that this word equally denotes too large a quantity of all the humours together, or a redundancy of one particular humour which prevails over the rest. According to these principles, there may be a languine, a bilious, a pituitous, or a melancholy plenitude: but there is this difference between the languine and the three other plenitudes, that the blood, which is the matter of the former, may far surpass the rest: whereas, if any of the three last mentioned ones do so, the case is no longer called plenitude, but cacochymia; because these humours, abounding more than they ought, corrupt the blood. The causes he also divides into such as are manifest and evident, and such as are latent and obscure. The first are such as spontaneously come under the cognizance of our senses when they act or produce their effects: the second are not of themselves perceptible, but may be discovered by reasoning: the third fort, i.e. such as he calls occult or concealed, cannot be discovered at all. Among this last he places the cause of the hydrophobia.\n\nHe next proceeds to consider the symptoms of diseases. A symptom he defines to be \"a supernatural affection depending upon a disease, or which follows it as a shadow does a body.\" He acknowledged three kinds of symptoms: the first and most considerable of these consisted in the action of the parts being injured or hindered; the second in a change of the quality of the parts, their actions in the mean time remaining entire: the third related to defects in point of excretion and retention.\n\nAfter having treated of symptoms, Galen treats of the signs of diseases. These are divided into diagnostic and prognostic. The first are so called because they enable us to know diseases, and distinguish them from each other. They are of two sorts, pathognomonic or adjunct. The first are peculiar to every disease, make known its precise species, and always accompany it, so that they begin and end with it. The second are common to several diseases, and only serve to point out the difference between diseases of the same species. In a pleurisy, for instance, the pathognomonic signs are a cough, a difficulty of breathing, a pain of the side, and a continued fever; the adjunct signs are the various sorts of matter expectorated, Oribasius, which is sometimes bloody, sometimes bilious, &c., &c.\n\nThe diagnostic signs were drawn from the defective or disordered disposition of the parts, or from the diseases themselves; secondly, from the causes of diseases; thirdly, from their symptoms; and lastly, from the particular dispositions of each body, from things which prove prejudicial and those that do service, and from epidemical diseases.—The prognostic signs he gathered from the species, virulence, and peculiar genius of the disease: but as we have already spoken so largely concerning the prognostics of Hippocrates, it is superfluous to be particular on those of Galen.—His method of cure differed little from that of Hippocrates: but from the specimen already given of Galen's method of teaching the medical art, it is evident that his system was little else than a collection of speculations, definitions, and reasonings; whereas that of Hippocrates was founded immediately upon facts, which he had either observed himself, or had learned from the observation of others.\n\nThe system of Galen, however, notwithstanding its defects and absurdities, remained almost uncontradicted for a very long period. Indeed it may be considered as having been the prevailing system till the inundation of the Goths and Vandals put an almost entire stop to the cultivation of letters in Europe. But during the general prevalence of the system of Galen, there appeared some writers to whom medicine was indebted for improvements, at least in certain particulars. Among the most distinguished of these we may mention Oribasius, Ætius, Alexander, and Paulus.\n\nOribasius flourished about the year 360, and was physician to the emperor Julian. He speaks very fully of the effects of bleeding by way of laceration, a thing little taken notice of by former writers; from his own experience he affirms us that he had found it successful in a supprestion of the meninges, defluxions of the eyes, headache, and straitness of breathing even when the person was extremely old. He tells his own case particularly, when the plague raged in Asia and he himself was taken ill. On the second day he scarified his leg, and took away two pounds of blood; by which means he entirely recovered, as did several others who used it. In this author also we find the first description of a surprising and terrible distemper, which he termed ἀναπληγμα, a species of melancholy and madness, which he describes thus. \"The persons affected get out of their houses in the night-time, and in every thing imitate wolves, and wander among the sepulchres of the dead till day-break. You may know them by these symptoms: Their looks are pale; their eyes heavy, hollow, dry, without the least moisture of a tear; their tongue exceedingly parched and dry, no spittle in their mouth, extreme thirst; their legs, from the falls and the bruises they receive, full of incurable sores and ulcers.\"\n\nÆtius lived very near the end of the fifth, or in the beginning of the sixth century. Many passages in his writings serve to show us how much the actual and potential cautery were used by the physicians of that age. In a paltry, he says, that he should not at all hesitate to make an elchar either way, and this in several places; one in the nape, where the spinal marrow takes its rise, two on each side of it; three or four\nAlexander four on the top of the head, one just in the middle, and three others round it. He adds, that in this case, if the ulcers continue running a considerable time, he should not doubt of a perfect recovery. He is still more particular when he comes to order this application for an inveterate asthma, after all other remedies have been tried in vain. Once, he says, should be made on each side near the middle of the joining of the clavicle, taking care not to touch the windpipe; two other little ones are then to be made near the carotids under the chin, one on each side, so that the cautif may penetrate no further than the skin; two others under the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs; and again, two more backwards towards the fifth and sixth ribs. Besides these there ought to be one in the middle of the thorax, near the beginning of the xiphoid cartilage, over the orifice of the stomach; one on each side between the eighth and ninth ribs; and three others in the back, one in the middle, and the two others just below it, on each side of the vertebrae. Those below the neck ought to be pretty large, not very superficial, not very deep; and all these ulcers should be kept open for a very long time.\n\nAetius takes notice of the worms bred in different parts of the body called dracunculi, which were unknown to Galen. He seems also to be the first Greek writer among the Christians, who gives us any specimen of medicinal spells and charms; such as that of a finger of St Blaius for removing a bone which sticks in the throat, and another in relation to a fistula. He gives a remedy for the gout, which he calls the grand drier; the patient is to use it for a whole year, and observe the following diet each month. \"In September, he must eat and drink milk; In October, he must eat garlic; in November, abstain from bathing; in December, he must eat no cabbage; in January, he is to take a glass of pure wine in the morning; in February, to eat no beets; in March, to mix sweet things both in eatables and drinkables; in April, not to eat horse-radish, nor in May the fish called polypus; in June, he is to drink cold water in a morning; in July, to avoid venery; and lastly, in August, to eat no mallows.\" This may sufficiently show the quackery of those times, and how superstition was beginning to mix itself with the art.\n\nAlexander, who flourished in the reign of Justinian, is a more original author than either of the two former. He confines himself directly to the describing the signs of diseases, and the methods of cure, without meddling with anatomy, the materia medica, or surgery, as all the rest did. He employs a whole book in treating of the gout. One method he takes of relieving this disease is by purging; and in most of the purges he recommends hermodactyls, of which he has a great opinion. In a caustic, or burning fever, where the bile is predominant, the matter fit for evacuation, and the fever not violent, he prefers purging to bleeding, and says that he has often ordered purging in acute fevers with surpising succels. In the caustic also, if a syncope happens from crude and redundant humours, he recommends bleeding. In a syncope succeeding the suppression of any usual evacuation, he recommends bleeding, with frictions. The diagnostics upon which he finds this practice are the following: viz. a face paler and more swelled than usual, a bloated habit of body, with a small sluggish pulse; having long intervals between the strokes. In tertian, and much more in quartan fevers, he recommends vomits above all other remedies, and affirms that by this remedy alone he has cured the most inveterate quartans. On the bulimus, or canine appetite, he makes a new observation, viz. that it is sometimes caused by worms. He mentions the case of a woman who laboured under this ravenous appetite, and had a perpetual gnawing at her stomach and pain in her head: after taking hiera, she voided a worm above a dozen of cubits long, and was entirely cured of her complaints.—He is also the first author who takes notice of rhubarb; which he recommends in a weakness of the liver and in dysentry.—Alexander is recommended by Dr Freind as one of the best practical writers among the ancients, and well worthy the perusal of any modern.\n\nPaulus was born in the island Ægina, and lived in the 7th century. He transcribes a great deal from Alexander and other physicians. His descriptions are short and accurate. He treats particularly of women's disorders; and seems to be the first instance upon record of a professed man-midwife, for so he was called by the Arabians; and accordingly he begins his book with the disorders incident to pregnant women. He treats also very fully of surgery; and gives some directions, according to Dr Freind, not to be found in the more ancient writers.\n\nAfter the downfall of the Roman empire, and when the inundation of Goths and Vandals had almost completely exterminated literature of every kind in Europe, medicine, though a practical art, shared the same fate with more abstract sciences. Learning in general, banished from the seat of arms, took refuge among the eastern nations, where the arts of peace still continued to be cultivated. To the Arabian physicians, as they have been called, we are indebted both for the preservation of medical science, as it subsisted among the Greeks and Romans, and likewise for the description of some new diseases, particularly the smallpox. Among the most eminent of the Arabians, we may mention Rhazes, Avicenna, Albucaïs, and Aven. But of their writings it would be tedious, and is unnecessary, to give any particular account.—They were for the most part, indeed, only copiers of the Greeks. We are, however, indebted to them for some improvements. They were the first who introduced chemical remedies, though of these they used but few, nor did they make any considerable progress in the chemical art. Anatomy was not in the least improved by them, nor did surgery receive any advancement till the time of Albucaïs, who lived probably in the 12th century. They added a great deal to botany and the materia medica, by the introduction of new drugs, of the aromatic kind especially, from the east, many of which are of considerable use. They also found out the way of making sugar; and by help of that, syrups; which two new materials are of great use in mixing up compound medicines.\n\nWith regard to their practice, in some few particulars they deviated from the Greeks. Their purging medicines were much milder than those formerly in use; and even when they did prescribe the old ones, they gave them in a much less dose than the Greek and Roman physicians. The same reflection may be made concerning...\nconcerning their manner of bleeding, which was never to that excessive degree practised by the Greeks. They deviated from Hippocrates, however, in one very trivial circumstance, which produced a violent controversy. The question was, Whether blood in a pleurisy ought to be drawn from the arm of the affected side or the opposite? Hippocrates had directed it to be drawn from the arm of the affected side; but the Arabians, following some other ancient physicians, ordered it to be drawn from the opposite one. Such was the ignorance of those ages, that the university of Salamanca in Spain made a decree, that no one should dare to let blood but in the contrary arm; and endeavoured to procure an edict from the emperor Charles V. to second it; alleging that the other method was of no less pernicious consequence to medicine, than Luther's heresy had been to religion.\n\nIn consequence of the general decay of learning in the western parts of the world, the Greek writers were entirely neglected, because nobody could read the language; and the Arabians, though principally copiers from them, enjoyed all the reputation that was due to the others. The Arabian physic was introduced into Europe very early, with the most extravagant applause; and not only this, but other branches of their learning, came into repute in the west; insomuch that in the 11th century, the studies of natural philosophy and the liberal arts were called the studies of the Saracens. This was owing partly to the crusades undertaken against them by the European princes; and partly to the settlement of Moors in Spain, and the intercourse they and other Arabians had with the Italians. For, long before the time of the crusades, probably in the middle of the 7th century, there were Hebrew, Arabic, and Latin professors of physic settled at Salernum: which place soon grew into such credit, that Charles the Great thought proper to found a college there in the year 802; the only one at that time in Europe. Constantine the African flourished there towards the latter end of the 11th century. He was a native of Carthage; but travelled into the east, and spent 30 years in Babylon and Bagdad, by which means he became master of the oriental languages and learning. He returned to Carthage; but being informed of an attempt against his life, made his escape into Apulia, where he was recommended to Robert Guiscard, created in 1060 duke of that country, who made him his secretary. He was reputed to be very well versed in the Greek, as well as in the eastern tongues; and seems to have been the first who introduced either the Greek or Arabian physic into Italy. His works, however, contain nothing that is new, or material; though he was then accounted a very learned man.\n\nFrom this time to the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th century, the history of physic furnishes us with no interesting particulars. This period, however, is famous for the introduction of chemistry into medicine, and the description of three new distempers, the sweating sicknesses, the venereal disease, and the scurvy. The sweating sicknesses began in 1485 in the army of Henry VII. upon his landing at Milford-haven, and spread itself at London from the 21st of September to the end of October. It returned there five times, and always in summer; first in 1495, then in 1506, afterwards in 1517, when it was so violent that it killed many in the space of three hours, so that numbers of the nobility died, and of the commonalty in several towns often the one-half perished. It appeared the fourth time in 1528, and then proved mortal in five hours; many of the courtiers died of it, and Henry VIII. himself was in danger. In 1529, and only then, it infected the Netherlands and Germany, in which last country it did much mischief. The last return of it was in 1551, and in Westminster it carried off 120 in a day. Dr Caius describes it as a pestilent contagious fever, of the duration of one natural day; the sweat he reckoned to be only a natural symptom, or crisis of the distemper. It first affected some particular part, attended with inward heat and burning, unquenchable thirst, restlessness, sickness at stomach, but seldom vomiting, headache, delirium, then faintness, and excessive drowsiness. The pulse was quick and vehement, and the breath short and laborious.—Children, poor and old people, were rarely subject to it. Of others, scarce any escaped the attack, and most of them died. Even by travelling into France or Flanders they did not escape; and what is still more strange, the Scots were said not to be affected; abroad the English only were seized; and foreigners in England were free. At first the physicians were much puzzled how to treat this disease. The only cure they ever found, however, was to carry on the sweat for a long time; or, if stopped, it was dangerous or fatal. The way, therefore, was for the patient to lie still, and not expose himself to cold. If nature was not strong enough to force out the sweat, it was necessary to assist her by art, with clothes, wine, &c. The violence of the distemper was over in 15 hours; but there was no security for the patient till 24 were passed. In some strong constitutions there was a necessity to repeat the sweating, even to 12 times. The removing out of bed was attended with great danger; some who had not sweated enough fell into very bad fevers.—No flesh meat was to be allowed in all the time of the distemper; nor drink for the first five hours. In the seventh, the distemper increased; in the ninth the delirium came on, and sleep was by all means to be avoided. However terrible this distemper appeared at first, it seldom proved obstinate, if treated in the above-mentioned manner.\n\nIn the beginning of the 16th century, the famous Paracelsus, chemist Paracelsus introduced a new system into medicine, founded on the principles of chemistry. The Galenical system had prevailed till his time; but the practice had greatly degenerated, and was become quite trifling and frivolous. The physicians in general rejected the use of opium, mercury, and other efficacious remedies. Paracelsus, who made use of these, had therefore greatly the advantage over them; and now all things relating to medicine were explained on imaginary chemical principles. It will easily be conceived that a practice founded in this manner could be no other than the most dangerous quackery. At this time, however, it was necessary; for now a new disease overran the world, and threatened greater destruction than almost all the old ones put together, both by the violence of its symptoms, and its baffling the most powerful remedies at that time known.—This was the venereal disease, which is supposed to have been imported\nHistory.\n\nModerns imported from the West Indies by the companions of Christopher Columbus. Its first remarkable appearance was at the siege of Naples in 1494, from whence it was soon after propagated through Europe, Asia, and Africa. The symptoms with which it made the attack at that time were exceedingly violent, much more so than they are at present; and consequently were utterly unconquerable by the Galenists. The quacks and chemists, who boldly ventured on mercury, though they no doubt destroyed numbers by their execrable use of it, yet thought that a remedy for this terrible distemper was at last found out, and that a proper method of treating it might soon be fallen upon. Shortly after, the West Indian specific, guaiacum, was discovered: the materia medica was enriched with that and many other valuable medicines, both from the East and West Indies: which contributed considerably to the improvement of the practice of physic. At this period, as sea voyages of considerable duration were more frequent, the scurvy became a more common distemper, and was of course more accurately described. But probably, from supposed analogy to the contagious which at that time were new in Europe, very erroneous ideas were entertained with regard to its being of an infectious nature: And it is not impossible, that from its being attended also with ulcers, it was on some occasions confounded with syphilitic complaints.\n\nThe revival of learning, which now took place throughout Europe, the appearance of these new distempers, and the natural fondness of mankind for novelty, contributed greatly to promote the advancement of medicine as well as other sciences. While at the same time, the introduction of the art of printing rendered the communication of new opinions as well as new practices so easy a matter, that to enumerate even the names of those who have been justly rendered eminent for medical knowledge would be a very tedious task. It was not, however, till 1628 that Dr William Harvey of London demonstrated and communicated to the public one of the most important discoveries respecting the animal economy, the circulation of the blood. This discovery, more effectually than any reasoning, overturned all the systems which had subsisted prior to that time. It may justly be reckoned the most important discovery that has hitherto been made in the healing art: for there can be no doubt that it puts the explanation of the phenomena of the animal body, both in a state of health and disease, on a more solid and rational footing than formerly. It has not, however, prevented the rise of numerous fanciful and absurd systems. These, though fashionable for a short time, and strenuously supported by blind adherents, have yet in no long period fallen into deserved contempt. And notwithstanding the abilities and industry of Stahl, Hoffman, Boerhaave, and Cullen, we may confidently venture to assert that no general system has yet been proposed which is not liable to innumerable and unmountable objections. Very great progress has indeed been made in explaining the philosophy of the human body, from ascertaining by decisive experiment the influence of the circulating, the nervous, and the lymphatic systems in the animal economy. But every attempt hitherto made to establish any general theory in medicine, that is to conduct the cure of every disease on a few general principles, has equally deviated from truth with those of Hippocrates and Galen; and has equally tended to mislead those who have adopted it. Many systems of our own days, such for example as that of Brown, though adopted with enthusiasm by the young and inexperienced, have evidently been attended with the most pernicious consequences in practice. Indeed we may with confidence venture to assert, that from the very nature of the subject itself, medicine does not admit of such simplicity. No one can deny that the human body consists of a very great number of different parts, both solids and fluids. It is, however, equally certain, that each of these is from many different causes liable to deviations from the sound state. And although some slight changes may take place without what can be called a morbid affection, yet we well know, that every change taking place to a certain degree in any one part will necessarily and unavoidably produce an affection of the whole. Hence we may without hesitation venture to affirm, that every general theory which can be proposed, attempting to explain the phenomena, and conduct the cure of all diseases on a few general principles, though for some time it may have strenuous advocates, will yet in the end be found to be both ill-grounded and pernicious.\n\nThe art of medicine has been much more usefully improved by careful attention to the history, theory, and practice of particular diseases, and by endeavouring to ascertain from cautious observation the symptoms by which they are to be distinguished, the causes by which they are induced, and the means by which they are to be prevented, alleviated, or cured. On this footing, therefore, we shall endeavour to give a brief account of at least the most important affections to which the human body is subjected, delivering what appear to us to be the best established facts and observations respecting each.\n\nBut before entering on the consideration of particular diseases, or what has commonly been styled the practice of medicine, it is necessary to give a general view of the most important functions of the animal body, and of the chief morbid affections to which they are subjected; a branch which has usually been named the Theory or Institutions of Medicine.\n\nTheory of Medicine, or an Account of the principal Functions of the Animal Body.\n\nWhile the functions of living animals, but particularly of the human species, are very numerous, the accounts given of these both in a state of health and disease are very various. Without, therefore, pretending to enumerate the contradictory opinions of different authors, we shall here present the reader with a view of this subject.\nFunctions subject, chiefly extracted from the Compendium Medicinae of the Body Theoretical of Dr James Gregory, who has collected from other writers the opinions at present most generally adopted.\n\nIn this work, which was first published in 1789, and afterwards reprinted under an enlarged form in 1792, Dr Gregory introduces his subject by observing, vital wing, that some functions of the human body relate to itself only, and others to external things. To the latter class belong those which by physicians are called the animal functions; to which are to be referred all our senses, as well as the power of voluntary motion, by which we become acquainted with the universe, and enjoy this earth. Among the functions which relate to the body, some have been named vital, such as the circulation of the blood and respiration; because, without the constant continuance of these life cannot subsist; others, intended for repelling the waste of the system, have been termed the natural functions: for by the constant attrition of the solids and the evaporation of the fluid parts of the body, we stand in need of nourishment to supply this waste; after which the putrid and excrementitious parts must be thrown out by the proper passages. The digestion of the food, secretion of the humours, and excretion of the putrid parts of the food, are referred to this class; which, though necessary to life, may yet be interrupted for a considerable time without danger. This division of the functions into animal, vital, and natural, is of very ancient date, and is perhaps one of the best that has yet been proposed.\n\nA disease takes place, when the body has so far declined from a sound state, that its functions are either quite impeded, or performed with difficulty. A disease therefore may happen to any part of the body either solid or fluid, or to any one of the functions: and those may occur either singly, or several of them may be diseased at the same time; whence the distinction of diseases into simple and compound.\n\nWe have examples of the most simple kinds of diseases, in the rupture or other injury of any of the corporeal organs, by which means they become less fit for performing their offices; or, though the organs themselves should remain sound, if the solids or fluids have degenerated from a healthy state; or if, having lost their proper qualities, they have acquired others of a different, perhaps of a noxious nature; or lastly, if the moving powers shall become too weak or too strong, or direct their force in a way contrary to what nature requires.\n\nThe most simple diseases are either productive of others, or of symptoms, by which alone they become known to us. Every thing in which a sick person is observed to differ from one in health is called a symptom; and the most remarkable of these symptoms, which most constantly appear, define and constitute the disease.\n\nThe causes of diseases are various; often obscure, and sometimes totally unknown. The most full and perfect proximate cause is that which, when present, produces a disease, when taken away removes it, and when changed, changes it.—There are also remote causes, which physicians have been accustomed to divide into the predisposing and exciting ones. The former are those which only render the body fit for a cause of disease, or which put it into such a state that it will readily receive one. The exciting cause is that which immediately produces the disease in a body already disposed to receive it.\n\nThe predisposing cause is always inherent in the body itself, though perhaps it originally came from cause without; thus heat or cold, a very sparing or a very luxurious diet, and many other particulars, may operate as causes of predisposition, inducing plethora, imanition, or the like. But the exciting cause may either come from within or without.\n\nFrom the combined action of the predisposing and exciting causes comes the proximate cause, which neither of the two taken singly is often able to produce.—A body predisposed to disease therefore has already declined somewhat from a state of perfect health, although none of its functions are impeded in such a manner that we can truly say the person is diseased. Yet sometimes the predisposing cause, by continuing long, may arrive at such a height, that it alone, without the addition of any exciting cause, may produce a real disease.—The exciting cause also, though it should not be able immediately to bring on a disease; yet if it continues long, will by degrees destroy the strongest constitution, and render it liable to various diseases; because it either produces a predisposing cause, or is converted into it, so that the same thing may sometimes be an exciting cause, sometimes a predisposing one, or rather a cause of predisposition; of which the inclemencies of the weather, sloth, luxury, &c. are examples.\n\nDiseases, however, seem to have their origin from the very constitution of the animal machine; and diseases, hence many diseases are common to every body when a proper exciting cause occurs, though some people are much more liable to certain diseases than others. Some are hereditary; for as healthy parents naturally produce healthy children, so diseased parents as naturally produce diseased offspring. Some of these diseases appear in the earliest infancy; others occur equally at all ages; nor are there wanting some which lurk unsuspected even to the latest old age, at last breaking out with the utmost violence. Some diseases are born with us, even though they have no proper foundation in our constitution, as when a fetus receives some hurt by an injury done to the mother; while others, neither born with us nor having any foundation in the constitution, are sucked in with the nurse's milk. Many diseases accompany the different stages of life; and hence some are proper to infancy, youth, and from age old age. Some also are proper to each of the sexes; and sex, especially the female sex, proceeding, no doubt, from the general constitution of the body, but particularly from the state of the parts subservient to generation. Hence the diseases peculiar to virgins, to menstruating women, to women with child, to lying-in women, to nurses, and to old women. The climate itself, under which people live, produces some diseases; and every climate has a tendency to produce particular diseases, either from its excess of heat or cold, or from the mutability of the weather. An immense number of diseases also may be produced by impure air, or such as is loaded with putrid, marshy, and other noxious vapours. The same\nTheory.\n\nCauses of disease may happen likewise from corrupted aliment, whether meat or drink; though even the best and most nutritious aliment will hurt if taken in too great quantity; not to mention poisons, which are endowed with such pernicious qualities, that even when taken in a very small quantity they produce the most grievous diseases, or perhaps even death itself. Lastly, from innumerable accidents and dangers to which mankind are exposed, they frequently come off with broken limbs, wounds, and contusions, sometimes quite incurable; and these misfortunes, though proceeding from an external cause at first, often terminate in internal diseases.\n\nHitherto we have mentioned only the dangers which come from without; but those are not least, nor fewer in number, which come from within. At every breath, man pours forth a deadly poison both to himself and others. Neither are the effluvia of the lungs alone harmful: there flows out from every pore of the body a most subtle and poisonous matter, perhaps of a putrefactive nature, which being long accumulated, and not allowed to diffuse itself through the air, infects the body with most grievous diseases; nor does it stop here, but produces a contagion which spreads devastation far and wide among mankind. From too much or too little exercise of our animal powers also no small danger ensues. By inactivity either of body or mind, the vigour of both is impaired; nor is the danger much less from too great employment. By moderate use, all the faculties of the mind, as well as all the parts of the body, are improved and strengthened; and here nature has appointed certain limits, so that exercise can neither be too much neglected, nor too much increased, with impunity. Hence those who use violent exercise, as well as those who spend their time in sloth and idleness, are equally liable to diseases; but each to diseases of a different kind: and hence also the bad effects of too great or too little employment of the mental powers.\n\nBesides the dangers arising from those actions of the body and mind which are in our own power, there are others arising from those which are quite involuntary. Thus, passions of the mind, either when carried to too great excess, or when long continued, equally destroy the health; nay, will even sometimes bring on sudden death. Sleep also, which is of the greatest service in restoring the exhausted strength of the body, proves noxious either from its too great or too little quantity. In the most healthy body, also, many things always require to be evacuated. The retention of these is hurtful, as well as too profuse an evacuation, or the excretion of those things either spontaneously or artificially which nature directs to be retained. As the solid parts sometimes become flabby, soft, almost dissolved, and unfit for their proper offices; so the fluids are sometimes inflamed, and formed even into the hardest solid masses. Hence impeded actions of the organs, vehement pain, various and grievous diseases. Lastly, some animals are to be reckoned among the causes of diseases: such particularly, as support their life at the expense of others: and these either invade us from without, or take up their residence within the body, gnawing the bowels while the person is yet alive, not only with great danger and distress to the patient, but sometimes even producing death itself.\n\nMan, however, is not left without defence against so many and so great dangers. The human body is possessed of a most wonderful power, by which it preserves itself from diseases, keeps off many, and in a very short time cures some already begun, while others are by the same means more slowly brought to a happy conclusion. This power, called the autocratiea, or vis medicatrix naturee, is well known both to physicians and philosophers. This alone is often sufficient for curing many diseases, and is of service in all. Nay, even the best medicines operate only by exciting and properly directing this force; for no medicine will act on a dead carcass. But though physicians justly put confidence in this power, and though it generally cures diseases of a lighter nature, it is not to be thought that those of the more grievous kind are to be left to the unaided efforts of the vis medicatrix. Physicians therefore have a twofold error to avoid, either despising the powers of nature too much, or putting too great confidence in them; because in many diseases these efforts are either too feeble or too violent, infomuch that sometimes they are more to be dreaded than even the disease itself. So far therefore is it from being the duty of a physician always to follow the footsteps of nature, that it is often necessary for him to take a directly contrary course, and oppose her efforts with all his might.\n\nAfter a general view of the functions of the animal body, of the nature and causes of disease, and of the analysis of the powers by which these are to be combated, Dr Gregory proceeds to treat of the solid materials of which the body is formed. He tells us, that the animal solid, when chemically examined, yields earth, oil, salt, water, phlogiston or inflammable air, and a great quantity of mephitic air. These elements are found in various proportions in the different parts of the body; and hence these parts are endowed with very different mechanical powers, from the hardest and most solid bone to the soft and almost fluid retina. Nay, it is principally in this difference of proportion between the quantities of the different elements, that the difference between the solid and fluid parts of the animal consist, the former having much more earth and less water in their composition than the latter. The cohesion, he thinks, is owing to something like a chemical attraction of the elements for one another; and its cause is neither to be sought for in the gluten, fixed air, nor earth. This attraction, however, is not so strong but that even during life the body tends to dissolution; and immediately after death putrefaction commences, provided only there be as much moisture in it as will allow an intestine motion to go on. The greater the heat, the sooner does putrefaction take place, and with the greater rapidity does it proceed; the mephitic air flies off, and together with it certain saline particles; after which, the cohesion of the body being totally destroyed, the whole falls into a putrid colluvies, of which at length all the volatile parts being dissipated, nothing but the earth is left behind.\n\nThis analysis, he owns, is far from being perfect, and is by no means in the language of modern chemistry.\ntry. But no modern chemist has ever been able, by combining the chemical principles of flesh, to reproduce a compound anything like what the flesh originally was; yet, however imperfect the analysis may be, it still has the advantage of showing in some measure the nature and causes of certain diseases, and thus leads physicians to the knowledge of proper remedies.\n\nThe solid parts are fitted for the purposes of life in three several ways; namely, by their cohesion, their flexibility, and their elasticity, all of which are various in the various parts of the body. Most of the functions of life consist in various motions. In some the most violent and powerful motions are required; and therefore such a degree of cohesion is necessary in these parts as will be sufficient for allowing them to perform their offices without any danger of laceration. It is therefore necessary that some of the solid parts should be more flexible than others; and it is likewise necessary that these parts, along with their flexibility, should have a power of recovering their former shape and situation, after the removal of the force by which they were altered.\n\nThese variations in flexibility, within certain limits, seldom produce any material consequence with regard to the health: though sometimes, by exceeding the proper bounds, they may bring on real and very dangerous diseases; and this either by an excess or diminution of their cohesion, flexibility, or elasticity. By augmenting the cohesion, the elasticity is also for the most part augmented, but the flexibility diminished; by diminishing the cohesion, the flexibility becomes greater, but the elasticity is diminished.\n\nThe cause of these affections, though various, may be reduced to the following heads. Either the chemical composition of the matter itself is changed; or, the composition remaining the same, the particles of the solid may be so disposed, that they shall more or less strongly attract one another. As to the composition, almost all the elements may exist in the body in an undue proportion, and thus each contribute its share to the general disorder. But of many of these things we know very little; only it is apparent, that the fluid parts, which consist chiefly of water, and the solid, which are made up of various elements, are often in very different proportions: the more water, the less is the cohesion or elasticity, but the greater the flexibility; and the reverse happens, if the solid or earthy part predominates.\n\nThe remote causes of these different states, whether predisposing or exciting, are very various. In the first place, idiosyncrasy itself, or the innate constitution of the body, contributes very much to produce the above-mentioned effects. Some have naturally a much harder and drier temperament of the body than others; men, for instance, more than women; which can with the utmost difficulty, indeed scarce by any means whatever, admit of an alteration. The same thing takes place at different periods of life; for, from first to last, the human body becomes always drier and more rigid. Much also depends on the diet made use of, which always produces a corresponding state of the solids in proportion to its being more or less watery. Neither are there wanting strong reasons for believing, that not only the habit of the body, but even the disposition of the mind, depends very much on the diet we make use of. The good or bad concoction of the aliment also, the application of the nourishment prepared from it, and likewise the state of the air with regard to moisture or dryness, affect the temperament of the body not a little; and hence those who inhabit mountains or dry countries, are very different from the inhabitants of low marshy places. Lastly, the manner of living contributes somewhat to this effect: Exercise perspires out and exhales the moisture of the body, if in too great quantity; on the contrary, sloth and laziness produce an effect directly opposite, and cause a redundancy of fluid.\n\nBut, putting the chemical composition of the solid parts out of the question altogether, they may be affected by many other causes. The condensation, for instance, or compression of the particles, whether by mechanical causes or by means of cold or heat, makes a considerable alteration in the strength and elasticity of every solid body. How much mechanical pressure contributes to this may be understood from the experiments of Sir Clifton Wintringham: and hence also are we to deduce the reason of many facts of the highest importance in the animal economy; namely, the growth, state, decrease of the body; its rigidity daily increasing; and at last the unavoidable death incident to old age from a continuance of the same causes.\n\nPerhaps the different density of the solids is in some measure owing to Nature herself; but it seems to depend more on the powers of exercise or inactivity in changing the state of the solids, the effects of which on the body whether good or bad, may hence be easily understood.\n\nHeat relaxes and expands all bodies, but cold renders them more dense and hard; the effects of which on the human body are well known to most people. Though the body is found to prefer a certain degree of heat almost in every situation, yet its surface must unavoidably be affected by the temperature of the circumambient atmosphere; and we have not the least reason to doubt that every part of the body may thus feel the effects of that temperature. What a difference is there between one who, exposed to the south wind, becomes lazy and languid, scarce able to drag along his limbs; and one who feels the force of the cold north wind, which renders the whole body alert, strong, and fit for action?\n\nThat these various causes, each of which is capable of affecting the constitution of the body when taken singly, will produce much greater effects when combined, is sufficiently evident. The experiments of Bryan Robinson, the effects of the warm bath, and indeed daily experience, show it fully.\n\nIt is not yet certainly known what is the ultimate structure of the minutest parts of the animal-solid; whether it consists of straight fibres or threads, whose length is very considerable in proportion to their breadth, variously interwoven with one another, as Boerhaave supposes; or of spiral ones, admirably convoluted and interwoven with one another, as some microscopical experiments seem to show; or whether the cellular texture be formed of fibres or laminae, and from thence the greatest part of the body, as the celebrated Haller hath endeavoured to prove.\nThe cellular texture is observed throughout the whole body: it surrounds and connects the fibres themselves, which are sufficiently apparent in many of the organs; and slightly joins the different parts which ought to have any kind of motion upon the neighbouring ones. By a condensation of this substance also, the strongest, and what seem the thinnest, membranes are formed; the most simple of which being accurately examined, discover the cellular structure. This cellular substance sometimes increases to a surprising degree, and all parts formed of it, membranes, veffels, &c. especially by a gentle diffusion; for a sudden and violent diffusion either breaks it altogether, or renders it thinner. Sometimes also it grows between neighbouring parts, and joins those which nature has left free. Preternatural concretions of this kind are often observed after an inflammation of the lungs or of the abdominal viscera; and these new membranes are found to be truly cellular. This substance, when cut, or by any other means divided, grows together of its own accord; but if, by reason of very great inflammation and suppuration, a large portion of the cellular texture has been destroyed, it is never again completely renewed, and an ugly scar is left. It is even said, that this substance, in certain cases, is capable of joining the parts either of the same body with one another, or of a foreign body with them; and upon this, if on any foundation, rests the art of Taliaclaus and that of transplanting teeth, lately so much talked of.\n\nThe cellular texture is in some places merely a kind of net-work, in others filled with fat. Wherever too great bulk or compression would have been inconvenient or dangerous, as in the head, lungs, eyes, eyebrows, penis, scrotum, &c. there it collects no fat, but is lax, and purely reticulated; but between the muscles of the body and limbs below the skin, in the abdomen, especially in the omentum and about the kidneys, very much fat is secreted and collected.\n\nThe fat is principally a pure animal oil, not very different from the expressed and mild vegetable ones; during life it is fluid, but of different degrees of thickness in different parts of the body. It is secreted from the blood, and is often suddenly reabsorbed into it, though pure oil is very rarely observed in the blood. It is indeed very probable, that oil, by digestion, partly in the prime viae, and partly in the lungs, is converted into gluten, and this again into oil by means of secretion; though no glandular organs secreting the fat can be shown by anatomists. It is however, probable, that there are such organs; and that the cellular texture has some peculiar structure in those parts which are destined to contain the fat already secreted, without suffering it to pass into other places; for it never passes into those parts which are purely reticulated, although the cellular texture is easily permeable by air or water over the whole body from head to foot.\n\nThe fat is augmented by the use of much animal-food, or of any other that is oily and nourishing, provided the digestion be good; by the use of strong drink, especially malt-liquor; by much rest of body and mind, much sleep and inactivity, castration, cold, repeated bloodletting, and in general by whatever diminishes the vital and animal powers. Much, however, depends on the constitution of the body itself; nor is it possible to fatten a human creature at pleasure like an ox. A certain degree of fatness, according to the age of the person, is a sign and effect of good health; but when too great, it becomes a disease of itself, and the cause of other diseases. It may always be very certainly removed by strong exercise, little sleep, and a spare diet. The fat commonly makes up a considerable part of the bulk of the body, and sometimes by far the greatest part. Its use seems to be to make the motion of the body more easy and free, by lessening the friction of the moving parts, and thus preventing the abrasion of the solids, which would otherwise happen. It is also of use to hinder the parts from growing together, which sometimes happens, when by an ulcer or any other accident a part of the cellular texture containing the fat is destroyed. Besides all this, the fat contributes not a little to the beauty of the body, by filling up the large interstices between the muscles, which would otherwise give the person a deformed and shocking appearance. It is thought to be nutritious, when absorbed from its cells into the blood; but of this we have no certain proof. It seems to have some power of defending from the cold; at least, nature has bestowed it in very great quantity on those animals which inhabit the colder regions, as whales, bears, &c.\n\nThose parts of the body which enjoy lenity and mobility, are called living or vital solids. They are the brain, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, spinal marrow, the nerves arising from these and diffused throughout the whole body, and which are distributed through the various organs of sense and through the muscles, and lastly the muscles themselves. Sensation is much more general than mobility, as being common to all the parts already mentioned. Mobility is proper to the muscular fibres alone: wherever there is sensation, therefore, we may believe that there are nerves; and wherever there is mobility, we may believe that muscular fibres exist. Nay, even mobility itself seems to originate from the connection which the muscles have with the nerves; for soon after the nerves are compressed, or tied, or cut, the muscles to which they are distributed lose their faculties; which happens, too, when the brain itself, or the origin of the nerves, is affected. Some reckon that the muscles are produced from the nerves, and consist of the same kind of matter. Both indeed have a similar structure, as being fibrous and of a white colour: for the muscles when well freed from the blood, of which they contain a great abundance, are of this colour as well as the nerves; neither can the nervous fibres by any means be distinguished from the muscular fibres themselves. Both have also sensation; and both stimulants and sedatives act in the same manner, whether they be applied to the muscles themselves or to the nerves. These circumstances have led Dr Cullen and many others to consider the muscular fibre as being merely a continuation of nerve. But to this opinion there are many strong objections; though there can be no doubt that the contraction of the muscular fibre is intimately connected with nervous influence.\n\nIt is difficult for us to discover the origin of many parts of the body, or to ascertain whether they are produced all at the same time or one after another; yet it must be owned, that many of the muscular parts are observed to have attained a remarkable degree of strength.\nExternal strength, while the brain is still soft and almost fluid; and that the action of these muscular parts is required for the action and growth of the brain. The muscles are also of a much firmer contexture than the nerves; and enjoy a power of their own, namely, that of irritability, of which the nerves never partake. Of necessity, therefore, either the muscles must be constructed of some kind of matter different from that of the nerves; or if both are made of the same materials, their organization must be exceedingly different. But if the substance of the muscles and nerves be totally different, we may easily be convinced that much of the one is always mixed with the other; for it is impossible to prick a muscle, even with the smallest needle, without wounding or lacerating many nervous fibres at the same time. Since, therefore, there is such a close connection between the muscles and nerves both as to their functions and structure, they are deservedly reckoned by physiologists to be parts of the same genus, called the genus nervosum, or nervous system.\n\nAfter treating of sense in general, Dr Gregory proceeds to consider particularly each of the senses both external and internal. He begins with the sense of feeling, as being the most simple, and at the same time in common to every part of the nervous system. In some places, however, it is much more acute than in others; in the skin, for instance, and especially in the points of the fingers. These are reckoned to have nervous papillae, which by the influx of the blood are somewhat erected in the action of contact, in order to give a more acute sensation; though indeed this opinion seems rather to be founded on a conjecture derived from the structure of the tongue, which is not only the organ of taste, but also a most delicate organ of touch, than upon any certain observations.\n\nFrom the sense of feeling, as well as all the other senses, either pain or pleasure may arise; nay, to this sense we commonly refer both pain and almost all other troublesome sensations, though in truth pain may arise from every vehement sensation. It is brought on by any great force applied to the sentient part; whether this force comes from within or from without. Whatever, therefore, pricks, cuts, lacerates, distends, compresses, bruises, strikes, gnaws, burns, or in any manner of way stimulates, may create pain. Hence it is so frequently conjoined with so many diseases, and is often more intolerable than even the disease itself. A moderate degree of pain stimulates the affected part, and by degrees the whole body; produces a greater flux of blood to the part affected, by increasing the action of its vessels; and it seems also to increase the sensibility of the part affected to future impressions. It often stimulates to such motions as are both necessary and healthful. Hence, pain is sometimes to be reckoned among those things which guard our life. When very violent, however, it produces too great irritation, inflammation and its consequences, fever, and all those evils which flow from too great force of the circulation; it disorders the whole nervous system, and produces shams, watching, convulsions, delirium, debility, and fainting. Neither the mind nor body can long bear very vehement pain; and indeed Nature has appointed certain limits, beyond which will not permit pain to be carried, without bringing on delirium, convulsions, syncope, or even death, to rescue the miserable sufferer from his torments.\n\nLong-continued pain, even though in a more gentle degree, often brings on debility, torpor, paleness, and rigidity of the affected part. But if not too violent, nor accompanied with fever, sickness, or anxiety, it sometimes seems to contribute to the clearness and acuteness of the judgement, as some people testify who have been afflicted with the gout.\n\nAnxiety is another disagreeable sensation, quite different from pain, as being more obtuse and less capable of being referred to any particular part, though frequently more intolerable than any pain. But we must take care to distinguish between this anxiety of which we treat in a medical sense, and that which is spoken of in common discourse. The latter does not at all depend on the state of the body, but belongs entirely to the mind; and arises from a sense of danger, or a foresight of any misfortune. The former is truly corporeal; and derives, no less than pain, its origin from a certain state of the body. Notwithstanding this difference, however, it is very possible for both these kinds of anxiety to be present at the same time, or for the one to be the cause of the other. A very great bodily anxiety will strike fear and despondency into the most resolute mind; and mental anxiety, on the contrary, if very violent and long-continued, may induce the former, by destroying the powers of the body, especially those which promote the circulation of the blood.\n\nAnxiety, in the medical sense of the word, arises in the first place from every cause disturbing or impeding the motion of the blood through the heart and large vessels near it. Anxiety, therefore, may arise from many diseases of the heart and its vessels, such as its enlargement, too great contraction, ossification, polypus, palpitation, syncope, inflammation, debility, and also some affections of the mind. It is likewise produced by every difficulty of breathing, from whatever cause it may arise; because then the blood passes less freely through the lungs: anxiety of this kind is felt deep in the breast. It is said also to arise from the difficult passage of the blood through the liver or other abdominal viscera.\n\nA certain kind of anxiety is very common and troublesome to hypochondriacal people; and arises from the stomach and intestines being either loaded with indigested and corrupted food, or distended with air produced by fermentation and extracted from the aliments. By such a load, or distention, the stomach, which is a very delicate organ, becomes greatly affected. Besides, the free descent of the diaphragm is thus hindered, and respiration obstructed. Anxiety of this kind is usually very much and suddenly relieved by the expulsion of the air; by which, as well as by other signs of a bad digestion, it is easily known. In these cases the anxiety is usually, though with little accuracy, referred to the stomach.\n\nAnxiety also frequently accompanies fevers of every kind, sometimes in a greater and sometimes in a lesser degree. In this case it arises as well from the general debility as from the blood being driven from the surface of the body and accumulated in the large vessels; as in the beginning of an intermittent fever. Or it may arise from an affection of the stomach, when\nTheory.\n\nExternal Sensations.\n\nWhen overloaded with crude, corrupted aliment; or blended and nauseated with too much drink, especially medicated drink. As the fever increases, the anxiety of the patient becomes greater and greater; remarkably so, according to the testimony of physicians, either immediately before the crisis or on the night preceding it; as before the breaking out of exanthemata, hemorrhagy, sweat, or diarrhea, which sometimes remove fevers. The patient feels likewise an anxiety from the striking in of any eruption or critical metastasis. This sensation also accompanies fevers and most other diseases, when the vital power is exhausted, and death approaches, of which it is the forerunner and the sign. It happens at that time, because the vital powers, unable to perform their functions, cannot make the blood circulate. But what kind of anxiety this is, the other signs of approaching death show very evidently. Moreover, even in the time of sleep, anxiety may arise from the same causes; hence frightful dreams, which frequently disturb our repose with surprise and terror.\n\nItching, an uneasy sensation, with a desire of scratching the place affected, is often very troublesome, although it seems to be more akin to pleasure than to pain. As pain proceeds from too great an irritation, either chemical or mechanical, so does itching proceed from a slight one. Titillation, or friction, of a woollen shirt, for instance, upon the skin of a person unaccustomed to it, and of a delicate constitution, excites itching; as do also many acid foils, vegetables, and animals. Hence an itching is the first sensation after the application of cantharides, although the same, when augmented becomes painful. The same effect is produced by anything acid thrown out upon the skin; as in exanthematic fevers, the disease called the itch, &c. Lice, worms, especially lice, irritating either the skin or the intestines, excite a troublesome itching.\n\nToo acute a sensation over the whole body is very rarely if ever observed. In a particular part the sense of feeling is often more acute than it ought to be, either from the cuticle itself being too thin and soft, or being removed; or from the part itself being inflamed, or exposed to too great heat. It becomes obtuse, or is even quite destroyed over the whole body, or in great part of it, from various affections of the brain and nerves; as when they are wounded, compressed, or defective in vital power. This is called anaesthesia, and sometimes accompanies palsy.\n\nThis sense may be deficient in a particular part, either from the nerve being diseased, or from its being compressed or wounded, or from the part itself being exposed to too great a degree of cold—or from the scarf-skin which covers it being vitiated, either becoming too thick or hard, by the handling of rough, or hard, or hot bodies, as is the case with glass-makers and smiths; or from the elevation of the cuticle from the subjacent cutis, or true skin itself, by the interposition of blood, serum, or pus; or from the cutis being macerated, relaxed, or become torpid, which sometimes happens to hydropic persons; or lastly, from the whole organ being corrupted by gangrene, burning, cold, or contusion. This sense is very rarely depraved, unless perhaps in the case of delirium, when all the functions of the brain are disturbed in a surprising manner.\n\nThe sense next to be considered is that of taste, the principal organ of which is the tongue; the nearer the tip of it, the more acute is the sense, and the nearer the glottis so much the more obtuse. It must be taken into account, however, that some kind of acid substances, the taste of which is scarcely perceived upon the tip of the tongue, excite a most vehement sensation about its roots, or even in the throat itself. The tongue is endowed with many large and beautiful nervous papillae, which seem to be the chief seat of this sense, and in the act of tasting are elevated and erected, in order to give the more acute sensation.\n\nNothing can be tasted which is not soluble in the saliva; that, being applied in a fluid form, it may pervade the involucra of the tongue, and affect its nervous pulp; and hence infusible earths are quite insipid. Neither is it sufficient for a body to be soluble that it may be tasted: it must also have something in it saline, or at least acid, in order to stimulate the nervous substance; and hence, whatever has less salt than the saliva is totally insipid.\n\nThe taste is rarely found to be too acute, unless through a fault in the epidermis which covers the tongue. If this be removed or wounded, or covered with ulcers, aphthae, &c., then the taste, becoming too acute, is painful: or sometimes no other sensation than that of pain is felt. It may be impaired, as well as the sense of feeling, from various affections of the brain and nerves; of which, however, the instances are but rare. In some people it is much more dull than in others; and in such the sense of smelling is usually deficient also. The taste is most commonly deficient on account of the want of saliva; for a dry tongue cannot perceive any taste: hence this sense is very dull in many diseases, especially in fevers, catarrhs, &c., as well on account of the defect of saliva as of appetite, which is of so much service in a state of health; or by reason of the tongue being covered with a viscid mucus.\n\nThe taste is frequently depraved; when, for example, we have a perception of taste without the application of any thing to the tongue; or if any thing be applied to it, when we perceive a taste different from what it ought to be. This happens for the most part from a vitiated condition of the saliva, which is itself tasted in the mouth. Hence we may perceive a sweet, saline, bitter, putrid, or rancid taste, according to the state of the saliva; which may be corrupted either from the general vitiated condition of the maws of humours, or the glands which secrete it; of the mouth itself; or even of the stomach, the vapours and eruptions of which rise into the mouth, especially when the stomach is diseased.\n\nBesides the faults of the saliva, however, the taste may be vitiated from other causes; as, for instance, the condition of the nervous papillae. This, however, is as yet but little known to us; for the taste is sometimes plainly vitiated when at the same time the saliva appears quite insipid when tasted by other people.\n\nPhysicians, in almost every disease, but especially in fevers, inquire into the state of the tongue; not, indeed, without the greatest reason: for from this they can judge of the condition of the stomach; of the thirst, or rather the occasion the patient has for drink, when, on account of his delirium or stupor, he neither feels his thirst.\nExternal Sense.\n\nAnd, lastly, from an inspection of the tongue, physicians endeavour to form some judgement concerning the nature, increase, and remission of the fever.\n\nAfter the sense of taste, we shall next treat of that of smell. Its seat is in that very soft and delicate membrane, filled with nerves and blood-vessels, which covers the internal parts of the nose, and the various sinuses and cavities proceeding from thence. This sense is more acute about the middle of the septum, and the osa spongiola, where the membrane is thicker and softer, than in the deeper cavities, where the membrane is thinner, less nervous, and less filled with blood-vessels; although even these do not seem to be altogether delusive of the sense of smelling.\n\nAs by our taste we judge of the soluble parts of bodies, so by our smell we judge of those very volatile and fugitive parts which fly off into the air; and like the organ of taste, that of smell is kept moist, that it may have the more exquisite sensation, partly by its proper mucus, and partly by the tears which descend from the eyes.\n\nSome kinds of odours greatly affect the nervous system, and produce the most surprising effects. Some gratefully excite it, and immediately recruit the spirits when almost sinking; while some produce fainting, nay, as it is alleged, even sudden death. To this head also are we to refer those antipathies, which, though truly ridiculous, are often not to be subdued by any force of mind.\n\nThis sense is sometimes too acute, as well from some disease in the organ itself, which happens more rarely, as from the too great sensibility of the nervous system in general, as is sometimes observed in nervous fevers, phrenitis, and hysteria. It is more frequently, however, too dull, either from diseases of the brain and nerves, as from some violence done to the head, or from some internal cause; or it may proceed from a dryness of the organ itself, either on account of the customary humours being suppressed or turned another way, or from the membranes being oppressed with too great a quantity of mucus or of tears. Of both these cases we have instances in the catarrh, where at first the nostrils are dry, but afterwards are deluged with a thin humour, or stoppered up with a thick one. But in these, and many other examples, the membrane of the nose itself is affected with inflammation, relaxation, or too great tension, by which the nerves, which constitute a great part of it, must be vitiated. It is evident also, that whatever obstructs the free entrance of the air into the nostrils, or impedes its passage through them, must prove detrimental to the sense of smelling.\n\nThe sense of hearing is more frequently vitiated than almost any of the rest, as having a most delicate organ, and one composed of many and very small parts, of which an account is given under the article Anatomy.—It frequently becomes too acute; either from the general habit of the body being too irritable, such as often happens to hysterical and lying-in women; or from too great a sensibility of the brain itself, which is not unfrequently observed in fevers, as well as in phrenitis, and sometimes in the true mania; or it may be from a disease of the ear itself, as when it is affected with inflammation, pain, or too great tension.—It may be rendered dull, or even be altogether destroyed, so that the person shall become totally deaf, from the same causes acting with different degrees of force. This happens especially from the want of the external ear; or from the meatus auditorius being stoppered up with mucus, wax, or other matters; or from the sides of the canal growing together, as sometimes happens after suppuration or the small-pox; or by the membrane of the tympanum becoming rigid or relaxed, or being eroded or ruptured; or the tympanum itself, or the Eustachian tube, may from certain causes be obstructed; or some of the little bones or membranes, or some of the muscles of the labyrinth, may be affected with concretion, palsy, palsy, or torpor; or lastly, it may happen from diseases of the brain and nerves, all the organs of hearing remaining sound. Hence deafness is often a nervous disease, coming suddenly on, and going off spontaneously. Hence also it is common in old people, all of whose solid parts are too rigid, while their nervous parts have too little sensibility.\n\nPersons labouring under fevers, especially of the typhus kind, often become deaf. When this comes on along with other signs of an oppressed brain, and a great prostration of strength, it may be a very bad symptom; but for the most part it is a very good one, even though accompanied with some degree of torpor or sleepiness.\n\nA very common disease in the sense of hearing is when certain sounds, like those of a drum, a bell, the falling of water, &c. are heard without any tremor in the air, or without a sound person's hearing anything. This disease is called tinnitus aurium, of which various kinds have been observed. For the most part it is a very slight transient disorder; but sometimes it is most obstinate, long continued, and troublesome. It often arises from the slightest cause, such as anything partially stopping up the meatus auditorius or Eustachian tube itself, so that access is in part denied to the air; whence it happens that the latter strikes the membrane of the tympanum, or perhaps the interior parts, unequally, and with too much force. Hence bonarii, a kind of tinnitus, are heard even by the most healthy when they yawn.\n\nA much more frequent and troublesome species of tinnitus accompanies many diseases both of the febrile and nervous kind. This is occasioned partly by the increased impetus of the blood towards the head, with an increase of sensibility in the nervous system itself, so that the very beatings of the arteries are heard; and partly from the increased sensation and mobility of the nerves and muscles of the labyrinth: whence it happens, that the parts which ought to be at rest until excited by the tremor of the air, begin to move of their own accord, and impart their motion to other parts which are already in a morbid state of too great sensibility.\n\nA tinnitus sometimes arises from any vehement affection of the mind; sometimes from a disorder in the stomach; sometimes from a rheumatic disorder affecting the ears and head; or from a catarrh, which commonly affects the Eustachian tube. Sometimes, however, the tinnitus alone affects the patient; and even this is a disease of no small consequence. These various causes, however, both of this and other disorders of the hearing,\nConcerning the nature of the sense of sight, the reader may consult the articles Anatomy and Optics. Of this sense some slight disorders, or rather varieties, are often observed. Those persons are called short-sighted who cannot see distinctly unless the object be very near them. This disorder arises from too great a refraction of the rays by reason of their being too soon collected into a focus by the crystalline lens, and diverging again before they fall upon the retina, by which means they make an indistinct picture upon it. The most common cause is too great a convexity of the eye or some of its humours, as too prominent a cornea. It is a disorder common to young people, which is sometimes removed when they grow older. As soon as the first approaches of short-sightedness are observed, it is supposed it may be obviated by the person's accustoming himself to view remote objects, and keeping his eyes off very small and near ones; as, on the contrary, it may be brought on by the opposite custom; because the eye accommodates itself somewhat to the distances of those objects which it is accustomed to view. But a concave glass, which causes the rays of light to diverge more than naturally they would before falling upon the cornea, is the most simple and certain remedy.\n\nLong-sighted people are those who cannot see an object distinctly unless it be at a considerable distance from them. This arises from causes contrary to the former; namely, the eye being too flat, so that there is no room for refracting the rays and bringing them into a focus. Hence this defect is common in old people, and remedied by the use of convex glasses.\n\nThose are called myopicopes who see better with a very weak than with a strong light. It is a defect very seldom to be met with in the human race, though every person is sensible of it who hath been long kept in the dark and is then suddenly brought into the light. The disease arises from too great a sensibility of the retina, and the pupil being too open.\n\nThe sight is liable to many and grievous disorders. It is sharpened beyond measure, so that the person either perceives nothing distinctly, or with great pain, from the same causes that induce a similar disorder in the other senses; namely, excessive sensibility in the general habit of body; or a particular state of the brain common in phrenitis, or even in those afflicted with fevers arising from inflammation or too great excitement; though more frequently from the condition of the eye itself, one becomes unable to bear the light. The inflammation of the tunica adnata, and the forepart of the sclerotic, is communicated to the back parts of it, and from thence to the choroides and retina itself. Hence the light becomes intolerable, and vision is attended with pain and great irritation, sometimes inducing or augmenting a delirium.\n\nThe sense of seeing is made dull, or even totally abolished, by age; the aqueous humour not being supplied in sufficient quantity, and the cornea and lens, or the vitreous humour, becoming shrivelled or decayed. It may likewise happen from the cornea becoming dry and opaque; which is to be imputed to the languid motion of the blood, and to great numbers of the small vessels being obstructed or having their fides concreted;—or from the crystalline lens becoming yellow like amber, and the retina itself less sensible, for old age diminishes every sensation. It is totally abolished by injuries of the brain, the optic nerve, or the retina, even though the structure of the organ should remain found. This disease is called an amaurosis; and is easily known by the dilatation and immobility of the pupil, the humours of the eye remaining clear. It is commonly owing to congestion of blood; and sometimes, where no congestion of blood can be discovered, to mere torpor of the nerves. If it be only a torpor of part of the retina, we see black spots in those things at which we look; or flies seem to pass before our eyes, a very bad sign in fevers, and almost always mortal. The sight is abolished also by the obscurity or opacity of any of the parts through which the rays ought to pass and be refracted; as if the cornea lost its transparency by being covered with spots; or the aqueous humours become corrupted with blood, serum, or pus; or the lens (which often happens and which is called a cataract) becomes of a gray or brown colour, or the vitreous humour be in like manner corrupted; or lastly, when all the humours being dissolved, confused, and mixed together, by inflammation and suppuration, either do not suffer the light to pass at all, or to pass imperfectly and unequally; whence either no image is formed on the retina, or it appears obscure, distorted, imperfect, and ill-coloured.\n\nThe sight is also depraved, when things appear to it of a colour different from their own, or even in another situation and of another shape than they ought to have. This happens from the humours being tinctured with any unusual colour, as is said to happen in some instances of jaundice; or from an extravasation and mixture of the blood with the aqueous humour. A surprising depravation also, or constant and perpetual defect of vision, is not unfrequently observed in men otherwise very healthy, and who see quite clearly; namely, that they cannot distinguish certain colours, green, for example, from red. Another deprivation is, when, without any light being admitted to the eyes, sparks, small drops of a flame or gold colour, and various other colours, are observed to float before us. This is generally a very slight and transient disorder, common to those whose constitutions are very irritable; and arises from the flight impulse, as it would seem, on the retina, by the vessels beating more vehemently than usual. A fiery circle is observed by pressing the eye with the finger after the eye lids are shut. The same reason, perhaps, may be given for those sparks which are seen by persons labouring under the falling-sickness, and increasing to the size of an immense and luminous beam before they fall down in convulsions. A similar beam those who have recovered from hanging or drowning testify that they have observed: for by reason of the respiration being suppressed, the veils of the head swell and compress the whole brain and nervous parts of the head. Sparks of the same kind, and these too of no good\nExternal Senes.\n\nomen, are observed in patients labouring under a fever, where a phrenitis or fierce delirium is at hand; and likewise in those who are threatened with palsy, apoplexy or epilepsy.—A distinct but false perception, namely of visible things which do not exist, is to be imputed to some injury of the brain, to madness or a delirium, not to any disease of the eye.\n\nA very frequent defect of vision remains to be mentioned; namely, squinting. A person is said to squint who has the axes of the eyes more oblique than usual, and directed to different points. Hence a great deformity, and often an imperfect and confused vision by which the objects are sometimes seen double. It is an evil for the most part born with the person, and often corrected by those attempts which an infant makes to see more pleasantly and distinctly; and this even without being conscious of its own defects. It is also easily learned, especially in infants, even without their own knowledge, by that kind of imitation which has a great influence over the human race, especially in their tender years.—It is by no means, however, so easily unlearned.\n\nSquinting is frequently occasioned by spasms, palsy, rigidity, &c. of the muscles which manage the eye; by epilepsy; by certain diseases of the head, the hydrocephalus especially; or by any great injury done to the head. Sometimes, though very rarely, it comes on suddenly without any known cause. It is very probable, however, that squinting often arises from a fault of the retinae, when their central points, for instance, and those similarly placed with respect to the centre, do not agree. In this case there must be a contortion of the eye, that the object may not be seen double. This seems also to be the reason why squinting is much increased when the person brings the object near his eye in order to view it more perfectly. Or if the central point of either, or both, of the retinae be insensible or nearly so, it is necessary for the person to distort his eyes that he may have any distinct vision of objects. If the optic nerve had not entered the retina obliquely, but passed directly through its centre, we would all either have squinted or been double.\n\nPhysicians have referred to the sense of vision that most troublesome sensation which we call vertigo; though it seems rather to belong to that of feeling, or of consciousness; for in many instances the disorder is not removed either in the dark or by shutting the eyelids. The vertigo takes place when external objects really at rest seem to reel, to whirl round, to tremble, or to move in any manner of way. If the disorder be very violent, the person is neither able to see, on account of a dimness of sight; nor can he stand, as the powers fail which ought to govern the limbs. A nausea also usually accompanies the vertigo, and the one generally produces the other.\n\nThis disorder is observed to be both the symptom and forerunner of some dangerous diseases; such as apoplexy, epilepsy, hysteria; hemorrhages from the nose and other parts; suppressions of the meninges; plethora; fevers, as well as those as are accompanied with debility as those in which there is an increased impetus of the blood towards the head. An injury done to the head also, but rarely one done to the eyes, unless as it affects the whole head, brings on a vertigo. A vertigo may be likewise produced by a very great and sudden loss of blood or other fluid; by debility; syncope; various diseases of the alimentary canal, of the stomach especially; poisons admitted into the body, particularly of the narcotic kind, as opium, stramonium, wine, &c., and hence vertigo is a symptom of every kind of drunkenness. Various motions also, either of the head or the whole body, being tossed in a ship, especially if the vessel be small and the sea runs high, produce a vertigo. In these and similar examples, the unusual and inordinate motions of the blood are communicated to the nervous parts which are in the head; or these being affected by sympathy from the neighbouring parts, produce a confused sensation as if of a rotatory motion. Nay, it is often produced from an affection of the mind itself, as from beholding anything turned swiftly round, or a great cataract, or looking down a precipice, or even by intense thought without looking at anything.\n\nThough a vertigo be for the most part a symptom and concomitant of other diseases, yet it is sometimes a primary disease, returning at intervals, increasing gradually, and equally impeding and destroying the functions of the body and mind.\n\nAfter having treated of the external senses, we shall next proceed to consider those properly called internal; which are, the memory, the imagination, and the judgment. The first is lessened, disturbed, or even totally destroyed, in many diseases, especially those which affect the brain; as in apoplexy, palsy, internal tumours of the head, external violence applied, fevers, especially those in which there is an increased motion of the blood towards the head, or where the brain is any other way very much affected. It is very rarely, however, depraved in such a manner that ideas are not represented to the mind in their proper order; or if at any time such a disorder occurs, it is considered rather as a disorder of the imagination, or as a delirium, than a failure of the memory. The mind is said to be disordered when the perceptions of memory or imagination are confounded with those of sense, and of consequence those things believed to be now present which are really past or which never existed; or when the sense of the person concerning ordinary things is different from that of other people. The general name for such disorders is vagraria; if from fever, it is called delirium. A general fury without a fever, is called mania or madnes; but a partial madness, on one or two points, the judgement remaining found in all other respects, is called melancholia. There is, however, no exact and accurate limits between a sound mind and madness. All immoderate vivacity borders upon madness; and, on the other hand, a sorrowful and gloomy disposition approaches to melancholy.\n\nDelirium accompanies fevers of many different kinds. Sometimes it is slight, easily removed, and scarce to be accounted a bad sign. Often, however, it is very violent, and one of the very worst of signs, requiring the utmost care and attention.\n\nA delirium is either fierce or mild. The fierce delirium is preceded and accompanied by a redness of the countenance, a pain of the head, a great beating of the arteries, and noise in the ears; the eyes in the mean time looking red, inflamed, fierce, shining, and unable to bear the light; there is either no sleep at all,\nDelirium all; or sleep troubled with horrid dreams; the wonted manners are changed; an unusual peevishness and ill-nature prevail. The depravation of judgement is first observed between sleep and waking, and by the person's crediting his imagination, while the perceptions of sense are neglected, and the ideas of memory occur in an irregular manner. Fury at last takes place, and sometimes an unusual and incredible degree of bodily strength, so that several attendants can scarce keep a single patient in his bed.\n\nThe mild delirium, on the contrary, is often accompanied with a weak pulse, a pale collapsed countenance, and a vertigo when the patient fits in an erect posture; he is seldom angry, but often stupid, and sometimes remarkably grieved and fearful. The loss of judgement, as in the former kind, is first perceived when the patient is half awake; but a temporary recovery ensues upon the admission of the light and the conversation of his friends. The patient mutters much to himself, and attends little to the things around him; at last, becoming quite stupid, he neither feels the sensations of hunger or thirst, nor any of the other propensities of nature, by which means the urine and excrements are voided involuntarily. As the disorder increases, it terminates in subfultus tendinum, tremors, convulsions, torpor, and death. The other species of delirium also frequently terminates in death, when the spirits and strength of the patient begin to fail.\n\nThe symptoms accompanying either of these kinds of delirium show an unusual, inordinate, and unequal motion of the blood through the brain, and a great change in that state of it which is necessary to the exercise of the mental powers. It is very probable, that an inflammation of the brain, more or less violent and general, sometimes takes place, although the signs of universal inflammation are frequently slight. This we learn from the dissection of dead bodies, which often show an unusual redness of the brain or of some of its parts, or sometimes an effusion or suppuration.\n\nThe state of the brain, however, may be much affected, and delirium induced, by many other causes besides the motion of the blood. In many fevers, typhus, for instance, the nervous system itself is much sooner and more affected than the blood's motion; and though the morbid affections of the nervous system are as invisible to the senses as the healthy state of it, the symptoms of its injuries plainly show that its action, or excitement, as some call it, is unequal and inordinate. In this way, too, delirium is produced by several poisons.\n\nThe pathology of melancholy and mania is much more obscure; as coming on without any fever, or disturbance in the blood's motion. Often also they are hereditary, depending on the original structure of the body, especially of the brain; the fault of which, however, cannot be detected by the nicest anatomist. But it is well known, that various diseases of the brain, obstructions, tumors, either of the brain itself, or of the cranium pressing upon it, any injury done to the head, and, as some physicians relate, the hardness and dryness of the brain, and some peculiar irritations affecting the nervous system, are capable of bringing on this malady. And indeed so great are the irritations affecting the nervous system in mad people, that they often sleep little or none for a long time.—Yet even this so defective and imperfect knowledge of the difficulties. For though we know that the brain, or a certain part of it, is hurt, or that it is irritated by a swelling, or a pointed bone growing into it, nobody can foretell how great, or what may be the nature of the malady from such a hurt: for examples are not wanting of people who, after losing a large part of the brain, have recovered and lived a long time; there are many instances also of persons who have perceived no inconvenience from a large portion of that vicious being corrupted, until at length they have fallen suddenly down and died in convulsions.\n\nAnother disease of the internal senses, quite different from these, is fatuity or idiotism. Those are called idiots who are destitute either of judgement or memory, or else have their faculties unequal to the common offices of life. A weak memory, however, is by no means essential to idiotism. For there are some instances of idiots who have had very correct and very extensive memories. A kind of idiotism is natural and common to all infants; neither is it to be accounted a disease; but if it last beyond the state of infancy, it is a real disease, and for the most part incurable. It has the same causes with the other diseases of the internal senses; although these can scarcely be detected by the eye or by the knife of the anatomist. It frequently accompanies, or is the effect of, epilepsy. Hence, if the epilepsy derives its origin from causes not located in the head, as from worms lodging in the intestines, the fatuity may be cured by dislodging these, and removing the epilepsy. It is not unlikely that the fatuity of children, and the dotage of old men, may arise from the brain being in the former too soft, and in the latter too hard; or perhaps in the one case not evolved, and in the other somewhat decayed.\n\nThe muscular power may be diseased in a great number of ways. The mobility itself may be too great; but this must be carefully distinguished from vigour. By mobility is meant the ease with which the muscular fibres are excited into contraction. The vigour, on the other hand, is that power with which the contraction is performed. They are sometimes joined, but more frequently separate, and for the most part the excesses of each are owing to contrary causes.\n\nToo great mobility is when motions are excited by a very slight stimulus, or when very violent motions are produced by the customary stimulus. A certain habit of body, sometimes hereditary, renders people liable to this disease. Women have a greater share of mobility than men. Infants have a great deal of mobility, often too great; youth has less than infancy, but more than man's estate; though old age has commonly too little. A lazy, sedentary life, full diet, suppression of the usual evacuations, fulness of the blood-vessels, and sometimes their being suddenly emptied, laxity, flaccidity of the solids in general, but sometimes too great a tension of the moving fibres, the use of diluents, especially when warm, or heat applied in any manner, produce too great mobility. And this may be either general or particular, according as the causes have been applied to the whole body, or only to a part of it.\n\nVigour in general is rarely morbid; although sometimes certain muscular parts appear to have too great strength. In maniacs and phrenatics, an immense\nDisorders in strength is observed in all the muscles, especially in those which serve for voluntary motion; this is not unjustly reckoned morbid. The reason of this excess is very obscure; however, it is plainly to be referred to a diseased state of the brain.\n\nA more frequent and more important excess of vigour is observed in those muscular fibres that do not obey the will, such as those which move the blood. Its circulation is thus often increased, not without great inconvenience and danger to the patient. But a slighter excess of this kind, pervading the whole body, renders people apt to receive inflammatory diseases, and is usually called a phlogistic diathesis. But this is better observed when local, as in inflammation itself.\n\nToo great vigour of the muscular fibres may arise from the nervous power increased beyond measure, as in mania, phrenitis, or violent affections of the mind; from too great a tension of the fibres, by which they more easily and vehemently conceive motions, as of the arteries when filled with too much blood; from catching cold, by being exposed either to cold or heat, as usually happens in the spring; or lastly, though the nervous power and tension of the fibres should not at all be changed, their action may become too great, from a stimulus more violent than usual being applied, or from the usual stimulus, if the fibres themselves have already acquired too great a share of mobility.\n\nThe opposite to too great mobility is torpor, and to too great vigour is debility. Torpor is such a diminution of mobility as renders the parts unequal to their functions. It arises from causes directly opposite to mobility; such as, a harder and more rigid contexture of the parts themselves, or even sometimes from one too lax and flaccid; from old age; from some peculiar temperament of body, such as one phlegmatic, frigid, or insensible; too great and incessant labour, cold, spare diet, and an exhausted body. This evil is the more to be dreaded, because, the powers of the body being deficient, nature is neither able to make any effort of herself, nor are the remedies, in other cases the most efficacious, capable of affording her any assistance.\n\nDebility takes place, when the motion of the muscles, either voluntary or involuntary, is not performed with sufficient strength. A greater or lesser share of debility, either general or of some particular part, accompanies almost all diseases, and is indeed no small part of them: for it is hardly possible that a disease can subsist for any length of time without inducing some degree of debility. When a state of debility is induced, it renders a man obnoxious to innumerable disorders, and throws him as it were defenceless in their way. It often depends on the original structure of the body, so that it can be corrected neither by regimen nor medicines of any kind. A different degree of strength also accompanies the different ages of mankind; and thus, in some cases, debility cannot be reckoned morbid. But a truly morbid and unusual debility arises from the nervous energy being diminished; from diseases of the brain and nerves, or of the muscles through which they are distributed; from a decay of the nerves themselves; from a want of the due tension of the fibres, or the fibres themselves becoming torpid; from the body exhausted by spare diet, want, evacuations; or lastly, from diseases affecting the whole body, or some particular parts of it.\n\nThe highest degree of debility, namely, when the strength of the muscles is altogether or nearly destroyed—Palpitated, is called paralysis or palsy; and is either universal, or belonging only to some particular muscles. An universal palsy arises from diseases of the brain and nerves, sometimes very obscure, and not to be discovered by the anatomist; for the nervous power itself is often deficient, even when the structure of the nerves remains unharmed; yet often a compression, obstruction, or injury of the vessels, extravasation of blood, or serum, collections of pus, swellings, &c., are discovered. It frequently arises from certain poisons acting on the nerves; from the fumes of metals; from the diseases of parts, and affections of the muscles, very remote from the brain, as in the colic of Poitou. A palsy of single muscles, but less perfect, often arises without any defect of the brain or nerves, from any violent and continued pain, inflammation, too great tension, relaxation, rest, or destruction of the texture of the parts, such as commonly happens after the rheumatism, gout, luxations, fractures of the bones, and itchuria.\n\nAn universal palsy, however, as it is called, seldom affects the whole body, even though it should originate from a disease of the brain. We most commonly see those who are paralytic affected only on one side, which is called an hemiplegia. It is said that the side of the body opposite to the diseased side of the brain is most commonly affected. If all the parts below the head become paralytic, it is called a paraplegia. In these diseases the senses for the most part remain; though sometimes they are abolished, and at others rendered dull. Sometimes, though rarely, and which is an exceeding bad symptom, the motion, sensation, pulse, and heat of the paralytic limbs are lost; in which case the arteries themselves become paralytic. A palsy of the whole body, as far as regards the voluntary motions, with anesthesia and sleep, is called an apoplexy. This proceeds from some injury of the brain; though a state very similar to it is induced by narcotics, opium, wine itself, or any generous liquor taken to excess; and lastly, by breathing in air corrupted by noxious impregnations, such as a large proportion of carbonic acid, hydrogenous gas, or similar active aeriform fluids.\n\nAnother disease to which muscular motion is liable, spasms, and that neither slight nor unfrequent, is called spasms. This is a violent and irregular motion of the muscles. Of spasms there are two kinds, the tonic and clonic. The latter is frequently called a convulsion; in order to distinguish it from the other, which is more peculiarly called spasms.\n\nSpasm therefore is a violent, constant, and preternatural contraction of the muscular fibres; but a convulsion is an unusual and violent contraction alternated with relaxation. People are rendered liable to spasms by too sensible a habit of body, or too great mobility; and hence it is a disease common in women, in infants, and in weak, luxurious, lazy, and plethoric people. It is brought on those already predisposed to it, by any kind of stimulus applied to the brain, or to any nerve, muscle, or nervous part connected with it.\nof which we have examples in dentition; worms lodged in the intestines, and irritating them; any acid matter infecting the blood, or much affecting the stomach and intestines; the irritation of any nerve, or of the brain itself, by an exfoliation, swelling, too great fulness of the vessels, pain, vehement affections of the mind, sudden evacuation, or poisons admitted into the body. Frequently, however, the malady originates from slight causes, little known, and not easily observed.\n\nSpasm is both the cause and effect, and frequently constitutes the greatest part, of many diseases. It is often very difficult either to be known or cured; because it is so multiform, and produces as many different symptoms as there are organs affected; of which it surprisingly disturbs, impedes, or increases the functions. It is a disease seated in the original stamina of the constitution; and neither to be removed by slight remedies, nor in a short time.\n\nWith regard to sleep, its use is sufficiently apparent from the effects which it produces in the body. It restores the powers both of mind and body when exhausted by exercise, giving vigour to the one, and restoring its wonted alacrity to the other. It renders the muscles again active and moveable, after they have become wearied, rigid, painful, and trembling by hard labour. It moderates the quickness of the pulse, which usually increases at night, and brings it back to its morning standard. It lessens also to allit the digestion of the aliment; lessens both the secretions and excretions; and renders the fluids thicker than otherwise they would be, especially in a body endowed with much flexibility or mobility. Hence sleep is not only useful, but absolutely necessary for preserving life and health; and is a most excellent remedy both for alleviating, and totally removing, many diseases.\n\nWant of sleep is hurtful in many different ways, especially to the nervous system. It renders the organs of sense both external and internal, as well as those of every kind of motion, unfit for performing their offices. Hence the sensations are either abolished, or become imperfect or depraved; and hence imbecility of mind, defect of memory, a kind of delirium, mania itself, pain of the head, weakness of the joints, an imperfect or inordinate action of the vital organs, quickness of pulse, heat, fever, depraved digestion, atrophy, lameness, and an increase or perturbation of the secretions and excretions.\n\nSleep may be prevented both in healthy and sick people from various causes; such as strong light, noise, pain, anger, joy, grief, fear, anxiety, hunger, thirst, vehement desire, motion of the body, memory, imagination, intense thought, &c. On the other hand, sleep is brought on by a slight impression on the organs of sense, or none at all; by the humming of bees, the noise of falling water, cold and insipid discourse; or lastly, by such an exercise of the memory as is neither too laborious nor disturbing to the mind.—Too great an impulse of the blood towards the head, such as often happens in fevers, prevents sleep; but a free and equal distribution of the blood through the whole body, especially the extreme parts, frequently brings it on. Whatever weakens the body also favours sleep; and hence various kinds of evacuations, the warm bath, fomentations, sometimes heat itself, are useful for promoting it. It also comes on easily after taking food, or indulging venery; the violent sensation being then quieted, and the body itself somewhat weakened. Cold produces a deep sleep of long continuance, not easily disturbed, and often terminating in death. Lastly, There are certain substances which, when applied to the body, not only do not excite the nervous system, but plainly lay us asleep, and render us unfit for sensation; of this kind are those called narcotics, as opium and the like, among which also we may reckon wine taken in too great quantity. Lastly, Watching itself is often the cause of sleep; because while a man is awake he always more or less exercises the organs of his body, by which the nervous influence is diminished, and thus the more violently the body is exercised, in the same proportion is the person under a necessity of sleeping.\n\nSleep is deficient in many diseases; for there are few which do not excite pain, anxiety, or uneasiness, sufficient to prevent the approach of sleep, or to disturb it. Fevers generally cause those who labour under them to sleep ill; as well on account of the uneasiness which accompanies this kind of disease, as by reason of the impetus of the blood towards the head being frequently increased; and likewise from the stomach being disordered, loaded with meat, or distended with drink. Hence also we may see the reason why many hypochondriac and hysteric patients sleep so ill; because they have a bad digestion, and their stomach is disposed to receive many though frequently slight disorders; the flightiest of which, however, is sufficient to deprive the patient of rest, provided the body be already irritable, and endowed with too great a share of mobility.\n\nWant of sleep will hurt in diseases as well as in health; and for the same reason; but in a greater degree, and more quickly, in the former than in the latter; and is therefore not only a very troublesome symptom of itself, but often produces other very dangerous ones.\n\nToo much sleep, on the other hand, produces many mischiefs, rendering the whole body languid, torpid, and lazy; and it even almost takes away the judgement. It also disturbs the circulation, and diminishes most of the secretions and excretions. Hence plethora, fatness, flaccidity, and an inability for the common offices of life.—The causes of this excess are, either the usual causes of sleep above mentioned increased beyond measure, or some fault in the brain, or a compulsion of it by an extravasation of the humours; or sometimes, as it would seem, from great debility produced by an unusual cause, as in those who are recovering from typhus fevers and other diseases. In these examples, however, this excess of sleep is by no means hurtful; nor even, perhaps, in those cases where an excess of grief continued for a long time, or a great fright, have produced a surprising and unexpected composure. Lastly, Many people have accustomed themselves, and that not without a great deal of hurt to their constitutions, to sleep too much. Nor are there examples wanting of some who have passed whole days, and even months, in sleep almost uninterrupted.\n\nWith regard to the manner in which the circulation of the blood is performed, and the various principles on which it is composed, see the articles Blood, and Anatomy. As for the disorders to which the blood and its circulation are subject, it has been observed,\nDisorders that in our younger years the veins are much more dense, firm, and strong, than the arteries; but the latter, by reason of the continual pressure upon them, and the strength which they exert, become daily more firm, hard, and strong, until at last they equal or exceed the veins themselves in strength; and it is not uncommon in old men to find some part of the arteries converted into an horny substance, or even into a solid bone. Hence in the state of infancy the greatest part of the blood is contained in the arteries, and in old age in the veins; an affair indeed of no small moment, as it shows the reason, in some measure, of the state of increase and decrease of the body. Besides, if any disease happens from too great a quantity of blood, it thence appears that it must show itself in young subjects in the arteries, and in old ones in the veins; and this is the reason of many diseases which accompany certain periods of life.\n\nIn most, if not in all species of animals, the arteries of the females are much more lax and capacious when compared with the veins, and the veins much less, than in the males of the same genus. The design of nature in this conformation, is probably that they may be the better able to nourish the fetus in their womb. The same likewise seems to be the reason why women are more inclined to plethora than men; and to this greater capacity of the arteries and smallness of the veins are we to attribute that beauty and elegant shape of the arms in women, not disfigured or livid with veins as in men.\n\nThe blood is also distributed in various proportions to the different parts of the body, and that proportion too differs at different periods of our lives. At first a great quantity is sent to the head, because that part of the body is first to be evolved and fitted for its offices: but as soon as the parts begin to make a considerable resistance to the efforts of the blood, and the vessels cannot easily be further dilated, it is necessarily sent off to other parts; by which means the rest of the body increases in bulk, and becomes fitted for performing its proper functions. The effect of this change is also very soon observed, namely, when none of the blood passes through the navel, and of consequence a greater quantity is sent by the iliac arteries to the inferior extremities. These, though so small and slender in the fetus, increase very suddenly; so that often in not many months the child can not only stand on its feet, but even walk tolerably well. And during the earliest periods of infancy, the inferior extremities grow more rapidly than any other part of the body.\n\nPhysicians are wont to judge of the state of the circulation by the pulse, which indeed is very various, as well with regard to its frequency, as to the strength and equality of its strokes and intervals.—Its common quickness in a healthy adult is about 70 strokes in a minute. In a fetus, perhaps, it is more than double; and in an infant a few months old, hardly less than 120. As we grow up, this quickness gradually diminishes; so that in extreme old age it sometimes does not exceed 50, or is even slower. This rule, however, is not without exceptions: for many, especially those of an irritable habit, have the pulse much quicker; while others, even in the vigour of their age, have their pulse remarkably slow. It is for the most part somewhat quicker in women than in men.\n\nThe pulse is also rendered quicker, both in a healthy and diseased body, by the application of stimuli of many different kinds. Exercise especially, by accelerating the return of the blood through the veins, increases the quickness of the pulse to a surprising degree. Various kinds of irritations affecting the nervous system, as intense thinking, passions of the mind, pain, heat, stimulating medicines, wine, spices, &c., likewise produce the same effect. The acrimony of the blood itself also is thought to quicken the pulse.\n\nWhen a person first awakes in the morning, the pulse is slow, but becomes quicker by degrees on account of the many irritating matters applied to the body. Its quickness is increased after taking food, especially of the animal kind, or such as is hot or seasoned with spices. In the evening a flight fever comes on, for which rest and sleep are the remedy. These things, however, are scarcely to be observed in a healthy person, but are very evident in one that is feverish, especially when the fever is a hectic.—Again, even debility itself often renders the pulse quicker than usual; because the ventricle of the heart not being quite emptied, it is the sooner dilated again, and of consequence contracts the sooner. For this reason a physician can never judge of the strength of the circulation from the frequency of the pulse.\n\nLastly, in all fevers, however different from one another, the pulse is found to be too quick, partly perhaps from debility, partly from the acrimony of the fluids, and partly from the repulsion of the blood from the surface of the body, and the accumulation of it in the large vessels where it acts as a stimulus; though it must be owned, that a great deal of this is obscure, if not totally unknown; nor in truth are we able to understand in what manner the autonomic acts with regard to the frequency of the pulse.\n\nThe pulse is seldom observed too slow, unless when the mobility of the body is much diminished, as in decrepid old age, or from a compression or disease of the brain, as is exemplified in the second stage of hydrocephalus; but a greater compression of the brain usually produces a still more remarkable slowness of the pulse, as in the third stage of hydrocephalus.—Sometimes also the pulse is too slow in those who are recovering from tedious fevers. But this is a matter of little moment, and seems to be owing to some kind of torpor. Indeed it has generally been considered as a mark of a thorough and complete solution of the fever; for it is commonly observed, that when this state of the pulse takes place, the patient seldom suffers a relapse.\n\nWhile the frequency of the pulse continues the same, its strokes may be either full, great, strong, and hard; or soft, small, and weak. A full, great, and strong pulse takes place when the ventricle strongly and completely empties itself; throwing out a great quantity of blood into the arteries, which fully distends them and stimulates them to a strong contraction. A pulse of this kind is common in strong healthy men, and is seldom to be accounted a symptom of disease. But if it be too strong, and strike the finger of the person who feels it violently and sharply, it is called a hard pulse. This hardness is produced by a sudden and violent contraction of the heart and arteries, which distends even the remote branches, as those of the wrist, too suddenly and\nA hard pulse therefore denotes too great an action of the heart and arteries. It may arise from various causes: in the first place, from too great a tension of the vessels; for instance, from their being too full, and by that means more prone to motion, and the more fit for receiving violent motions. It may arise also from too great a density and firmness of the solids; and hence it is most frequent in cold countries, among strong robust people, and such as are accustomed to hard labour. It may likewise arise from various causes irritating the whole nervous system, or only the heart and arteries. Lastly, it accompanies many fevers, as well as most inflammatory disorders, whether the inflammation arises from a general stimulus applied to the whole body, or from the irritation of particular parts, by degrees extended over the whole body. In such a state of the circulation, the patient frequently stands in need of blood-letting, and almost always bears it well.\n\nA small, weak, and soft pulse is generally owing to causes opposite to the former, and indicates a contrary state of the circulation and nervous system. It frequently requires stimulants; nor does it generally require blood-letting, or easily bear it. Sometimes, however, a pulse of this kind is observed even in the case of a dangerous inflammation, of the stomach for instance, or intestines. But in these and the like examples we ought to attend to the nature of the malady, much more than to the state of the pulse.\n\nThe pulse is said to intermit, when the stroke does not return after the usual interval, and perhaps not till after twice, thrice, or four times the usual space. A pulse of this kind seems to be almost natural and constant in some animals, and is common to some men even in the most perfect health; and if these happen to be seized with a fever, the pulse sometimes becomes regular, nor can the disease be removed before the intermission has returned.\n\nMoreover, in some people, though their pulse beats equally while in health, yet the slightest illness makes it intermit; and in others, especially those who have a great deal of mobility in their constitution, such as hypochondriac and hysterical people, the intermission of the pulse is felt, without applying the finger to the artery, merely by the uneasiness which they perceive in their breasts during those intervals in which the pulse is deficient. An intermittent pulse likewise occurs in many diseases of the breast, especially when water is collected in it; and the like happens in the end of all diseases, especially fevers, when the strength is nearly exhausted, and death approaches, of which it is frequently the forerunner.\n\nAn intermittent pulse therefore seems to arise from an unequal influx of the nervous power into the heart, or from the decay and exhaustion of the nervous power, by which means the heart is not able to contract till it has been dilated beyond its due pitch. Or lastly, it may arise from diseases of the organ itself, or the neighbouring parts; from swellings, water, &c., pressing upon them, and impeding the action of the heart: which indeed is a very dangerous disorder, and almost always mortal.\n\nMany other variations of the pulse are enumerated by physicians, but most of them are uncertain, and not confirmed by experience. We shall therefore now consider the motion of the blood, which may be either too great, too small, or irregular.\n\nA quick pulse, *exercit paribus*, produces a more rapid circulation, because the sooner that the ventricle of the heart is emptied, the more quickly is the blood thrown into the arteries; and their actions must answer to this stronger stimulus. Hence exercise, heat, stimulants, plethora, every kind of irritation, passions of the mind, and fever, increase the circulation. The effect of this increase is a diffusion of the vessels, a stimulus applied to the whole body, an increase of heat, and often a debility. The secretion of sweat is increased while the other secretions are diminished, and the various functions of the body impeded; thirst comes on, the appetite is lost, the fat consumed, and a disposition to putrefaction introduced. Sometimes the smaller vessels are burst; whence effusions of blood and hemorrhages. But we are by no means to forget, that this violent motion of the blood, however hurtful it may seem, is among the best remedies made use of by nature in curing many diseases.\n\nThe motion of the blood is diminished, especially by debility, torpor, the want of irritation or of exercise: the same thing happens to all the fluids, if there be any obstruction in the vessels, or any cause by which their return is hindered or rendered more difficult. Thus, from the very weight of the blood itself, if a person has stood long on his feet, the humours return more slowly from the inferior extremities. Any disease of the heart and arteries also, as an aneurism, contraction, obfiscation, must necessarily obstruct the circulation. The same thing happens from obstructions of the veins, or interrupted respiration, by which the pallage of the blood through the lungs to the left side of the heart is impeded.\n\nBut, from whatever cause this diminution of the circulation takes place, the bad consequences are perceived chiefly in the veins, because in them the blood always moves more slowly than in the arteries. Hence varices, and congestions of blood, especially in those parts of the body where the veins are destitute of valves, and of consequence where the motion of the muscles cannot assist the circulation. Hence also arise dropsies from an impeded or languid motion of the blood; because the resistance of the veins being increased, the blood is received into them with the greater difficulty, and more of the thin humour is driven into the exhaling vessels, and by them deposited in such quantities as cannot be reabsorbed by the lymphatics. These diseases, as well as all others proceeding from defects of the circulation, are also more difficult of cure than others, because all the vital powers are weakened at the same time.\n\nAnother disorder of the circulation is where the blood is carried to one part of the body in too great quantity, by which means the other parts are deprived of their due proportion. This irregular distribution of the vital fluid frequently arises from a stimulus applied to the part itself, or to the brain, or at length acting on the mind, which, according to the laws of sympathy, produces a certain definite distribution of the\nDisorders of the blood. It arises also not unfrequently from a spasm taking place in some other parts, which drives the blood out of its ordinary course.\n\nIn proportion to this irregularity of the circulation are the consequences; heat, swelling, redness, inflammation, rupture of vessels, hemorrhages, effusions, destruction, corruption, and suppuration of the cellular texture and adjoining parts, &c. Even this evil, however, nature often converts into an excellent remedy; and physicians, following her steps, frequently attempt to direct the distribution of the blood in particular diseases, well knowing that a change in the distribution of the blood is frequently efficacious either for radically curing some diseases, or relieving their most urgent symptoms.\n\nPalpitation. Lastly, some disorders in the motion of the heart itself, and those of no small consequence, remain yet to be taken notice of, namely, palpitation and syncope.\n\nA palpitation is a violent and irregular action of the heart, such as for the most part is perceived by the patient himself, and that not without a great deal of uneasiness and oppression at his breast; and it is also manifest to the bystanders, if they apply their hands, or look at his naked breast; the pulse of the arteries in the mean time being weak, unequal, and intermittent. This is a spasmodic disorder; and is induced by various causes affecting either the nervous system in general, or the heart in particular. Every disease of the organ itself, such as a contraction of its valves and blood-vessels, an ossification, enlargement, or polyposis, hindering the free action of the heart, and evacuation of blood from it, are capable of exciting it to violent and unusual contractions. The same effect will also follow plethora, or too violent an impulse of the blood. The heart will likewise frequently palpitate from a violent excitement of the nervous system, especially where the constitution is endowed with a great deal of mobility. Hence palpitations arise from any affection of the mind, and in hysterical women. Palpitation may likewise arise from an affection of the stomach, occasioned by worms, a surfeit, flatus, or stimulation by various acid substances. It frequently also accompanies the gout when repelled, or even when a fit is coming on. Sometimes it arises from debility, whatever may be the cause; frequently from any difficulty in breathing; and many of these causes may be joined at the same time, or some of them produce others.\n\nHence we may see why the evil is sometimes slight and of short continuance; at other times altogether incurable, and certainly mortal in a longer or shorter time; why it sometimes returns at intervals, often coming on and being increased by every kind of irritation and exercise, and sometimes relieved or totally removed by stimulants or exercise.\n\nA syncope takes place when the action of the heart, and along with it that of the arteries, is suddenly and very much lessened; whence the animal powers, the senses, and voluntary motions, immediately cease. This may be produced by almost all the causes of palpitation; because whatever can disturb and disorder the motion of the heart, may also weaken or suspend it. The vitiated structure of the heart itself therefore, violent passions of the mind, whether of the depressing kind, or those which suddenly and vehemently excite, various kinds of nervous diseases, those of the stomach, every kind of debility and evacuation, especially a great loss of blood, excessive and unremitting labour, long watching, heat, pain, many kinds of poisons, &c., produce fainting.\n\nHence we see, that whatever weakens the motion of the blood through the brain tends to produce fainting; and, on the contrary, whatever tends to augment that motion, also tends to refresh, and to prevent the person from fainting. Hence also we see how the mere posture of the body may either bring on or keep off fainting, or remove it after it has already come on. We likewise see how this disorder may sometimes be of little consequence and easily removed; at others very dangerous, not only as a symptom, but even of itself, as sometimes terminating in death; and lastly, how it may be used as a remedy by a skilful physician, and artificially induced, either to free the patient from violent pain, or to stop an immoderate effusion of blood scarce to be restrained by any other method.\n\nWith regard to the disorders of the blood itself, the buff-coloured crusty part of it, or, more properly, its fibrine separated from the red particles, produces that buff-coloured appearance often seen upon blood drawn from people afflicted with inflammatory disorders, and even sometimes when no such diseases are present. This crust indeed is nothing else than the fibrine of the blood taking longer time than usual to coagulate, by which means the red particles have an opportunity of falling to the bottom. This indicates no lento, density, thickness, or tenacity of the blood, as was formerly thought; but rather its thinness, or at least a less tendency in it to coagulate. It arises for the most part from a violent agitation and conglutination of the blood within the body; and hence it accompanies many fevers, all inflammations, sometimes hemorrhages, exanthemata, plethora, pain, and many irritations. It must, however, be allowed, that in several of these diseases it is rendered highly probable at least, from experiments apparently accurate, that the quantity of the fibrine of the blood is really increased in the proportion which it bears to the other parts. This crust, however, is not always to be accounted morbid, as it often happens to the most healthy; and may even be produced or destroyed by the slightest causes while the blood is running from the vein, so that frequently we shall see a very thick and tenacious crust on the blood flowing into one cup, while that which runs into another has little or none at all. In general, however, the appearance of this crust shows, that the patient will bear blood-letting well, though those have been in a great mistake who have directed this operation to be repeated till no more crust appeared on the blood.\n\nThe coagulable part of the blood also frequently produces those masses called polypi, which sometimes take place during life, but more frequently after death, in the large vessels near the heart, or even in the cavities of that organ. Similar masses also are frequently formed in the uterus, and are called moles.\n\nThe quantity of blood contained in a healthy body is very various, and difficult to be ascertained. Many diseases, however, may arise from its being either too scanty or too abundant. Too great a quantity of blood is produced by the use of rich, nourishing diet, strong drink, accompanied with a good digestion; from a lazy, sedentary life, or much sleep, especially in\nDisorders in those who have been formerly accustomed to much of the exercise; with many other causes of the same kind.\n\nIt renders the person dull and languid, and sometimes almost totally oppresses him; nor are those organs destined for moving the blood sufficient for driving forward such a load. The pulse sinks; and sometimes a syncope, vertigo, or palpitation takes place. More frequently, however, the vessels are too much distended, and ready to be thrown into violent and irregular motions. Hence a disposition to fevers, inflammations, an unequal distribution of the blood, unusual congestions, rupture of the vessels, and hemorrhages. Besides this, in consequence of the close connection between the sanguiferous and the nervous system, a fulness of blood produces a disposition to spasm and other diseases of that kind.\n\nHence we may understand why a plethora is sometimes accompanied with a weak and sometimes with a strong and hard pulse, why it is the cause as well as a part of so many distempers, why it is the effect of a high state of health, &c.\n\nThe want of a due quantity of blood is no less pernicious than too great an abundance of it. It debilitates the person, and renders him unable to perform the proper duties of life; produces a languid circulation, syncope, spasms, and at last death itself. In a lighter degree of the disease the body is emaciated through want of nourishment, and its functions are vitiated in various ways. It may arise from want, bad food, or such as affords little nourishment: from bad digestion, or the chyle being hindered from passing into the blood; from fevers, or other diseases which exhaust the body and hinder nutrition: or lastly, from various evacuations, particularly of blood; and that the more especially if they are sudden, for in slow evacuations the vessels accommodate themselves surprisingly to the quantity left in them. Besides, if the body be slowly exhausted, the evacuations are lessened by reason of the deficiency of the vital power; so that the unusual expense is easily compensated by the unusual retention. But if the evacuation happens to be very sudden and great, it may either prove mortal in a short time, or break the constitution to a degree beyond recovery.\n\nBy a great and long-continued deficiency of blood the quality of it also is impaired; because the thin part of it is easily and soon made up; but the glutinous, and red part, not so easily. Hence the blood becomes thin, pale, scarcely capable of coagulation, or of affording a proper support to the body. Too great thinness of the blood also proceeds from using much drink, especially of the aqueous kind, slender and unnutritious diet, a bad digestion in the stomach; from diseases of the lungs and those organs which elaborate the red part; or from suppression of the usual evacuations of thin humours, as sweat or urine, induced by cold, a fault of the secreting organs, or from putrefaction. But along with this, other disorders of the blood concur.\n\nA too thin and watery blood makes the face pale, the body weak and languid. The solid parts become flaccid from want of nourishment, and having too great a quantity of water in their composition. It brings on hydropic effusions of water in all parts of the body, by reason of the increased exhalation of that thin fluid which moistens all the inward parts; partly by reason of the vessels being relaxed beyond their usual pitch, and not making a proper resistance. Besides, in this case, the lymphatics are so far from absorbing more than usual, that, partaking likewise of the general debility, they are scarcely fitted for performing their proper offices.\n\nNature, however, has taken care, by the most simple means, to provide against so many and so great evils; for neither does the blood so easily become thin as some have imagined, nor when this quality takes place does it want a proper remedy. For almost instantly, if the person be otherwise in health, the excretions of watery matters are greatly augmented, and the whole mass of blood in a short time becomes as thick as formerly.\n\nThe opposite to this, namely, too great a thickness of the blood, though often spoken of by physicians, is very rarely if ever observed; and those fevers and inflammations which have been thought to arise from thence, are now found to originate from other causes. The following would seem to be the law of the human constitution. As soon as the blood has attained the due degree of thickness, or gone in the least beyond it, the excretions are either suppressed or diminished, the body attracts more moisture from the air, the person is thirsty, and drinks as much as is necessary for diluting the blood. But if water be wanting, and the person cannot satisfy his thirst, then the blood is so far from being thickened, that by reason of putrefaction begun or augmented, it is much dissolved, becomes acrid, and is with difficulty contained in the vessels.\n\nThe acrimony of the fluids has afforded a large field for declamation to speculative physicians, and upon this slender foundation many perplexed and intricate theories have been built. It is certain indeed, that the blood in a state of health has some small share of acrimony; and this acrimony, from certain causes, may be a little increased so as to produce various diseases of a dangerous nature. This we are assured of from the increase of motion in the heart and arteries, and the similar augmentation of the action of the secretory organs, when certain acid substances are taken inwardly. The same thing also appears from the unusual acrimony of the secreted fluids in such cases, by which the vessels are sometimes greatly stimulated, and sometimes even quite eroded. Very many acrid substances, however, are daily taken into the stomach; so that these must either be corrected in the prime vice, or changed by digestion before they pass into the blood; or at least by dilution with much water, or being blunted by an admixture with gluten, oil, or different gases, they must deposit much of their acrimony, and at last be thrown out of the body as noxious substances. Thus a vast quantity of salts, acid, alkaline, and neutral, may pass through the body, without in the least affecting the health; though these salts, if taken in very large quantity, undiluted, or not thrown out of the body, will do much hurt.\n\nMoreover, even while life continues, putrefaction is going on, and produces much of that substance called animal salt; for into this a great part of our food is converted, and passes off by the urine. But if this putrefactive disposition be too great, it will produce too large a quantity of animal salt; especially if much of any saline substance is otherwise thrown into the body without.\nDiforders without proper dilution; and this kind of disease is well known to sailors who have been long at sea without having an opportunity of getting fresh provisions.\n\nFor this spontaneous putrefaction, nature has suggested a proper remedy, namely, fresh meat, especially of the vegetable and acefcent kind, and such as is much impregnated with acid, which it may impart to the body. But where this kind of food is wanting, the putrefaction goes on apace, and a very great thinness and acrimony of the juices take place; especially if there be also a scarcity of urine, or the excretions which ought to carry the putrid matters out of the body languish, either from cold, sloth, torpor, depressing passions of the mind, or from the constitution being broken by diseases; or lastly, from too great heat, which always favours putrefaction.\n\nBesides, it would seem, that sometimes a disposition to putrefaction is much increased by the reception of a putrid ferment into the body; of which we have examples in some infectious fevers, where the contagion is very much assisted by heat, animal diet, certain kinds of salts, debility and nausines.\n\nLastly, Any single part of the body may putrefy from various causes, as from inflammation, cold, &c., and thus may the whole body be infected; although for the most part the disease proves fatal before the corruption has spread over the whole body.\n\nBut when the mass of blood begins to putrefy greatly, it not only becomes very acid, but thin also, so that it either will not coagulate at all, or shows only a slight and very loose clathramentum. Nay, even the red globules are broken down and destroyed; in which case it necessarily follows, that the blood must become very acid, as well on account of the evolution of the salts, as by reason of the rancid and putrid gluten, which stimulates, and frequently even erodes, the vessels; producing spots, first red, then livid and black, tumors, and ulcers scarce possible to be cured, without first removing the putrefactive disposition of the humours. From the same causes proceed hemorrhages from every part of the body, hardly to be restrained; a most intolerable fetor of the breath and all the excrements; the highest debility and laxity of the solids; the putrefaction acting as a poison to the nervous system, and at length bringing on death.\n\nAn acrimony of the acid kind never takes place in the human blood, nor in any of the humours secreted from it; though one of them, namely the milk, turns acid spontaneously in a very short time after it is drawn from the breast. Neither does an alkaline acrimony seem ever to take place in the blood. Putrefaction indeed tends this way, and at last terminates in it; but scarcely while the person lives, though the nature of the urine, even while recent, seems to be but little distant from that of an alkali.\n\nMany kinds of acrimony may exist in the blood from too liberal an use of spices, wine, spirits, &c., but of these we know nothing certain. We well know, however, that the body is often infected with various kinds of morbid acrimony, which bring on many and dangerous diseases, as the small-pox, measles, cancers, lues venerea, &c., of which the origin and manner of acting are very little understood, though the effects are abundantly evident. In most cases, nature has taken no less care to provide against the acrimony than against the too great viscidity of the blood. Sometimes an antidote is afforded, either by the excitement of thirst, that the acid substance may be diluted with plenty of drink; or by increasing the evacuations, that it may be thrown out of the body; or lastly, by exciting various motions and actions of the vital powers, by which it may be either subdued, changed, rendered innocent, or expelled from the body by new and wonted paffages.\n\nWith regard to respiration, it may be obstructed from various causes seated either in the lungs themselves or the surrounding parts. But from whatever cause this obstruction may arise, it undoubtedly produces all those diseases which proceed from an interrupted circulation. The lungs themselves also being at length compressed, and not suffered to dilate sufficiently, cannot throw off the vapour which arises from them; and hence they are frequently oppressed with moisture. At the same time they are irritated, so that a greater quantity of mucus, and that of a thicker kind than usual, is secreted; by which means the passages through which the air enters them are flopped up, till a violent cough at length throws off the load.\n\nThe respiration is also subjected to some other disorders, as a cough and sneezing; which, though at first sight they may seem very dangerous, are not destitute of use, and may even be reckoned among the most salutary attempts of nature to relieve the patient. Often, however, they are attended with danger, or very great uneasiness; namely, when they are either too violent or exerted in vain. At any rate, it is necessary for a physician to know the nature, causes, and effects of these, that he may be enabled to promote them when necessary, to moderate them when too violent, and to stop them when noxious or of no use.\n\nA cough is a violent, frequently involuntary, and coughorous expiration, suddenly expelling the air with great force through the glottis somewhat contracted. The convulsion of the muscles serving for expiration, gives a great force to the air, while the contraction of the glottis produces the sound. It is often long continued, being repeated at certain intervals, during each of which the inspiration is imperfect and obstructed by reason of the contraction of the glottis. It is excited by any kind of acid substance, either chemically or mechanically applied to those passages through which the air enters. These are lined with a membrane so exceedingly delicate and impatient of stimulus, that it cannot even bear the touch of the mildest substance, such as a small drop of water, without throwing the muscles serving for expiration into a violent convulsion; the glottis at the same time contracting by means of the sympathy between it and the neighbouring parts. Thus the air is thrown out with such violence, that it drives the irritating substance along with it; and thus a cough becomes not only useful, but absolutely necessary for the preservation of life, as being able to free the lungs from every kind of irritating substance or foulness, which might soon bring on a suffocation. Hence a cough is almost an inseparable companion of every inflammation of the lungs, as well as every difficulty in respiration; and even frequently accompanies the entrance of the purest air when the trachga\nThe last affections of which we shall here speak, are those arising from a bad digestion, disordered motion of the intestines, and some of the principal secretions. The first of these are sometimes very troublesome, though seldom dangerous. The principal symptoms are oppression, anxiety, pain at the stomach; eruptions, by reason of air extracted from the fermenting alimentments, and irritating the stomach; nausea and vomiting, from the irritation and distention of the same organ; the belly sometimes too colicive, and sometimes too loose; a defect of nourishment; a general debility; relaxation of the solid parts; too great thinness of the fluids; all the functions impeded; pain of the head; vertigo, syncope, asthma, palpitation; great sinking of the spirits, especially if the patient has been of a peculiar constitution; sometimes the gout, sometimes a dropy, or a slow fever which may prove fatal.\n\nThe motion of the intestines may be either too great or too little; and hence proceeds either coliciveness or loofeness. The former is frequently not to be accounted morbid; but, when it is, it may arise from the structure of the intestines being injured, or from their being shut up or obstructed by spasm or otherwise, or from a deficiency of those humours which moisten the intestines; or it may arise from mere debility, from a palsy of the fibres, perhaps, or from a deficiency of the usual stimulus, of the bile, for instance, or from too dry or slender a diet.\n\nThe consequences of long-continued coliciveness, are, first, an affection of the alimentary canal, and then of the whole body. The stomach is diseased, and does not digest the aliments properly; the whole body is left destitute of its usual stimulus; the blood is corrupted, perhaps from the reversion of the putrid matter into it. The circulation through the abdominal viscera is impeded; hence frequent and irregular congestions, varices of the veins, hemorrhoids, &c. Nay, the intestines themselves being overloaded, distended and irritated by a heavy, acrid, and putrid load of aliment or other matters, are excited to new and unusual contractions, which, if they do not get the better of the obstruction, bring on torments, colic, or an iliac passion, inflammation and gangrene, fatal in a very short time.\n\nLoofeness, or diarrhoea, is a malady extremely common; being sometimes a primary disease, and sometimes only a symptom or an effect of others. Sometimes it is a salutary effect of nature, such as the physician ought to imitate and bring on by art. It is also familiar to infants, and to people of a certain constitution; and to them loofeness is very prejudicial. It may arise, in the first place, from something taken into the body, or generated in the intestines; from a fermentation and corruption of the maws of aliments; from the bile being too abundant and acrid, or from blood or pus poured into the intestines; from the intestines themselves being eroded, or deprived of their natural mucus; from the humours being driven from the surface of the body towards the inward parts, as by cold, especially when applied to the feet; or from a general corruption of the whole body, as in the phthisis, hectic, or putrid fever, especially towards the end of these disorders. In fevers it is sometimes salutary, or even puts an end to the disease altogether, or\nDisorders at least renders it milder; more frequently, however, deriving its origin from putrefaction, it is of no service, but rather exhausts the strength of the patient.\n\nA diarrhoea likewise, almost incurable, and often fatal in a short time, frequently arises after the operation for the fistula in ano. Some have their intestines so extremely weak and moveable, that from the slightest cause, such as catching cold, any violent commotion of the mind, &c., they are subject to a violent diarrhoea. Lastly, whatever be its origin, if it has continued for a long time, the viscera are rendered so weak and irritable, that the disease, though often removed, still returns from the slightest causes, and even such as are not easily discovered.\n\nA diarrhoea proves very pernicious, by hindering digestion and the nourishment of the body; for the stomach is commonly affected, and the aliments pass through the intestines so quickly, that they can neither be properly digested, nor are the lacteals able to absorb the chyle from them as they go along. Such a violent evacuation is also hurtful by exhausting the body, and carrying off a great quantity of the nutritious matter from the blood. Neither indeed, is it only the alimentary mass which is thrown out sooner than it ought to be; but at the same time, a great quantity of the fluids secreted in the intestines, so that the whole body quickly partakes of the debility.\n\nSometimes a violent and long-continued diarrhoea rises to such a height, that the aliment is discharged with little or no alteration. Sometimes also, though rarely, from a similar cause, or from the obstruction of the melenic glands, and its other passages into the blood, the chyle itself is thrown out like milk along with the excrements; and this disease is called the fluxus calicus.\n\nDysentery. A dysentery is attended with very severe gripes in the belly, a frequent desire of going to stool, and vain efforts, when nothing is excreted besides the mucus of the intestines mixed with a little blood; it is also accompanied with excessive debility, and frequently with putrefaction and fever. It is thought to arise from the contraction of some part of the intestines, of the colon especially; by which means the bowels, though ever so much irritated, can pass nothing; neither can the disease be removed, until the belly has been well purged by proper medicines.\n\nA tenesmus is a frequent and insatiable propensity to stool, without being able to pass anything, notwithstanding the most violent efforts. It may be occasioned by any kind of irritation, either of the rectum itself or of the neighbouring parts, by acrid substances taken into the body; by some of the stronger purges, especially aloes, a substance very difficult of solution, which will pass even to the rectum with very little alteration; by a violent and obstinate diarrhoea, dysentery, haemorrhoids, worms, fistula, calculus, ulcer in the bladder, urethra, &c. It is often very pernicious, both from the excessive uneasiness it occasions to the patient, and from its exhausting his strength, by the frequent and vain efforts bringing on a prolapsus ani, and communicating the violent irritation to the neighbouring parts, as the bladder, &c.\n\nA nausea and vomiting are disorders very common, and owing to almost innumerable causes; not only to affections of the stomach itself, but also to affections and irritations of the remotest parts of the body which may act upon the stomach by sympathy. Every irritation and distention of that viscus therefore, a load of crude aliment, an obstruction about the pylorus, all acrid substances taken into it, diseases of the liver, intestines, kidneys, uterus, the head, the feet, the skin, or indeed the whole body, inflammation, the stone, king's evil, schirrus, apoplexy, compression of the brain, fracture of the skull, vertigo, syncope, violent pain, the gout, especially when repelled, fevers, passions of the mind, disagreeable imaginations or discourses, frequently induce nausea and vomiting.\n\nThese affections are often serviceable by freeing the stomach from something with which it was overloaded; promoting spitting in some cases where the lungs are overcharged with mucus, blood, pus, or water; producing sweat, and a free and proper distribution of blood to the surface of the body; partly, perhaps, by the great straining which accompanies vomiting, but rather by that wonderful sympathy which takes place between the stomach and skin: and hence, in many diseases, vomiting is a most excellent remedy. It is however in some cases hurtful, if too violent or too frequently repeated, partly by debilitating and making the stomach more easily moved; and partly by fatiguing the patient with violent strainings, which occasion hernias, abortions, &c.\n\nSometimes we find the motion of the intestines totally inverted, from the anus to the mouth; a most dangerous distemper, which hath obtained the name of the iliac passion. It most frequently arises from some obstruction in the alimentary canal hindering the descent of the excrements, as schirrus, spasms, inflammation, &c.; though the most perfect iliac passion takes place without any obstruction, so that clitters will be vomited; and even after this has continued for several days, the patients have at length recovered.\n\nA slighter degree of the iliac passion, namely the inversion of the peristaltic motion of the duodenum, always takes place in long-continued and violent vomiting, as in sea-sickness, or when a person has taken too large a dose of an emetic; by which means a vast quantity of bile frequently ascends into the stomach, and is discharged by vomiting.\n\nAn excessive vomiting with looseness is called a cholera, when the matter discharged has a bilious appearance. It arises from a very great irritation of the alimentary canal without any obstruction; and is for the most part occasioned by too great a quantity, or from an acrimony of the bile, from whence it takes its name. It may originate from several causes, as too strong a dose of an emetic and cathartic medicine, eating too great a quantity of summer-fruits, &c., and is a very violent malady, often killing the patient in a few hours, unless proper remedies be applied in time.\n\nFrom a suppression of any of the secretions, or a disordered function of any of the secretory organs, many mischiefs may arise. A diminution of perspiration produces plethora, languor, depression of mind, bad digestion, loss of appetite, and even a general corruption of the humours from the retention of such a quantity of putrefactive matter.—The more suddenly the diminution or suppression of the perspiration takes place,\nTheory.\n\nDisorders place, the sooner the mischief is produced, and the greater it is; not only by retaining the matter which ought to be thrown out, but by repelling the humours from the surface of the body, and directing them to other parts; whence fevers, inflammations, congestions of the blood, &c. frequently take place.\n\nThus suppression of perspiration may arise from many different causes; as from cold suddenly applied to the body when very hot; sometimes from very violent passions of the mind; or from spasmodic diseases, as the hysterics, &c. It may be suppressed also by that kind of constricting of the vessels of the skin which is produced by various kinds of fevers, the nature of which has hitherto been but little known.\n\nExcessive perspiration or sweating is injurious by debilitating the body, relaxing the skin, and exposing the patient to all the evils which arise from catching cold. It may even be carried to such a height as to produce fainting and death; though it must be owned that we cannot easily bring examples of people having, from this cause, their blood insufflated, corrupted, or being thence made liable to inflammations and fevers.\n\nA suppression of urine is still more dangerous than that of perspiration, and unless relieved in a short time will certainly prove fatal. This disorder, which is called dysuria, may arise from various diseases of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, urethra, &c. Thus any obstruction or irritation of one or other of the kidneys or ureters, by a stone, gravel, mucus, blood, inflammations, spasms, suppuration, ichoritus, swellings of the neighbouring parts, &c. may either prevent the urine from being secreted, or may give rise to a scanty or depraved secretion, or, finally, may obstruct its passage into the bladder after it is secreted.\n\nThe urine also, after it has entered the bladder, is there frequently suppressed, by reason of various disorders to which that organ is liable, as an irritation or inflammation, spasm, acid substances injected, or sympathy with the neighbouring parts; or by reason of the texture of the bladder itself being destroyed, or from a palsy, ichoritus, ulcer, &c. in the bladder. Or, lastly, the urine may be retained in the bladder from a general stupor, as from a disease of the brain, which happens in some fevers, when the patient is neither sensible of the usual stimulus, nor even of one much greater, so that the fibres can scarcely be excited to contraction by any means whatever. This, in fevers, is always a bad sign, and sometimes even proves fatal.\n\nA suppression of urine for any length of time produces an immense distention of the bladder, oppression, uneasiness, and pain, not only of the part itself, but of the surrounding ones, and even of the whole body; a spasm, or insuperable constriction of the sphincter; an inflammation, gangrene, or laceration of the bladder itself; a violent irritation of the whole habit; then a nausea, vomiting, vertigo, general languor, and an impregnation of the whole mass of blood with a humour of an urinous nature, which at last being poured out into various cavities of the body, especially of the head, soon brings on a deep sleep, convulsions, and death.\n\nFrom the same causes, but acting with less force, proceeds that disease called dysuria, when the urine passes with difficulty and pain, and is frequently red, black, bloody, purulent, mucous, and sandy; the reason of all which appearances is very much unknown.—The most frequent complaint, however, in making water, is where the patient has a continual and violent desire of passing his urine, while at the same time only two or three drops can be passed at once, and that not without some pain. This may be occasioned even in healthy people, by some acid substance taken into the stomach; and is very common to old people, who are generally subject to disorders of the kidneys and bladder. It arises also frequently from a stone irritating the bladder, or from an inflammation of it, or its being deprived of its mucus, or this last being somehow or other corrupted; or lastly, from certain diseases, or some particular state of the neighbouring parts, as of the uterus, vagina, urethra, prostate gland, &c.\n\nAkin to the strangury is an incontinence of urine, when the patient's water either comes away against his will, or altogether without his knowledge. This disorder may arise from debility, palsy, an ulcer or wound, or any long-continued and violent irritation of the bladder, especially of its sphincter, as from a stone, a general palsy, or in females difficult labour, injuring the neighbouring parts.—This symptom occurs in a great number of diseases, especially in the hydrocephalus.—Sometimes the urine is expelled with violence, either by reason of universal spasms, or by violent contractions of the muscles of respiration, as in sneezing, laughter, &c.\n\nAmong the disorders incident to the urine we may reckon the production of calculi, which frequently bring on the most excruciating and dangerous diseases. The urine, besides the water and salts, contains no small share of the glutinous part of the blood already somewhat corrupted, and still inclined to farther corruption. Hence the urine even of the most healthy person deposits a sediment after it has stood for some time; and though none of this sediment be formed in a healthy body, yet if the smallest particle of foreign matter be introduced into the bladder, a crust soon gathers round it, and it is sure to become the basis of a concretion, which by degrees grows to a very great size. It is not unlikely, also, that some unknown fault of the fluids may contribute to the production of those calculi, as the stone is well known to be an hereditary disease, and to be born with the patient. Calculous persons also are commonly subject to complaints of the stomach, especially to an acidity of it; and many have received no little relief from alkaline or alkaline medicines.—From the same causes may calculi be formed in the kidneys; from which proceed a horrid train of symptoms described in the subsequent part of this treatise.\n\nIt is now found, by accurate experiments of the most able chemists, that urinary calculi do not, as was once supposed, consist almost entirely of an earthy matter. Their principal constituent is a peculiar acid approaching more nearly to the phosphoric acid found in the bones than to any other. But the acid of calculus being in some respects peculiar in its nature, has among modern chemists obtained a peculiar name, and been distinguished by the appellation of the lithic or uric acid. It is highly probable that this acid present in the circulating mass, is precipitated and discharged by the introduction\nintroduction of other acids, and thus thrown off in greater quantities by the kidneys. Thus, then, we can understand the influence of acids as tending to the generation of calculus, and of alkalis as tending to prevent it.\n\nThe last disorder here to be taken notice of is a disorder of the glands themselves, owing to some kind of obstruction, and is one of the most dreadful diseases incident to human nature. Hence happens a great swelling and surprising hardness, not only without pain, but sometimes even with a diminution of sensation in the part affected; and when the gland is thus affected, it is called a schirrus. Sometimes it remains in this state for a long time; but sooner or later produces the most excruciating torment. By degrees it is infected with a slow and malignant suppuration, degenerating into an horrid ulcer, consuming not only the part itself, but eating away the neighbouring ones, and corrupting the whole body with the most acid and incurable poison. This disease is called a cancer, of which the causes are very little known.\n\nOf the organs in both sexes concerned in the function of generation, and of that function as far as we yet know any thing respecting it, an account has already been given in Anatomy; and after what has been said of the different functions, and of the morbid affections, to which these are subjected, we may conclude our remarks on the theory of medicine, with mentioning the remarkable variability of the human constitution; which, more than that of any other animal, is capable of accommodating itself to every climate and to all kinds of diet. Hence we may conclude, that a large proportion of the diseases to which we are subjected are produced by ourselves.\n\nPractice of Medicine, or an Account of the principal Diseases to which the Human Body is subjected.\n\nWE have already defined medicine to be the art of preventing, curing, and alleviating, those diseases to which mankind are subjected. While these affections, however, are in number almost infinite, each in its progress is subjected to almost endless varieties from differences in climate, constitution, treatment, and a variety of other particulars. Hence we may readily explain both the difficulty of distinguishing morbid affections from each other in actual practice, and the diversity of names which have been affixed to them in the writings of ancient physicians. It may readily be supposed, that in this, as well as other subjects, there has been a gradual improvement from the progressive labours of industrious and ingenious men. And although much yet remains to be done in the proper arrangement and definition of diseases, or what has been called methodical nomenclature, yet there cannot be a doubt, that during the course of the 18th century, this subject has received very great improvements. For these, we are, in the first place, highly indebted to the labours of Franciscus Boissier de Sauvages, an eminent professor of medicine at Montpelier, who, following out an idea suggested by the sagacious Dr Sydenham of England, first successfully attempted to arrange diseases, as botanists had done plants, into classes, orders, genera, and species. Since the publication of the Nomenclature Methodica of Sauvages, this subject has been successfully cultivated by several ingenious men, particularly by Sir Charles Linnaeus of Upsal, to whose genius for arrangement every branch of natural history, but botany in particular, has been so highly indebted; by Rudolphus Augustus Vogel, an eminent professor at Gottingen; and by John Baptist Sagar, a distinguished physician at Iglau in Moravia: But of all the systems of arrangement yet presented to the medical world, that published by the late illustrious Dr William Cullen of Edinburgh, may justly be considered as the best. In treating, therefore, of the principal diseases to which the human body is subjected, we shall follow his plan, endeavouring to deliver the best established observations respecting the history, theory, and practice of each. In treating of particular genera of disease, although we follow the arrangement of Dr Cullen, yet for the satisfaction of the reader, we shall often point out the classes to which the same affection is referred by the other eminent writers whom we have mentioned. And on this account, it may not be improper briefly to enumerate the general classes to which each of them have referred the affections of the human body.\n\nThe Classes of Sauvages are,\n\n1.

This disease, in its most regular form, consists of repeated paroxysms, returning every second day, the patient during the intermediate period enjoying apparently a state of good health. This is the most common form of ague, as it is commonly called in Britain. Each paroxysm consists of three parts, the cold, the hot, and the sweating stages. The paroxysm commonly begins with a remarkable shivering, increasing frequently to a convulsive shaking of the limbs. The extremities are always cold, sometimes remarkably so. The cold for the most part is first perceived about the lumbar regions, from thence ascending along the spine it turns towards the pit of the stomach. Sometimes it begins in the first joint of the fingers and tip of the nose. Sometimes it attacks only a particular part of the body, as one of the arms, the side of the head, &c. This cold is often preceded by a heavy and sleepy torpor, languor, and lassitude, which we are partly to ascribe to real weakness and partly to mere languor. To these symptoms succeed yawning and stretching; after which the cold comes on as above described, not unfrequently with a pain of the back, and a troublesome sensation of tension in the precordia and hypochondria. To this succeed nausea and vomiting; and the more genuine the disease, the more certainly does the vomiting come on; by which a great deal of tough mucous matter, and sometimes bilious fluff or indigested food, is evacuated during the first paroxysm. In some there is only a violent straining to vomit, without bringing up anything; sometimes instead of these symptoms, a diarrhoea occurs; and this chiefly in weak, phlegmatic, and aged people, or where an indigested mucous scabula has long remained in the prime vie.\n\nWhen these symptoms have continued for an hour or two, the cold begins to go off, and is succeeded by a lassitude, languor, and flaccidity of the whole body, but chiefly in the limbs, with an uneasy foreboding as if the parts had been bruised; excepting in those cases where the nausea continues for a longer time. After this languor, a heat comes on, the increase of which is generally slow, but sometimes otherwise, with pain of the head, thirst, and bitterness in the mouth. The pulse is quick and unequal; sometimes beating 130 strokes in a minute. As soon as this heat has abated, a little moisture or sweat is observed to break forth; not always indeed in the first, but always in the succeeding paroxysms, and the urine lets fall a quantity of lateritious sediment. The whole paroxysm is seldom over in less than six hours, more frequently eight, and in violent cases it extends to 12 hours; but that which exceeds 12 hours is to be reckoned a spurious kind, and approaching to the nature of continuous fevers. All these symptoms, however, are repeated every second day, in such a manner that the patient is quite free from fever for at least 24 hours. The paroxysms return much about the same time, though sometimes a little sooner or later.\n\n2. Causes of this disease, and persons subject to it. The genuine tertian attacks men rather than women, young people rather than old: the latter being more subject to anomalous tertians. It likewise seizes the lusty and active, rather than the lazy and indolent. Those, however, who are apt to nauseate their meat fall easily into a tertian fever. The cause, according to Dr Cullen, is the miasm of marshes, and that only. Other physicians have taken in many more causes, almost everything indeed which debilitates the body; but the Doctor denies that any of these, though they may dispose the body for receiving the disease, or many augment it, can by any means produce it without the concurrence of the marsh miasm; and it cannot be denied, that it is a disease almost peculiar to marshy situations. Thus we find it very frequent in the fenny counties of Britain, although in other parts of this island it may be considered as a very rare disease; nay, in many it may perhaps be said that it never occurs. And it is also well known that intermittents have almost entirely disappeared in many parts of Britain, in which they were very common before the marshes of these places were drained.\n\n3. Prognosis. The genuine simple tertian, unless improper medicines be administered, is generally very easily cured; nay, the vulgar reckon it of such a salutary nature, that after it they imagine a person becomes more strong and healthy than before. Hippocrates has observed, that these fevers terminate of their own accord after seven or nine paroxysms. Juncker tells us, that it frequently terminates before the seventh paroxysm, but rarely before the fourth. He also denies that anything critical is to be observed in its going off; but in this he differs from Vogel, who tells us, that the urine, for some days after the fever is quite gone off, appears slimy, and lets fall much sediment. The latter also informs us, that besides the common crisis by sweat and urine, the tertian hath one peculiar to itself, namely, dry scabby ulcers breaking out upon the lips. These sometimes appear about the third or fourth paroxysm; and then we may venture to foretel that the disease will go off spontaneously after the seventh. But though the disease be never dangerous, in cold climates at least, when properly treated; yet the improper use of hot and stimulating medicines may change it into a continued fever, more or less dangerous according to the quantity of medicines taken and the constitution of the patient; in which case the prognosis must be regulated by the particular symptoms which occur. In warm climates, however, the tertian fever may be considered as a much more alarming disease; and unless the most powerful remedies be employed, the patient is in danger of falling a victim to every paroxysm.\n\nA variety of theories have been proposed for explaining the phenomena of this affection; but we may assert, that every thing hitherto said upon the subject is highly unsatisfactory. For although it be now almost universally admitted, that this fever does arise from the effluvia of marshes, yet in what manner the action\naction of those effluvia induces fever, and particularly why this fever returns in regular paroxysms, are questions with regard to which we are still totally in the dark. Dr Cullen, with much ingenuity, attempted to prove, that the remote causes of this, as well as of other fevers, operate by inducing a state of debility; that this debility gives rise to spasm, which induces increased action, from which the phenomena are to be explained. But this theory is liable to no less numerous and unanswerable objections than the exploded hypotheses which had before been propounded by others. For it is an undeniable truth, that debility often exists, even to the highest imaginable degree, without any fever; nay, that when fever has taken place, the debility is often much greater after it is entirely gone than at any period during its course. When spasm and increased action do take place, we have no reason to view them in any other light than merely as symptoms of the disease; and while they are often absent in this affection, they frequently occur in others where the chills, anxiety, and other characteristic symptoms of fever are entirely absent: and upon the whole, a probable or rational theory of intermittents, as well as of other fevers, still remains to be discovered.\n\nCure. The treatment of all genuine intermittents, whether tertians, quotidians, or quartans, being almost precisely the same, the general method of cure applicable to all of them may be here given, to which it will be easy to refer when we come to describe the others.\n\nIn treating intermittent fevers, physicians have formed indications of cure according to their different theories. The followers of Boerhaave, Stahl, &c., who imagined that the disease proceeded from a lentor or other disorders in the blood, always thought it necessary to correct and evacuate these peccant humours by emetics and purgatives, before they attempted to stop the disease by the Peruvian bark or any other medicine. Cinchona indeed, among some, seems to be held in very little estimation: since Vogel affirms, that this medicine, instead of deserving to have the preference of all other febrifuge medicines, ought rather to be ranked among the lowest of the whole; and for this reason he attributes the cures, said to be obtained by the use of the Peruvian bark, entirely to nature.\n\nAccording to Dr Cullen, the indications of cure in intermittent fevers may be reduced to the following:\n\n1. In the time of intermission, to prevent the return of the paroxysms.\n2. In the time of paroxysms, to conduct these in such a manner as to obtain a final solution of the disease.\n3. To take off certain circumstances which might prevent the fulfilling of the two first indications.\n\nThe first indication may be answered in two ways:\n\n1. By increasing the action of the heart and arteries some time before the period of accession, and supporting that increased action till the period of accession be over, and thus preventing the recurrence of that atony and spasm of the extreme vessels, which he thinks give occasion to the recurrence of paroxysms.\n2. By supporting the tone of the vessels, and thereby preventing atony and the consequent spasm, without increasing the action of the heart and arteries, the recurrence of paroxysms may be prevented.\n\nThe action of the heart and arteries may be increased in various stimulant remedies internally given or externally applied, and that without exciting sweat.\n\n2. By the same remedies, or by others, managed in such a manner as to excite sweating, and to support that sweating till the period of accession be for some time past.\n3. By emetics, supporting for the same time the tone and action of the extreme vessels.\n\nThe tone of the extreme vessels may be supported without increasing the action of the heart and arteries, by various tonic medicines; as,\n1. Astringents alone.\n2. Bitters alone.\n3. Astringents and bitters conjoined.\n4. Astringents and aromatics conjoined.\n5. Certain metallic tonics; and,\n6. Opiates. A good deal of exercise, and as full a diet as the condition of the patient's appetite and digestion allow, will be proper during the time of intermission, and may be considered as belonging to this head. Although many particulars in this plan of cure are deduced from Dr Cullen's theory, yet there can be no doubt that the object chiefly to be aimed at is to employ such remedies during the intermissions as will prevent a recurrence of the paroxysm. Of all the remedies hitherto employed with this intention, the most celebrated, perhaps the most certainly effectual, is the Peruvian bark; or, to speak more properly, the bark of the Cinchona officinalis of Linnaeus. But it must be observed, that good effects are only to be expected from this medicine when employed in substance and in large quantity; and for its use the following rules or observations have been given:\n\n1. The cinchona may with safety be employed at any period of intermittent fevers, providing that at the same time there be neither a phlegmatic diathesis prevailing in the system, nor any considerable or fixed congestion present in the abdominal viscera.\n2. The proper time for exhibiting the cinchona in intermittent fevers is during the time of intermission, and it is to be abstained from in the time of paroxysms.\n3. In the case of genuine intermittents, while a due quantity of cinchona is employed, the exhibition of it ought to be brought as near to the time of accession as the condition of the patient's stomach will allow.\n4. In all cases of intermittents, it is not sufficient that the recurrence of paroxysms be stopped for once by the use of the cinchona; a relapse is commonly to be expected, and should be prevented by the exhibition of the cinchona repeated at proper intervals.\n\nThe advantage of administering the medicine as early as possible, was fully ascertained by Dr Lind in the years 1765, 1766, and 1767, during an uncommon prevalence of intermittents. When the disease was stopped by the cinchona immediately after the first or second fit, which was the case with 200 of the Doctor's patients as well as himself, neither a jaundice nor dropy ensued; whereas, when the cinchona could not be administered, on account of the imperfect intermission of the fever, or when the patient had neglected to take it, either a dropy, jaundice, or constant headache, were the certain consequences, and the violence of the disease was in proportion to the number of the preceding fits, or to the continuance of the fever. By every paroxysm the dropical swellings were visibly increased, and the colour of the skin rendered of a deeper yellow. When the fever continued a few days without intermission, the belly and legs generally swelled; a violent headache, likewise, and vertigo, for the most part distressed the patient;\nPractice.\n\nMEDICINE.\n\nFeb. patient; so that some, even after the fever had left them, were not able to walk across their chamber for a fortnight or three weeks. When the returns of the fever were regular and even, but flight, four or five fits of a simple tertian were sometimes followed by the most dangerous symptoms; especially in the year 1765, when these fevers raged with the greatest violence. If, as frequently happened, a dropical patient relapsed into the intermittent, there was an absolute necessity for putting an immediate stop to it by the cinchona; and in upwards of 70 such patients, Dr Lind observed the most beneficial effects to accrue from this practice. Without regard to a cough, or any other chronic indisposition, he ordered it to be given in large doses.\n\nCinchona has been often observed to fail in removing intermittents, from not continuing the use of it for a sufficient length of time, from administering it in too small a dose, or from giving it in an improper form. It was a prevailing opinion, that an ounce, or an ounce and an half, taken during one intermission, was sufficient to prevent the return of another paroxysm. But this is not always the case; for a severe fit will often attack a patient who has taken such a quantity. When this happens, the patient ought to persevere during the following intermissions, with an increase of the dose, till five or six ounces at least have been taken. The medicine also ought not to be omitted as soon as one fit is stopped, but should be continued in a smaller dose, and after longer intervals, for at least ten days or a fortnight. Even for several months after the disease is entirely removed, it would be advisable to take a little occasionally in damp weather, or during an easterly wind, to prevent a relapse. Where the intervals between the fits are short, as in quotidian and double tertians, from one to two drams of it ought to be taken every two or three hours.\n\nThe form in which this medicine is administered is of some consequence. Mucilages and syrups have been recommended to conceal the taste of it; but, from various experiments, Dr Lind found nothing more effectual for this purpose than small beer or milk, especially the latter. A dram of bark mixed with two ounces of milk, and quickly drank, may easily be taken by a person of the most delicate taste, and by washing the mouth afterwards with milk, there will not remain the least flavour of the bark; but if the mixture be not drank immediately, the bark will impart a bitter taste to the milk. This medicine is commonly given in electuaries or boluses; but Dr Lind observes, that in these forms it proves much less efficacious than when administered in juleps or draughts, with the plentiful addition of wine or spirits. He has remarked, that six drams of powdered bark, given in a julep, consisting of one fourth or one third of brandy, is as effectual as an ounce of the powder in the form of an electuary, and proves less disagreeable to the stomach. For patients unaccustomed to wine or spirits, each draught should be warmed with spiritus ammoniae, or tinct. myrrh, by both of which the efficacy of the bark is he thinks increased. Dr Lind is also fully convinced that wine or spirits improve the virtues of the bark much more than elixir vitrioli, tinct. rofar, or such other medicines as have been recommended by different physicians.\n\nFor those who nauseate cinchona from a weakness of the stomach or other cause, he advises it to be given in clysters, in which form it is, he tells us, as efficacious as when taken by the mouth. For this purpose the extract is most proper with the addition of a sufficient quantity of the tinctura thebaicae, in order to its being longer retained. For children labouring under intermittent fevers, Dr Lind orders the spine of the back to be anointed, at the approach of the fit, with a liniment composed of equal parts of tinctura thebaicae and liniment. sapon. which has often prevented it. If this should not produce the desired effect, he informs us that two or three tea-spoonfuls of syrup & mecon, given in the hot fit, will generally mitigate the symptoms. But for the entire removal of the disease, after purging with magnesia alba, he prefers a dram of the extract, cinchona with a few drops of tinct. thebaica, in a clyster, to be repeated every three hours for a child of about a year old. When the stomach is oppressed with phlegm, the magnesia frequently occasions vomiting, which should be promoted with warm water. The constant heaviness of the head occasioned by those fevers in such tender constitutions is best relieved by the application of a blister to the back.\n\nCinchona has also proved effectual for the cure of intermittents in children, even when externally applied, by putting the powder of it into a quilted waistcoat. Of its efficacy in this way several instances are related by Dr Samuel Pye in the second volume of Medical Observations and Inquiries. In short, so effectual was it found in removing these fevers when properly applied, that of between four and five hundred afflicted with them in the year 1765, Dr Lind lost only two, neither of whom had taken this medicine.\n\nIn all these cases, a vomit was administered whenever the patient complained of a sickness and retching to vomit, or was seized with a spontaneous vomiting; and cinchona was never given till this sickness was removed, or a purgative taken to clear more perfectly the whole alimentary canal. In those patients who were troubled with a cough, attended with a pain in the side affecting the breathing, when the pain was not relieved by warm fomentations, the balsamum anodynum, or by a blister, Dr Lind generally ordered a few ounces of blood to be taken away, and endeavoured to stop the fever as soon as possible by the administration of cinchona; having found that every return of the fever increased all such pains.—When the headache was very violent, and harassed the patient during the intermissions, the fuscels of cinchona was rendered more complete by the application of a blister to the back.—A giddiness of the head, which is the symptom most commonly remaining after even a slight intermittent fever, was generally relieved by the sal C. C. and cinchona in wine. The former of these was administered in the following manner.\n\nR. Aq. Alex. Simp. 3 vii.\nSal C. C. 3fs.\nSyr. c Cort. Aurant. 3i. M. f. julep. Cap. cochlear. ij. subinde.\n\nIf from the continuance of the fever the patient was distreched with a flatulence, a distention of the abdomen, and a swelling of the legs, a spoonful of tinctura faecra, with the addition of 30 drops of the spirit. lavend. compos. was ordered to be taken every night.—A\ncontinuance of cinchona, a change of air, and the cold bath, were often found requisite to prevent a relapse.\n\nSuch is the method of cure recommended by this experienced author, who has also discovered the efficacy and success of opium in intermittent fevers. He informs us, that he has prescribed an opiate to upwards of 300 patients labouring under this disease; and he observed, that, if taken during the intermission, it had not the least effect either in preventing or mitigating the succeeding paroxysm; when given in the cold fit, it once or twice seemed to remove it; but when given half an hour after the commencement of the hot fit, it generally gave immediate relief.\n\nWhen given in the hot fit, the effects of opium are as follow: 1. It thaws and abates the fit; and this with more certainty than an ounce of cinchona is found to remove the disease. 2. It generally gives a sensible relief to the head, takes off the burning heat of the fever, and occasions a profuse sweat. This sweat is attended with an agreeable softness of the skin, instead of the burning sensation which affects patients sweating in the hot fit, and is always much more copious than in those who have not taken opium. 3. It often produces a soft and refreshing sleep to a patient tortured in the agonies of the fever, from which he awakes bathed in sweat, and in a great measure free from all complaints.\n\nDr Lind has always observed, that the effects of opium are more uniform and constant in intermittent fevers than in any other disease, and are then more quick and obvious than those of any other medicine. An opiate thus given soon after the commencement of the hot fit, by abating the violence and lessening the duration of the fever, preserves the constitution so entirely uninjured, that, since he used opium in agues, a dropy or jaundice has seldom attacked any of his patients in those diseases. When opium did not immediately abate the symptoms of the fever, it never increased their violence. On the contrary, most patients reaped some benefit from an opiate given in the hot fit, and many of them bore a larger dose at that time than they could do at any other. He affirms us, that even a delirium in the hot fit is not increased by opium, though opium will not remove it. Hence he thinks it probable, that many symptoms attending these fevers are spasmodic; but more especially the headache. However, if the patient be delirious in the fit, the administration of the opiate ought to be delayed until he recovers his senses, when it will be found greatly to relieve the weakness and faintness which commonly succeed the delirium. Dr Lind is of opinion, that opium in this disease is the best preparative for cinchona; as it not only produces a complete intermission, in which case alone that remedy can be safely administered; but occasions such a salutary and copious evacuation by sweat, as generally to render a much less quantity of cinchona requisite. He commonly prescribes the opiate in about two ounces of tinctura sacra, when the patient is convalescent, who is to take the cinchona immediately after the fit. By these means the paroxysm is shortened, and the intermissions are cleansed, previous to the administration of cinchona; as the opiate doth not prevent, but only somewhat retard, the operation of the purgative. When a vomit is given immediately before the paroxysm, the administration of the opiate should be postponed till the hot fit be begun.\n\nIn the administration of cinchona, care should be taken that it be of a good quality. And different opinions have been entertained with respect to the choice, even where there is no reason to believe that it has been adulterated by the mixture of other articles. For a long time, the preference was given to small quilled pieces of pale-coloured bark; but of late the red bark, which is generally in larger masses, of an apparently coarser texture, and evidently of a more resinous nature, has been highly celebrated by Dr Saunders and others. And in cases where it does not disagree with the stomach or excite looseness, it is admitted by the most accurate observers to be more powerful in preventing the return of intermittents. Whether the red bark be the product of a different species of the cinchona, or be obtained as well as the pale quilled bark from the cinchona officinalis, is not yet ascertained with sufficient accuracy. Cinchona of a yellow colour has lately been imported into Britain and highly extolled. Its botanical history is not ascertained. It contains more bitter extractive matter, and more tannin and gallic acid, than either the pale or red; but less gum than the pale, and less resin than the red. It seems to produce the same medical effects in smaller doses. And it has sometimes succeeded in the cure of intermittents where the pale and red cinchona have before been employed in vain.\n\nA species of cinchona, distinguished by the title of cinchona Jamaicensis, has been discovered in Jamaica and other islands in the West Indies. A very accurate description of it has been given by Dr Wright of Jamaica in the Philosophical Transactions of London. The bark of this species also has been recommended in the cure of intermittents; but the advantages of it have not hitherto been sufficiently confirmed by experience.\n\nThe barks of various trees readily cultivated in Britain, particularly different species of the salix, the prunus, the fraxinus, and the quercus, have by some been represented as no less efficacious than the cinchona. But we may safely venture to affirm, that although several of them may possess some power in stopping intermittents, yet that none hitherto tried can be considered as in any degree approaching to the cinchona in point of efficacy.\n\nBut although the Peruvian bark be the best cure for intermittents hitherto discovered, yet while it can by no means be represented as the only cure, it is very certain that other remedies have in different cases succeeded after the cinchona has failed. Cures have often been obtained by the use of different aromatics, bitters, and astringents. Many articles from the mineral kingdom also have been employed with advantage. And intermittents have unquestionably been in certain cases stopped by different preparations of iron, zinc, copper, lead, and mercury. But of all the articles of this nature, arsenic has of late been the most celebrated. Arsenic is on good grounds conjectured to be the basis of an article much employed in the cure of intermittents in some of the countries where they are most prevalent, and sold under the title of the taffel's aque drop. The great success attending the use of this article, led Dr Fowler, an ingenious physician of Stafford, to examine it with particular attention. And in a treatise which he has lately published, entitled Medical Reports on the effects of arsenic in the cure of agues, he has given a formula for an arsenical solution,\nMEDICINE.\n\nFebre, which he has found very successful in affections of this kind, and which is probably very nearly the same with the tattelteague drop. Dr Fowler's mineral solution, as he styles it, is found by dissolving 64 grains of arsenic and as much fixed vegetable alkaline salt in a pound of distilled water. This solution is given in doses from three to 12 drops, varied according to the condition of the patient, and repeated two or three times a day. And where the cinchona has failed in stopping intermittents, it seems to be one of the most powerful remedies yet discovered. But after all remedies prove ineffectual, intermittents are often stopped by change of season and of situation.\n\nBut besides the remedies employed in tertians and other intermittents, with the view of preventing the return of paroxysms, it is often also necessary to employ powerful articles with other intentions, particularly to mitigate and shorten the paroxysm when present; to obviate urgent symptoms, especially those of an inflammatory or putrid nature; and to obtain a complete apyrexia or intermission from fever after the paroxysm has ceased. With these intentions, recourse is not unfrequently had to emetics, laxatives, bloodletting, blisters, opium, diluents, or sudorifics, as the circumstances of the case may require.\n\nThe Irregular or Spurious Tertian.\nSp. I. var. 1. B.\nTertiana notha five spuria, Sauv. sp. 2. Sennert.\nCleghorn. Hoffman.\n\nThe characteristic marks of this fever are, that its paroxysms last longer than 12 hours, and consequently it inclines more to the quotidian or continued fever than the former. Its paroxysms have no stated hour of attacking. The cure, however, is precisely the same with that above described, observing the proper cautions already mentioned with regard to the use of the cinchona.\n\nThe Double Tertian. Sp. i. var. 2. C.\nTertiana duplex, Sauv. sp. 13. Vog. G. 12. Sennert.\nCleghorn. Duplicata, Lin. 18.\n\nThe double tertian comes on every day; but differs from the quotidian in this, that its paroxysms do not answer to each other singly, but alternately. The first day, for instance, the fit will come on in the forenoon, in the second in the afternoon, the third in the forenoon, and the fourth in the afternoon.\n\nOf these fevers we shall give the following description from Cleghorn's treatise on the diseases of Minorca: \"They are called double tertians when there are two fits and two intervals within the time of each period. But commonly there is some difference between the two fits, either in respect of the hour they come at, the time of their duration, or the nature and violence of their concomitant symptoms. Some double tertians begin in this manner.—On the evening of Monday, for example, a flight fit comes on, and goes off early next morning; but on Tuesday, towards the middle of the day, a more severe paroxysm begins, and continues till night. Then there is an interval to Wednesday evening, when a flight fit commences a new period of the fever, which proceeds in the same manner as the first; so that according to the way Tertiana physicians calculate the days of diseases, by beginning to reckon from the first hour of their invasion, both paroxysms happen on the odd days, while the greatest part of the even days is calm and undisturbed. But in most double tertians the patient has a fit every day of the disease; the severe one commonly appearing at noon upon the odd days, the flight one towards evening on the even days; though sometimes the worst of the two fits happen on the even days.\n\n\"There is a tertian fever sometimes to be met with, during each period of which there are three different fits, and as many intervals. For example, towards Monday noon the patient is seized with a paroxysm, which declines about five or six o'clock the same evening; a few hours after, another fit begins, and continues until morning: from which time there is an interval to Tuesday evening, when a third fit comes on, and lasts most part of the night. On Wednesday there are again two paroxysms, as on Monday, and on Thursday like that of Tuesday; and thus the fever goes on with a double fit on each of the odd days, and a single fit on the even days.\n\n\"In double tertians, that interval is the most considerable which follows the severe fit; for the slight fit oftener ends in a remission than intermission, and frequently lingers till the other approaches: Hence it is, that the night preceding the vehement fit is much more restless than that which comes after it, as has been observed by Hippocrates. In double tertians, the vehement fit often comes on a little earlier in each period, while the slight fit returns at the same hour, or perhaps later and later every second day: so that the motions of one have no influence on those of the other; from whence it appears, that each of these fits hath its own proper independent causes.\"\n\nDuplicated Tertian. Sp. I. var. 2. D.\nTertiana duplicata, Sauv. sp. 14. Joner. Rover.\n\nThis hath two fits on the same day, with an intermediate day on which there are none. This also does not differ in any remarkable particular from those already described.\n\nThe Triple Tertian. Sp. I. var. 2. E.\nTertiana tripes, Sauv. sp. 15. Cleghorn.\nSemiteriana, Hoffman.\nSemiteriana primi ordinis, Spig.\n\nThis differs from the former in having a single and double fit alternately: thus, for instance, if there be two fits the first day, there is only one the second, two the third, one the fourth, &c. Its cure is the same as before.\n\nThe Semi-Tertian. Sp. I. var. 2. F.\nHemitritaeus, Celt.\nSemiteriana, Cleghorn.\nSemiteriana secundi ordinis, Spig.\nAmphimerina hemitritaeus, Sauv. sp. 8.\nAmphimerina pseudo-hemitritaeus, Sauv. sp. 9.\n\nThe semiterian is described by Dr Cullen as having only an evident remission between its paroxysms; more remarkable between the odd and even day, but less so between the even and odd one. For this reason, he adds, that possibly some semiterians ought rather\nto be clasped among the remittents; and owns that it is difficult to settle the boundaries between them. But Cleghorn, whom he quotes, describes it in the following manner. \"A fit begins on Monday noon, for example, and goes off the same night. On Tuesday afternoon a second fit comes on, and gradually increases till Wednesday night, when it terminates. On Thursday morning there is such another interval as happened on Tuesday morning: But on Thursday afternoon another long fit like the preceding commences; and returning regularly every second day, leaves only a short interval of ten or twelve hours during the eight and forty.\n\nConcerning the cure of these fevers Dr Cullen observes, that though no entire apyrexia occurs, cinchona may be given during the remissions: and it should be given even though the remissions be inconsiderable; if, from the known nature of the epidemic, intermissions or considerable remissions are not to be expected, and that great danger is apprehended from repeated exacerbations.\n\nThe Sleepy Tertian. Sp. I. var. 3. G.\nTertiana carotica, Sauv. sp. 10. Werthof.\nTertiana hemiplegica, Sauv. sp. 20. Werthof.\nQuotidiana soporosa, Sauv. sp. 8. Car. Piff.\nFebris caput impetens, Sydenham, ep. ad. R. Brady.\n\nThis, according to Vogel, is a most dangerous species, and very commonly fatal; for which reason he ranks it among those intermittents which he calls malignant. Sometimes he tells us the alarming symptom of a sleepiness comes on, not at the beginning of the disease, but will unexpectedly occur during the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth paroxysm. It commonly begins with the cold fit, and continues during the whole time of the paroxysm, and, becoming stronger at every succeeding one, at last terminates in a mortal apoplexy. Sometimes fevers of this kind rage epidemically. Vogel relates, that he saw a simple tertian changed into one of these dangerous fevers. The patient was a woman of a delicate constitution, and the symptom appeared in consequence of her being put in a violent passion: however, it occurred but once, and she recovered. Hoffman mentions a case in a double tertian occurring seven times without proving mortal; though Vogel says, that the powers of nature are very seldom sufficient to conquer the disease.\n\nIn 1678, Dr Sydenham tells us that intermittents raged epidemically at London, where none had appeared before from 1664. Of them \"it is to be noted (says he), that though quartans were most frequent formerly, yet now tertians or quotidians were most common, unless the latter be entitled double tertians; and likewise, that though these tertians sometimes began with chills and shivering, which were succeeded first by heat, and soon after by sweat, and ended at length in a perfect intermission, returning again after a fixed time; yet they did not keep this order after the third or fourth fit, especially if the patient was confined to his bed and used hot cardias, which increase the disease. But afterwards this fever became so unusually violent, that only a remission happened in the place of an intermission; and approaching every day nearer the species of continued fevers, it seized the head, and proved fatal to abundance of persons.\"\n\nFrom this description of Sydenham's we may have an idea of the nature of the disease. As to its cure he strongly recommends cinchona; telling us, that, even in the most continued kind of intermittents, \"the nearer the intermittent approaches to a continued fever, either spontaneously, or from using too hot a regimen, so much the more necessary is it to exhibit a larger quantity of the bark; and that he took advantage of a remission, though ever so small.\"\n\nThe Spasmodic or Convulsive TERTIAN.

II.\n\nTertians of this kind occur with very different symptoms from those of the true ones, and sometimes even with those which are very extraordinary. In some they are attended with symptoms of asthma, in others with those of hysterics, in others with convulsions. Where the symptoms of asthma occur, the disease must be treated with diuretics and antiphlogistics joined with cinchona. In the hysteric asthma the fit comes on with cold, yawning, cardialgia, terror and dejection of mind. The disease is to be removed by mild aperients and antihysterics joined with cinchona.\n\nOf the convulsive tertian we have a most remarkable instance in the Edinburgh Medical Essays, vol. v. The patient was a farmer's son about 26 years of age, of a strong plethoric habit of body. He had laboured under an ague half-a-year, and had taken a great deal of Peruvian bark. While he was telling his case to the surgeon (Mr Baine of Pembroke), he was suddenly taken with a violent stamping of his feet; and the convulsions gradually ascended from the soles of the feet to his legs, thighs, belly, back, and shoulders. His head was then most violently convulsed, with a total deprivation of speech; but he had a most dismal vociferation, which might have been heard at a considerable distance, his abdomen and thorax working and heaving violently and unusually in the mean time. This fit having lasted half an hour, a profuse sweat broke out over all his body, which relieved him; and he then became capable of answering such questions as were put. These extraordinary fits, he said, had been occasioned by a fright, and his neighbours had concluded that he was bewitched. They returned sometimes twice a-day, and always at the times the ague used to return. During the paroxysm his pulse was very high and quick, his face much inflamed, and his eyes ready to start out of his head. After the\nPractice.\n\nFebr., the fit was over, he complained of a most torturing pain of the bowels. His tongue was generally moist, and he had a suppression of urine.—This formidable disease, however, was totally subdued by the use of cinchona, mercurials, antipathmodics, opiates, and saline draughts.\n\nThe Erupitive Tertian.

Ger.\n\nThis species of tertian is accompanied with red or livid blotches on the skin, or an eruption like that occasioned by the stinging of nettles. In the latter case Dr Cleghorn says the disease is very dangerous; and as the former indicates an incipient dissolution and putrefaction of the blood, it must also be reckoned of very dangerous tendency.\n\nThe Inflammatory Tertian.

Lautt.\n\nSauvages informs us, that he has seen a true and genuine pleurisy having all the pathognomonic signs of the disease, but assuming the form of an intermittent; that is, the patient is one day affected with the pleurisy, and the next seemingly in perfect health. He also tells us, that in the month of May 1760 a tertian raged epidemically, which after the third fit imitated a pleurisy, the pain of the side and difficulty of breathing coming regularly on, and the fever from an intermittent becoming remittent; the blood had also the same appearance with that of pleuritic persons, and the distemper yielded to bleeding and gentle cathartics.—Morton also informs us, that he has observed similar disorders a hundred times, which were always certainly and safely cured by the Peruvian bark.\n\nThe Tertian complicated with other Disorders.\nSp. I. var. 4.\nTertiana scorbutica, Sauv. f. 9. Etmuller. Timaeus.\nTertiana typhilitica, Sauv. sp. 17. Deidier.\nTertiana verminosa, Sauv. sp. 18. Silfer. in act. Helmstad. Laneif. de noxius palud. Pringle. Ramazzini. Van den Bofch. de confit. vermin.\n\nThe scorbutic tertian, according to Sauvages, is exceedingly anomalous, its periods being sometimes much anticipated, and sometimes much postponed. It is exceedingly obstinate, and will return if the body be not cleared of its scorbutic taint. The patient is afflicted with lancinating pains of a wandering nature. The urine lets fall a bulky red sediment, or a thick branny matter is copiously scattered up and down in it, seemingly tinged with blood. The usual symptoms of scurvy, viz. livid spots, and rotten fetid gums, also frequently occur. For this the Peruvian bark is very useful, both as a febrifuge and antiscorbutic.\n\nA tertian accompanied with worms is taken notice of by Sir John Pringle in his treatise on the diseases of Tertiana of the army. The worms, he tells us, were of the round kind; and though we are by no means to reckon them the cause of the fever, they never failed to make it worse, occasioning obstinate gripings or sickness at stomach. In these cases stitches were frequent; but, being flatulent, were not often relieved by bleeding. The worms were discharged by vomiting as well as by stool. For discharging these worms, he commonly gave half a dram of rhubarb with 12 grains of calomel; without obliterating any inconvenience from such a large dose of mercury. Anthelmintics, which act slowly, had little chance of doing good; for though worms will sometimes lie long in the bowels without giving much uneasiness to a person otherwise well, yet in a fever, especially one of a putrid kind (to which his intermittents always seemed to incline), the worms being disturbed by the increase of heat, and the corruption of the humours in the prime vice, begin to move about, and struggle to get out. Lancisi, who makes this remark, adds, that upon opening the bodies of some who had died at Rome of fevers of this kind, wounds were found in the intestines made by the biting of the worms; nay, that some of them had even pierced through the coats of the guts, and lay in the cavity of the abdomen. Pringle never had any instance of this; but knew many cases in which the worms escaped by the patient's mouth, though there had been no previous retching to bring them up. One folder was thrown into violent convulsions, but was cured by the above-mentioned powder.\n\nThe Tertian varied from its Origin. Sp. I. var. 5.\nTertiana accidentalis, Sauv. sp. 12.

Hoffman, II. p. 12.\n\nThe existence of fevers of this kind, as we have already observed, is denied by Dr Cullen; the accidental fever of Sauvages was said to arise from any slight error in the non-naturals, and consequently was very easily cured. That which arose from the repulsion of the itch, was cured as soon as the eruption returned.\n\nThe Tertian with only a remission between the fits. Sp. II.\nRemittent tertian.\nTritæophya, Sauv.

Sau-\nvages divides his triteophyta, a remittent tertia into\nthe following species:\n\n1. Triteophyta syncopalis, or that attended with faint-\ning. It begins like a tertia, with cold succeeded by\nheat and profuse sweating; but attended with much\nmore dangerous symptoms, such as cardialgia, enor-\nmous vomiting, great weakness, small contracted pulse,\ncoldness of the extremities, and, unless timely assistance\nbe given, kills during the second or third paroxysm.\n\n2. The caufus, or burning fever of Hippocrates,\nreturns every third day without any new sensation of\ncold; and is attended with great thirst, heat, but with-\nout diarrhoea or sweat, and continues only for one\nweek or two at the utmost. It attacks chiefly young\npeople of a robust and bilious habit of body, who have\nbeen accustomed to much exercise, and exposed to the\nsun during the heats of summer, and have also used a\nphlogistic regimen. The tongue is dry, sometimes\nblack; the urine of a red or flame colour; together\nwith pain of the head, anxiety, and sometimes other\nsymptoms still more dangerous.\n\n3. Triteophyta Wratislaviensis, was a pestilential disease\noccasioned by famine, during which the people fed on\nputrid aliments: the air was infected by the vast num-\nbers of bodies of those slain in battle, and the inhabitants\nwere also deprived of reason of being deprived of their\nharvest, and other calamities; to all which was added\nthe continuance of a calm in the atmosphere for a long\ntime. It began with an acute fever, leipyria or coldness\nof the external parts and a sensation of burning heat\ninwardly; general weakness; pain of the head and pra-\ncordia; ferous, or bilious diarrhoea; a delirium, in\nsome furious, and accompanied with a dread of be-\ning exposed to the air; on the second day the thirst\nwas violent, attended with a bilious vomiting, as well\nas diarrhoea, tough viscid spitting, fainting, burning\nheat in the bowels, the tongue dry and seeming as if\nburnt with a hot iron, a suppression of the voice, anxi-\nety, stupor, after which quickly followed convulsions\nand death. In some fevers leipyria came on with an\nexceeding great cold of the extremities, presently fol-\nlowed by an intolerable heat of the viscera, with symp-\ntomatic sweats, violent diarrhoea, followed by a very\nitchy miliary eruption. On the fourth day came on\ncopious sweats, spasms of the lower jaw, nausea, invo-\nluntary passing of urine, slight delirium, a flux of ichor-\neous matter from the nostrils, an exceeding tough spit-\nting, an epilepsy, and death. Professor Hahn, who\ngives the history of this disease, was himself attacked by it, and suffered in the following manner: On the first day was a violent feverish paroxysm without rigor, a sharp pain in the occiput, and immediately an inflammatory pain over the whole head; the feet were extremely cold, and the extremities rigid with spasms. The pain continued to increase daily to such a degree, that the contact of the air itself became at last intolerable; a dejection of mind and incredible weakness followed; he paled reflexively nights with continual sweating, heavy and pained eyes, and an universal sensation of rheumatism over the whole body. On the third day the pains were alleviated, but he had a very bad night. On the fourth day all the symptoms were worse, the feet quite chilled, the hands very red and agitated with convulsive motions; he was terrified with apprehensions of death, and had a vomiting every now and then: this day sponges dipped in cold water were applied over the whole body, and he used cold water for his drink. On the eighth day the pulse was convulsive; and the pains were so violent that they made him cry out almost continually. On the ninth day he was delirious, and threw up some grumous blood. On the 11th his pulse was more quiet, and he had a sweat; a decoction of cinchona was given; his voice was broken, his speech interrupted, and his teeth chattered upon one another. On the 12th his jaw was convulsed, he had a risus sardonicus, and deafness; after which the paroxysms returned less frequently, and only towards night. On the 14th he had a chilling cold over the whole body, a cold sweat; frequent lotions were applied, and all the symptoms became milder. On the 18th he had a quick delirium, but fainted as soon as taken out of bed; a sensation of hunger, followed by copious sweats; profound sleep; an aversion from noise; everything appeared new and extraordinary. On the 36th a cholera; on the 48th a feeling off the skin, and falling off of the nails. This epidemic carried off above 3000 people at Warsaw. Frequent lotions of the body either cold or tepid, watery glysters, and the copious introduction of watery fluids under the form of drink, were of service. But the most favourable crisis was under the form of some cutaneous eruption.\n\n4. Tritrophya typhodes. The principal symptom of this fever was a continual sweat with which the patients were almost always wet; with paroxysms returning every third day. Sauvages tells us, that he had twice an opportunity of observing this fever; one was in the teacher of an academy, about 40 years of age, and of a melancholic temperament. He sweated every second night so plentifully, that he was obliged to change his linen nine times; and even on the intermediate days was never perfectly free of fever, and had his skin moistened with sweat. The other was of a woman who went about in man's clothes, and was discovered only after her death. The disease began with a slight sensation of cold, after which she sweated for eight hours. It was attended with the highest debility, anxiety, and at the same time an insatiable hunger.\n\n5. Tritrophya eloder, was an inflammatory epidemic, but not contagious, terminating about the 14th or 21st day. The disease came on in the night-time, with disturbed rest, universal weakness, watchings, great heat and sweat, redness of the face and almost of the whole body, sparkling eyes, the tongue dry and white; a hard, tense, and turgid pulse; about the third day a kind of frenzy frequently came on with the feverish paroxysm, the forerunner of an universal military eruption; or, what was worse, with purple spots to close together, that they looked like an erysipelas of the whole body. Sometimes blisters of the size of small pearls, filled with acid serum, appeared on the neck, armpits, and trunk of the body, which were of all the symptoms the most dangerous. There was a variety of the disease, which Sauvages calls the humoralis, in which the pulse was soft and feeble, with greater weaknesses over the whole body, and the disposition to sleep more frequent than in the other; the eyes languid; the tongue very white, but not dry; and worms were sometimes discharged.\n\n6. Tritrophya affoder. This species arose from a foulness of the prime vice, and the effluvia of waters in which hemp had been steeped. It began with rigor, followed by great heats, reflexions, tossing of the limbs, faintings, inordinate thirst, dryness of tongue, delirium, and at length excessive watchings; these last, however, were less dangerous than vertigo or a comatose disposition, which brought on convulsions or apoplexies.\n\n7. Tritrophya carolica. This had exacerbations every other evening; and its distinguishing symptom was an excessive inclination to sleep, preceded by a severe headache, and followed by delirium, and sometimes convulsions; the tongue was black, and the patient insensible of thirst after the delirium came on. In those cases where the disease proved fatal, a subfultus tendinum and other alarming symptoms, came on.\n\n8. Tritrophya leipyria is only a variety of the tritrophya caulis, already described.\n\n9. Tritrophya deceptiva. This species at first assumes the appearance of a continued fever; but afterwards degenerates into a remittent, or even an intermittent. It is described by Sydenham, but attended with no remarkable symptoms.\n\n10. The last of Sauvages's species of Tritrophya belonging to the remitting tertian is the Americana. This, according to Sauvages, is the ardent fever with which the Europeans are usually seized on their first arrival in America, and generally carries off one half of them. Of this there are two varieties, the very acute and the acute. The very acute ends before the seventh day. It comes on a few days after the person's arrival, with loss of appetite, with dyspnea and fitting from weakness, headache, latitude, and pain of the loins; a pyrexia succeeds, with great thirst, sweat, and heat; the sickness increases, nausea comes on, with vomiting of porraceous bile; the tongue rough, the extremities often cold; watching, furious delirium; and the patient frequently dies on the third day. Copious sweats, and a plentiful hemorrhage from the nose on the fifth day, but not sooner, are serviceable; but a bilious diarrhoea is the best crisis of all.\n\nThe acute kind terminates most frequently on the ninth, but very rarely goes beyond the fifteenth day. Death frequently comes on between the fourth and seventh days. It begins with headache, pain in the loins, and sometimes shivering; great latitude, dys-\nMEDICINE.\n\npnoea, thirst; burning fever, increasing every third day; inflation of the abdomen, pain at the pit of the stomach, nausea, and bilious vomiting. Such is the state of the disease within twenty-four hours. The eyes are red, and full of tears; the urine pellucid; there is a low delirium, and continual anxiety; the tongue is dry and red, and sometimes, though rarely, black, which is a still worse sign; the pulse, formerly strong and full, sinks about the fourth day, and becomes tense and spasmodic: if a crisis then comes on, the patient dies the fifth or sixth day; but if the pulse keeps up, and no crisis comes on, a crisis is to be expected by sweat, by a copious hemorrhage from the nose, or, which is still more safe, by a bilious diarrhea, which is never salutary if it comes on before the fifth day.\n\nTo the remitting tertian also belong the following species mentioned by Sauvages, viz.\n\n1. Tertiana subcontinua. This begins like a genuine tertian, and at first hath distinct paroxysms; but these grow gradually more and more obscure, the disease acquiring daily more of the appearance of continued fever, by which it is to be distinguished from the other varieties of this species. It is not unfrequently joined with those symptoms which attend the fatal fever already mentioned; as cardialgia, cholera, syncope, &c., but in a much less degree. The disease commonly begins with little or no sense of cold, but rather a sensation of heat; when the tertian is doubled, it has first a slighter and then a more severe fit; and thus goes on with an exacerbation on the even days; and though it should change from a double into a single tertian, we are still to suspect it, if a weak fit is the forerunner of a very strong one. This change of the tertian into a continued fever is also to be prognosticated if a heat remarkable to the touch is perceived on the day of intermission, together with some disturbance of the pulse, thirst, and dryness of the tongue; all of which show a tendency to inflammation: the same is foretold by the urine being in small quantity, and very red, or of a saffron colour; also an ulcerous or aphthous inflammation of the throat, with difficulty of swallowing, or any very severe symptom coming on in the beginning of the disease, excepting only a delirium, which is easily removed.\n\n2. Quotidiana deceptiva. This is a disorder of an inflammatory kind, with a strong tendency to putrefaction, and sometimes assumes the form of a quotidian. In it the patient frequently complains of cold when he really is hot, and the remission is very indistinct. The disease is known by the great languor of the patient and the foulness of his tongue.\n\n3. Amphimerina cardiaca is an acute malignant fever, with daily exacerbations, attended with fainting and vomiting of green bile. Afterwards, the weakness increasing, the patient's extremities grow cold, and a profuse sweat comes on, which is frequently succeeded by death on the fourth day. Another species resembling this Sauvages calls the syncope; but the cardiaca differs from it in being attended with cardialgia.\n\n4. Amphimerina paludosa. This is the fever described by the British physicians under many different names, and appearing under various forms, according to the different constitutions of the patients. This fever in the East Indies, according to Dr Lind of Windsor, generally comes on suddenly, and begins with a sense of debility and a very great lowness of spirits. These tertian symptoms, are attended with a greater or less degree of chilliness, vertigo, nausea, very acute pains in the head and loins, and a trembling of the hands; the countenance is pale, the skin commonly very dry and corrugated, the eyes dull and heavy, the pulse quick and small, the breath generally difficult, and interrupted by hiccup.\n\nAs the paroxysm increases, the chilliness now and then gives way to irregular heats, which soon become violent and permanent; the nausea likewise increases; and in force there comes on a vomiting, in which they throw up a great deal of bile. Sometimes bile is likewise voided by stool. The skin grows red; the eyes appear small, and sometimes not a little inflamed. The pulse becomes fuller, and the breath more difficult, attended with great restlessness and a troublesome thirst; notwithstanding which (so great is the nausea) the patient cannot endure any kind of liquids. The tongue becomes foul, and the pain of the head and loins more violent; a delirium then follows; a slight moisture appears on the face, and from thence spreads to the other parts; whilst the violence of the other symptoms abates, and shows the beginning of a remission, which is completed by plentiful sweats.\n\nOn the fever's remitting, the pulse returns almost to its natural state; the pains of the head and loins still continue, though somewhat less violent, as likewise the nausea and want of appetite. When the disease gains strength, the remission is scarcely obvious, and is immediately followed by another paroxysm; which begins, not indeed with so great a shivering, but is attended with a greater pain of the head, the greatest anxiety, a heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and bilious stools. The matter most commonly evacuated by vomit and stool is whitish like chalk and water, or curdled milk which is vomited by sucking children, when the curd is much broke down. A heat, immoderate thirst, and delirium, now come on. The tongue becomes more foul; the teeth and inside of the lips are covered with a black crust; the breath grows hot and fetid; another remission ensues, attended with a sweat; but this remission is both shorter and less obvious than the first.\n\nThis second remission is succeeded by a paroxysm, in which the symptoms are far more violent than in the former; that which the patient discharges by vomiting and purging is more fetid; the mouth, teeth and inside of the lips, are not only covered with a black crust, but the tongue becomes so dry and stiff, that the patient's voice can scarce be heard. Violent delirium, with restlessness and anxiety, come on chiefly during the paroxysm; nor do these symptoms abate till the fever remits, and the patient sweats.\n\nWhen the fever becomes so violent, during the third fit, as to end in death, which is often the case, some of the sick have a coma; in others the delirium becomes more violent. The discharges now become more fetid, and have a cadaverous smell; the stools are involuntary; the pulse is so quick, small, and irregular, that it is scarce to be counted, or even felt; a cold sweat is diffused over the whole body, especially the head and neck; the face becomes Hippocratic and convulsed; the patient picks the bed-clothes; a subfultus tendinum comes on; the sick lie constantly on their backs, and insensibly\nPractice.\n\nMEDICINE.\n\nFebrés insensibly slide down to the foot of the bed; their extremities grow cold; they are then seized with convulsions, with which the scene closes.\n\nIn this fever, the urine, which at the beginning is pale, becomes of a deeper colour by degrees, but without depositing any sediment. There seldom or never appear any petechiae, and the prickly heat which was before on the skin vanishes on the first appearance of the fever. But though these were the general symptoms of this disorder, they varied in the different subjects, and at different seasons of the same year. The pulse, for example, in some, was quick in the beginning of the disorder; in others, it varied with the other symptoms. The skin was generally dry in the beginning of the fit; but in some it was moist, and covered with sweat from the very beginning of the disease. In the month of September, when the disorder raged most, the remissions were very imperfect and obscure; but, on the return of winter and the healthy season, they became more regular, and the disease assumed the appearance of an intermitting fever, to such a degree as at length not to be distinguished from it. In some the remissions could scarcely be perceived, and the fever continued for two weeks without any material change for the better or the worse. At this time numbers were seized with it. When the disorder continued for any time without a change, it generally ended in death; while the weather grew better, it sometimes, in the space of a few days, from a common fever became an intermitting one, and the patient recovered, unless his liver, which was sometimes the case, happened to be affected. The cure of an inflammation of the liver proved uncertain and tedious; as it was commonly followed by a colliquative diarrhoea, which generally endangered the patient's life.—Every succeeding paroxysm was observed to be more dangerous than the preceding; the third generally proved fatal; some died during the first. When this happened, the fever, in the language of the country, was called a puca, that is a strong fever.\n\nThis disease, according to Dr Lind of Hallar hospital, is the autumnal fever of all hot countries, the epidemic disease between the tropics, and the disease most fatal to Europeans in all hot and unhealthy climates. All authors agree that intermittents in general, but particularly this dangerous kind of them, are produced by heat and moisture, but particularly the evaporation of moisture from marshes. Dr Lind of Windsor remarks, that the European seamen are very subject to the fever above mentioned when they happen to arrive at Bengal in autumn. They are predisposed to it from the nature of their food, their confinement on board, the very great heats to which they are exposed during the voyage, and their lying for hours together exposed to the night colds.\n\nMost of the meat used by the crews of those ships is salted, and often in a putrid state, without any fresh vegetables, they having only biscuits, and some other farinaceous matters. The quantity of the vinous or spirituous liquors allowed them is, in his opinion, by far too small to subdue the putrefactive disposition of their animal-food. Their fluids consequently become, from day to day, more and more putrefied, and of course more apt to breed and contract this disorder. This disposition is likewise induced by their being stowed very close together, and that for a considerable length of time, and in a foul air, especially when the weather happens to be too stormy to permit the hatches and portholes to be kept open.\n\nThough the heats they endure in the voyage to India are less considerable than those of the country itself, yet they are too much for an European constitution to bear. The general heat at sea within the tropics is about 84° of Fahrenheit's thermometer, which is sufficient to relax them, and promote a corruption of their humours, especially when it coincides with the above causes. It likewise creates a languor and indolence, which alone are sufficient to increase that putrefaction. These causes are apt to be considerably aggravated by the men's being often exposed, when on duty, for hours together, to rain, damp, and cold air; a circumstance which frequently happens to them when working their ships up the river Ganges in the night-time. Hence the perspiration is checked, and the excrementitious fluid which used to be discharged by the skin being retained in the body, contributes, he thinks, very much towards the predisposition to this disease.\n\nBut the most powerful of all the remote causes is justly thought to be the effluvia of marshes replete with putrid animal-substances. We have not, however, been able to determine from what kind of putrid animal-substances these effluvia derive their virus. For that every kind of putrefaction has not such an effect appears from this, that neither practical anatomists, nor those who by their trades are exposed to the putrid effluvia of animals, for instance such tanners and butchers as keep their shops and halls very dirty, are more subject than others to putrid fevers. Nor are the ship-stewards and their servants, whose business it is to deliver out the provisions to the ships' crews, and who spend the most of their time amongst the putrid and rancid effluvia of the places in which those provisions are kept, more subject to putrid fevers than their ship-mates. But whatever be in this, we are well assured that some particular putrid fermentations produce noxious vapours, which, united with those of marshes, render them more pernicious. Hence evidently proceeds the extreme unhealthfulness of a place called Culpi, on the eastern bank of the Ganges. The shores about it are full of mud, and the banks covered with trees. Opposite to the place where the ships lie there is a creek, and about a mile from its entrance stands the town of Culpi; the ships lie about a mile from the shore. None of the sailors on board the ships stationed at this place enjoyed their health. The burying ground also contributed not a little to spread the infection. The ground being marshy, the putrid water flowed from the old graves into the new ones, which infected the grave-diggers and those that attended the funerals; and from this cause many were suddenly seized while they were performing the last duty to their companions. This place has ever been remarkable for the unhealthfulness of its air. It was once customary to send some of the Company's servants here to receive the cargoes of the ships, and send them to Calcutta; but so many of them died on this duty, that the Company was at length obliged to dispense with it.\n\nHence it plainly appears, how apt putrid animal and vegetable substances are to render the effluvia of\nfenny places more pernicious than they would otherwise be. The reason why great inundations of the Nile and Ganges are followed by a healthy season is, that by this means the putrid animal and vegetable substances dispersed over the contiguous countries are carried off into the sea.—The noxious vapors arising from fens spread but a little way. Dr Lind has often known ships crews at a very little distance from the shore quite free from this disorder. But although these marsh miasmata first bring on the disease, yet contagion particularly spreads it, and renders it more epidemic. Thus the Drake East Indiaman continued free from the disorder for two weeks together, when she had no communication with the other ships; but as soon as the disorder was brought on board, many were seized with it within a few days in such a manner as to leave no room to entertain the least doubt concerning its contagious nature.\n\nDr Lind of Hallar hospital has given a very curious and learned account of the appearance of this fever throughout the various parts of the globe. It was very common in England in the years 1765 and 1766, one obvious cause of which was the prevalence of the easterly wind. This wind in England is often said to bring with it a fog from the sea; but the truth of the matter is, that in many places of this island the easterly wind frequently raises a copious vapour from water, mud, and all marshy or damp places. To this exhaling quality of the easterly wind Dr Lind has often been an eye-witness. When the wind changes to the east, the mud sometimes sends up a vapour as thick as smoke; and the doctor has observed two fish ponds in his neighbourhood, one of fresh and the other of salt water, which on the approach of an easterly wind sometimes also emit a dense vapour, as from a pot of boiling water. In order to view this phenomenon distinctly, the person should stand at about 100 yards distance from the mud or ponds. If the sun shines when the wind changes to the east, he will observe a constant steam of vapours arising out of the ponds, from about five to ten yards in height, while the air about him remains serene. As the vapour or fog rising from other bodies glides along the surface of the earth, and is brought by the easterly wind to the ponds, he will still be able, for some time, to distinguish the vapours ascending perpendicularly out of the ponds from those which are carried in an horizontal direction by the wind; especially if the sun continues to shine, though faintly.\n\nThis evaporating quality of the easterly wind seems to manifest itself also by its effects both on the thermometer and the human body; for a thermometer hung over a damp piece of ground during the fogs or exhalations arising from it, will often indicate a degree of cold below the freezing point. The chilliness of the body, so sensibly perceived when in this situation, seems to proceed from the same cause, and to produce nearly the same sensations, which the damp arising from the wet floor of a chamber communicates to those who happen to be in it.\n\nWinds are not constant in their effects. As we have sometimes warm weather with a north-west wind, and sometimes very little heat with one blowing from the south; so the fogs attending an easterly wind are not constant, neither is the evaporation above mentioned at all times to be perceived. It is possible, however, that in all this there may be a deception; and that instead of supposing the quantity of vapors exhaled to be increased by an easterly wind, the coolness of that wind may only condense and render visible the vapors in the air at that time. But even this supposition is liable to great objections, as our coldest north-winds seldom or never produce such an effect, but on the contrary are attended with dry and serene weather.\n\nBe this as it will, however, an easterly wind is usually accompanied with a cold, damp, and unwholesome vapour, which is observed to affect the health both of animals and vegetables, and in many places to produce obstinate intermittent fevers, and also to occasion frequent relapses. In particular spots of the low damp island of Portsea, the ague frequently prevails during the autumnal season, and in some years is much more frequent and violent than in others. It is also observable, that this disease always attacks strangers, or those who have formerly lived on a drier soil, and in a more elevated situation, with greater severity than those who are natives of the island.\n\nThe year 1765 was remarkable, not only for the long continuance of the easterly winds, but for an excessive degree of heat, which produced a more violent and general appearance of those diseases than had been known for many years before. In the month of August the quicksilver in Fahrenheit's thermometer often rose to 82° in the middle of the day. This considerable addition of heat, together with the want of refreshing rains, greatly spread the fever, increased its violence, and even changed its form in many places. At Portsmouth, and throughout almost the whole island of Portsea, an alarming continual or remitting fever raged, which extended itself as far as Chichester. At the same time, the town of Gosport, though distant only one mile from Portsmouth, enjoyed an almost total exemption from sickness of every kind; whereas in the neighbouring villages and farm-houses, a mild regular tertian ague affected whole families. The violence of the fever, with its appearances in a continued, retreating, or intermittent form, marked in some measure the nature of the soil. In Portsmouth the symptoms were bad, worse at Kingston, and still more dangerous and violent at a place called Half-way House; a street so named, about half a mile from Portsmouth, where scarcely one in a family escaped this fever, which generally made its first attack with a delirium. In the large suburb of Portsmouth called the Common, it seemed to rage with more violence than in the town, some parts excepted; but even whole streets of this suburb, together with the houses in the dock-yard, escaped its attack.\n\nThe marines, who were three times a-week exercised early in the morning on Southsea beach, suffered much from the effect of the stagnant water in an adjoining marsh. Half a dozen of them were frequently taken ill in their ranks when under arms; some being seized with such a giddiness of their head, that they could scarcely stand; while others fell down speechless, and upon recovering their senses complained of a violent headache. When such patients were received into the hospital, it was observed that some few had a regular ague, but that far the greater number laboured under a remitting fever, in which sometimes indeed there was\nwas no perceptible remission for several days. A constant pain and giddiness of the head were the most inseparable and distressing symptoms of this disease. Some were delirious, and a few vomited up a quantity of bile; but in all the countenance was yellow. A long continuance of the fever produced a dropy or jaundice, or both. Even a flight attack reduced the most robust constitution to a state of extreme debility; and this weakness, together with the giddiness, continued for a long time after the fever. A scabby eruption now and then made its appearance on the lips and the corners of the mouth; but dry itchy spots over the whole body, resembling much the common itch, and seeming to partake of the nature of that disease, were more frequently observed in the patients at Portsmouth, where there was not the least reason to suspect any infection.\n\nSuch is the appearance of the remitting fever occasioned by marsh malaria in England. In the Netherlands its symptoms are not much different. Dr Lind informs us, that at Middleburg, the capital of West Zealand, a sickness generally reigns towards the latter end of August, or the beginning of September, which is always most violent after hot summers. It commences after the rains which fall in the end of July; the sooner it begins the longer it continues, and it is only checked by the coldness of the weather. Towards the end of August and beginning of September it is a continual burning fever, attended with a vomiting of bile, which is called the gall-sickness. This fever, after continuing three or four days, intermits, and assumes the form of a double tertian; leaving the patient in a fortnight, or perhaps sooner. Strangers that have been accustomed to breathe a dry pure air do not recover so quickly. Foreigners in indigent circumstances, such as the Scots and German soldiers, who are quartered in the adjacent places, are apt after those fevers to have a swelling in their legs and a dropy; of which many die.\n\nThese diseases, the doctor observes, are the same with the double tertians common within the tropics. Such as are seized with the gall-sickness have at first some flushes of heat over the body, a loss of appetite, a white foul tongue, a yellow tincture in the eyes, and a pale colour in the lips. Such as live well, drink wine, and have warm clothes and good lodgings, do not suffer so much during the sickly season as the poor people; however, these diseases are not infectious, and seldom prove mortal to the natives.\n\nSir John Pringle observes, that the prevailing epidemic of autumn in all marshy countries, is a fever of an intermittent nature, commonly of a tertian form, but of a bad kind; which, in the dampest places and worst seasons, appears as a double tertian, a remitting, or even an ardent fever. But however these fevers may vary in their appearance according to the constitution of the patient and other circumstances, they are all of a similar nature. For though, in the beginning of the epidemic, when the heat or rather the putrefaction in the air is the greatest, they assume a continued or a remitting form, yet by the end of autumn they usually terminate in regular intermittents.\n\nIn Zealand, where the air is more corrupted than in other parts of the Netherlands, this distemper is called the gall-sickness; and indeed both the redundancy and depravation of the bile is sometimes so great, that it has been generally ascribed to the corruption and overflowing of that humour. But though it cannot with justice be said to originate from corrupted bile, it is certain that the disease may be continued, and the symptoms aggravated, by an increased secretion and putrefaction of the bile occasioned by the fever. In proportion to the coolness of the season, to the height and dryness of the ground, this distemper is milder, remits or intermits more freely, and removes further from the nature of a continued fever. The higher ranks of people in general are least liable to the diseases of the marshes; for such countries require dry houses, apartments raised above the ground, moderate exercise, without labour in the sun or evening damps, a just quantity of fermented liquors, plenty of vegetables, and fresh meats. Without such helps, not only strangers, but the natives themselves, are sickly, especially after hot and close summers. The hardiest constitutions are very little excepted more than others; and hence the British in the Netherlands have always been liable to fevers.\n\nBy this distemper the British troops were harassed throughout the whole of the war from 1743 to 1747. It appeared in the month of August 1743; the paroxysms came on in the evening, with great heat, thirst, a violent headache, and often a delirium. These symptoms lasted most of the night, but abated in the morning, with an imperfect sweat, sometimes with a hemorrhage from the nose or a looseness. The stomach from the beginning was disordered with a nausea and sense of oppression, frequently with a bilious and offensive vomiting. If evacuations were either neglected, or too sparingly used, the patient fell into a continued fever, and sometimes grew yellow as in a jaundice. When the season was further advanced, this fever was attended with a cough, rheumatic pains, and fizzy blood. The officers being better accommodated than the common men, and the cavalry who had cloaks to keep them warm, were not so subject to it; and others who belonged to the army, but lay in quarters, were least of all affected; and the less in proportion to their being little exposed to heats, night-damps, and the other fatigues of the service.\n\nIn this manner did the remitting fever infect the army for the remaining years of the war; and that exactly in proportion to their distance from the marshy places, of which we have several notable instances in Pringle's observations. In Hungary the same disease appears with still more violence, and is readily complicated with fevers of a truly pestilential nature, by which means it becomes extremely dangerous. Hungary is acknowledged to be the most sickly climate in Europe, and indeed as bad as any in the world. Here it was where the crusaders in only marching through the country to invade Asia, often lost half their number by sickness; and where the Austrians not long since buried, in a few years, above 40,000 of their best troops, who fell a sacrifice to the malignant disposition of the Hungarian air. The reason of this uncommon malignity is, that Hungary abounds with rivers, which, by often overflowing, leave that low flat country overspread with lakes and ponds of stagnating water, and with large unwholesome marshes. So great is the impurity of these stagnated waters, that by them the rivers, even the Danube, whose course is slow, become in some places corrupted and offensive. The air is moist,\nmoist, and in summer quite sultry. In the nights of harvest, Kramer tells us, it was so very damp, that the Austrian soldiers could not secure themselves from the moisture even by a triple tent-covering. Here epidemical distempers begin constantly to rage during the hottest months of the year; which are July, August, and September: and these complaints, according to the observations of the physician above mentioned, are the same with those which are epidemic upon the coast of Guinea, and in the sickly climates of the East and West Indies, of which malignant fevers of the remitting and intermitting kind are the most common and dangerous.\n\nThe heat of the sun in Hungary is more intense than in any other country of Europe; and in proportion to the heat is the pestilential quality of the marshy exhalations. It is constantly observed, that the nearer any city or fort is to a morass or a large river with foul and oozy banks, the more unhealthy are the inhabitants. At such seaports and places, the air swarms with numberless insects and animalcules, a sure sign of its malignant disposition; and the hotter the summer, the more frequent and mortal are the diseases. In short, this country, on account of its unhealthiness, has been termed the grave of the Germans; and in Italy, the Campania of Rome is almost equally unhealthy. Lanchius, physician to Pope Clement XI., furnishes us with a very striking instance of the malignant quality of the air of Campania. Thirty gentlemen and ladies of the first rank in Rome having made an excursion, upon a party of pleasure, towards the mouth of the Tyber, the wind suddenly shifting, blew from the south over the putrid marshes, when 29 were immediately seized with a tertian fever, only one escaping.\n\nThe island of Sardinia is annually visited with an epidemical sickness, which rages from June to September, and is called by the natives the intemperies. In some years there is a want of rain for four or five months; and then it is that this sickness exerts its utmost violence, being always more fatal in some places than in others, and in particular to strangers. Of this the British had a severe proof in 1758.—Admiral Broderick, in the Prince ship of war, anchored in the bay of Orifagno, where 27 of his men, sent ashore on duty, were seized with the epidemical distemper of this island; twelve of them in particular, who had slept on shore, were brought on board delirious. All of them in general laboured under a low fever, attended with great oppression at the breast and at the pit of the stomach, a constant retching, and sometimes a vomiting of bile; upon which a delirium often ensued. These fevers changed into double tertians, and terminated in obstinate quartan agues. It is worthy of remark, that in this ship, which lay only two miles from the land, none were taken ill but such as had been on shore, of whom seven died. The prior of a convent, making a visit to the English officers, informed them, that the intemperies of the island was a remitting or intermitting fever, and that he himself had suffered several attacks of it. Sardinia was formerly so remarkable for its unwholesome air, that the Romans used to banish their criminals thither; and it is at present but thinly peopled, owing to the mortality occasioned by this annual sickness. For although it is about 140 miles long, and in several places 75 miles broad, yet it is computed that the whole number of its inhabitants does not exceed 250,000; an insignificant number, when compared with the inhabitants of the lesser, but comparatively more healthful, island of Corsica; though even there the French lost a number of their troops by intermitting and remitting fevers. In the island of Minorca, too, Dr Cleghorn informs us, that fevers of this kind prevail exceedingly; that their types are various, their symptoms violent, the intermissions fallacious, and that they frequently and suddenly prove fatal. It is more than probable, he adds, from the accounts of several physicians and travellers, that epidemical tertians are not wholly confined to the coasts and islands of the Mediterranean, but that they are equally frequent and destructive in many other parts of the globe; and perhaps may be deemed the anniversary autumnal distempers of most hot countries in the world. And though in the mild climate of Britain, a tertian may easily be cured when it is discovered; yet in warm climates, such is the rapid progress of the distemper, that it is necessary to know it in the very beginning, which is very difficult for those who have never seen any but the tertians usually met with in Britain.\n\nFrom Dr Cleghorn's account of Minorca, however, it doth not appear why that island should be so much infested with fevers of this kind, since it is far from being a marshy country; nay, on the contrary, is very dry. The south wind, he observes, is very unhealthy; and it is the prevalence of this wind which brings on the fever; but still the difficulty is not removed, because the sea air is so far from bringing on such dangerous diseases, that it is one of the greatest preservatives against them. As to the moisture which must necessarily accompany an insular situation, that cannot reasonably be admitted as a cause of this or any other disease. In the London Medical Observations we find a paper on a subject very similar to the present, namely, the mischief produced by lying in damp sheets, or being exposed to moist vapour. The author tells us, that he hardly knows a distemper the origin of which has not by some been ascribed to lying in a damp bed, or sitting in a wet room; and yet he does not know any one which will certainly be produced by these causes, and people frequently expose themselves to such causes without suffering any ill effects. \"It must be owned indeed, (says he), that the vapours arising from the bilge-water of ships tend to produce a scurvy. The swampy plains also near the mouths of great rivers which are often overflowed, and low grounds which cannot readily be drained, and those tracts of land where the thickness and extent of the woods keep the ground moist and half putrid for want of ventilation, are destructive to the neighbouring inhabitants, by occasioning oblate intermittents in the colder climates, and pestilential fevers in the hotter regions. But all this mischief arises not merely from moisture, but from an unventilated and putrid moisture; for the insufficiency of mere wetness, untainted with putridity, may be reasonably inferred from the following considerations. The air is often fully saturated with moisture; and yet neither is any epidemical distemper produced by it, nor are those remarkably aggravated with which the sick happen at that time to be afflicted. The air from rivers and from the sea is probably more replenished...\ned with vapours than inland countries cleared of their woods: yet the most celebrated of the ancient physicians recommended the bank of a running river for the situation of a house, on account of its peculiar healthfulness; and many invalids are sent by the modern physicians to the sea side, only for the benefit of the sea air.\n\n\"Where the sailors are cleanly, and not too much crowded, they are often as healthy during long voyages at sea, as they would have been upon any part of the land. Venice is not observed to be less healthy than London or Paris.\n\n\"Those who are much disposed to sweat, lie many hours in bedclothes impregnated probably with a less wholesome moisture than would have been left in the sheets half-dried after washing; and there is no reason to think that any remarkable injury was done to the health by the continuance of such sweats almost every night for weeks, and for months, except what arose from the too great copiousness of this evacuation.\n\n\"Children, and such as are troubled with the stone, and those who, from other infirmities or age, constantly wet their beds with their urine, do not appear to suffer in their health on this account.\n\n\"It is a common practice, in some disorders, to go to bed with the legs or arms wrapped in linen cloths thoroughly soaked in Malvern water, so that the sheets will be in many places as wet as they can be; and I have known these patients and their bedfellows receive no harm from a continuance of this practice for many months. Nor can it be said that the Malvern water is more innocent than any other water might be, on account of any ingredients with which it is impregnated; for the Malvern water is purer than that of any other spring in England which I ever examined.\n\n\"The greatest valetudinarians do not scruple to sprinkle lavender-water upon their sheets; and yet, when the spirit is flown off, there is left what is as truly water as if it had been taken from the river.\n\n\"Is it observed, that laundresses are peculiarly unhealthy above other women, though they live half their time in the midst of wet linen, in an air fully saturated with vapours? Many other employments might be mentioned, the persons occupied in which are constantly exposed to wet floors or pavements, or to be surrounded with watery vapours, or to have their clothes often wet for many hours together.\n\n\"Is it the coldness of wet linen which is to be feared? But shirts and sheets, colder than any unfrozen water can be, are safely worn and lain in by many persons, who, during a hard frost, neither warm their flirts nor their sheets.—Or does the danger lie in the dampness? But then how comes it to pass, that a warm or cold bath, and long-continued fomentations, can be used, without the destruction of those who use them? Or is it from both together? Yet we have long heard of the thickness and continuance of the cold fogs in the seas north-west of England, but have never yet been told of any certain ill effect which they have upon those that live in these countries.\"\n\nWith regard to the causes of fevers, however, Dr Lind is of opinion, that noxious vapours arising from the earth are for the most part to be blamed. Even in countries seemingly dry, and where violent rains are not frequent, he thinks that the air may load itself with putrid exhalations from the ground; and that, except in the burning deserts of Arabia or Africa, people are nowhere exempt from diseases occasioned by putrid moisture. In most of the hot countries, the pernicious effects of the putrid vapours are by no means equivocal. In Guinea, they seem to be more extraordinary than anywhere else in the world; neither indeed can it be supposed, that a hot and moist atmosphere can be without putrefaction. It may in general be remarked, that in fusty climates, or during hot weather, in all places subject to great rains, where the country is not cleared and cultivated, but is overrun with thickets, thubs, or woods, especially if there are marshes or stagnating waters in the neighbourhood, sickness may be dreaded, and particularly the remitting fever of which we now treat. The fens, even in different counties of England, are known to be very prejudicial to the health of those who live near them, and still more so to strangers; but the woody and marshy lands in hot countries are much more pernicious to the health of Europeans. In all those unhealthy places, particularly during fogs or rains, a raw vapour, disagreeable to the smell, arises from the earth, and especially in the huts or houses. But of all the vapours which infect the torrid zone, the most malignant and fatal are the harmattans: They are said to arise from the confluence of several rivers in the king of Dormo's dominions at Benin (the most unwholesome part of Guinea), where travellers are obliged to be carried on men's backs for several days journey, through swampy grounds, and over marshes, amidst tinkling ooze, and thickets of mangrove trees which are annually overgrown. These vapours come up the coast to a surprising distance, with the south-east and north-east winds: and it has been observed, that in their progress they have often changed both the course of the winds and of the sea-currents. The times of their appearance at Cape Coast are the months of December, January, or February. The north-east and south-east winds are always unhealthy, but particularly so during the harmattan season. In some years this vapour is scarcely perceptible; but in others it is thick, noxious, and destructive to the blacks as well as whites.—The mortality is in proportion to the density and duration of the fog. It has a raw putrid smell; and is sometimes so thick, that a person or house cannot be discerned through it at the distance of 15 or 20 yards; and it continues so for 10 or 14 days; during which it opens the seams of ships, splits or opens the crevices of wood as if shrunk or dried with a great fire, and destroys both man and beast.—In the year 1754 or 1755, the mortality occasioned in Guinea by this stinking fog was so great, that in several negro towns the living were scarce sufficient to bury the dead.—Twenty women brought from Holland by a new governor to the Castle del Mina, perished, together with most of the men in the garrison. The gates of Cape Coast castle were shut up for want of centinels to do duty; the blacks dying at this time as well as the white people. It is lucky that it is only in some years that harmattans are so very thick and noxious, otherwise that part of the country would be depopulated. It is observed that all fogs are extremely unhealthy in those parts, particularly before and after the rainy seasons; but the above account of the harmattans appeared so very extraordinary and incredible to some of Dr Lind's readers, that he thought proper to publish.\npublish a further corroboration of the facts above mentioned. \"A gentleman (says he), who had long resided at Cape Coast castle, informed me, that during the time of this fog, being in the upper chambers of the fort, the boards of the floor shrunk so much, that he could discern the candles burning in the apartments below him (there are no plaster ceilings used in those hot countries), and that he could then even distinguish what people were doing in the apartments below; the seams of the floor having opened above half an inch while the fog lasted, which afterwards, upon its being dispelled, became close and tight as before.\"\n\nIn Africa the rains and dews seem to be possessed of qualities almost equally pernicious with the fogs. This much is certain, that in Guinea, many of the principal negroes, and especially of the mulatto Portuguese, take the utmost precaution to avoid being wet with those rains, especially such as fall first. At the setting in of the rainy season, they generally shut themselves up in a close well-thatched hut, where they keep a constant fire, smoke tobacco, and drink brandy, as preservatives against the noxious quality of the air at that time. When wet by accident with the rain, they immediately plunge themselves into salt-water, if near it. Those natives generally bathe once a day, but never in the fresh water rivers when they are overflowed with the rains; at such times they prefer for that purpose the water of springs. The first rains which fall in Guinea are commonly supposed to be the most unhealthy. They have been known, in 48 hours, to render the leather of the shoes quite mouldy and rotten; they stain clothes more than any other rain; and soon after their commencement, even places formerly dry and parched swarm with frogs. At this time skins, part of the traffic of Senegal, quickly generate large worms; and it is remarked, that the fowls, which greedily prey on other insects, refuse to feed on these. It has been further observed, that woollen cloths wet in those rains, and afterwards hung up to dry in the sun, have sometimes become full of maggots in a few hours.—It is also probable, that as in some of those countries the earth, for six or eight months of the year, receives no moisture from the heavens but what falls in dews, which every night renew the vegetation, the surface of the ground in many places becomes hard and incrusted with a dry scurf, which pens up the vapours below; until, by the continuance of the rains for some time, this crust is softened, and the long pent up vapours set free. That these dews do not penetrate deep into the earth is evident from the constant dryness and hardness of such spots of ground in those countries as are not covered with grass and other vegetables. Thus the large rivers in the dry season being confined within narrow bounds, leave a great part of their channel uncovered, which having its moisture totally exhaled, becomes a solid hard crust; but no sooner the rains fall, than by degrees this long parched up crust of earth and clay gradually softens, and the ground, which before had not the least smell, begins to emit a stench, which in four or five weeks becomes exceedingly noisome, at which time the sickness is generally most violent.\n\nThis sickness, however, is not different from the remitting fever which has been described under so many various forms and names. An inflammatory fever is seldom observed, during the season of sickness, in this part of the world; and we shall conclude our description of the *amphinerina paludosa* with some extracts from the surgeon's journal in a ship that sailed up the rivers of Guinea.\n\n\"On the 5th of April we sailed up the river of Gambia, and found all the English in the fort in perfect health. The surgeons of the factory informed me, that a relaxation of the stomach, and consequently a weakened digestion, seemed to bring on most of the distempers fatal to Europeans in the rainy season. They were generally of a bilious nature, attended with a low fever, sometimes of a malignant, at other times of a remitting kind.—On the 12th of April, after sailing 30 miles up the river St Domingo, we came to Catchou, a town belonging to the Portuguese, in Lat. 25° N. In this town were only four white people, the governor, and three friars. The number of whites in the trading ships was 51. One morning, towards the latter end of April, a little rain fell. On the 13th of May there was a second shower, accompanied with a tornado. On the 18th of May it rained the whole day; and the rain continued, with but short intervals, until the beginning of October.\n\n\"In the month of June, almost two-thirds of the white people were taken ill. Their sickness could not be well characterized by any denomination commonly applied to fevers: it however approached nearest to what is called a nervous fever, as the pulse was always low, and the brain and nerves seemed principally affected. It had also a tendency to frequent remissions. It began sometimes with a vomiting, but oftener with a delirium. Its attack was commonly in the night; and the patients, being then delirious, were apt to run into the open air. I observed them frequently recover their senses for a short time, by means of the heavy rain which fell upon their naked bodies. But the delirium soon returned: they afterwards became comatose, their pulse sunk, and a train of nervous symptoms followed; their skin often became yellow; bilious vomitings and stools were frequent symptoms. The fever reduced the patient's strength so much, that it was generally six weeks or two months before he was able to walk abroad. A confining flux, a jaundice, a dropy, or obstructions in the bowels, were the consequences of it. Of 51 white men, being the companies of four ships which were at Catchou, one third died of the fever, and one-third more of the flux, and other diefeases consequent upon it; and of these not one was taken ill till the rains began.\n\n\"I believe, on the whole face of the earth, there is hardly to be found a more unhealthy country than this during the rainy season: and the idea I then conceived of our white people was by making a comparison of their breathing such a noxious air, with a number of river-fish put into stagnating water; where, as the water corrupts, the fish grow less lively, they droop, pine away, and many die.\n\n\"Thus some persons became dull, inactive, or slightly delirious, at intervals; and, without being so much as confined to their beds, they expired in that delirious and comatose state in less than 48 hours, after being in apparent good health. The white people in general became yellow; their stomachs could not receive much food without loathing and retchings. Indeed, it is no wonder that this sickness proved so fatal, that recoveries...\"\nries from it were so tedious, and that they were attended with fluxes, dropsies, the jaundice, ague-cakes, and other dangerous chronical distempers. It seems more wonderful to me that any white people ever recover, while they continue to breathe so pestiferous an air as that at Catchou during the rainy season. We were, as I have already observed, 30 miles from the sea, in a country altogether uncultivated, overflowed with water, surrounded with thick impenetrable woods, and overrun with slime. The air was vitiated, noisome, and thick; insomuch that the lighted torches or candles burnt dim, and seemed ready to be extinguished: even the human voice lost its natural tone. The smell of the ground and of the houses was raw and offensive; but the vapour arising from putrid water in the ditches was much worse. All this, however, seemed tolerable, when compared with the infinite numbers of insects swarming everywhere, both on the ground and in the air; which, as they seemed to be produced and cherished by the putrefaction of the atmosphere, so they contributed greatly to increase its impurity. The wild bees from the woods, together with millions of ants, overrun and destroyed the furniture of the houses; at the same time, swarms of cockroaches often darkened the air, and extinguished even candles in their flight; but the greatest plague was the musquitoes and sand-flies, whose incessant buzz and painful stings were more insupportable than any symptom of the fever. Besides all these, an incredible number of frogs on the banks of the river made such a constant and disagreeable croaking, that nothing but being accustomed to such an hideous noise could permit the enjoyment of natural sleep. In the beginning of October, as the rains abated, the weather became very hot; the woods were covered with abundance of dead frogs, and other vermin, left by the receds of the river; all the mangroves and shrubs were likewise overspread with slimy slime.\"\n\nAfter so particular a description of the remitting fever in many different parts of the world, we presume it will be needless to take notice of any little varieties which may occur in the warm parts of America, as both the nature and cure of the distemper are radically the same: neither shall we lengthen out this article with further descriptions of remitting fevers from the works of foreign authors, as, from what we have already said, their nature cannot easily be mistaken.\n\nCure. The great difficulty in the cure of remitting fevers arises from their not being simple diseases, but a complication of several. Fevers, properly speaking, have but three or four different appearances which they can assume without a complication. One is, when they are attended with a phlogistic diathesis; another is, when they assume the form of genuine intermittents; a third is, when they produce a great debility of the nervous system; and the fourth is, when along with this debility there is also a rapid tendency to putrefaction. If, therefore, all these species happen to make an attack at once, the most dangerous fever we can imagine will be produced; and however contrary it may be to our theories to admit the possibility of such an attack, the truth of the fact is too often confirmed by fatal experience. In the beginning of remittent fevers, for instance, the symptoms indicate a high degree of inflammation; but if the practitioner attempts to remove this inflammation by blood-letting or other evacuations, the pulse sinks irrecoverably, and the person dies with such symptoms as show that the nervous system has been from the beginning greatly affected; at the same time the high stimulants and cordials, or cinchona, which would have conquered the nervous part of the disease, increase the inflammatory part of it to such a degree, that, by a too early exhibition of them, the patient also dies, but after another manner.\n\nIn the remitting fever of the East Indies, Dr Lind of Windfor formed the following indications of cure:\n\n1. To allay the violence of the fever.\n2. To evacuate the putrid humours, and take great care to prevent the body from inclining to putrefaction.\n3. To keep up the strength of the patient as much as possible during the disorder.\n4. To lose no time in preventing the return of the paroxysms.\n\nTo allay the violence of the fever, every thing that can contribute to increase it ought to be carefully avoided or removed; such as great heat, too strong a light falling on the eyes, noise, and motion. If during the paroxysm the head and loins be affected with violent pains, the pulse be full and hard, and the heat intense, bleeding may be used, but with the greatest caution: for, however useful this operation may be in cold climates, the success of it in warm ones is so far from being certain, that the lives of the patients have been often very much endangered, nay even destroyed by it. Dr Badenoch, and the surgeon of the Pomfoborne, endeavoured each of them to relieve two patients by blood-letting; and the consequence was, that each of them lost one patient. Dr Lind bled two patients; one of whom was Mr Richardson, the first mate of the ship, who complained of a most violent pain in his head, with a full hard pulse. About four or five ounces of blood were taken from him, by which he was greatly relieved: nor was the cure retarded by it; nay, the fever afterwards became less irregular. At the time the other patient was bled, the disease was exceedingly frequent and violent. He was so earnest for bleeding, that he fired all the rest with the same desire, swearing, that by refusing them this only remedy, every one of them would be sent to their graves. To quiet them, therefore, and get quit of their opportunities, the doctor complied with their request, and took about five or six ounces from him who had been the first to require it. The consequence was, that he immediately lost his strength; and in less than an hour, during which time he made his will, was carried off by the next fit. It is necessary, however, to observe, and indeed the doctor himself makes the observation, with regard to this patient, that he was bled at an improper time, namely, between the fits; whereas, had he been bled in the hot fit, it is possible he might have been relieved.\n\nIn support of the advantages to be derived from bleeding under proper circumstances, we have the authority both of Cleghorn and Pringle. As Dr Cleghorn practised in a very hot country, his observations must in the present case have greater weight than those of Pringle, who practised in a colder one. The former acquaints us, that if he was called in early enough, unless there was a strong contra-indication, he always used to take away some blood from people\npeople of all ages; namely, from robust adults, 15 or 12 ounces; from others a smaller quantity, in proportion to their strength and years. And further, if a violent headache, obtinate delirium, and heat or pains of the bowels, were urgent, the bleeding was repeated within a day or two. By this feasible evacuation, he found the vehemence of all the paroxysms somewhat diminished; the apyrexia became more complete; the operation of emetics and cathartics rendered safer and more successful; and the terrible symptoms which happened about the height of the distemper, such as raving fevers, difficulty of breathing, inflammations of the abdominal viscera, &c., were either prevented or mitigated. But if the fever had continued for some time before he was called, and the mass of blood appeared to be too much melted down or inclined to a putrid dissolution, he either abstained from bleeding entirely, or took away a very small quantity, though some urgent symptoms might seem to require a larger evacuation. As to the time of performing the operation, he acquaints us, that it is safe enough, except when the cold fit lasts or is soon expected, or while the skin is covered with critical sweats; and that he usually opened a vein in the beginning of the hot fit; by which means the sick were relieved, the immoderate heat of the body, which is often productive of fatal effects, was diminished, and the critical sweats brought off sooner and in greater abundance.\n\nBut though Dr Lind found venesection to be of such pernicious tendency in his patients, cooling acidulated liquors were of the utmost service, as they corrected the putrid humours, lessened the heat and thirst, and of course prevented the fever from arriving at so great an height as it would otherwise have done. Those cooling liquors are the best which are made up with some farinaceous substance, as they most easily unite with our fluids. Follicle acids too, and crystals of tartar, especially the latter, are of considerable use, not only in this, but in other fevers. The neutral salts, prepared with the juice of lemons, were likewise given with success during the heat of the fever. They lessen the nausea, the fits become more regular, and the resolutions more full; and they are particularly grateful when given in a state of effervescence. The good effects of these draughts we are in a great measure to attribute to the antifebric quality of the fixed air extracted from them during the effervescence.\n\nDuring the remission, it is proper to evacuate the putrid humours by small doses of ipecacuanha, or rather tartar emetic. The tartar emetic indeed appears to be endowed with some kind of febrifuge virtue, which Dr Cullen thinks is owing to its relaxing the febrile spasms taking place in the capillary vessels. But should there appear any symptoms of a topical inflammation in some of the abdominal viscera, a thing which never happens unless the disorder has been of some standing, vomiting is to be avoided, and we are to depend upon purgatives alone for the evacuation of the putrid bile. These are always useful in the cure of this disorder. But all acrid and strong purgatives are to be carefully avoided, and only the mild antifebric ones made use of, such as crystals of tartar, or tamarinds made up with manna or with Glauber's salt.\n\nThough in these diseases there is a great quantity of putrefied bile collected in the body, yet it seems much more probable that this is the effect than the cause of the disorder; and therefore, though we carry off the quantity collected ever so often, more of the same kind will still be produced by the putrefactive disposition of the other fluids, at the same time that the strength of the patient must necessarily be diminished by repeated evacuations, when it ought rather to be kept up by all possible means. We ought well to observe, however, that the mineral acids have not that property of sweetening putrid bile which the vegetable ones have; and therefore the same relief will not be given by them which might reasonably be expected from vinegar or lemon juice.\n\nIn order to keep up the strength of the patient, good food is absolutely necessary. Dr Lind allowed the sick small meals of panada made with boiled rice and barley mixed with currants or raisins and prunes, seasoned with sugar and a little wine, especially claret. During the paroxysms, they had gruel made of flour and rice, with sugar and the juice of acid fruit; and when the fit went off, a little wine was added to this mixture.\n\nThe shirts and bedding must be very often changed and well aired; their stools, and all filth and nastiness, are to be immediately removed; the places where they are lodged, should be well aired and frequently sprinkled with vinegar; and, in the last place, the sick must be exceedingly well nursed. Blistering, according to Dr Lind, should never be used till the fever has been of long continuance, or the spirits and pulse of the patient have begun to flag. But here our author has implicitly followed Dr Huxham, whose theory concerning the use of blisters is now found to be erroneous. According to that celebrated author, blisters are capable of doing considerable hurt in all cases where there is a tendency to inflammation, by increasing the motion of the fluids and the oscillatory power of the vessels, both of which are already too great. They are also improper, according to him, where there is a considerable tendency of the fluids to putrefaction; because he supposes the faults of these flies to operate in the same manner with volatile alkalies, that is, by dilolving and putrefying the blood still farther. But Sir John Pringle has shown, that, in inflammatory fevers as well as those of the putrid kind, both blisters and volatile salts may be of service; the latter, particularly, he hath experimentally proved to be so far from promoting putrefaction, that they are exceedingly strong antifebrics.\n\nIn the East Indies, Dr Lind found it absolutely necessary to exhibit the Peruvian bark in large quantities, and as early as possible. By this method he not only secured the patient from the imminent danger of death to which he was exposed at every fit, but likewise conquered those obstructions which were apt to ensue in the abdominal viscera, and which are to be attributed to the continuance of the disorder, and not to the bark employed to cure it. He always gave the cinchona during the second remission, as all his care was during the first to cleanse the prime vein. He observes, however, that it is to no purpose to give the bark till the necessary purgations are over; but affirms us, that it never fails, unless from the coming on of a vomiting\nor diarrhoea it cannot be taken in sufficient quantities before the return of a paroxysm. To prevent the medicine from vomiting or purging, he mixed a few drops of liquid laudanum with every dose of it. Half a dram was given every half hour in some convenient vehicle, beginning as soon as the fever had considerably abated, and the pulse was returned nearly to its natural state; both which generally happened before the sweats were over. An ounce of the bark was sometimes found too little to check the fever, but an ounce and a half never failed. It must be continued daily in small doses till the patient has recovered his strength, and then a greater quantity must be given, especially at the season when the rivers overflow the country.\n\nDr Pringle found the autumnal remittents in the Netherlands complicated with a great many inflammatory symptoms; for which reason it was generally found necessary to open a vein in the beginning. The venereal and later autumnal remitting fevers are accompanied with pleuritic and rheumatic pains from the coldness of the weather, and on that account require more bleeding. A physician unacquainted with the nature of the disease, and attending chiefly to the paroxysms and remissions, would be apt to omit this evacuation entirely, and give the cinchona too soon, which would bring on a continued inflammatory fever. In these countries a vein may be safely opened either during the remission or in the height of a paroxysm; and our author also found good effects resulting from bleeding in the hot fits of the marsh fever, even after it had almost come to regular intermissions. After bleeding, a purgative was usually exhibited, of which he gives us the following formula.\n\nR. Infusi fenni commun. 3ij.\nElect. Lenitiv. 3/s.\nNitr. pur. 3i.\nTinct. fen. 5vi. M.\n\nOf this only one half was taken at once; and if it did not operate twice in four hours, the remainder was then taken. This potion agreed with the stomach, purged plentifully, and therefore was a very useful composition. Next morning, when there was almost always some remission, he gave one grain of emetic tartar rubbed with 12 grains of crabs-eyes, and repeated the dose in two hours, if the first had little or no effect; or at any rate in four hours. This medicine was intended not only to vomit, but also to operate by stool, and excite a sweat. If these evacuations were procured, the fever generally became easier, and was even sometimes cured. This he prefers to the ipecacuanha, and therefore in the latter years of his practice diluted that root entirely. The same medicine was repeated next day or the day following; or if not, a laxative clyster was thrown up; and this method was continued till the fever either went off altogether, or intermittent in such a manner as to be cured by the cinchona.\n\nA similar method was followed by Dr Huck in the remitting fevers of the West Indies and North America. In the beginning he let blood; and in the first remission gave four or five grains of ipecacuanha, with from half a grain to two grains of emetic tartar. This powder he repeated in two hours, taking care that the patient should not drink before the second dose; for Tertiana, then the medicine more readily passed into the bowels after it had operated by vomiting. If, after two hours more, the operation either way was small, he gave a third dose, which commonly had a good effect in opening the first pallages; and then the fever either went quite off, or intermittent in such a manner as to yield to the bark. On the continent, he found little difficulty after the intermission; but in the West Indies, unless he gave the cinchona upon the very first intermission, though imperfect, the fever was apt to assume a continued and dangerous form.\n\nIn the remitting fevers of hot countries, however, it must be observed, that the lancet must in all cases be much more sparingly used than in similar diseases of the colder regions; and we must also be sparing of venefaction in those countries where the marsh effluvia are very strong and prevail much. For this reason Dr Lind of Hallar greatly condemns the practice of indiscriminate bleeding when people first arrive in hot climates. The first diseases indeed which occur in a voyage to the southward are, for the most part, of an inflammatory nature, and owing to a sudden transition from cold to hot weather. This occasions a fullness and diffusion of the vessels; whence all Europeans, on their first arrival under the tropic, bear evacuations much better than afterwards. The practice of indiscriminately bleeding, however, a number of the ship's company when they first come into a warm latitude, is by no means found to answer the purpose of a preventive. In such cases, indeed, as plainly indicate a plethoric disposition brought on by the heat, blood-letting is certainly useful. The signs of this are a pain and giddiness in the head; a heaviness and dulness of the eyes, which sometimes appear slightly inflamed; there is also commonly a sense of weight and fulness in the breast, the pulse at the same time being quick and oppressed.\n\nBut the case is quite different after a longer continuance of sultry weather, and when the constitution is in some measure habituated to the hot climate. For it is then observed, that the symptoms of inflammations in the bowels, even the most dangerous, are not near so severe in such climates as in cold countries; nor can the patients bear such large evacuations. The physician, however, must take care not to be misled by the apparent mildness of the symptoms; for he will find, notwithstanding such deceitful appearances, that the inflammation makes a more rapid progress in hot countries than in cold, suppurations and mortifications being much more suddenly formed; and that in general all acute distempers come sooner to a crisis in the warm than in colder regions. Hence it is an important rule of practice in those climates, to seize the most early opportunity, in the commencement of all threatening inflammations, to make frequent though not copious evacuations by blood-letting. For by delay the inflammation quickly passes from its first to its last or fatal stage; at least, an imperfect crisis in such inflammatory fevers ensues, which fixes an obstruction in the visceræ extremely difficult to remove.\n\nIt is indeed a general maxim with some physician in the West Indies, that in most acute distempers bleeding in that country is prejudicial. This is founded upon a supposition that the coagamentum of the blood\nis thinned, and the solids greatly weakened, by the heat of the climate. It is therefore objected, that bleeding in such an habit of body weakens the powers of nature, and withdraws the strength which is requisite to support the patient until the crisis of the fever.\n\nThis reasoning is partly just; but, like all general maxims, will admit of exceptions. First, with regard to sailors, it is to be remembered, that they are more exposed to quick vicissitudes of heat, cold, damps, and to various changes of the air and weather, than most of the other inhabitants of the Torrid Zone. Add to this, that their intemperance, and the excesses they are apt to fall into whenever it is in their power to commit them, render them more liable to inflammations than any other set of people. Hence their deficiencies require more plentiful evacuations than the land-inhabitants of those parts of the world, and generally they bear them better. But with regard to the natives of the country, or those who have remained long there, it must be proper to bleed them very sparingly, making allowance for the different seasons of the year, the temperature of the air, and the situation of the places where they reside. Thus, in some parts, even on the island of Jamaica, at particular seasons, the weather is cool; therefore, in these places, and at such seasons, the inhabitants having their fibres more rigid, and a firmer crisis of their blood, bear venefection much better.\n\nIn cold countries the state of the air greatly assists in restoring the impaired spring of the fibres; whereas everything almost in warm weather, such as heat, moisture, &c., concur to relax and weaken the habit of body. Thus we may daily see persons in Britain, after having suffered a most severe fit of sickness, recover their strength and spirits in a few days, and in a very short time their natural constitution. But the case is very different in the fusty regions of the Torrid Zone, or indeed in any part of the world where the heat of the season causes the mercury to stand for any length of time at the 77th degree and upward of Fahrenheit's thermometer. During such an excess of heat, debility after fevers is apt to remain with European constitutions for several months. In Jamaica, the convalescents are sent to the cool summits of the mountains; but a retreat to a more northern climate is often absolutely necessary to recover their wonted tone and vigour of body. It is a well-established observation, that the negroes and aborigines of the Torrid Zone cannot bear plentiful evacuations by the lancet. They commonly mix the most stimulating poignant spices with their ordinary light food, and this is found by experience suitable to their constitutions.\n\nAs proper preventives for the dangerous fevers of which we are treating, Dr Lind on all occasions recommends the avoiding of stagnant water, or putrid marshes; the use of proper food, cleanliness, and sobriety. Of the propriety of removing from the neighbourhood of those places whose pestilential effluvia produce the disorders, we cannot possibly entertain a doubt; and of the efficacy of proper food in preventing putrid disorders he gives a remarkable instance in the Sheerness man of war, bound to the East Indies. As they went out, the men being apprehensive of sickness in so long a voyage, petitioned the captain Tertiana, not to oblige them to take up their salt provisions, but rather to permit them to live upon the other species of their allowance. It was therefore ordered, that they should be served with salt-meat only once a-week; and the consequence was, that, after a passage of five months and one day, the ship arrived at the Cape of Good Hope without having a single person sick on board. As the use of Sutton's pipes had been then newly introduced into the king's ships, the captain was willing to ascribe part of such an uncommon healthfulness to their beneficial effects; but it was soon discovered, that, by the neglect of the carpenter, the cock of the pipes had all this while been kept shut. This ship remained in India some months, where none of the men, except the boat's crew, had the benefit of going on shore; notwithstanding which, the crew continued to enjoy the most perfect state of health; they were, however, well supplied with fresh meat. On leaving India, knowing they were to stop at the Cape of Good Hope, and trusting to a quick passage, and the abundance of refreshments to be had there, they ate their full allowance of salt meats, during a passage of only 10 weeks; and it is to be remarked the air-pipes were now opened. The effects of this was, that when they arrived at the Cape, 20 of them were afflicted in a most miserable manner with scurvy and other disorders. These, however, were speedily recovered by the refreshments they met with on shore. Being now thoroughly sensible of the beneficial effects of eating, in these southern climates, as little salt meat as possible when at sea, they unanimously agreed, in their voyage home from the Cape, to refrain from their too plentiful allowance of salt flesh. And thus the Sheerness arrived at Spithead, with her full complement of 160 men in perfect health and with unbroken constitutions, having in this voyage of 14 months and 15 days buried but one man, who died in a mercurial salivation.\n\nThus we see, that a free and pure air is not a sufficient preservative against a putrefactive state of the fluids, without proper food; and, on the other hand, we have a very remarkable instance of the inefficacy of the most salutary food to prevent putrid diseases, in a very noxious state of the atmosphere. In the year 1717, at the siege of Belgrade in Hungary, the fever of the country, and the flux, occasioned a most extraordinary mortality among the troops. The dread of these diseases caused every one, as may naturally be supposed, to have recourse to different precautions for self-preservation. Prince Eugene, the commander in chief, had water and the provisions for his table sent him twice a-week from Vienna. The pure stream of the river Kahlenberg was regularly brought to him: he avoided all excesses, and lived regularly, or rather abstemiously; refreshed himself often by eating a cool melon; and mixed his usual wine, which was Burgundy, with water. Yet, notwithstanding his utmost care, he was seized with a dysentery; which would have quickly put an end to his life, had not the speedy conclusion of that campaign permitted him to make a quick retreat.\n\nAt this unhealthy season, when hardly one imperial officer, much less their several domestics, escaped those malignant diseases, the renowned Count Bonneval and his\nhis numerous retinue continued in perfect health, to the surprize, or to use the words, of Dr Kramer, to the envy, of all who beheld them. The only precaution he used, was to take, two or three times a day, a small quantity of brandy in which the Peruvian bark was infused; and he obliged all his attendants and domestics to follow his example. It is no less remarkable that the count, placing his certain preferment in the use of this single medicine, lived for many years afterwards in the most unhealthy spots of Hungary, without any attack or apprehension of disease; and continued to enjoy a perfect state of health during the hottest and most fickle seasons. And thus, with an unbroken and sound constitution, which is seldom the case of those who reside long in such climates, he lived to a great age. There is an instance produced by the same author, of a whole regiment in Italy having been preserved by the use of cinchona from the attack of these malignant diseases, viz. the flux, and bilious fever as it is frequently called, when the rest of the Austrian army, not pursuing that method, became greatly annoyed with them.\n\nThe intemperance and irregular living of those Europeans who visit the hot climates is frequently accused as the cause of their destruction; but our author thinks, without sufficient reason; for though intemperance will make the body more liable to receive such diseases, it will not bring them on. It must by no means, however, be imagined, that in those climates Europeans may with impunity be guilty of excesses in eating or drinking: for the least error in that way will often prove fatal by debilitating the body, whose utmost strength in time of full health was perhaps scarce sufficient to resist the pestilential miasmata of the atmosphere.\n\nIt appears, therefore, from the concurrent testimony of the most eminent physicians, that the most proper medicine to be used, either as a preventive or cure for remitting and intermitting disorders, is the Peruvian bark, administered with proper precautions and after the prince viz have been evacuated of the putrid bilious matter collected in them. In those species of triteophyta, &c. belonging to this class, enumerated by Sauvages, the same remedies only were useful; but in that pestilential distemper which he calls triteophyta Vraiflaviensis, he tells us, that walking the body with water sometimes hot, sometimes cold, watery clysters, and plenty of aqueous drink, were likewise of use.\n\n**Genus II.

A.**\n*Quartana legitima, Sauv. fp. 1. Sydenham de morb. acut. cap. v.*\n\n**Description.** The genuine quartan, according to Juncker, keeps its form more exactly than other intermittents; scarcely coming on at any other time than four or five in the afternoon. The cold is less violent than in the tertian; but is very perceptible, though it doth not proceed to such a height as to make the limbs shake; it continues for about two hours. It is preceded and accompanied by a languor both of body and mind. There is seldom any vomiting unless when the stomach is manifestly overloaded with aliment; neither is there any diarrhoea, but the belly in general is rather bound, not only on the days on which the paroxysm takes place, but also on the intermediate ones. The heat, which slowly succeeds the cold, is less troublesome to the patient by its violence than by the uneasy dryness of the skin, which is scarcely ever moistened with sweat. This heat rarely continues longer than four or five hours, unless perhaps at the first or second paroxysm. It is accompanied also with a giddiness and dull pain of the head. On the termination of the paroxysm, the patient returns to a middling state of health, and continues in the same for the rest of the intermediate days; only there remains somewhat of a loathing, and a deep-leated pain as if the person was all over bruised or broken, which kind of fenation the physicians are wont to call *oecopurus*. The fit returns every fourth day, and that precisely at the same hours, being rarely postponed.\n\n**Causes of, and persons subject to, this disorder.** The same general causes concur in producing this as other intermittents, namely miasmata, and whatever can dispose the body to be easily affected by them. Studious people, and those of a melancholic turn, are said to be particularly subject to quartans; but what are the immediate causes which produce a return of the fits every fourth day, instead of every day, or every third day, must probably lie for ever concealed, as depending upon the secret and inexplicable mechanism of the human body.\n\n**Prognosis.** A simple quartan, where there is no reason to dread any induration of the viscera, may very certainly admit of a cure; and the prognosis can never be unfavourable, unless in cases of extreme weakness, or where the distemper hath been unskillfully treated.\n\n**Cure.** This does not in the least differ from that which hath been fully laid down for the simple tertian, and which it is therefore needless to repeat here.\n\n**The Duplicated Quartan, Sp.

This kind of fever generally comes about fix or seven o'clock in the morning, beginning with a considerable degree of cold and shivering, which lasts for about an hour; and is often accompanied with vomiting or spontaneous diarrhoea, or both. It is succeeded by a pretty strong heat, accompanied with thirst, restlessness, and pain of the head.

It begins without any sensation of cold or shivering, unless there be some internal inflammation, or the small-pox or measles happen to be present. A continual heat without any intermission constitutes the essence of this disease. The heat, however, is more tolerable than in the synocha properly so called. In some, the pains of the head are pungent and throbbing, answering to the pulsations of the arteries; but in others they are dull and heavy. The face is red and bloated; and there is a remarkable laxitude of the limbs, with a strong, full, and frequent pulse. The urine is red, and deposits a sediment almost of the colour of orange-peel; and in the very first day of the disease, signs of conception (according to the Hippocratic phrase) appear. The fever commonly goes off with a gentle sweat; but sometimes, though more rarely, with a hemorrhagy by the nose. Its shortest period is 24 hours; but if it goes beyond the fourth day, it is then a synocha properly so called.\n\nThe simple synocha, according to Vogel, begins with cold and shivering, succeeded by vehement heat, redness, and dryness of the skin. The face, especially, is very red, and the thirst intense. The head is either pained or heavy. The patient neither doth not sleep at all, or is disturbed with dreams. A moist sweat then breaks out all over the skin. The pulse is full, quick, and frequent; the judgement is sometimes a little disturbed; young people are apt to be terrified with imaginations; and they for the most part incline to sleep: the respiration is difficult, and the belly costive; at the same time that a tenitive kind of laxitude is perceived over the whole body. A complete crisis takes place either on the fourth or at the farthest on the eleventh day. The characteristic marks of the simple synocha, therefore, are, A redness of the face, moisture of the skin, a strong and frequent pulse.\n\n**Causes of, and persons subject to, this disease.** As we have already remarked of intermittents, so must we also now remark of continued fevers, that it is impossible to discover those minute causes which occasion the difference of type betwixt one inflammatory fever and another, though most authors pretend to enumerate these with great certainty. Thus Juncker tells us, that the cause of the simple ephemera is plethora, together with any immoderate agitation and commotion of the fluids while in that state. Vogel reckons among the causes of his febris diaria, passions of the mind, pain, want, exposure to the sun, &c.; a repulsion or absorption of certain humours; wounds, fractures, luxations, &c.; so that in general we may reckon every thing tending to increase the action of the arterial system to be in certain circumstances a cause of inflammatory fever. Hence we find those are most subject to the synocha whose constitution is either naturally robust, or who are exposed to those causes which tend to produce an increased action of the arterial system; such as hard labour, high living, &c.\n\n**Prognosis.** The most simple kind of synocha, that is, the ephemera or diary fever, is commonly cured without the assistance of medicine, and therefore the prognosis is for the most part favourable: yet, if it be improperly treated by heating medicines, it may easily be converted into the other kind; or, if there be a putrid disposition of the fluids, into a fever of a very dangerous nature. The same thing is to be understood even of the most violent kind; for simple inflammatory fevers are not dangerous unless complicated with an affection of some particular part, as the pleura, stomach, &c.\n\n**Cure.** Dr. Cullen objects to the plan of those who are for leaving the cure of continued fevers to the operations of nature; because these operations are neither certain in themselves, nor are they so well understood as to enable us to regulate them properly; and it is likewise possible to supersede them by art. The plan therefore on which he proceeds is, to form his indications of cure upon the means of obviating the tendency to death in fevers; and these he reduces to three. 1. To moderate the violence of re-action. 2. To remove or obviate the causes of debility; and, 3. To obviate or correct the tendency of the fluids to putrefaction.\n\nThe first indication may be answered, 1. By all those means which diminish the action of the heart and arteries. 2. By those which take off the spasm of the extreme vessels, which, according to his theory, is the chief cause of violent re-action.\n\n1. The action of the heart and arteries may be diminished, 1. By avoiding or moderating those irritations which, in one degree or other, are almost constantly applied to the body. 2. By the use of certain sedative powers. 3. By diminishing the tension or tone of the arterial system.\n\n[1.] The irritations above-mentioned are the impressions made upon our senses, the exercise of the body and mind, and the taking in of aliments. The avoiding of these as much as possible, or the moderating their force, makes what is properly called the antiphlogistic regimen, proper to be employed in almost every continued fever. This regimen is to be directed in the following manner.\n\n1. Impressions on the external senses, as stimulant to the system, and a chief support of its activity, should be avoided as much as possible; especially such as are of a stronger kind, and which give pain and uneasiness. No impression is to be more carefully guarded against than that of external heat; and at the same...\nsame time every other means of increasing the heat of the body is to be shunned. Both these precautions are to be taken as soon as a hot stage is fully formed, and to be attended to during its continuance, except in certain cases, where a determination to sweating is necessary, or where the stimulant effects of heat may be compensated by circumstances which determine it to produce a relaxation and revulsion.\n\n2. All motion of the body is to be avoided as much as possible, and that posture only chosen which employs the fewest muscles, and keeps none of them long in a state of contraction. Speaking, as it accelerates respiration, is particularly to be avoided. It must also be observed, that every motion of the body is more stimulant in proportion as the patient is weaker.\n\n3. The exercise of the mind is also to be avoided, as being a stimulus to the body; but here an exception is to be made in the case of a delirium coming on, when the presenting of accustomed objects may divert the irregular train of ideas then arising in the mind.\n\n4. The presence of recent aliment in the stomach proves always a stimulus to the system, and ought therefore to be as moderate as possible. A total abstinence for some time may be of service; but as this cannot be long continued with safety, we must avoid the stimulus of aliment by choosing that kind which gives the least. Alimentary matters are also to be accounted more stimulant in proportion to their alkaline qualities; and this leads us to avoid all animal, and use only vegetable food. For the same reason, aromatic and spirituous liquors are to be avoided; and in answering the present indication, we must abstain from all fermented liquors except those of the lowest quality. Other stimuli are, the sensation of thirst, crudities or corrupted humours in the stomach, a preternatural retention of the faeces in the intestines, and a general acrimony of all the humours, which is in most fevers to be suspected. These are to be removed by such methods as the urgency of the symptoms require, by diluting liquors, vomiting, the use of acids, laxative clysters, and large quantities of antiseptic drinks.\n\n[2.] The second method of moderating the violence of reaction is by the employment of certain sedative powers, with a view to diminish the activity of the whole body, and particularly that of the sanguiferous system. The first of these to be mentioned is the application of cold. Heat is the chief support of the activity of the animal-lystem; and the system is therefore provided with a power of generating heat; but at the same time we may observe, that this would go to excess, were it not constantly moderated by a cooler temperature in the surrounding atmosphere. When, therefore, the generating power of heat in the system is increased, as is commonly the case in fevers, it is necessary not only to avoid all further means of increasing it, but also to apply air of a cooler temperature; or at least to apply it more entirely and freely than in a state of health. This is known, from some late observations, to be a very powerful means of moderating the violence of reaction; but what is the mode of its operation, to what circumstances of fever it particularly applies, or what limitations it requires, are not yet fully ascertained.\n\nAnother sedative power very frequently employed in fevers, is that of certain medicines known in the materia medica by the name of refrigerants. The chief of these are acids of all kinds when sufficiently diluted, and which are, in several respects, remedies adapted to continued fevers. Those especially in use are the sulphuric and vegetable; and on many accounts the latter are to be preferred. Another set of refrigerants are the neutral salts formed of the sulphuric, nitrous or vegetable acids, with alkalis either fixed or volatile. All these neutrals, while they are dissolved in water, generate cold; but as that cold ceases soon after the dissolution is finished, and as the salts are generally exhibited in a dissolved state, their refrigerant power in the animal body does not all depend upon their power of generating cold with water. Nitre is the refrigerant chiefly employed; but all the others, compounded as above mentioned, partake more or less of the same quality. Besides these neutrals, some metallic salts have also been employed in fevers, particularly the acetate of lead; but the refrigerant powers of this salt are by no means ascertained, and its deleterious qualities are too well known to admit of its being freely used.\n\n[3.] The third general method of diminishing the reaction, is by lessening the tension, tone, and activity of the sanguiferous system. As the activity of the system in a great measure depends upon the tone, and this again upon the tension, of the vessels, given to them by the quantity of fluids they contain, it is evident, that the diminution of the quantity of these must diminish the activity of the sanguiferous system. The most efficacious means of diminishing the quantity of fluids is by the evacuations of blood-letting and purging. The former is evidently one of the most powerful means of diminishing the activity of the whole body, and especially of the sanguiferous system; and it must therefore be the most effectual means of moderating the reaction in fevers. When the violence of reaction, and its constant attendant phlogistic diathesis, are sufficiently evident; when these constitute the principal part of the disease, and may be expected to continue through the whole of it, as in the cases of synoche; then blood-letting is the principal remedy, and may be employed as far as the symptoms of the disease may seem to require, and the constitution of the patient will bear. It must, however, be remarked, that a greater evacuation than is necessary may occasion a slower recovery, and render the person more liable to a relapse, or bring on other diseases. It is also to be observed, that this evacuation is the most effectual, as the blood is more suddenly drawn off, and as the body is at the same time more free from all irritation, and therefore when it is in a posture in which the fewest muscles are in action.\n\nWith regard to purging, when we consider the quantity of fluids constantly present in the cavity of the intestines, and the quantity which may be drawn off from the innumerable excretories that open into this cavity, it will be obvious, that a very great evacuation may be made in this way; and if this be done by a stimulus that is not at the same time communicated to the rest of the body, it may, by emptying both the cavity of the intestines and the arteries which furnish\nFebrua. furnish the excretions poured into it, induce a considerable relaxation in the whole system; and is therefore suited to moderate the violence of reaction in fevers. But it is to be observed, that as the fluid drawn from the excretories opening into the intestines is not all drawn immediately from the arteries, and as what is even more immediately drawn from these is drawn off slowly; so the evacuation will not, in proportion to its quantity, occasion such a sudden depletion of the red vessels as blood-letting does; and therefore cannot act so powerfully in taking off the phlogistic diathesis of the system.\n\nAt the same time this evacuation may induce a considerable degree of debility; and therefore, in those cases in which a dangerous state of debility is likely to occur, purging is to be employed with a great deal of caution; and this caution is more difficult to be observed than in the case of blood-letting: and it is further to be noticed, that as purging takes off in some measure the determination of the blood to the vessels on the surface of the body, it seems to be less adapted to the cure of fevers.\n\nII. The other method of moderating the violence of reaction in fevers is by the exhibition of those remedies suited to take off the spasm of the extreme vessels, supposed to be the irritation which chiefly supports the reaction. The means to be employed for this purpose are either internal or external.\n\nFirst, The internal means are, 1. Those which determine the force of the circulation to the extreme vessels on the surface of the body, and by restoring the tone and activity of these vessels, overcome the spasm on their extremities. 2. Those medicines which have the power of taking off spasm in any part of the system, and which are known under the title of Antispasmodics.\n\n(1.) Those remedies which are fit to determine to the surface of the body are, 1. Diluents. 2. Neutral salts. 3. Sudorifics. 4. Emetics.\n\n1. Water enters, in a large proportion, into the composition of all the animal fluids, and a large quantity of it is always diffused through the whole of the common mass. In a sound state, the fluidity of the whole mass depends upon the quantity of water present in it. Water therefore is the proper diluent of our mass of blood, and other fluids are diluent only in proportion to the quantity of water they contain.\n\nIn a healthy state, also the fulness of the extreme vessels and the quantity of excretion are in proportion to the quantity of water present in the body. But in fever, though the excretions be in some measure interrupted, they continue in such quantity as to exhale the more fluid parts of the blood; and, while a portion of them is at the same time necessarily retained in the larger vessels, the smaller, and the extreme vessels, both from the deficiency of fluid and their own contracted state, are less filled, and therefore allowed to remain in that condition. To remedy this contracted state, nothing is more necessary than a large supply of water or watery fluids taken in by drinking or otherwise; for as any superfluous quantity of water is forced off by the several excretories, such a force applied may be a means of dilating the extreme vessels, and of overcoming the spasm affecting their extremities. Accordingly, the throwing in a large quantity of watery fluids, has been, at all times, a remedy much employed in fevers; and in no instance more remarkably than by the Spanish and Italian physicians, in the use of what they call the dieta aquosa. This practice consists in taking away every other kind of aliment and drink, and in giving, in divided portions, every day for several days together, six or eight pounds of plain water, generally cold, but sometimes warm. This, however, is to be done only after the disease has continued for some time, and at least for a week.\n\n2. A second mean of determining to the surface of the body, is by the use of neutral salts. These neutrals, in a certain dose, taken into the stomach, produce soon after a sense of heat upon the surface of the body; and, if the body be covered close and kept warm, a sweat is readily brought out. The same medicines taken during the cold stage of a fever, very often put an end to it, and bring on the hot one; and they are also remarkable for stopping the vomiting which so frequently attends the cold stage of fevers. All this shows, that neutral salts have a power of determining the blood to the surface of the body, and may therefore be of use in taking off the spasm which subsists there in fevers. The neutral most commonly employed in fevers, is that formed of an alkali with the native acid of vegetables. But all the other neutrals have more or less of the same virtue; and perhaps some of them, particularly the ammoniacal salts, possess it in a stronger degree. As cold water taken into the stomach often shows the same diaphoretic effects with the neutral salts, it is probable that the effect of the latter depends upon their refrigerant powers.\n\n3. A third method of determining to the surface of the body, and taking off the spasm subsisting there, is by the use of sudorifics and by sweating. The propriety of this practice has been much disputed; and many specious arguments may be adduced both for and against it. In its favour may be urged, 1. That in healthy persons, in every case of increased action of the heart and arteries, a sweating takes place, and is, seemingly, the means of preventing the bad effects of such increased action. 2. That, in fevers, their most usual solution and termination is by spontaneous sweating. 3. That, even when excited by art, it has been found useful at certain periods, and in certain species of fever.—On the other hand, it may be urged against the practice of sweating, 1. That in fevers, as a spontaneous sweating does not immediately come on, there are some circumstances different from those in the state of health, and which may render it doubtful whether the sweating can be safely excited by art. 2. That in many cases the practice has been attended with bad consequences. The means commonly employed have a tendency to produce an inflammatory diathesis; which, if not taken off by the sweat succeeding, must be increased with much danger. Thus sweating employed to prevent the accessions of intermittent fevers has often changed them into a continued form, which is always dangerous. 3. The utility of the practice is doubtful; as sweating, when it happens, does not always give a final termination, as must be manifest in the case of intermittents, and in many continued fevers which are sometimes in the beginning attended with sweatings which do not prove final; and, on the contrary, whether they be spontaneous...\nneous or excited by art, they seem often to aggravate the disease.\n\nFrom these considerations, it is doubtful if the practice of sweating can be admitted very generally; but, at the same time, it is also very doubtful if the failure of the practice, or the mischief said to arise from it, have not been owing to the improper conduct of the practitioner. With respect to the last, it is almost agreed among physicians, 1. That sweating has been generally hurtful when excited by stimulant, heating, and inflammatory medicines. 2. That it has been hurtful when excited by much external heat, and continued with a great increase of the heat of the body. 3. That it is always hurtful when it does not relieve; and rather increases the frequency and hardness of the pulse, the anxiety and difficulty of breathing, the headache, and delirium. 4. That it is always hurtful if it be urged when the sweat is not fluid, and when it is partial and on the superior parts of the body only.\n\nIn these cases, it is probable, that either an inflammatory diathesis is produced, which increases the spasm on the extreme vessels; or that, from other causes, the spasm is too much fixed to yield easily to the increased action of the heart and arteries; and upon either supposition it must be obvious, that urging the sweat may produce determinations to some of the internal parts, with very great danger.\n\nNotwithstanding these doubts, however, it still remains true, 1. That sweating has been often useful in preventing the accessions of fevers when they have been certainly foreseen, and a proper conduct employed. 2. That even after fevers have in some measure come on, sweating has interrupted their progress when properly employed, either at the very beginning of the disease, or during its approach and gradual formation. 3. That even after pyrexia have continued for some time, sweating has been successfully employed in curing them, as is particularly exemplified in the case of a rheumatism. 4. That certain fevers produced by a very powerful febrile contagion, have been generally treated most successfully by sweating.\n\nThese instances are in favour of sweating, but give no general rule; and it must be left to farther experience to determine how far any general rule can be established in this matter. In the mean time, if the practice of sweating is to be attempted, the following rules may be laid down for the conduct of it: 1. That a sweat should be excited without the use of stimulant inflammatory medicines. 2. That it should be excited with as little external heat, and with as little increase of the heat of the body, as possible. 3. That, when excited, it should be continued for a due length of time; not less than 12 hours, and sometimes for 24 or 48 hours; always, however, supposing that it proceeds without the dangerous circumstances already mentioned. 4. That for some part of the time, and as long as the person can easily bear, it should be carried on without admitting of sleep. 5. That it should be rendered universal over the whole body; and therefore particularly that care should be taken to bring the sweating to the lower extremities. 6. That the practice should be rendered safer by moderate purging excited at the same time. 7. That it should not be suddenly checked by cold anyhow applied to the body.\n\nWhen attention is to be given to these rules, the sweating may be excited, 1. By warm bathing, or a fomentation of the lower extremities. 2. By frequent draughts of tepid liquors, chiefly water, rendered more grateful by the addition of a light aromatic, or more powerful by that of a small quantity of wine. 3. By giving some doses of neutral salts. 4. Most effectually, and perhaps most safely, by a large dose of an opiate, joined with a portion of neutral salts, and of an emetic.\n\nThe fourth mean of determining to the surface, of the body, and thereby taking off the spasm affecting the extreme vessels, is by the use of emetics. These, particularly of the antimonial kind, have been employed in the cure of fevers ever since the introduction of chemical medicines; but though of late their use has become very general, their efficacy is still disputed, and their manner of operating is differently explained.\n\nVomiting is in many respects useful in fevers; as it evacuates the contents of the stomach, as it emulges the biliary and pancreatic ducts, and evacuates the contents of the duodenum, and perhaps also of a large portion of the intestines; as it agitates the whole of the abdominal viscera, it expedites the circulation in them, and promotes their several secretions; and, lastly, as it agitates also the viscera of the thorax, it has like effects there.\n\nIt is not to this cause, however, that we are to impute the effect vomiting has in determining to the surface of the body. This must be attributed to the particular operation of emetics upon the muscular fibres of the stomach, whereby they excite the action of the extreme arteries on the surface of the body, and by this means effectually determine the blood to these vessels, remove the atony, and take off the spasm affecting them. For this purpose they are exhibited in two different ways; that is, either in such doses as may excite full and repeated vomitings, or in such doses as may excite sickness and nausea only, with little or no vomiting at all.\n\nFull vomiting is well suited to determine to the surface of the body, and thereby to obviate the atony and spasm which lay the foundation of fever. Thus, vomiting excited a little before the expected accession of the paroxysm of an intermittent, has been found to prevent the paroxysm altogether. It has been observed also, that when contagion has been applied to a person, and first discovers its operation, an emetic given has prevented the fever which might otherwise have been expected.\n\nThese are the advantages to be obtained by exciting vomiting at the first approach of fevers, or of the paroxysm of fevers; and they may also be applied after fevers are formed, to take off, perhaps entirely, the atony and spasm, or at least to moderate these, so that the fever may proceed more gently and safely. It is seldom, however, that vomiting is found to produce a final solution of fevers; and after they are once formed, it is commonly necessary to repeat the vomiting several times; but this is attended with inconvenience, and sometimes with disadvantage. The operation of\nFevers, full vomiting is transitory, and the exercise of vomiting is a debilitating power; and therefore, when the vomiting does not remove the atony and spasms very entirely, it may give occasion to their recurrence with greater force. For these reasons, after fevers are fully formed, some physicians have thought proper to employ emetics in nauseating doses only. These are capable of exciting the action of the extreme vessels, and their operation is more permanent. At the same time they often show their power by exciting some degree of sweat, and their operation is rendered more safe by their commonly producing some evacuation by stool. But nausea continued for any great length of time, is to most patients a sensation highly distressing, and almost insufferable.\n\nThe emetics chiefly in use at present are, ipecacuanha and antimony. The former may be employed for determining to the surface of the body; but, even in very small doses, it so readily excites vomiting, that it is with difficulty employed for the purpose of nauseating only; and in whatever manner employed, there is reason to suspect that its effects are less permanent, and less powerfully communicated from the stomach to the rest of the system, than those of antimony. This last is therefore generally preferred; and its preparations, seemingly various, may all be reduced to two heads; one comprehending those in which the reguline part is in a condition to be acted upon by acids, and therefore on meeting with acids in the stomach it becomes active; and another, comprehending those preparations in which the reguline part is already joined with an acid, rendering it active. Of each kind there are great numbers, but not differing essentially from one another; the two most worthy of notice are, the calx nitrata antimonii, and emetic tartar, or tartrate of antimony, of the Edinburgh Dispensatory. Both these are very efficacious medicines; but the latter seems preferable, because its dose is capable of being better ascertained; though the former, on account of its slower operation, may have some advantages, and in certain cases be more efficacious as a purgative and sudorific.\n\nThe calx nitrata antimonii, when first introduced into the pharmacopoeia of the Edinburgh college was supposed to be very nearly, if not precisely, the same with a medicine which has of late been highly celebrated in the cure of fevers, Dr James's powder. But from more accurate observations, there is now reason to believe that the pulvis antimonialis of the London Pharmacopoeia, formed by the calcination of antimony with hartshorn, approaches more nearly to that celebrated arcanum. But at any rate, the calx antimonii nitrata, the pulvis antimonialis, and James's powder, are probably not essentially different from each other. The two latter, however, have the most near resemblance; and accordingly the Edinburgh college, in their Pharmacopoeia, have introduced an article under the title of antimonium calcareo-phosphoricum, which they consider so much similar to James's powder, that they have used as a synonyme for it, the title of pulvis Jacobi.\n\nThe time most proper for exhibiting these medicines is a little before the accession, when that can be certainly known. In continued fevers the exacerbations are not always very observable; but there is reason to believe, that one commonly happens about noon or soon after it; and that these, therefore, are the most proper times for exhibiting emetics.\n\nWith respect to the manner of administration, that of the calx nitrata is simple, as the whole of what is thought a proper dose may be given at once; and no more can be properly given till the next accession. The administration of the emetic tartar is different. It is to be given in small doses, not sufficient to excite vomiting; and these doses are to be repeated after short intervals for several times, till sickness, nausea, and some, though not much, vomiting come on. The difference of administration must depend upon the dose, and the length of the interval at which it is given. If it be intended that the medicine should certainly operate by stool, the doses are made small, and the intervals long. On the contrary, when vomiting is proper, or when much purging ought to be avoided, and therefore some vomiting must be admitted, the doses are made larger, and the intervals shorter. With respect to both kinds of preparations, the repetition is to be made at the times of accession, but not very often; for if the first exhibitions, duly managed, have little effect, it is seldom that the after exhibitions have much; and it sometimes happens that the repeated vomiting, and especially repeated purging, does harm by weakening the patient.\n\n(2.) The other set of internal medicines which are supposed useful in taking off the spasms of the extreme vessels, are those named anti-pasmodics. But whatever may be the virtues of some of them in this way, such is their power of stimulating at the same time, that very few of them can with safety be administered in fevers of an inflammatory nature. Almost the only one which can with safety be exhibited in these cases is camphor; and the operations of this are by no means well ascertained. Dr Huxham mentions it as a corrector of the acrimony of cantharides; and affirms us, that it very effectually promotes a diaphoresis. But from the remarks of other practitioners, we have no just reason to suppose that it acts perceptibly in a dose of five or six grains, though in 15 or 20 it produces a particular kind of intoxication.\n\nSecondly, The external means suited to take off the spasms of the extreme vessels, are blistering and warm bathing.\n\n1. What are the effects of blistering so frequently employed in fevers, is not yet agreed among physicians. Dr Cullen is of opinion, that the small quantity of cantharides absorbed from a blistering plaster, is not sufficient to change the consistence of the maws of blood; and therefore, that such a quantity can neither do good by resolving phlogistic tenor if it exists, nor do harm by increasing the diffusion of the blood arising from a putrid tendency in it. The effects of cantharides upon the fluids, therefore, may be entirely neglected. The inflammation produced by the application of cantharides to the skin, affords a certain proof of their stimulant power; but in many persons the effect of that stimulus is not considerable; in many it is not communicated to the whole system; and even when it does take place in the whole system, it seems to be taken off very entirely by the effusion and evacuation of serum from the blistered part. It may be concluded, therefore, that neither much good is to be expected,\nnor much harm to be apprehended, from the stimulant power of blistering; and the certainty of this conclusion is established by the great benefit arising from the proper practice of blistering in inflammatory diseases. Much has been imputed to the evacuation made by blistering; but it is never so considerable as to affect the whole system; and therefore can neither, by a sudden depletion, relax the sanguiferous system nor by any revulsion affect the general distribution of the fluids. The evacuation, however, is so considerable as to affect the neighbouring vessels; and the manifest utility of blistering near the part affected in inflammatory diseases leads us to think, that blistering, by deriving to the skin, and producing an effusion there, relaxes the spasm of the deeper seated vessels. It is in this manner, most probably, that the tumor of a joint, from an effusion into the cellular texture under the skin, takes off the rheumatic pain formerly afflicting that joint. Analogous to this, probably, is the good effect of blistering in continued fevers, arising from the relaxation of the spasm of the extreme vessels by a communication of the blistered part with the rest of the skin. A blister may be employed at any period in continued fevers; but it will be of most advantage in the advanced state of such fevers, when, the reaction being weaker, all ambiguity from the stimulating power of blistering is removed, and when it may best concur with other circumstances tending to a final solution of the spasm.\n\nFrom this view of the matter, it will appear, that the part of the body to which blisters ought to be applied is indifferent, except upon the suspicion of topical affection, when the blistering is to be made as near as possible to the part affected. Whether liniments and other rubefacientia act in a manner analogous to what has been supposed of blistering may be doubtful; but their effects in rheumatism and other inflammatory diseases render it probable.\n\n2. The other external means of taking off the spasm of the extreme vessels is warm bathing. This was frequently, and in different circumstances, employed by the ancients; but has, till very lately, been neglected by modern physicians. As the heat of the bath stimulates the extreme vessels, and, with the concurrence of moisture, also relaxes them, it seems to be a safe stimulus, and well suited to take off the spasm affecting these vessels. It may be applied to the whole body by immersion; but this is in many respects inconvenient. From extensive experience it appears, that most of the purposes of warm bathing can be obtained by a fomentation of the legs and feet, if properly administered, and continued for a due length of time, not less than an hour. The marks of the good effects of such a fomentation are, the patient's bearing it easily, its relieving delirium, and inducing sleep.\n\nGENUS V. TYPHUS; the Typhons Fever.\n\nTyphus, Sauv. gen. 82.

According to him, the patient at first grows somewhat listless, and feels slight chills and shudders, with uncertain flushes of heat, and a kind of weariness all over, like what is felt after great fatigue. This is always attended with a sort of heaviness and dejection of spirit, and more or less of a load, pain, or giddiness of the head; a nausea and distaste of every thing soon follows, without any considerable thirst, but frequently with retching to vomit, though little but insipid phlegm is brought up. Though a kind of lucid interval of several hours sometimes intervenes, yet the symptoms return with aggravation, especially towards night; the head grows more giddy or heavy; the heat greater; the pulse quicker, but weak; with an oppressive kind of breathing. A great torpor, or obtuse pain and coldness, affects the hinder part of the head frequently, and oftentimes a heavy pain is felt on the top all along the coronary future; this, and that of the back part of the head, generally attend nervous fevers, and are commonly succeeded by some degree of a delirium. In this condition the patient often continues for five or six days, with a heavy, pale, sunk countenance; feemingly not very sick, and yet far from being well; restless, anxious, and commonly quite void of sleep, though sometimes very drowsy and heavy; but although he appears to those about him actually to sleep, he is utterly insensible of it. The pulse during all this time is quick, weak, and unequal; sometimes fluttering, and sometimes for a few moments flow; nay, even intermittent, and then, with a sudden flush in the face, immediately very quick, and perhaps soon after surprizingly calm and equal; and thus alternately. The heats and chills are as uncertain and unequal; sometimes a sudden colour and glow arise in the cheeks, while the tip of the nose and ears is cold, and the forehead at the same time in a cold dewy sweat. Nay, it is very common, that a high colour and heat appear in the face, when the extremities are quite cold. The urine is commonly pale, and often limpid; frequently of a whey colour, or like vapid small beer, in which there is either no manner of sediment, or a kind of loofe matter like bran irregularly scattered up and down in it. The tongue at the beginning is seldom or never dry or discoloured, but sometimes covered with a thin whitish mucus; at length, indeed, it often appears very dry, red, and chapped, or of the colour of pomegranate rind; but this chiefly at the close of the disease: yet, however dry the tongue and lips seem, the patient seldom complains of thirst, though sometimes of a heat in the tongue. About the seventh or eighth day, the giddiness,\nFebrea. giddiness, pain, or heaviness of the head become much greater, with a constant noise in it, or tinnitus aurium; which is very disturbing to the sick, and frequently brings on a delirium. The load on the precordia, anxiety and faintness, grow much more urgent; and patients often fall into an actual delirium, especially if they attempt to sit up; cold sweats suddenly come out on the forehead, and on the backs of the hands (though at the same time there be too much heat in the cheeks and palms), and as suddenly go off. If the urine now grow more pale and limpid, a delirium is certainly to be expected, with universal tremors and fulfuls tendinum; the delirium is seldom violent, but as it were a confusion of thought and action, muttering continually and faltering in their speech. Sometimes they awake only in a hurry and confusion, and presently recollect themselves, but forthwith fall into a muttering dozy state again. The tongue grows often very dry at the height, especially in its middle part, with a yellowish tint on each side, and trembles greatly when the sick attempts to put it out. Frequently profuse sweats pour forth all at once, about the ninth, tenth, or eleventh day, commonly coldih and clammy on the extremities; oftentimes very thin stools are discharged, and then nature links apace; the extremities grow cold, the nails pale or livid; the pulse may be said to tremble and flutter, rather than to beat, the vibrations being so exceedingly weak and quick that they can scarce be distinguished; though sometimes they creep on surringly slow, and very frequently intermit. The sick become quite inflexible and stupid, scarce affected with the loudest noise or the strongest light; though, at the beginning, strangely susceptible of the impressions of either. The delirium now ends in a profound coma, and that soon in death. The stools, urine, and tears, run off involuntarily, and denounce a speedy dissolution, as the tremblings and twitchings of the nerves and tendons are preludes to a general convulsion, which at once snaps the thread of life. In one or other of these ways are the sick carried off, after having languished for 14, 18, or 20 days; nay, sometimes much longer. Most patients grow deaf and stupid towards the end of this disease (some extremely deaf), though too quick and apprehensive at the beginning; insomuch that the least noise or light greatly offended them. Many from their immoderate fears seem to hurry themselves out of life, where little danger is apparent at the beginning; nay, some will not allow themselves to sleep, from a vain fear of dozing quite away; and others from the vast hurry, anxiety, and confusion of which they are sensible either during sleep or at their waking.\n\nCauses of, and persons subject to, this disorder. The nervous fever is most frequently the consequence of contagion. It most commonly attacks persons of weak nerves, a lax habit of body, and a poor thin blood; those who have suffered great evacuations, a long dejection of spirits, immoderate watchings, flu- dyes, fatigue, &c.; also those who have used much crude unwholesome food, vapour impure drinks, or who have been confined long in damp foul air; who have broken the vigour of their constitutions by fasting, too frequent purging, inordinate venery, &c. Hence we see how the disease is connected with an extreme debility of the nervous system; for when people are prepared for this fever by having their nerves already weakened, the contagious particles immediately attack the nervous system, without so much affecting the state of the blood or juices, though the latter are greatly affected in the putrid malignant fevers.\n\nPrognosis. In nervous fevers, the prognosis is very much the same with that of the putrid malignant kind. And although death be not so frequent as in that modification of fever, yet it may justly be considered as a very fatal disease.\n\nCure. As this fever is produced by contagion affecting the nervous system of a person already debilitated, and thus producing weakness in an extreme degree, we have now occasion to consider Dr Cullen's two indications of cure omitted under the Synocha; namely, to remove the cause and obviate the effects of debility, and to correct the putrefactive tendency of the fluids; for though, in the beginning of nervous fevers, the tendency to putrefaction be not remarkable, it becomes exceedingly great towards their conclusion.\n\n[1.] In answering the first indication, Dr Cullen observes, that most of the sedative powers inducing debility cease to act soon after they have been first applied; and therefore the removing them is not an object of the present indication. There is only one which may be supposed to continue to act for a long time, and that is the contagion applied; but we know nothing in the nature of contagion that can lead us to any measures for removing or correcting it. We know only its effects as a sedative power inducing debility, or as a ferment inducing a tendency to putrefaction in the fluids, the former of which at present falls under our consideration.—The debility induced in fevers by contagion, or other causes, appears especially in the weaker energy of the brain; but in what this consists, or how it may be restored, we do not well know; but as nature, seemingly for this purpose, excites the motion of the heart and arteries, we must ascribe the continuance of the debility to the weaker reaction of the sanguiferous system: the means, therefore, which we employ for obviating debility, are immediately directed to support and increase the action of the heart and arteries; and the remedies employed are tonics or stimulants.\n\nIn contagious diseases we know, both from the effects which appear, and from directions, that the tone of the heart and arteries is considerably diminished; and that tonic remedies are therefore properly indicated. We are to consider these remedies as of two kinds; 1. The power of cold; 2. That of tonic medicines.\n\nThe power of cold as a tonic in fevers may be employed in two ways: either as thrown into the stomach, or as applied to the surface of the body. As we have already observed that the power of cold may be communicated from any one part to every other part of the system, so it will be readily allowed that the stomach is a part as fit as any other for this communication, and that cold drink taken into the stomach may prove an useful tonic in fevers. This the experience of all ages has confirmed; but at the same time it has been frequently observed, that, in certain circumstances, cold drink taken into the stomach has proved very hurtful; and therefore that its use in fevers requires some limitations.\nWhat these limitations should be, and what are all the circumstances which may forbid the use of cold drink, it is difficult to determine; but it seems clearly forbidden in all cases where a phlogistic diathesis prevails in the system, and more especially when there are topical affections of an inflammatory nature.\n\nThe other method of employing cold as a tonic, is by applying it to the surface of the body, as a refrigerant power fit to moderate the violence of reaction; but probably it may here also be considered properly as a tonic, and useful in cases of debility.—Not only cool air, but cold water also may be applied to the surface of the body as a tonic. The ancients frequently applied it with advantage to particular parts as a tonic; but it is a discovery of modern times, that, in the case of putrid fevers attended with much debility, the body may be washed all over with cold water. This was first practised at Breslau in Silesia, as appears from a dissertation under the title of Epidemia Verne, que Wraissilviam anno 1737 affixit, to be found in the Acta Nat. Curios., vol. x.\n\nAnd from other writers it appears, that the practice has passed into some of the neighbouring countries. But in Britain the use of cold water externally applied has of late been more extensively introduced than into any other country of Europe. For this we are chiefly indebted to the late ingenious Dr Currie of Liverpool. He has recommended the dashing cold water over the whole surface of the body, as a means not only of obviating heat, delirium, and other symptoms most urgent; but of putting an immediate stop to the disease. And there can be no doubt that the practice has often been attended with the most salutary consequences. But it is by no means so generally advantageous as Dr Currie and some others are inclined to believe. It is in but very rare instances that an artificial termination of fever can thus be obtained; and even as obviating symptoms, it is not unfrequently attended with bad consequences. It can never be employed with safety unless where the heat is very urgent. And perhaps all the advantages of cold immersion may be obtained merely from cold bathing, a practice now very common in Britain.\n\nThe medicines which have been employed in fevers as tonics are various. If the acetate of lead hath been found useful, it is probably as a tonic rather than as a refrigerant; and the ens veneris, or other preparations of iron which have been employed, can act as tonics only. The preparations of copper, from their effects in epilepsy, are presumed to possess a tonic power; but whether their use in fevers be founded on their tonic or emetic powers, is uncertain. And upon the whole there may no doubt occur some instances of fevers being cured by tonics taken from the fossil kingdom; but the vegetable tonics are the most efficacious, and among these the cinchona certainly holds the first place.\n\nThe cinchona has commonly been considered as a specific, or a remedy of which the operation was not understood. We must observe, however, that, as in many cases the effects of the bark are perceived soon after its being taken into the stomach, and before it can possibly be conveyed to the mass of blood, we may conclude, that its effects do not arise from its operating on the fluids; and must therefore depend upon its Typhus, acting on the nerves of the stomach, and being thereby communicated to the rest of the nervous system. This operation seems to be a tonic power, the bark being a remedy in many cases of debility, particularly in gangrene; and if its operation may be explained from its possessing a tonic power, we may easily perceive why it is improper when a phlogistic diathesis prevails; and from the same view we can ascertain in what cases of continued fever it may be admitted. These cases are either where considerable remissions have appeared, when it may be employed to prevent the return of exacerbations, on the same footing as it is used in intermittent fevers; or in the advanced state of fevers, when all suspicion of an inflammatory condition is removed, and a general debility prevails in the system; and its being then employed is sufficiently agreeable to the present practice.\n\nAnother set of medicines to be employed for obviating debility and its effects, are the direct stimulants. These, in some measure, increase the tone of the moving fibres; but are different from the tonics, as they more directly excite and increase the action of the heart and arteries. This mode of operation renders their use ambiguous; and when an inflammatory diathesis is present, the effects of the stimulants may be very hurtful; but it is still probable, that in the advanced state of these fevers, when debility prevails, they may be useful.\n\nOf all the stimulants which may be properly employed, wine seems to be the most eligible. It has the advantage of being grateful to the palate and stomach, and of having its stimulant parts so much diluted, that it can be conveniently given in small doses; and therefore it may be employed with sufficient safety.—It may be suspected that wine has an operation analogous to that of opium; and on good grounds. But we can distinctly remark its stimulant power only; which renders its effects in the phrenetic delirium manifestly hurtful; and in the mild delirium depending on debility, as remarkably useful.\n\n[2.] We must now proceed to the other indication of cure, namely, to correct or obviate the tendency in the fluids to putrefaction. This may be done, 1. By avoiding any new application of putrid or putreficient matter. 2. By evacuating the putrid or putreficient matter already present in the body. 3. By correcting the putrid or putreficient matter remaining in the body by diluents and antifeptics. 4. By supporting the tone of the vessels, and thereby retarding further putrefaction, or obviating its effects. 5. By moderating the violence of reaction, considered as a means of increasing putrefaction.\n\nThe further application of putrid or putreficient matter may be avoided, 1. By removing the patient from places filled with corrupted air. 2. By preventing the accumulation of the patient's own effluvia, by a constant ventilation, and by a frequent change of bedclothes and body linen. 3. By the careful and speedy removal of all excremental matters from the patient's chamber. 4. By avoiding animal food.\n\nThe putrid or putreficient matter already present in the body, may be evacuated partly by frequent evacuations of the contents of the intestines; and more effectually still by supporting the excretions of perspiration.\nIt is observable, that the sick are never so easy as when they are in a gentle sweat; for this soon removes the hurry of spirits, exacerbations of heat, &c. But profuse sweats should never be encouraged, much less induced, by very strong heating medicines, especially in the beginning or advance of the fever; for they too much exhaust the vital powers, and are followed by a vast dejection of spirits, tremors, startings of the tendons, and sometimes end in rigors, cold clammy sweats, syncope, or a comatose disposition. Sometimes irregular partial heats and flushes succeed, with great anxiety, restlessness, delirium, difficulty of breathing, and a vast load and oppression in the precordialia, so as to incline the less cautious observer to think there may be something pneumonic in it; but even here we must beware of bleeding, as the pulse will be found very small and unequal, though very quick. Nor is bleeding contraindicated only by the weakness and fluttering of the pulse, but also by the pale, limpid, and watery urine which is commonly attendant. These symptoms denote the load, anxiety, and oppression on the precordialia to proceed from an affection of the nervous system, and not from a pneumonic obstruction or inflammation. The breathing in this case, though thick and laborious, is not hot, but a kind of sighing or sobbing respiration, nor is there often any kind of cough concomitant; so that it has been conjectured to proceed from some spasm on the vitals. Here therefore the nervous cordial medicines are indicated, and blisters to the thighs, legs, or arms.\n\nThe above-mentioned difficulty of breathing, anxiety, and oppression, many times precede a miliary eruption, which often appears on the seventh, ninth, or eleventh day of the fever, and sometimes later. Indeed great anxiety and oppression on the precordialia always precede putrid eruptions of any kind in all sorts of fevers. This eruption should be promoted by soft easy cordials and proper diluents; to which should be sometimes added some gentle aromatics. These tend to calm the universal uneasiness commonly complained of, and also very effectually promote a diaphoresis, with which the miliary eruptions freely and easily advance. But however advantageous these commonly are, profuse sweats are seldom or never so, even though attended with a very large eruption. Two or three crops of these miliary pustules have been known to succeed one another, following profuse sweats, not only without advantage, but with great detriment to the patients, as they were thereby reduced to an extreme degree of weakness; so that they may justly be reckoned symptomatic rather than anything else, and the consequent eruption is often merely the symptom of a symptom.\n\nIn these profuse colliquative sweatings a little generous red wine (diluted somewhat, if necessary) may be given with the greatest advantage; as it pleasantly moderates the sweats, supports the patient, and keeps up the miliary populace if they happen to attend. Towards the decline of the fever also, where the sweats are abundant and weakening, small doses of the tincture of cinchona with saffron and snakeroot may be given with the greatest advantage, frequently interposing a dose of rhubarb to carry off the putrid collyvies in the first passages; which withal makes the remissions or intermissions that often happen in the decline of nervous fevers.\nfevers more distinct and manifest, and gives a fairer opportunity of throwing in the bark; for in the proper exhibition of this medicine we are to place our chief hope of curing both the nervous and putrid malignant fevers.\n\nII.

This disease has been supposed to differ from the former in degree only; and there are many circumstances which would lead us to conclude, that both frequently originate from a contagion precisely of the same nature. In the same manner we see, during different seasons, and in different circumstances, various degrees of malignity in smallpox. Though every instance of the disease depends on the introduction of a peculiar and specific contagion into the body, yet this contagion in particular epidemics evidently possesses peculiar malignancy. The same is probably the case with the typhoid fever: But whether this observation be well founded or not, there cannot be a doubt that the typhus gravior or putrid fever is a disease of the most dangerous nature, as, besides the extreme debility of the nervous system, there is a rapid tendency of the fluids to putrefaction, which sometimes cuts off the patient in a few days, nay, in the warm climates, in 12 or 14 hours; or if the patient recovers, he is for a long time, even in this country, in an exceedingly weak state, and requires many weeks to recover his former health.\n\nThe putrid fevers, according to Huxham, make their attack with much more violence than the slow nervous ones; the rigors are sometimes very great, though sometimes scarce felt; the heats much sharper and permanent; yet, at first, sudden, transient, and remittent: the pulse more tense and hard, but commonly quick and small; though sometimes slow, and seemingly regular for a time, and then fluttering and unequal. The headache, nausea, and vomiting, are much more considerable even from the beginning. Sometimes a severe fixed pain is felt in one or both temples, or over one or both eyebrows; frequently in the bottom of the orbits of the eyes. The eyes always appear very dull, heavy, sometimes yellowish, and very often a little inflamed. The countenance seems bloated, and more dead-coloured than usual. Commonly the temporal arteries throb much, and a tinnitus aurium is very troublesome: a strong vibration also of the carotid arteries frequently takes place in the advance of the fever, though the pulse at the wrist may be small, nay even slow; this is a certain sign of an impending delirium,\nMEDICINE.\n\nFeverium, and generally proceeds from some considerable obstructions in the brain.\n\nThe prostration of spirits, weakness, and faintness, are often surprisingly great and sudden, though noordinate evacuation happens; and this too sometimes when the pulse seems tolerably strong. The respiration is most commonly laborious, and interrupted with a kind of sighing or sobbing, and the breath is hot and offensive.\n\nFew or none of these fevers are without pain in the back and loins; always an universal weariness or forens is felt, and often much pain in the limbs. Sometimes a great heat, load, and pain, affect the pit of the stomach, with perpetual vomiting of porraceous or black bile, and a most troublesome singultus; the matter discharged is frequently of a very nauseous smell. The tongue, though only white at the beginning, grows daily more dark and dry; sometimes of a shining livid colour, with a kind of dark bubble at top; sometimes exceeding black; and so continues for many days together; nor is the thirst to be got off many times for several days, even after a favourable crisis; at the height of the disease, it generally becomes very dry, stiff, and black, or of a dark pomegranate colour. Hence the speech is very inarticulate, and scarce intelligible. The thirst in the increase of the fever is commonly very great, sometimes unquenchable; and yet no kind of drink pleases, but all seem bitter and mawkish; at other times, however, no thirst is complained of, though the mouth and tongue are exceedingly foul and dry; this is always a dangerous symptom, and ends in a frenzy or coma. The lips and teeth, especially near the height, are covered with a very black tenacious froth. At the commencement of the fever, the urine is often crude, pale, and vapour, but grows much higher coloured in the advance, and frequently resembles a strong lixivium, or citrine urine, tinged with a small quantity of blood; it is without the least sediment or cloud, and so continues for many days together; by degrees it grows darker, like dead strong high-coloured beer, and smells very rank and offensive. In petechial fevers, the urine has often been seen almost black and very fetid. The stools, especially near the height, or in the decline of the fever, are for the most part intolerably fetid, green, livid, or black, frequently with severe gripes and blood. When they are more yellow or brown, the less is the danger; but the highest when they run off infinently, whatever their colour may be. It is likewise a very bad symptom when the belly continues tense, swollen, and hard, after profuse stools; for this is generally the consequence of an inflammation or mortification of the intestines. A gentle diarrhoea is often very beneficial, and sometimes seems to be the only way which nature takes to carry off the morbid matter.\n\nSometimes black, livid, dun, or greenish spots appear on different parts of the skin, particularly on the breast, which always indicate a high degree of malignity; but the more florid the spots are, the less danger is to be feared. It is also a good sign when the black or violet petechiae become of a brighter colour. The large, black, or livid spots, are almost always attended with profuse haemorrhagies; and the small, dusky, brown spots, like freckles, are not much less dangerous than the livid or black; though they are seldom accompanied with fluxes of blood; excessively profuse, cold, clammy sweats are often concomitant, by which also they sometimes vanish, though without any advantage to the patient. The eruption of the petechiae is uncertain; sometimes they appear on the fourth or fifth day, though sometimes not till the eleventh, or even later. The vibices, or large dark, blue, or greenish marks, seldom appear till very near the fatal period. Frequently also we meet with an efflorescence like the measles in malignant fevers, but of a much more dull and livid hue; in which the skin, especially on the breast, appears as it were marbled or variegated. This in general is an ill symptom, and is often attended with fatal consequences.\n\nSometimes about the 11th or 14th day, on the occurrence of profuse sweats, the petechiae disappear, and vast quantities of white milky pustules break out. This is seldom found of any considerable advantage; but an itching, smarting, red rash, commonly gives great relief; and so do the large, fretting, watery bladders, which many times rise upon the back, breast, shoulders, &c. A scabby eruption likewise about the lips and nose is one of the salutary symptoms; and the more hot and angry it is, so much the better. But of much more uncertain and dangerous event are the brown-coloured aphthae; nor are those that are exceeding white and thick, like lard, of a very promising aspect. They are soon succeeded by great difficulty of swallowing, pain and ulceration of the fauces, oesophagus, &c., and with an incessant singultus: the whole prime vis become at last affected; a bloody dysentery comes on, followed by a sphacelation of the intestines; as is evident from the black, fomentous, and bloody stools, extremely fetid and infectious. Vibices, or large, black, and bluish marks resembling bruises, are frequently seen towards the close of the fever; and, when attended with lividity and coldness of the extremities, are certain tokens of approaching death. In some cases, the blackness has been known to reach almost to the elbows, and the hands have been dead-cold for a day or two before the death of the patient.\n\nSuch are the general appearances of the putrid malignant fever in this country, among those who enjoy a free air, and are not crowded together, or exposed to the causes of infection: but, in jails, hospitals, or other places where the sick are crowded, and in some measure deprived of the benefit of the free air, the symptoms are, if possible, more terrible. Sir John Pringle, who had many opportunities of observing it, tells us, that the jail or hospital fever, in the beginning, is not easy to be distinguished from a common fever. The first symptoms are slight interchanges of heat and cold, a trembling of the hands, sometimes a tense of numbness in the arms, weakness of the limbs, loss of appetite; and the disorder increasing towards night, the body grows hot, the sleep is interrupted, and not refreshing. With these symptoms, for the most part, there is some pain or confusion in the head; the pulse at first is a little quicker than natural, and the patients find themselves too much indisposed to go about busily, though too well to be wholly confined. When the fever advances, the above-mentioned symptoms are in a higher degree; and in particular the patient\npatient complains of a languor, nausea, pains in his back, a more constant pain and confusion in his head, attended with an uncommon dejection of spirits. At this time the pulse is never sunk, but beats quick, and often varies in the same day both as to strength and fulness. It is little affected by bleeding, if a moderate quantity of blood be taken away; but if the evacuation be large, and especially if it be repeated, to answer a false indication of inflammation, the pulse, increasing in frequency, is apt to sink in force, and often irrecoverably, whilst the patient becomes delirious. But we must observe, that, in every case, independent of evacuations, the pulse sooner or later sinks, and then gives certain evidence of the nature of the disease. The appearance of the blood is various; for though it be commonly little altered, yet sometimes it will be fizzy, not only on the first attack, but after the fever is formed. The worst appearance is when the claretamentum is dissolved; though this does not happen till the advanced state of the fever; indeed this seems not easy to be ascertained, as blood has been so seldom taken away at that time. The urine is also various. Sometimes it is of a reddish or flame colour, which it preserves a long time; but it is often pale, and changes from time to time in colour as well as crudity, being sometimes clear, sometimes clouded: towards the end, upon a favourable crisis, it becomes thick, but does not always deposit a sediment. If the sick lie warm, and have had no preceding flux, the belly is generally bound; but when they lie cold, as they often do in field-hospitals, the pores of the skin being shut, a diarrhoea is a common symptom, but is not critical. In the worst cases, a flux appears in the last stage; then the stools are involuntary, colliquative, ichorous, or bloody, and have a cadaverous smell; the effects of a mortification of the bowels, and the sign of approaching death. When the hospitals are filled with dysenteric patients, some of the nurses will be infected with the flux only, and others with this fever, ending in these bloody and gangrenous stools.\n\nIn the beginning the heat is moderate; and even in the advanced state, on first touching the skin, it seems inconsiderable: but upon feeling the pulse for some time, we are sensible of an uncommon heat (the calor mordicans, as it has been called), leaving an unpleasant sensation on the fingers for a few minutes. A day or two before death, if care be not taken, the extremities become cold, and the pulse is then hardly to be felt. The skin is generally dry and parched; though sometimes there are longer or shorter sweats, especially in the beginning. Such as are produced by medicine are of no use, except on the first attack, at which time they will often remove the fever; and natural sweats are never critical till the distemper begins to decline. These last are rarely profuse, but gentle, continued, and equally diffused over the body; sometimes the disease will terminate by an almost imperceptible moisture of the skin; the sweats are usually fetid, and offensive even to the patient himself.\n\nThe tongue is commonly dry; and, without constant care of the nurse, becomes hard and brown, with deep chops: but this symptom is common to most fevers. At other times, though rarely, the tongue is soft and moist to the last, but with a mixture of a greenish or yellowish colour. The thirst is sometimes great, but more frequently moderate. In the advanced state, the breath is offensive, and a blackish furring gathers about the roots of the teeth.\n\nSome are never delirious, but all lie under a stupor or confusion; few retain their senses till death: many lose them early, and from two causes; either from immoderate bleeding, or the premature use of warm and spirituous medicines. They rarely sleep; and, unless delirious, have more of a dejected and thoughtful look than what is commonly seen in other fevers. The face is late in acquiring either a ghastly or a very morbid appearance; yet the eyes are always muddy, and generally the white is of a reddish cast as if inflamed. The confusion of head commonly rises to a delirium, especially at night; but, unless by an unseasonable hot regimen, it seldom turns to rage, or to those high flights of imagination common in other fevers. When the delirium comes to that height, the face is flushed, the eyes red, the voice is quick, and the patient struggles to get up. But when that symptom is owing to large evacuations, or only to the advanced state of the disease, the face appears meagre; the eye-lids in flutters are only half shut; and the voice, which is commonly low and slow, sinks to a degree scarce to be heard. From the beginning there is generally a great dejection and failure of strength. A tremor of the hands is more common than a flaring of the tendons; and if the subsultus occurs, it is in a lesser degree than in many other fevers. In every stage of the disease, as the pulse sinks, the delirium and tremors increase; and in proportion as the pulse rises, the head and spirits are relieved. Sometimes in the beginning, but for the most part in the advanced state, the patient grows dull of hearing, and at last almost deaf. When the fever is protracted, with a low and low voice, the sick have a particular craving for something cordial, and nothing so cordial or so acceptable as wine. They long for no food, yet willingly take a little panada if wine be added. But such as are delirious, with a quick voice, wild looks, a subsultus tendinum, or violent actions, though their pulse be sunk, yet bear neither hot medicines, wine, nor the common cordials.\n\nVomiting, and complaints of a load and sickness at stomach, though usual symptoms, are not essential to the disease; nor are pleuritic stitches, difficulty in breathing, or flying pains, to be referred so much to it as to the constitution of the patient, or to a preceding cold.\n\nA petechial efflorescence is a frequent, though not an inseparable, attendant of this fever. It sometimes appears of a brighter or paler red, at other times of a livid colour, but never rises above the skin. The spots are small; but generally so confluent, that at a little distance the skin appears only somewhat redder than ordinary, as if the colour was uniform; but upon a nearer inspection interstices are seen. For the most part this eruption is so little conspicuous, that unless it be looked for attentively, it may escape notice. The spots appear thickset on the back and breast, less on the legs and arms, and Sir John Pringle never remembers to have seen any on the face. As to the time of their appearance, he agrees entirely with Dr Huxham. These spots are never critical, nor are they reckoned among the mortal symptoms; but only concur with other signs to ascertain the nature of the disease. The nearer they\nPractice.\n\nMEDICINE.\n\nFebres they approach to purple, the more they are to be dreaded. In a few cases, instead of spots, purple streaks and blotches were observed. Sometimes the petechiae did not appear till after death; and there was one case in which, after bleeding, the petechiae were seen only on the arm below the ligature, and nowhere else on the skin.\n\nThe hospital fever, though accounted one of the continued kind, yet has generally some exacerbation at night, with a remission and often partial sweats in the day; and after a long continuance it is apt to change into a hectic, or an intermittent form. The length of the disease is uncertain. Sometimes it was terminated, either in death or recovery, in seven days after the patient took to his bed; but in the hospitals it generally continued from 14 to 20, and some died or recovered after four weeks. From the time of the sinking of the pulse until death or a favourable crisis, there is perhaps less change to be seen from day to day in this than in most other fevers. When its course is long, it sometimes terminates in suppurations of the parotid or axillary glands; and when these do not appear, it is probable that the fever is kept up by the formation of some internal abscesses. The parotid glands themselves do not suppurate, but only some of the lymphatic glands that lie over them. Sir John Pringle observed one instance of a swelling of this kind on both sides, without any previous indisposition, when the person, not suspecting the cause, and applying disquieting cataplasms, was, upon the tumor subsiding, seized with the hospital-fever. Many patients after the crisis of this fever complain of a pain in the limbs and want of rest; and almost all of them mention great weakness, confusion in their head, vertigo, and a noise in their ears.\n\nTen of the bodies of those who died of this distemper in Houghton's regiment were opened. In some, all the cavities were examined; in others, only the brain and the bowels. In some of them, the brain appeared to be suppurrated. The first of this kind Sir John Pringle met with at Ghent; but the man being brought into the hospital from the barracks no earlier than two days before he died, he could only conjecture from the symptoms and the imperfect accounts he had of him, that his death was owing to a fever of this kind, after lingering near a month in it. About three ounces of purulent matter were found in the ventricles of the brain, and the whole cortical and medullary substance was uncommonly flaccid and tender; nay, some of the same kind of matter was found in the substance of the upper part of the cerebellum: yet this person, with some stupor and deafness, had his senses till the night before he died; so far, at least, that he answered distinctly when roused and spoken to; but about that time the muscles of his face began to be convulsed. Of two other instances of men who undoubtedly died of this fever, in one the cerebrum was suppurrated, in the other the cerebellum. In the former case, the patient was under a stupor, with deafness from the beginning; but was never delirious, nor altogether insensible. His pulse sunk early; and about ten days before his death his head began to swell, and continued very large till within two days before he died, when it subsided a little. For several days before his end, he would take nothing but cold water, and during his illness he lay constantly upon one side. The head being opened, an abscess as large as an egg was found in the substance of the forepart of the right hemisphere of the brain, full of thin matter like whey. At that time five more, ill of the same fever, had the like swelling of their heads, but recovered. In the other case, the abscess in the cerebellum was about the size of a small pigeon's egg, and contained also a thin ichorous matter; nor had this patient ever been so thoroughly insensible as not to answer reasonably when spoken to. Two days before he died his urine turned pale.\n\nThese suppurations, however, were not constant; for another who died about the same time, and had been ill about the same number of days with the like symptoms, the pale water excepted, had no abscess either in the brain or cerebellum. Two were opened afterwards, in whom the cortical substance of the brain had an inflammatory appearance, but no suppuration. In one of them the large intesines were corrupted: that man went off with a loofeness; and just before he died, an ichorous matter was discharged from his nose. In the military hospital at Ipswich, one who unexpectedly died of this fever after having been seemingly in a fair way of recovery, had no suppuration in his brain; but in another, who died after an abscess in both orbits, the brain was found flaccid, and about two ounces of a thin serum in the ventricles.\n\nCauses of, and persons subject to, this disorder. The cause of this fever, as well as that of the flow-nervous fever, is an infection or contagion from some diseased animal-body, or from corrupted vegetables; and therefore is very little, if at all, different from those pestilential disorders which have arisen after battles, where great numbers of dead bodies were allowed to lie above ground, and infect the air with their effluvia. This is confirmed by an observation of Forelius, who was eyewitness to a distemper of this kind (which indeed he calls a plague) owing to the same cause, attended with buboes and a high degree of contagion. The same author also gives an account of a malignant fever breaking out at Egmont in North-Holland, occasioned by the rotting of a whale which had been left on the shore. We have a like observation of a fever affecting the crew of a French ship, by the putrefaction of some cattle which they had killed on the island of Nevis in the West Indies. These men were seized with a pain in their head and loins, great weakness, and a disorder of the stomach, accompanied with fever. Some had carbuncles; and on others purple spots appeared after death.\n\nGalen assigns two causes for pestilential fevers:\n\n1. The great heat of the weather, when the humours happen to be in a more putrefactive state than usual.\n2. A putrid state of the air, arising either from a multitude of dead bodies left unburied, as after a battle, or from the evaporation of corrupted lakes and marshes.\n\nOne of the most remarkable diseases incident to an army is related by Diodorus, as breaking out among the Carthaginians at the siege of Syracuse. That author not only relates some of its most distinguishing symptoms, but reasons well about its cause. He observes, that pains in the back and eruptions (παρατηναι) were common; that some had bloody stools; that others were seized with a delirium, so as to run about and beat all that came in their way; that the physicians...\ncians knew no cure; and that it was the more fatal as the sick were abandoned by every body on account of the contagion. As to the cause, the author takes notice of the multitude of people confined within a narrow compass; of the situation of the camp in low and wet ground; of the scorching heats in the middle of the day, succeeded by the cold and damp air from the marshes in the night-time; to these he adds, the putrid fumes arising first from the marshes, and afterwards from the bodies of those who lay unburied.\n\nThis distemper seems to have been a compound of the marsh and pestilential fever.\n\nForelius remarks, that, from the putrefaction of the water only, the city of Delft, where he practised, was scarce ten years together free from the plague or some pestilential distemper. He adds, that the magistrates, upon his representation of the cause, erected a wind-mill for moving and refreshing the water. At that time Holland was much more subject to inundations and the stagnation of water than at present.\n\nIn 1694, a fever broke out at Rochfort in France, which, on account of the uncommon symptoms and great mortality, was at first believed to be the plague. But M. Chirac, who was sent by the court to inquire into its nature, found the cause to arise from some marshes that had been made by an inundation of the sea; and observed, that the corrupted fumes, which smelled like gun-powder, were carried to the town by the wind, which had long blown from that quarter. About two-thirds of those who were taken ill died. In such as were opened, the brain was found either inflamed or loaded with blood; the fibres of the body were uncommonly tender; and the bowels had either suppurred or were mortified.\n\nIt is needless to mention more instances of pestilential fevers being brought on by the fumes of corrupted substances, whether animal or vegetable. In general it may be remarked, that the putrefaction of these substances in a dry air is more apt to bring on a fever of the continued form; but in a moist air has a greater tendency to produce remitting fevers. But it must also be observed, that, even in cases where the most malignant fevers prevail, all persons are not equally disposed to receive the infection, though equally exposed to it with others. Some, through mere vigour of body and mind, cannot be infected with the most contagious diseases; while, on the other hand, those whose bodies are debilitated by a former disease, by study, low diet, or want, or those who have laboured under any of the depressing passions of the mind for some time, seldom or never escape. Men, therefore, who have been weakened by accidents (as those who have undergone a mercurial salivation) are very apt to fall into this distemper. Those who are taken into crowded hospitals, ill of the smallpox, however good the fort may be, fall readily into this fever, and run a greater risk of dying of it than others. The second fever is attended with double danger, feeling the patient has been so much weakened by the first. A sure sign of the corruption of the air in an hospital is when many of the nurses fall sick.\n\nPrognosis. In these fevers we cannot draw a prognostic from any symptom by itself; and perhaps all of them together are more fallible than in others. Generally the following are good: To have little delirium; the strength little impaired; turbid urine in the decline of the disease; and at that time a gentle sweat or moisture diffused over the body, or even the skin soft and the tongue moist; or to have some loose stools succeeded by a diaphoresis; the pulse to rise by wine or cordials, with an abatement of the stupor, tremor, and other affections of the brain. Deafness is rather a good sign. A sediment in the urine, without other changes for the better, is no sure sign of recovery; and some have recovered in whose urine there was no sediment.—The bad signs are, a subfulvus tendinum; the eyes much inflamed and flaring; the speech quick, and the sound of the voice altered; a high delirium; perpetual watchfulness; constant sickness at the stomach, and vomitings; frequent stools, with a sinking pulse, and the disorder of the head increased; coldness of the extremities, and a tremulous motion of the tongue. It is observed to be among the worst signs when the patient complains of blindness; when he swallows with difficulty, or cannot put out his tongue when desired to do it; when he can lie on his back only, and pulls up his knees; or when insensible he endeavours to uncover his breast, or makes frequent attempts to get out of bed without assigning any reason. If to any of these are added ichorous, cadaverous, and involuntary stools, it is a sign of a mortification of the bowels and approaching death. It will not seem strange to find most of these prognostics common to the advanced state of other fevers, when we consider, that from whatever cause fevers begin, by a long continuance the humours are corrupted, and the brain and nerves affected much in the same manner as in those which arise from infection.\n\nPrevention and cure. As distempers of the putrid kind never arise without an infection received from some quarter or other, the methods of prevention must evidently be reduced to two general heads. 1. To avoid receiving the infection into the body; and, 2. To put the body in such a situation as may enable it to resist the infection when received. On both these methods scarce any writer hath equalled Dr Lind of Hafnar, whose opinions and directions therefore we shall give pretty fully.\n\nAs putrid diseases are very common and violent in the hot countries, it is very necessary for Europeans who visit these climates to be well informed, in the first place, of the signs of an unhealthy country, that they may be upon their guard as soon as they enter any foreign region. These signs are by this author enumerated as follows.\n\n1. A sudden and great alteration in the air, at sunset, from intolerable heat to a chilling cold. This is perceived as soon as the sun is down, and is for the most part accompanied with a very heavy dew; it flows an unhealthy swampy soil, the nature of which is such, that no sooner the sun-beams are withdrawn, than the vapours emitted from it render the air damp, raw, and chilling, in the most sultry climates; so that even under the equator, in some unhealthy places, the night-air is very cold to an European constitution.\n\n2. Thick noisome fogs, chiefly after sunset, arising from the valleys, and particularly from the mud, slime, or other impurities. In hot countries, the smell of these...\nthese fogs may be compared to that of a new-cleaned ditch. Diseases therefore, arising from this cause, generally take place in the night, or before sunrise.\n\n3. Numerous swarms of flies, gnats, and other insects which attend stagnated air and unhealthy places covered with wood.\n\n4. When all butchers' meat soon corrupts, and in a few hours becomes full of maggots; when metals are quickly corroded on being exposed to the air; and when a corpse becomes intolerably offensive in less than six hours; these are proofs of a close, hot, and unwholesome country. And in such places, during excessive heats and great calms, it is not altogether uncommon for Europeans, especially such as are of a gross habit of body, to be seized at once with the most alarming and fatal symptoms of what is called the yellow fever, without even any previous complaint of sickness or other symptoms of the disease. There has first been perceived an uneasy itching sensation, commonly in the legs; and upon pulling down the stockings, streams of thin dissolved blood followed, a ghastly yellow colour quickly diffused itself over the whole body, and the patient has been carried off in less than forty-eight hours.\n\n5. A sort of sandy soil, commonly a small, loose, white sand, as that at Penfascola, Whydah, and the island of Bonavista, which is found by experience to be injurious to health. The pestiferous vapour arising, during the summer months and in the heat of the day, from such a sandy soil, is best characterized by its effects in the extensive deserts of Asia and Africa. It there constitutes what is called the Sambal-wind; a blast which, in the parched desert, proves instantly fatal both to man and beast; but when it passes over a soil well covered with grass and vegetables, has its effects greatly mitigated; it is, however, even then, productive of sickness; thus the foetid winds, while they blow from the deserts of Libya during the summer, at Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, produce an unhealthy fection; and at Madras the winds, which, in the months of April and May, pass over a large tract of land, are always hot, disagreeable, and unwholesome.\n\nDuring these land-winds, sudden gusts of a more hot and suffocating nature are often observed to come from these lands once or twice, or even more frequently, in a day, which seem to be this vapour in a purer form. These gusts pass very quickly, and affect persons who happen to stand with their faces towards them in the same manner as the hot air which issues from a burning furnace, or from a heated oven, and obliges them immediately to turn away from it in order to recover breath. The effect of this hot suffocating blast or vapour on the human body, even when mitigated by passing through a moist atmosphere, is the same as that of intense cold; it flutes up every pore of the skin, and entirely stops the perspiration of such as are exposed to it. These blasts come only in the daytime, and always from the deserts. Water is the only known corrector or antidote against them; hence, coarse thick clothes, kept constantly wet, and hung up at the windows or doors, greatly mitigate their violence. A house so built as to have no windows or doors towards the deserts, is an excellent protection against their pernicious effects. The hot land-winds constantly blow at Madras and other places on the coast of Coromandel, at that season, from midnight till noon; the sea-breezes then begin, which relieve the difficulty in breathing, and the obstructed perspiration, which the former occasioned.\n\nThat the heat of these land-winds, as also of the sudden gusts which accompany them, proceed from large tracts of land heated by the sun, is evident from the increased heat and suffocating quality of those winds, in proportion as the day advances, and as the heat of the season is increased. The opposite winds, blowing from each side of the Balaghat mountains, are a farther proof of this. These mountains, running from north to south, divide the hither Peninsula of India into two equal parts, and separate what is called the Malabar from the Coromandel coast. To the former they are very near, but at a great distance from the latter. The winds blowing from those hills are on the Malabar coast always remarkably cool; but on the coast of Coromandel, in the months of April, May, June, and July, are extremely hot and suffocating, as they pass over a large tract of intermediate sand, heated during those months by an almost vertical sun. Hence the Malabar coast is always covered with an agreeable verdure; whereas the Coromandel coast, during the continuance of these hot winds, seems a barren wilderness, nothing appearing green except the trees. On the contrary, the winds that pass over these sands, after being wet with the rains, are the coolest which blow at Madras. Bottles of liquor inclosed in bags of coarse cloth, kept constantly wet, and suspended in the shade, where those hot winds may have access to them, become as cold as if they had been immersed in a solution of nitre; an effect owing undoubtedly to the constant evaporation of water from the surface.\n\nIt is an observation of the natives on the coast of Coromandel, which is confirmed by the experience of many Europeans, that the longer the hot land-winds blow, the healthier are the ensuing months; these winds, as they express it, purifying the air. Are not the winds therefore the cause why the air on the coast of Coromandel, except during their continuance, is more healthy than in other parts of India where these winds do not blow? Does not this also suggest a very probable reason, why the plague in Egypt generally ceases in the beginning of June; the periodical hot winds which come from the deserts of Nubia and Ethiopia having then rendered the air of Egypt pure and wholesome? Many have ascribed that effect to the north winds; as the plague not only ceases when they blow, but all infected goods, household-furniture, and wearing apparel, are then said to become entirely free from the contagion; these, however, cannot be the cause, as the most destructive plague is abated in its violence, if not wholly eradicated, before they let in. With equal propriety we may reject the opinion that the overflowing of the Nile is productive of that salutary effect, as the plague generally ceases before the increase of that river is perceptible.\n\nThus the plague, the greatest calamity which can afflict mankind, seems to be destroyed by those hot winds, which are otherwise so pernicious to animal and vegetable life. And although, during the continuance of these winds, the most fruitful fields wear\nthe aspect of a parched desert; yet no sooner the rains fall, but vegetation is restored, the plants revive, and a beautiful verdure is again spread over the face of the country.\n\nHaving thus given an account of the signs of an unhealthy country, Dr Lind next proceeds to mention such employments as are particularly dangerous to Europeans on their first arrival. One of these is the cutting down of trees, shrubs, &c., or clearing the ground, as it is called. Of the unhealthiness of this employment he gives two instances. At the conclusion of the late peace, the captain of a ship of war went on shore at the island of Dominica, with 12 of his men, to cut down the wood, and to clear a piece of ground which he intended to have purchased: but, in a few days, sickness obliged him to desist from this dangerous work; the captain and 11 of his men being seized with violent fevers, which terminated in obstinate intermittents, and of which several died. The survivors suffered so much in their constitutions, that, even after they came to England, the return of an east wind was apt to bring on a violent fit of the ague. The Ludlow-Castle, a ship of war of 40 guns, in a voyage to the coast of Guinea, also lost 25 of her men at Sierra Leone, who were employed in cutting down wood for the ship. This is an occupation which has often proved destructive to Europeans in those climates, and in which they ought never to be employed, especially during the rainy season; there being numberless instances of white persons, when cutting down the woods at that season, who have been taken ill in the morning, and dead before night.\n\nAnother evil, less known, and less suspected, but no less dangerous, is the sending Europeans in open boats after sunset, where the soil is swampy, or where there are great night-fogs. The single duty alone of fetching fresh-killed butchers meat at night for the use of our ships companies in the East and West Indies, has destroyed every year several thousand seamen. In those parts of the world, butchers meat must be brought on board at night immediately after it is killed, otherwise it will not be fit for use the next day; but a contract made with the natives to send it on board at that time, which might be done for a trifling sum, would be the means of preserving many useful lives. During the fickle season at Batavia, a boat belonging to the Medway, which attended on shore every night, was three times successively manned, not one having survived that service. They were all taken ill in the night, when on shore, or when returning on board; so that at length the officers were obliged to employ none but the natives on that business. Great numbers of men have perished from being employed in this manner at Bengal, where the European ships often anchor in the most unhealthy spots of the river; and even when the great night-fogs arise, after the rainy season, the men are often obliged to perform such night-services in boats. Now since it is so dangerous for Europeans in unhealthy countries, particularly during a season of sickness, to be exposed in an open boat to the foggy night-air, it must appear that sending them unsheltered, in open boats, far up rivers, in unhealthy southern climates, for the sake of wood, water, trade, or other purposes, must be attended with the most destructive and fatal consequences.\n\nBurying the dead in swampy countries is another occupation which has proved fatal to many, and which ought to be entrusted to negroes or the natives of the country. The effluvia from the ground when newly opened, whether from graves or ditches, are far more dangerous than from the same swampy soil when the surface is undisturbed; nay, in some places, it has been found almost certain death for an European to dig a grave, unless long sealed to the country. In such a place, the attendance of friends at funerals ought to be dispensed with.\n\nIn all cases where it is practicable, the ships which visit these unhealthy countries should anchor at as great a distance as possible from shore; or if obliged to anchor near marshy grounds or swamps, especially during summer or in hot weather, and when the wind blows directly from thence, the gun-ports which would admit the noxious land-breeze ought to be kept shut, especially at night. Or if the ship rides with her head to the wind, a thick sail ought to be put upon the foremast, along which the smoke from the fire-place might be made constantly to play and ascend. If the sail should occasion a little smoke between decks, this inconvenience will be sufficiently compensated by its keeping off the direct stream of the swampy shore effluvia; which now being obliged to form a curve before they reach the more distant parts of the vessel, must needs be greatly diverted and scattered.\n\nThe best preservative against the mischievous impressions of a putrid fog, or of a marshy exhalation, is a close, sheltered, and covered place; such as the lower apartments in a ship, or a house in which there are no doors or windows facing the swamps. If in such places a fire be kept either at the doors and other inlets to a house, or in the chambers, as is practised in some unhealthy countries during the rainy or foggy season, it will prove an excellent and effectual protection against the injuries of a bad air. On board of ships also fires may be made at the hatchways; and of the good effects of this we have the following example. When the Edgar, a ship of war of 60 guns, was upon the coast of Guinea in the year 1768, her men were very sickly, and many of them died; however it was observed, that in a floop of war, which was constantly in company with her, few were taken ill, and not one died during the whole voyage. This could be ascribed to no other cause, but that in the floop the fire-place for cooking victuals was on the same level with the deck where the men lay; and every morning when the fire was lighted, especially when there was but little wind, the smoke from the cook-room spread itself all over the ship, and particularly over those parts where the men lay; but from the construction of the fire-place of the Edgar, no smoke from it ever came between her decks.\n\nPersons on board any ship whatever, are much more safe, and their situation is much preferable to that of those who make distant inland excursions in small boats upon the rivers, and who are for the most part ignorant of the cause of those maladies which destroy them. The intolerable heat at noon often obliges such persons to go in a manner half naked; while a free and plentiful perspiration issues from every pore. A near approach to putrid swamps at this time is apt to produce an immediate sickness, vomiting, and afterwards...\nafterwards a low nervous or malignant fever. If they happen to pass them at night, or lie near them in an open boat, the air from those swamps is perceived to be quite chill and cold; in so much that warm thick clothing becomes absolutely requisite to guard the body against the impressions of so great an alteration in the air, and against its cold and inclement quality: for the effects of it then, even on the most healthy and vigorous constitution, is frequently a chilling cold fit of anague, terminating in a fever with delirium, bilious vomitings, and purging, or even death itself.\n\nWhere such exposure becomes unavoidable, the only method is to defend the body as much as possible against the pernicious miasmas with which the air abounds.—All those who are employed in cutting down woods, or in other laborious and dangerous services in hot climates, during the heat of the day, ought to have their heads covered with a bladder dipped in vinegar, and to wash their mouths often with the same liquor; never to swallow their spittle, but rather to chew a little rhubarb or some other bitter, and spit it out frequently; to stop their nostrils with a small bit of linen or tow dipped in camphorated vinegar; and to infuse some Peruvian bark, garlic, and rhubarb, in brandy, of which a dram is to be taken, either by itself or diluted with water, morning and evening.\n\nIn the evening before sunset they should leave off work, and not return to their labour in the morning till the sun has dispersed the unwholesome dews and vapours. Those who must of necessity remain on shore, and sleep in dangerous places, should take care not to sleep upon the ground exposed to the dews, but in hammocks in a close tent, standing upon a dry sand, gravel, or chalk, near the sea shore, and where there is no subterraneous water for at least four feet below the surface of the ground. The door of this tent should be made to open towards the sea; and the back part of it, which receives the land breeze, must be well secured by double canvas, or covered with branches of trees. But in such circumstances, a hut, when it can be procured, is preferable to a tent, especially if it be well thatched, so as to prove a defence both against the excessive heat of the sun by day, and the noxious dews which fall at night. Here the men may be enjoined to smoke tobacco. When the air is thick, moist, and chill, the earth being overspread with cold dew, a constant fire must be kept in and about the tent or hut, as the most excellent means of purifying such unwholesome air, and of preserving the health of those who either sleeping or waking are exposed to its influence. The sentinels who guard the water-casks, ought likewise at such a time to have a fire burning near them. All old and forsaken habitations, natural caves and grottos in the earth, where the men may be induced to take up their abode, must before their admission be perfectly dried and purified with sufficient fires. Fire and smoke are undoubtedly the great purifiers of all tainted and unwholesome air, and the most excellent preservatives against its noxious influence. It is the custom of the negroes in Guinea, and also of some Indians (who both sleep for the most part on the ground), to have a fire, producing a little smoke, constantly burning in their huts where they sleep. This not only corrects the moisture of the night, but also, by occasioning more smoke than heat, renders the damp from the earth less noxious; of which Dr Lind gives the following remarkable instance. A Guinea ship being up one of the rivers for the sake of trade, it was found to be very dangerous to sleep on shore; without which their trade could not be so conveniently carried on. First the captain, then the mate, and two or three of the seamen, were taken ill; each of them, the morning after they had lain on shore. By these accidents the men were greatly intimidated from lying ashore; till the surgeon boldly offered to try the experiment on himself. Next morning when he waked, he found himself seized, as the rest, with a giddiness and pain in the head. He immediately acquainted one of the negroes with his condition, who carried him to his hut, and let him down in the smoke of it; when his shiverings and giddiness soon left him. He then took a dram of the bark bitter; and found himself greatly relieved, especially by breathing some time in the smoke.—Thus instructed by the negro, he ordered a large fire to dry the hut he slept in; and afterwards had every night a small fire sufficient to raise a gentle smoke, without occasioning a troublesome heat: and by this means he and several others, using the same precautions, slept many nights on shore without any inconvenience.\n\nFire and smoke indeed are found to be certain correctors, or rather destroyers, of infection in all cases, whether arising from the noxious effluvia of marshes, or from the contagion of diseased bodies. Even those most extraordinary and fatal damps called harmattans, are unable to resist the salutary effects of smoke. In other cases, Dr Lind remarks, that, under some circumstances, the source of an infection in a sick chamber or any other place, may be removed or destroyed by accidental means, for which we cannot account, and which we often cannot ascertain. But it oftener happens, that it is very difficultly rooted out; and that exact cleanliness, with the benefit of a pure air, often proves insufficient to remove the evil. Smoke, however, has never been known to fail. It is not to be doubted, that, excepting the true plague, there has been an infection fully as pestilential and as mortal in some ships as in any other place whatever; yet it has never been heard, that any ship, after having been carefully smoked, did not immediately become healthy: and if afterwards they turned sickly, it was easy to trace that sickness from other infected ships, jails, and the like places.\n\nThere are three methods practised for purifying vessels after the men have been removed out of them. The first is by burning of tobacco. A quantity of tobacco is spread on several fires, made with such old pieces of rope as are called junk. These are dispersed into different places of the ship, and their heat and smoke afterwards closely confined below for a considerable time.—The second method is by charcoal fires fired with brimstone. The heat and steam of these burning materials must also be long and close shut up; but, although this fume, properly applied, has been found by experience to purify most effectually tainted apartments, ships, clothes, &c. yet there are some kinds of vermin which it will not destroy, particularly lice. The third method of purification is performed by the addition of arsenic to the materials of the second process.\ncells in the following manner. After carefully stopping up all the openings and every small crevice of the ship (as was also necessary in the preceding processes), a number of iron pots, properly secured, are to be placed in the hold, orloge, gun-deck, &c. Each of these is to contain a layer of charcoal at the bottom, then a layer of brimstone, and so alternately three or four layers of each, upon which the arsenic is to be sprinkled, and on the top of it some oakum dipped in tar is to be laid to serve as a match. The men, upon setting fire to the oakum, must speedily leave the place, shutting close the hatchway by which they came up.\n\nFrom the known and experienced efficacy of these processes, it appears, that fire and smoke are powerful agents for annihilating infection; and, it may be presumed, even the plague itself. This is in some measure agreeable to what we learn from the ancient records of physic. But the preposterous use, or rather abuse, of fire on such occasions, has caused its effects to be disregarded by some, and to be suspected of mischief by others. The modern practice of burning large fires in the open air, in the streets, and about the walls of towns infected with the plague or other contagion, is founded on principles groundless and erroneous; and has therefore been found by experience not only unsuccessful, but hurtful. But though this must be allowed, it does not thence by any means follow, that when once a house hath been infected, and the patients removed from it, the doors and windows at the same time being shut, that such fires will then prove hurtful; or that, by this method of purification, all the seeds of contagion may not be effectually destroyed. Whenever, therefore, persons die of a spotted fever, a malignant sore throat, the small-pox, or any distemper found to be communicable from the sick to the sound, the corpse ought quickly after death to be removed into another room; that in which the person died should be well aired, by having the windows opened, till a charcoal fire be kindled, with some rolls of sulphur upon it; after which, both doors and windows should be kept shut for a considerable time, not less than eight or ten hours, till the room be thoroughly smoked. In several ships, where there are the fairest opportunities of trying and judging things of this nature, the contagion of the small-pox has been entirely stopped by wood-fires, sprinkled with brimstone, kept burning and closely confined in the infected place.\n\nIn a word, a judicious and proper application of fire and smoke is a powerful agent, for the destruction and utter extinction of the most malignant sources of disease; and they are besides great purifiers of all bad and tainted air.\n\nNext to the smoke of wood for purifying a tainted air, that of gun-powder is to be esteemed the best; and it has this further good property, that it is entirely inoffensive to the lungs. The cacailla-bark, when burning, gives a most agreeable scent to the chamber of the sick; thus it is at least an elegant preservative, and may prevent bad smells from taking effect. The steam of camphorated vinegar, warmed, is still more powerful for this purpose. But, besides correcting the ill quality of the air, and purifying the chamber, another good effect is produced from such steams and smoke as are inoffensive to the lungs. As soon as the vapour becomes dense, the nurses and patients become desirous of the admission of fresh air by the door or windows.\n\nNow it is certain, that the air in the chambers of the Typhus sick cannot be too often changed, provided the patient be well covered, and the curtains of his bed, if necessary, be drawn close. No argument is so forcible to obviate the danger of foul air in a room or ward (occasioned by the obstinacy of nurses or relations), as ordering it to be frequently fumigated or smoked: A practice more frequent in other countries than in this, but of great benefit to the sick.\n\nLastly, with regard to the method of purifying goods, moveables, clothes, &c. which are supposed to harbour infection, it must be observed, that the usual custom of only unpacking and exposing such materials to the open air, is in many instances insufficient to destroy the latent seeds of disease. It is certain indeed, that in most cases the contagious particles are more readily and fatally communicated from the clothes of a sick person than from his body. The spreading abroad, therefore, of contaminated clothes to dry or to be aired, without a previous fumigation of them, may be of dangerous and fatal consequence. All such suspected substances should be first fumigated in a close place, and in the same manner as an infected chamber, after which they may be spread abroad and exposed to the air. In infectious diseases, especially fevers, the linen of the sick, or such clothes about them as will admit of being washed, ought never at first to be put in warm water, as it is dangerous to receive the steam that may hence arise. It is necessary to steep them first either in cold water or in cold soap-les for several hours, that the filth may be washed off.\n\nBut although the destruction of contagion by smoke is unquestionably a very important practice, yet it cannot now be said, that it is the most powerful agent for this purpose. By the ingenious observations and experiments of M. Morveau in France, and of Dr Smyth Carmichael in England, it is now ascertained, that we possess still more powerful means of destroying contagions, either in the muriatic or nitrous acid gas. The former may easily be detached from common sea salt, and the latter from nitre, by means of the sulphuric acid. Rooms may, with the utmost safety and ease, be filled with these fumes, although the sick be not removed from them. But for disinfecting a room, ward, or ship, when empty, the most powerful article yet discovered is the oxygenated muriatic acid gas, detached from a mixture of manganese and sea salt, by means of the sulphuric acid.\n\nWe must now proceed to give an account of the method of cure, after these means of preventing the infection from being received into the body have either been neglected or proved ineffectual. Here it is of the utmost importance to take the disease in the very beginning, before it has time to corrupt the fluids to such a degree as to endanger life. In slight degrees of infection, a vomit properly administered, especially if succeeded by a blister, never fails to remove the disorder, and prevent the fever which would otherwise unavoidably follow. Of this Dr Lind gives the following instances. A lady afflicted with the bilious cholick, had intolerably fetid discharges of corrupted matters upwards and downwards. A gentlewoman, only in passing the room, was immediately seized with a retching and sickness, which continued 24 hours. The nurse who attended was suddenly\nIt often resembles the disagreeable smell of a person labouring under the confluent small-pox at their turn, though not so strong. One person, on receiving the infection, was sensible of something like an electric shock through his body. But many are not sensible of any effect from infection at first; and an infection from a fever will sometimes continue for many days, nay weeks, discovering itself chiefly by irregular shiverings, sometimes so severe as to oblige the patients to have recourse to their beds once or twice a day; sometimes every other day. Among a number thus affected, it also appears, that such as are put into uncleaned chambers, or have sat down on the cold ground, lain in raw damp apartments, &c., are immediately seized with a sickness at stomach, sometimes with a dangerous purging, and often with fevers accompanied with bad symptoms, which others have entirely escaped.\n\nIt now remains to consider the proper method of curing putrid fevers, on the supposition that the infection has been allowed to operate till the blood becomes radically tainted, and of consequence the nervous system affected to such a degree, that its power cannot be restored by any of the simple practices above mentioned. Here all authors agree, that a change of air, when it can be effected, is highly advantageous, and often contributes more towards the removing of the disease than all the medicines that can be exhibited. The utility of this change will appear from what has been formerly said; and we shall only further mention one instance from Dr Lind, in which the effects of bad air appear to a degree almost incredible. \"It is remarkable (says he), that, in the last war, the English ships which touched at Batavia suffered more by the malignant and fatal diseases of that climate, than they did in any other part of India, if we except a fatal scurvy which once raged in that fleet at sea. Soon after the capture of Manila, the Falmouth, a ship of 50 guns, went to Batavia, where she remained from the latter end of July to the latter end of January; during which time she buried 100 soldiers of the 79th regiment and 75 of the ship's company; not one person in the ship having escaped a fit of sickness, except her commander Captain Breerton. The Panther, a ship of 60 guns, was there in the years 1762 and 1764; and both times during the rainy season. In the former of these years, she buried 70 of her men; and 92 of them were very ill when she left the place. In the year 1764, during a short stay, 25 of her men died. The Medway, which was in company with her, lost also a great number of men. Nor was the sickness at that time confined to the ships: the whole city afforded a scene of disease and death; streets crowded with funerals, bells tolling from morning to night, and horses jaded with dragging the dead in hearse to their graves. At that time a slight cut of the skin, the least scratch of a nail, or the most inconsiderable wound, turned quickly to a spreading putrid ulcer, which in 24 hours consumed the flesh even to the bone. This fact is so extraordinary, that upon a single testimony, credit would hardly be given to it; yet on board the Medway and Panther they had the most fatal experience of it, and suffered much from it.\"\n\nBut where a change of air is impracticable or ineffectual, and where the fever has already made some progress, Sir John Pringle generally took away some blood if the pulse was full. When the symptoms run high,\nhigh, a plentiful evacuation of that kind seemed indicated; yet it was observed, that large bleedings generally did harm, by sinking the pulse, and affecting the head. Nor was a moderate bleeding to be repeated without caution; even those whose blood was fizzy, unless their lungs were inflamed, were the worse for a second bleeding. If the head only suffered, it was much safer to use leeches than to open a vein in the arm; but in the delirium with a sunk pulse, even leeches were hurtful. Many recovered without letting blood, but few who lost much of it.\n\nEmetics also must be used with caution; for though they may be of service by way of prevention, yet in the advanced stage of the disease, when the patient has all along complained of a sickness at stomach, they are evidently unsafe. Here the antiseptic quality of fixed air is of much use, and the neutral draughts given in the act of effervescence are generally attended with happy effects. Nay, clysters of fixed air itself have been found very serviceable. Even in very bad stages of the distemper, where a putrid and colligative looseness has taken place, clysters of fixed air have been known to alleviate the symptoms. We must not, however, put too much confidence in medicines of this kind. Mild tonic cordials, especially wine and cinchona, are the only resources in these disorders. Concerning the former, Sir John Pringle observes, in the low stage of these fevers, and in great sicknesses, which either come after unseasonable bleedings or long want of nourishment, it was a most grateful and efficacious cordial, to which nothing was comparable. The common men had an allowance, from a quarter to half a pint in a day, of a strong kind, made into whey, or added to the panada which was their ordinary food. But to others out of the hospital, he usually prescribed Rhenish or a small French wine, whereof some consumed near a quart per day, and part of that undiluted. Nay, so great was the virtue of wine in this stage of the fever, that several were known to recover from the lowest condition, when refusing the bark on account of its taste, they took nothing but a little panada with wine, and a volatile diaphoretic mixture, every two or three hours by turns. Perhaps there is no rule more necessary in this state, than not to let the patient when low remain long without taking something cordial and nourishing; as many have been observed past recovery, by being suffered to pass a whole night without any support about the time of the crisis. In the advanced stage of this fever the sick are remarkably low; and therefore Hoffman advises in such cases, that they should be constantly kept in bed, and not permitted even to sit up in it. In the last stage of this fever, as well as in that of the sea-fever, it would seem that the force of the heart was too small to convey the blood to the brain, except when the body is in a horizontal posture.\n\nBut, however necessary wine and cinchona may be in the low stage of this fever, we must remember, that these remedies are to be administered only as antiseptics and supporters of the vis viva, without aiming at thoroughly raising the pulse or relieving the head, or at forcing a sweat by them, before nature points that way, and which Sir John Pringle seldom observed before the 14th day.\n\nIn the low stage of the hospital fever, a stupor was a constant attendant, which was very apt, in the evening, to change to a flight delirium. If this was all, nothing was done. But if the delirium increased upon using wine, if the eyes looked wild, or the voice became quick, there was reason to apprehend a phrenitis; and accordingly it was observed, that at such times all internal heating medicines aggravated the symptoms; and in these cases, blisters were of the greatest service. Fomentations of vinegar and warm water for the feet, Sir John Pringle is of opinion, would answer better than either sinapisms or blisters, provided they were long enough and often enough applied. In the inflammatory fevers, he has known these fomentations have little effect for the first hour, and yet succeed afterwards. For internal medicine, cinchona was omitted for some time, but the patient was continued with an acidulated drink, viz. barley-water and vinegar; and treated also with camphire, pulvis contrayerve compositus, and nitre, as was usual in the beginning of the fever. If the delirium was of the low kind, a decoction of cinchona and wine were the only remedies; for in no instance was the delirium perfectly removed till the time of the crisis. It must also be observed, that a delirium may arise in putrid fevers from two opposite errors; one from large and repeated bleedings, and the other from wine and the cordial medicines being taken too early. It appears, therefore, how nice the principles are that regard the cure; as neither a hot nor a cool regimen will answer with every patient, or in every stage of the disease.\n\nIf a diarrhoea came on in the decline of the fever, it was moderated, but not suppressed, by adding an opiate to the usual medicines. For though the loofenels may be considered as critical; yet as the sick were too low to bear evacuations, there was a necessity for restraining it in some measure; and it has often been observed, that when it has been treated in this manner, about the usual time of the crisis, the patient has fallen into a gentle sweat, which has carried off the disease. In the worst cases of this fever, and especially when it coincides with the dysentery, the stools are frequently bloody; in which dangerous state, if anything could be done, it was attempted by medicines of the same kind. In proportion to the putrid nature of the stools, opiates and astringents were used with the greater caution.\n\nIf the disease terminate in a suppuration upon one of the parotid glands, the abscess was opened without waiting for a fluctuation, which might never happen; the pus being often here so viscous, that after it was ripe, the part felt nearly as hard as if the suppuration had not begun.\n\nAlmost every patient, after the fever, complained of want of rest, frequently of a vertigo or confusion of the head, of a continuation of the deafness, or of other symptoms commonly called nervous. An opiate was then given at night; and in the day some strengthening medicines, such as cinchona and the fulphuric acid. In these cases, the bark was found not only to be the best strengthener, but the surest preservative against a return of the disease. For this last intention the convalescent was ordered about three drams a-day for six or seven days together; and afterwards, if he remained longer in the hospital, some smaller quantity daily. But if there was any appearance of a hectic.\ntic fever from an inward abscess, the case was treated accordingly. Upon comparing some of the remaining symptoms of those who recovered, with the condition of the brain in those who died and were opened, Sir John Pringle was induced to think, that some part even of that substance might suppurate, and yet the person recover.\n\nSometimes the patient falls into an irregular intermittent; which, if not of a hectic nature from an internal abscess, may proceed from neglecting to clear the prime via. For it easy to conceive, that after a long fever of such a putrid nature, often attended with languor of the bowels, the feces may be so much accumulated, and so corrupted, as to occasion new disorders. In such cases, after proper evacuation by a purge, cinchona was almost an infallible remedy.\n\nThe Yellow Fever.\n\nTyphus cum flavedine cutis.\nTyphus icteroides, Sauv. sp. 7.\nFebris flavo Indic Occidentalis, Warren.

McKitterick de Febre Flava Indic Occidentalis, Edin. 1766.\n\nDescription. This is one of the most fatal diseases to which the inhabitants of warm climates are subject, and is the same with that called, from one of its worst symptoms, the black vomit, which is so terribly destructive in some of the warm parts of America, particularly at Cartagena; and which of late has proved so fatal in Philadelphia, New York, and the British West India islands, as described by Drs Ruth, Chisholm, Clerk, and other late writers. This, though by some considered as a new disease, is evidently from the same contagion which has produced fatal fevers on many former occasions.\n\nThe yellow or putrid bilious fever has been in particular minutely described by Dr Hillary. It most commonly seizes the patient at first with a faintness, then with a sickness at stomach, accompanied in general with a giddiness of the head; and soon after with a flight chills and horror, very rarely with a rigor. These symptoms are soon followed by a violent heat and high fever, attended with acute darting pains in the head and back. A flushing in the face, with an inflamed redness and a burning heat in the eyes, great anxiety and oppression about the precordia, are the pathognomonic signs of the distemper, especially when attended with sickness at stomach, violent retchings, and bilious yellow vomitings, with frequent sighing. The pulse is now generally very quick, high, soft, and sometimes throbbing, but never hard; in some it is very quick, soft, low, and oppressed; the respiration quick, full, and sometimes difficult; the skin very hot, and sometimes dry, though more frequently moist. Blood taken from the patient, even at the very beginning of the disease, is often of an exceeding florid red colour, without the least appearance of size; and the crustamentum, when it has stood till it is cold, will scarce cohere, but fluctuates; the serum is often yellow.\n\nMost of the above-mentioned symptoms continually increase, and are much aggravated; the retching and vomiting become almost incessant; the anxiety great, and sighing frequent; great restlessness; continual typhus, tossing; no ease in any posture; little sleep, and that disturbed and uneasy, and without any refreshment to the sick. When they are fainting, they turn yellow about the face and neck, instead of turning pale; and as the fainting goes off, they recover their natural colour. These symptoms generally continue to the third day, though sometimes not longer than the first or second; in others to the end of the fourth; the first shows the greater dilution of the blood, and the greater malignity of the disease; the last, the contrary; which the improper manner of treating the disease sometimes hastens and increases, or the proper method retards. This may be called the first stadium of the disease, and generally ends on the third day.\n\nBlood taken from the sick on the second or third day, is much more diffused, the serum more yellow, and the crustamentum florid, loose, scarcely cohering, but undulates like fizzy water when shaken, and sometimes has dark blackish spots on its surface, showing a strong gangreneceous diathesis.\n\nAbout the third day, the pulse, which was quick and full before, now generally sinks greatly, and becomes very low; though sometimes it remains very quick, yet in others it is not much quicker than when the patient was in health, but is always low; the vomiting becomes almost incessant if not so before, and the matter thrown up is black; the patient then becomes comatose, with interrupted delirium. The thirst in some is very great, in others but little; the pulse still low and quick, attended with cold clammy sweats, and sometimes with delirium. The eyes, which were inflamed and red before, and began to be of a more dullish colour, now turn yellow; and this yellowness also soon after appears round the mouth, eyes, temples, and neck, and in a short time diffuses itself all over the body. But this yellowness is so far from being always an encouraging prognostic, as some would have it, that it most commonly proves a mortal symptom. Sometimes indeed, though seldom, this suffusion of bile upon the surface has proved critical; but then it did not come on till the eighth or ninth day, nor appear till the coma and all the other bad symptoms began to abate; and then in proportion as the yellowness increases, all the bad symptoms decrease. But the case is most commonly quite the reverse; especially when the yellowness comes soon on; and then it uthers in the most fatal symptoms of the disease, viz. a deep coma, a low, vermicular, and intermitting pulse, great haemorrhages from various parts of the body, a delirium with laborious and interrupted respiration, great anxiety, deep sighing, restlessness, a subfultus tendinum, coldness of the extreme parts first, and then all over the body, a faltering of the speech, tremors, and convulsions, which are soon after followed by death. So that from the first appearance of the yellowness we may say the patient is in the last stage of the disease, whether it terminates in death or recovery.\n\nIt has been observed, that, in some strong sanguine constitutions, when the patients have not been bled to a sufficient quantity in the beginning of the disease, the pulse has continued full, strong, and rapid, but never hard; the face flushed, eyes inflamed; the tongue dry, with great thirst and heat, till the second or last stage of the fever is come on, when the pulse has suddenly\nsuddenly sunk, and death soon after ensued. Yet in others, who seemed to be of a plethoric habit, the tongue has been moist all along, though they have been delirious most of the time, and the heat of their skin and the strength and quickness of their pulse have continued, after the first stage of the disease was over, pretty near to that of their natural state in health, till within a few hours of death; and when they have had a coma on them, one who is not well acquainted with the nature of this disease would, from the pulse, heat, breathing, and other symptoms, have taken them to be in a natural sleep. Others, when the pulse has begun to sink, and the fatal period seemed to be just approaching, to the great surprize of all present have recovered their senses, sat up and talked pretty cheerfully for an hour or two, and in the midst of this seeming security have been suddenly seized with convulsions which carried them off immediately.\n\nIn the latter stage of this fever, the blood is so attenuated and dissolved, that we frequently see it flowing not only out of the nose and mouth, but from the eyes, and even through the pores of the skin; great quantities also of black, half-baked, or half-mortified blood, are frequently voided both by vomiting and by stool, with great quantities of yellow and blackish putrid bile by the same passages; and the urine, which was before of a high icterous colour, is now almost black, and is frequently mixed with a considerable quantity of half-dissolved blood. The pulse, which was much sunk before, now becomes very low, unequal, and intermittent; the breathing difficult and laborious; and the anxiety inexpressible; an oppresion with a burning heat about the precordia comes on, though the extremities are cold, and often covered with cold clammy sweats; a constant delirium follows; and then a total loss of the outward senses as well as the judgment, with livid spots in many parts of the body, especially about the precordia; and sometimes gangrenes in other parts of the body, which are very soon succeeded by death.\n\nIn a short time after death, the body appears much more full of livid, large, mortified spots, particularly about the precordia and hypochondries, especially the right; which parts seem, even from the first seizure, to be the principal seat of this terrible disease; and, upon opening the bodies of those who die of it, we generally find the gall-bladder and biliary ducts turgid, and filled with a putrid blackish bile; and the liver, stomach, and adjoining parts, full of livid or blackish mortified spots; and the whole corpse soon putrefies after death, and can be kept but a few hours above ground.\n\nDr Lind is of opinion, that the remarkable dissolution of the blood, the violent haemorrhages, black vomit, and the other symptoms which characterize the yellow fever, are only accidental appearances in the common fever of the West Indies; that they are to be esteemed merely as adventitious, in the same manner as purple spots and bloody urine are in the smallpox, or as an hiccup in the dysentery: like these they only appear when the disease is attended with a high degree of malignity, and therefore always indicate great danger. This opinion, he thinks, is confirmed by an observation of Dr Wind's, that in 1750 the crew of a Dutch ship of war were distressed by the yellow fever, accompanied with the black vomit; but when the ship left the harbour, and changed the noxious land air for one more healthy, the fever continued, but was not accompanied with the black vomit.\n\nDiseases similar to this fever, Dr Lind informs us, may arise in any part of the world where the air is intensely hot and unwholesome; and therefore he treats as chimerical the notion of its being imported from one part of the world to another. An example of this happened at Cadiz in Spain, in the months of September and October 1764, when excessive heat, and want of rain for some months, gave rise to violent epidemic, bilious disorders, resembling those of the West Indies, of which 100 persons often died in a day. At this time the winds blew principally from the south, and after sunset there fell an unusual and very heavy dew. But his opinion on this subject is liable to strong objections. And however the disease may originate, yet the late introduction of it from Spain into the fortresses of Gibraltar, from which, by proper attention, it had been excluded in former epidemics, demonstrates the contagious nature of this fever beyond all possibility of doubt.\n\nIt has been a matter of much dispute, whether the yellow fever is of an infectious nature or not. Some time ago it became an object of consideration before the Right Hon. the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, where it was urged among other reasons, for not removing the seat of government and justice in the island of Jamaica from Spanish Town to Kingston, that there was danger from Greenwich hospital, situated near Kingston, of an infection from the yellow fever being frequently communicated to that town. On this affair a physician was consulted, who had long practised in that island, and who gave it as his opinion, that from the yellow fever in that island there was no infection. This was the opinion not only of that gentleman, but of many others who had an opportunity of being well acquainted with this fever in Jamaica. But this opinion probably only arose from these practitioners having confounded the ordinary remittent fever of the West Indies, which is often accompanied with bilious symptoms, and is from thence often denominated the yellow fever, with the typhus icteroides, a disease essentially different from the bilious remittent which often prevails both in the West and East Indies. Dr Lind gives a remarkable instance of its being of an infectious nature.—A gentleman dying at Barbadoes of a yellow fever, his wearing apparel and linen, packed up in a chest, were sent to his friends at Philadelphia; where, upon opening the chest, the family was taken ill; and the clothes being unluckily hung abroad to be aired, they presently diffused the contagion of the yellow fever over the whole town, by which 200 persons died.\n\nIn the description of the same fever by Dr Linning, as it appeared in South Carolina, there are several particulars considerably different from that by Dr Hillary. According to the former, people complained for a day or two before the attack, of a headache, pain in the loins and extremities, especially in the knees and calves of the legs, loss of appetite, debility, and a spontaneous latitude. Some, however, were seized suddenly, without any such previous symptoms. After a chilliness and horror, with which this disease generally invades, a fever succeeded. The pulse was very frequent, till near the termination of the fever, and was generally full,\nFever, full, hard, and consequently strong; in some, it was small and hard; in others, soft and small; but in all those cases, it frequently varied in its fulness and hardness. Towards the termination of the fever, the pulse became smaller, harder, and less frequent. In some there was a remarkable throbbing in the carotids and in the hypochondria; in the latter of which it was sometimes so great, that it caused a constant tremulous motion of the abdomen. The heat generally did not exceed 102 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer; in some it was less; it varied frequently, and was commonly nearly equal in all parts, the heat about the precordia being seldom more intense than in the extremities when these were kept covered. On the first day of the disease, some had frequent returns of a sense of chilliness, though there was not any abatement of the heat. In a few, there happened so great a remission of the heat for some hours, when at the same time the pulse was soft and less frequent, and the skin too moist, that one from these circumstances might reasonably have hoped that the fever would only prove a remittent or intermittent. About the end of the second day, the heat began to abate. The skin was sometimes (though rarely) dry; but oftener, and indeed generally, it was moist, and disposed to sweat. On the first day, the sweating was commonly profuse and general; on the second day, it was more moderate: but on both these, there happened frequent and short remissions of the sweatings; at which times the febrile heat increased, and the patient became more uneasy. On the third day, the disposition to sweat was so much abated, that the skin was generally dry; only the forehead and backs of the hands continued moist. The respiration was by no means frequent or difficult; but was soon accelerated by motion, or the fatigue of drinking a cup of any liquid. The tongue was moist, rough, and white, even to its tip and edges. On the second day, its middle in some was brown. On the third day, the whitening and roughness of the tongue began to abate. The thirst in very few was great. A nausea, vomiting, or frequent retchings to vomit, especially after the exhibition of either medicines or food, came on generally the third day, as the fever began to lessen; or rather as the fulness of the pulse, heat, and disposition to sweat, began to abate. Some indeed, but very few, on the first day, had a vomiting, either bilious or phlegmatic. Very few complained of anxiety or oppression about the precordia or hypochondria, nor was there any tension or hardness about the latter. On the first day they generally dozed much, but were afterwards very watchful. Reflexions and almost continual jactations came on the second day. A great depondency attended the sick, and the strength was much prostrated from the first attack. The pain in the head, loins, &c., of which they had complained before the attack, was much increased, and in some the pain in the forehead was very acute and darting; but those pains went generally off the second day. The face was flushed; and the eyes were hot, inflamed, and unable to bear much light. On the first day, many of them at times were a little delirious, but afterwards not until the recess of the fever. The blood drawn by venesection had not any inflammatory crust; in warm weather, it was florid like arterial blood, and continued in one soft homogeneous-like mass, without any separation of the serum after it was cold. When there was any separation, the crassamentum was of a very lax texture. The stools, after the first day, were fetid, inclined to a black colour, and were very rarely bilious, soft, or liquid, excepting when forced by art; for an oblitiate coliciveness attended the febrile state. The urine was discharged in a large quantity, was pale, sometimes limpid, and rarely of a higher than a straw colour, except when the weather was very warm, and then it was more saturated, of a deep colour, and discharged in smaller quantities. It had a large cloud, except when it was very pale or limpid; but more generally it had a copious white sediment, even on the first day of the fever. On the second day, the urine continued to be discharged very copiously; in some it was then turbid, and deposited a more copious sediment than on the first day; this sediment was sometimes of a brownish colour; in which case it was generally followed by bloody urine, either about the end of the second or beginning of the third day.—The colour and quantity of the urine, discharged in equal times, were remarkably variable, being now limpid, then of a deeper colour; now discharged in a larger, then in a smaller quantity; which could not be ascribed to any change made either in the quantity or quality of the drink.\n\nThe fever accompanied with those symptoms terminated on the third day, or generally in less than 72 hours from the first attack, not by any assimilation or coction and excretion of the morbid matter; for if by the latter, there would have been some critical discharge by sweat, urine, stool, or otherwise, none of which happened; and if by the former, nothing then would have remained but great debility. This fever, however, did not terminate in either of these salutary ways, excepting in some, who were happy enough to have the disease conquered in the beginning by proper evacuations, and by keeping up a plentiful sweat, till the total solution of the fever, by proper mild diaphoretics and diluents. But in those who had not that good fortune, however tranquil things might appear, yet the face of affairs was quickly changed: for this period was soon succeeded by the second stadium; a state, though without any fever, much more terrible than the first: the symptoms in which were the following. The pulse, immediately after the recess of the fever, was very little more frequent than in health, but hard and small. However, though it continued small, it became, soon afterwards, slower and very soft; and this softness of the pulse remained as long as the pulse could be felt. In many, in this stage of the disease, the pulse gradually subsided, until it became scarcely perceptible; and this, notwithstanding all the means used to support and fill it; and when this was the case, the isteritious-like suffusion, the vomiting, delirium, reflexions, &c. increased to a great degree. In some, the pulse, after being exceedingly small and scarcely perceptible, recovered considerably its fulness; but that favourable appearance was generally of but short continuance. The heat did not exceed the natural animal heat; and when the pulse subsided, the skin became cold, and the face, breast, and extremities acquired somewhat of a livid colour. The skin was dry when the weather was cold, but was moist and clammy when the weather was hot. The respiration was...\nwas natural, or rather slow. The tongue was moist, and much cleaner than in the former stage; its tip and edges, as also the gums and lips, were of a more florid red colour than usual. Very few complained of thirst, though they had a great desire for cold liquors. The vomiting or retching to vomit increased, and in some was so constant that neither medicines nor aliment of any kind were retained. Some vomited blood; others only what was last exhibited mixed with phlegm; and others again had what is called the black vomit. The retching to vomit continued a longer or shorter time according to the state of the pulse; for as that became fuller, and the heat greater, the retching to vomit abated, and *contra*. The inquietude was very obstinate; and when they dozed, their slumbers were but short and unrefreshing. There were some who were drowsy; but these always awakened, after the shortest slumber, with a great dejection of spirits and strength. The jaundices or reticulations were surprising: it was frequently scarce possible to keep the patients in bed; though, at the same time, they did not complain of any anxiety or uneasiness; but if asked how they did? the reply was, *Very well*. The debility was so great, that, if the patient was raised erect in the bed, or, in some, if the head was only raised from the pillow, while a cup of drink was given, the pulse sunk immediately, and became sometimes so small, that it could scarcely be felt; at this time, they became cold, as in a horripilation, but without the anserine-like skin: their lips and skin, especially about the neck, face, and extremities, together with their nails, acquired a livid colour. The delirium returned and increased; it was generally constant in those whose pulse was small and subfibrating. The inflammation of the tunica conjunctiva or white of the eyes increased much, but without pain. A yellowness in the white of the eyes, if it did not appear before in the febrile state, became now very observable, and that itetitious tincture was soon diffused over the whole surface of the body, and was continually acquiring a deeper saffron-like colour. In some, indeed, no yellowness was observable, excepting in the white of the eyes, until a little before death, when it increased very quickly, especially about the breast and neck. There were many small specks, not raised above the skin, which appeared very thick in the breast and neck, but less so in the extremities, and were of a scarlet, purple, or livid colour. In women the menstrua flowed, and sometimes excessively, though not at their regular period.\n\nThere was such a putrid dissolution of the blood in this stadium of the disease, that there were hemorrhages from the nose, mouth, ears, eyes, and from the parts which were blistered with cantharides. Nay, in the years 1739 and 1745, there were one or two instances of an hemorrhage from the skin, without any apparent puncture or loss of any part of the scarf-skin.\n\nAn obstinate coughness continued in some; in others, the stools were frequent and loose; in some they were black, liquid, large, and greatly fatiguing; in others, when the stools were moderate, even though they were black, they gave great relief; in others, again, the stools nearly resembled tar in smoothness, tenacity, colour, and consistence.\n\nThe urine was discharged in a large quantity, in proportion to the drink retained by the patient; it was pale if the patient was not yellow; but if yellow, then it was of a deep saffron-colour: in either case, it had a sediment, or at least a large cloud, which remained at the bottom of the glass; in some, it was very turbid; in others it was bloody; and the quantity of blood discharged with the urine bore always some proportion to the state of the pulse; when that became fuller, the quantity of blood in the urine was diminished; when the pulse subsided, the bloody urine increased, and even returned after it had ceased some days, soon after the pulse became smaller. This stage of the disease continued sometimes seven or eight days before the patient died.\n\nWhen this stadium of the disease terminated in health, it was by a receds or abatement of the vomiting, hemorrhages, delirium, inquietude, jaundices, and itetitious-like suffusion of the skin and white of the eyes; while, at the same time, the pulse became fuller, and the patient gained strength, but very slowly. But when it terminated in death, those symptoms not only continued, but sooner or later increased in violence, and were succeeded with the following, which may be termed the third stadium of the disease, which quickly ended in death. The pulse, though soft, became exceedingly small and unequal; the extremities grew cold, clammy, and livid; the face and lips, in some, were flushed; in others, they were of a livid colour; the livid specks increased so fast, that in some the whole breast and neck appeared livid; the heart palpitated strongly; the heat about the praecordia increased much; the respiration became difficult, with frequent sighing; the patient now became anxious, and extremely restless; the sweat flowed from the face, neck, and breast; blood flowed from the mouth, or nose, or ears, and in some from all those parts at once; the deglutition became difficult; the hiccoughs and subfusus tendinum came on, and were frequent; the patients trifled with their fingers, and picked the naps of the bedclothes; they grew comatose, or were constantly delirious. In this terrible state, some continued eight, ten, or twelve hours before they died, even after they had been so long speechless, and without any perceptible pulsation of the arteries at the wrists; whereas, in all other acute diseases, after the pulse in the wrists ceases, death follows almost immediately. When the disease was very acute, violent convulsions seized the unhappy patient, and quickly brought this stadium to its fatal end. After death, the livid blotches increased fast, especially about the face, breast, and neck, and the putrefaction began very early, or rather increased very quickly.\n\nSuch was the progress of this terrible disease through its several stadia. But in hot weather, and when the symptoms in the first stage were very violent, it passed through those stages with such precipitation that there was but little opportunity of distinguishing its different stadia, the whole tragedy having been finished in less than 48 hours. It was remarkable, that, 1. The infection was increased by warm and lenified by cold weather. 2. The symptoms in the several stadium were more or less violent, according to the heat or coolness of the weather. In hot days, the symptoms were not only more violent, but in those who seemed in moderate weather to be on the recovery, or at least in no danger, the symptoms were all so greatly heightened, when\nwhen the weather grew considerably warmer, as frequently to become fatal. In cool days, the symptoms were not only milder, but many who were apparently in great danger in hot days were saved from the very jaws of death by the weather becoming happily cooler.\n\n3. The disease was generally more fatal to those who lay in small chambers not conveniently situated for the admission of fresh air, to those of an athletic and full habit, to strangers who were natives of a cold climate, to those who had the greatest dread of it, and to those who before the attack of the disease had overheated themselves by exercise in the sun, or by excessive drinking of strong liquors; either of which indeed seemed to render the body more susceptible of the infection. Lastly, the disease proved most certainly fatal to valetudinarians, or to those who had been weakened by any previous disease.\n\nCausae of, and persons subject to, this disease. The yellow fever attacks principally Europeans, especially those who have but lately arrived in the hot climates. Negroes are entirely exempt from it, though the mulattoes and tawnies are as liable to be seized with it as the whites themselves. The cause of the disease seems to be a particular kind of contagion; but Dr Lind seems to be of opinion, that the immediate cause of the symptoms is a disposition in the glutinous part of the blood to separate from the others, and to become putrefactive. In some persons who have been bled in the yellow fever, the blood has been observed very viscid; the clotted matter covered with a yellow glutinous appearance, exactly resembling the coagulum of the blood. His complaints had been, a great oppression on the breast, and an extreme difficulty of breathing. In a third person, who died on the thirteenth day of the fever, above two quarts of pus and purulent jelly were found in the cavity of the belly. The source of such an extraordinary quantity of matter was not from any preceding inflammation, nor any impothesis, that we could discover; but from innumerable ulcerations on the surface of the intestines, omentum, mesentery, and peritoneum. Neither did these ulcerations (or excoriations, as they rather appeared in several places) seem to be the primary fountains of the matter, but to have been occasioned by its acrimony.\n\nThis purulent appearance seems to arise merely from an extravasation of one of the component parts of the blood, the glutinous or fibrine as it is now called. Blood taken from persons in a fever, and frequently even from persons in perfect health, after standing in a clean vessel for a short time, commonly separates into three distinct portions; viz. the serum, or water of the blood, the red concreted mass, and a viscid pellicle termed the fissa, which spreads itself on the top of the red concretion. Some time ago, when making experiments with the blood taken from persons in the fevers, I was surprised to find it often covered with that viscid crust. This induced me to extend my experiments to large quantities of blood from different subjects, which I had opportunities of inspecting at once in a large hospital. For this purpose I one morning ordered ten patients in the fevers to be bled, taking two ounces from each. A larger quantity was taken, for its inspection, from two men in health. That day I had occasion to prescribe bleeding to a woman in labour, two hours before her delivery; to a girl of fifteen years of age afflicted with a lunacy proceeding from the chlorosis; to three patients in the rheumatism; and to a person labouring under an obstruction of the liver.\n\nFrom a nice comparison, and an examination of the blood in these cases, I found in general, that the\n\n(b) In others who died in this yellow state, the bile in the gall-bladder was found of a thick ropy consistence like pitch, but the liver never appeared in the least affected. Dr Lind at first in several bodies opened the head only; but afterwards judged that all the cavities ought to be inspected.\nmore size there was on the top, and the thicker and more viscid this white pellicle showed itself, the concretion below it was of a more loose coherence. This was not so observable when only some slight white streaks appeared on the top. But when much size had separated itself, the red mass became very soft at the bottom of the vessel, and less compact in its different parts, in proportion to their distance from the surface, towards which this whitish portion had ascended.\n\n\"From this and from other experiments it appears, that this crust or pellicle is the natural gluten which becomes strongly disposed, in certain circumstances and diseases, to separate itself. And whereas the serum and red concretion are easily incorporated together, it will be found, that this glue, after its separation, becomes insensible with either. We have, by gentle drying, converted it into a perfectly tough elastic membrane; and, by the means of a small portion of the red mass being left adhering to it, into a substance resembling muscular flesh; and it is capable of undergoing various changes into corruption, in the same manner as either of these.\n\n\"Now, I can see no reason why this gluten, in its morbid state, may not separate itself from the circulating blood, and be deposited in the cavities of the body, as readily as the serum does in dropsies; the former having always a less disposition than the latter to incorporate with the mass.\n\n\"In dissecting persons who died of fevers in London and Minorca, and where no infection was suspected, appearances similar to these have also fallen under the inspection of those accurate anatomists Drs Hunter and Cleghorn. Hence it may be presumed very difficult to distinguish fevers that are produced by infection, from some others. I cannot, however, be induced to think, as those gentlemen seem to do, that these preternatural substances which were found in the cavities of the body are the consequence, but rather that they are the cause, of the inflammation and excoriations. I believe these substances to be at first diseased extravasated gluten, and conjecture their different states greatly to depend upon the different times at which they were deposited.\n\n\"I have remarked, in a variety of dead bodies, three different kinds of extravasation; these occurred in such as had died of the scurvy, of consumption, and of fevers. In the former of those diseases, red coagulated blood is found extravasated in almost all parts of the body, not only into the tela cellulosa, but into the bellies of the muscles, particularly of the legs and thighs, which often become quite stuffed and even distended with large grumous masses. The intestines and mesentery are often spotted also with extravasated blood; and I have seen large ecchymoses on the stomach. Those appearances at first sight resembled so many distinct mortifications; and by this appearance some anatomists have been deceived; but, upon a nice examination, the texture of the parts is found to be sound and firm. There is likewise, in that disease, sometimes, an extravasation of water, chiefly collected in the tela cellulosa.\n\n\"But as, in the limbs of scorbutic persons, it is extremely difficult to make a good dissection by reason of such quantities of extravasated blood that everywhere obstruct the operator; so, on the contrary, the lower extremities of those who have died consumptive, with typhus, swollen legs, are, of all subjects, in the best state to afford a satisfactory view of the muscles. The matter enclosed in their legs having intimated itself, by passing the tela cellulosa, into the spaces between the muscles, the muscles are easily separated from each other; and their several origins and insertions may be distinctly traced by means of their having been cleaned and washed by the water in the investing cellular membrane. Thus there are extravasations of three sorts; viz. First, The grumous mass in the fever; and this I have often remarked where no serum was observed. Secondly, The serum alone in anasarcan swellings. The third and last is what was taken notice of in those who died of fevers, being the gluten of the blood, accompanied for the most part with some serum; both of them altogether confined to the large cavities of the body.\n\n\"I conjecture, that in those fevers there is always an ulcerous or purulent disposition in the blood; and that the gluten is greatly diseased. I have frequently seen it have a true purulent appearance soon after it was drawn off, when the patient seemed not very ill.\n\n\"And I further conjecture, that the mischief often lies within the breast; as also that the great benefit derived from the very early application of blisters, in a great measure flows from so many ulcerations and vents being timely provided for the free discharge of those purulent and tainted particles from the body.\n\n\"If an infection depends, as many have imagined, on the admission of certain foreign particles into the blood, this gluten seems to be primarily affected by it; and a discharge of this, by washing those particles out of the body, tends in a great measure to remove that disease.\n\n\"It is an observation of the best practical writers, that illus and fetos are most excellent preservatives against receiving an infection, even that of the plague itself. And indeed a suppuration and plentiful discharge from a proper ulcer, whether produced by nature or by art, seems to open a channel the best appropriated for an exit out of the body to some of the most malignant poisons. Thus the most favourable crisis in the plague, and in most pellidential fevers, happens when nature excites tumors kindly suppurating in the groin or armpits, by whose beneficial and plentiful discharge the deadly poison is expelled from the constitution.\n\n\"I have observed it to be amongst the most certain characteristics of the worst fevers, that the blisters either do not rise and fill, or discharge such yellow, greenish, fetid, and highly offensive stuff, that even experienced nurses could give a pretty certain conjecture from the blisters of the different degrees of malignity in the fever. We have more than once endeavoured to conceal the bad state of some patients in the hospital; but a discovery was always made of their condition in the washhouse, from the linen sent there stained with the discharges from the blistered parts. And indeed a careful inspection of the state and discharge from the blisters, together with their effects, furnishes us, in those diseases, with some of the most certain diagnostics of their nature, and prognostics of their event.\"\n\nPrognosis. This distemper, where it attacks with violence,\nFevers, violence, is generally fatal; the prognosis therefore must be commonly unfavourable, and always uncertain; neither can any thing more be said on this subject, than that an abatement of the symptoms already enumerated affords a favourable prognostic, and an increase of them the contrary.\n\nCure. The cure of this terrible disease, according to Dr Hilary, is very easy and simple. His indications are, 1. To moderate the too great and rapid motion of the fluids, and abate the too great heat and violence of the fever in the two first days of the disease, as much and as safely as we can. 2. To evacuate and carry out of the body as much of the putrid bile and other humours, and as expeditiously and safely as possible. 3. To put a stop to the putrefactive disposition of the fluids, and to prevent the gangrene from coming on, by suitable antiseptics.\n\nThe first indication is answered by bleeding, which, in the first stage of this fever, is sometimes absolutely necessary in some degree; the quantity to be taken away must be determined by the age and strength of the patient, the degree of plethora, fulness of the pulse, &c. When called at the beginning, he orders 12, 14, 16, 18, or 20 ounces of blood to be taken away on the first or second day; and if the patient's pulse rise after the first bleeding, or if the fever still continue high and the pulse full, he repeats the bleeding once on the days above mentioned. But bleeding a third time is seldom or never required; neither is bleeding on the third day almost ever necessary; and when it is performed on that day, it ought to be done with the greatest caution and judgement; neither should a vein be opened after the third day in this fever, unless some very extraordinary symptoms and circumstances require it; which seldom or never happen. On that day, indeed, the pulse generally sinks, and the blood is in such a dissolved state, that bleeding must be accounted highly pernicious. Nevertheless, it is indispensably necessary in the beginning of the distemper; and if omitted at that time, the violent heat and motion of the blood increase the putrefaction of the humours to such a degree as to bring on the fatal consequences much sooner than would otherwise have happened. If blood-letting be thus advised by Dr Hilary, it has been still more strongly recommended by Dr Rush, who, in his first publication on the subject of the dreadful yellow fever which proved so fatal at Philadelphia, represented it as an almost infallible remedy for the disease. But the observations and experience of others have by no means confirmed the practice which he recommended.\n\nAfter bleeding, we come to the second indication of cure, namely, to evacuate as much of the bilious and putrid humours as soon and as safely as we can. The great irritation of the stomach, by the putrid bilious humours constantly attending this fever, with almost continual retchings and violent vomitings, seem to indicate the giving of an emetic; but the stomach is always observed to be so violently stimulated and irritated, and most commonly inflamed, by the acrimony of the putrefactive bile, that any emetic, even the most mild and gentle, given in the smallest dose, brings on an incessant vomiting, which continues, in spite of all remedies, till a mortification and death ensue. Instead of this, it is proper to give large draughts of warm water, which, without any additional stimulus to the stomach, evacuates its acid and putrid contents, commonly with great relief to the patient: the warm water also acts as an emollient foment to the inflamed coats of the stomach; and thus abates the inflammation, and prevents gangrene and mortification from coming on.\n\nAfter the patient has by this means vomited seven or eight times, or oftener, and discharged a great quantity of yellow and blackish bilious matter, a grain or a grain and a half of thebaic extract is given, in order to procure some respite from the violent retching, vomiting, and anxiety. The person is desired to take nothing into his stomach for two hours after this, by which means it is seldom or never rejected; and thus all the symptoms are considerably abated, the retching and vomiting either totally cease or are very much lessened, so that medicines may now be exhibited which the stomach would not have retained before. These are cooling acid juleps, or other antiseptic remedies; but neither nitre nor any of its preparations will commonly be found to stay on the stomach, nor, according to Dr Hilary, are the nitrous medicines, or even the common antiemetic draughts, proper to be given in this disease, even though they should agree with the stomach, on account of their attenuating property.\n\nIf the patient has not a stool or two after drinking the warm water and vomiting, it is necessary to give a gentle purging clyster; and when six or eight hours rest have been obtained, a gentle antiphlogistic and antiseptic purge, in order to evacuate by stool as much of the bilious matter as we possibly can. Or if the patient has a purging before, which sometimes though very rarely happens, a dose of toasted rhubarb is given, and an antiseptic anodyne after it has operated, to abate and check the too great purging, but not to stop it, as this evacuation has been always observed to be of service, provided it be not very violent.\n\nAfter this indication is completely answered, the next is to exhibit such proper antiseptic medicines as may stop the putrefactive disposition of the fluids. Here the cinchona would seem to be the most proper remedy; but unluckily the stomachs of the patients in this disease are so much irritated, and so apt to reject everything, that it cannot be retained in any form whatever. In this case Dr Percival recommends columbo root, the infusion of which is found to be a powerful antiemetic and antiputrefactive medicine, and might perhaps go far after the state of the stomach as to make it bear the bark. Dr Hillary, however, who was ignorant of the virtues of columbo, substituted the radix serpentinae Virginianae with success. A slight infusion of this root not only sat easily on the stomach of the patients, but moderately raised the pulse and fever, both of which are now too low. The following receipt was found the most agreeable and efficacious.\n\nRad. serpent. Virginian. 3j.\nCroc. Ang. 3f.\nM. et infunde vafe clauso in aqua bul. q. per horam unam ut col. 3vj. Add. aqua menth. simp. 3ij. Vin. Maderienf. 3iv. Syr. croc. vel tyr. & mecon. 3i. Elix. vitrioli. acid. q. f. ad grat. acid. sap. Exhibe cochlearia duo vel tria singulis horis vel bihoris, vel sequius pro re nata.\n\nBy the use of this medicine, and soft light nourishment taken in small quantities, the pulse is usually kept up.\nup and the distemper goes off. But if, after taking this a little while, we find that the pulse does not rise, but on the contrary that a coldness of the extreme parts comes on, the medicines must be made more warming, by increasing the quantity of the snakeroot and saffron, or by adding vinum croceum, confectio cardica, or the like, but not by the use of volatile spirits and salts, which hurt by their stimulating and dissolving qualities. Blistering Dr Hilary reproaches in the strongest terms, and affirms that he has seen the place where a blister was applied turned perfectly black and sphacelated; so that if the spine and end of the ribs had not hindered, a large square passage would have been opened into the cavity of the thorax, had the patient lived a few hours after it.\n\nAt the same time that the strength of the patient is kept up by the medicines above mentioned, or by others similar, he gave repeated gentle purgatives every second or third day, and sometimes, when the symptoms were very urgent, every day, for four or five days successively. But if proper methods be taken in the beginning of the disease, it is seldom that such a repetition of purging is necessary.\n\nDr Hilary's plan of treating the yellow fever is, in our opinion, as judicious as any that has yet been proposed. But, among the late writers, some have recommended mercury, particularly under the form of calomel, as the most efficacious remedy which can be employed. In some cases it has certainly been given to an almost incredible extent, in a very short time, without exciting either purging or salivation. And it cannot be denied, that patients have not unfrequently recovered under the use of it. But calomel can no more be reckoned an infallible remedy for this disease than blood-letting.\n\nSince the introduction of cold affusion, in the cure of typhus fevers, by Dr Currie, it has been imagined by some, that this practice would afford a very efficacious remedy in the typhus icteroides, as well as in the typhus mitior. But experience has not yet confirmed the utility of this practice.\n\nSome have suggested the internal use of the oxygenated muriatic acid, properly diluted, as an article from which great benefit may be expected in the yellow fever. This practice deserves, we think, a fair trial; but the utility of it still remains to be determined by experience.\n\nTo the genus of typhus also belong all those fevers attended with very profuse and debilitating sweats, and which sometimes, not without good reason, been accounted plagues; such as the English sweating-lickness, Miliaris ludatoria, Sauv. sp. 5. Ephemera ludatoria, Sauv. sp. 7. Ephemera Britannica, Gaius de ephem. Britan.\n\nGENUS VI. SYNOCHUS.\n\nSynochus, Sauv. gen. 81. Lin. 13.\nLenta, Lin. 14.\nPhrenitis, Vog. 18.\nFebris continua putrida, Boerh. 730.\n\nThis is a contagious distemper, being a complication of a synocha and typhus; for the description and cure of which, we must of consequence refer to what hath been already said concerning these diseases.\n\nThe Hectic Fever.\n\nHectica, Sauv. gen. 83. Lin. 24. Vog. 80. Sag. 684.\n\nThis disease is reckoned by Dr Cullen to be merely symptomatic; as indeed seems very probable, since it generally accompanies absortion of pus into the blood from internal suppurations, or indeed from such as are external, provided they be very large or of a bad kind.\n\nDescription. The best, perhaps the only proper, description of this disorder we have is that by Dr Heberden. According to him, the appearance of the hectic fever is not unlike that of the genuine intermittent; from which, however, the disease is very different in its nature, while at the same time it is much more dangerous. In the true intermittent, the three stages of cold, heat, and sweat, are far more distinctly marked; the whole fit is much longer, the period which it obliterates is more constant and regular, and the intermissions are more perfect, than in the hectic fever. For in the latter, even during the clearest remission, there is usually a feverish quickness perceptible in the pulse, which seldom fails to exceed the utmost limit of a healthy one by at least ten strokes in a minute.\n\nThe chills of the hectic fever is sometimes succeeded by heat, and sometimes immediately by a sweat without any intermediate stage of heat. The heat will sometimes come on without any remarkable chills preceding; and the chills has been observed to go off without being followed either by heat or sweat. The duration of these stages is seldom the same for three fits together; and as it is not uncommon for one of them to be wanting, the length of the whole fit must vary much more than in the true intermittent; but in general it is much shorter.\n\nA patient subjected to hectic fever is little or nothing relieved by the occurrence of the sweat; but is often as anxious and restless under it as during the chills or heat. When the sweat is over, the fever will sometimes continue; and in the middle of the fever the chills will return; which is a most certain mark of this disease.\n\nThe hectic fever will return with great exactness, like an intermittent, for two or perhaps three fits; but Dr Heberden informs us, that he does not remember ever to have known it keep the same period for four fits successively. The paroxysm will now and then keep off for ten or twelve days; and at other times, especially when the patient is very ill, it will return so frequently on the same day, that the chills of a new fit will follow immediately the sweat of the former. It is not unusual to have many threatenings of a shivering in the same day; and some degree of drowsiness is apt to attend the cessation of a fit.\n\nThe urine in a true intermittent is clear during the fits and turbid during the intervals; but in the hectic fever it is liable to all kinds of irregularity. It will be equally clear or turbid in both stages; or turbid in the fits and clear in the intervals; and sometimes it will be, as in a true intermittent, clear during the fever, and thick at the going off.\n\nHectic patients often complain of pains like those of the rheumatism, which either affect by turns almost every\nevery part of the body, or else return constantly to the same part; which is often at a great distance from the seat of the principal disorder, and, as far as is known, without any peculiar connection with it. Those pains are so violent in some patients, as to require a large quantity of opium. As far as Dr Heberden has observed, they are most common where the hectic arises from some ulcer open to the external air, as in cancers of the face, breast, &c. Joined with this fever, and arising probably from one common cause, he has been surprised to see swellings of the limbs, neck, or trunk of the body, rise up almost in an instant, as if the part was all at once grown fatter. These swellings are not painful, hard, or discoloured, and they continue for several hours.\n\nDr Heberden has seen this fever attack those who seemed in tolerable health, in a sudden and violent manner, like a common inflammatory one; and like that, also, in a very short time bring them into imminent danger of their lives; after which it has begun to abate, and to afford hopes of a perfect recovery. But though the danger might be over for the present, and but little of a fever remain; yet that little has soon demonstrated, that it was kept up by some great mischief within, and, proving unconquerable by any remedies, has gradually undermined the health of the patient, and never ceased except with his life. This manner of its beginning, however, is a rare occurrence. It much oftener resembles its strength at first; and creeps on so slowly, that the subjects of it, though they be not perfectly well, yet for some months hardly think themselves ill; complaining only of being sooner tired with exercise than usual, of want of appetite, and of falling away. But gentle as the symptoms may seem, if the pulse be quicker than ordinary, so as to have the artery to beat 90 times and perhaps 120 times in a minute, there is the greatest reason to be apprehensive of the event. In no disorder, perhaps, is the pulse of more use to guide our judgment than in the hectic fever: yet even here we must be upon our guard, and not trust entirely to this criterion; for one in about twenty patients, with all the worst signs of decay from some incurable cause, which irresistibly goes on to destroy his life, will show not the smallest degree of quickness, nor any other irregularity of the pulse, to the day of his death.\n\nCauses, &c. This fever will supervene whenever there is a great collection of matter formed in any part of the body; but it more particularly attends upon the inflammation of a scirrhus gland, and even upon one that is slight and only just beginning; the fever growing worse in proportion as the gland becomes more inflamed, ulcerated, or gangrenous. And such is the lingering nature of these glandular disorders, that the first of these stages will continue for many months, and the second for some years.\n\nIf this scirrhus inflammation be external, or in the lungs, or some of the abdominal viscera, where the disturbance of their functions plainly points out the seat of the disorder, no doubt can be entertained concerning the cause of the fever. But if the part affected be not obvious to the senses, and its precise functions be not known, the hectic, which is there only part of the train of another disease, may be mistaken for the primary or only affection.\n\nLying-in-women, on account of the violence sustained in delivery, generally die when affected with this fever. Women of the age of near 50 and upwards are particularly liable to it. For, upon the cessation of their natural discharge, the glands of the breasts, ovaries, or womb, too commonly begin to grow scirrhus, and proceed to be cancerous. Not only these, but the glandular parts of all the abdominal viscera, are disposed to be affected at this particular time, and to become the seats of incurable disorders.\n\nThe injuries done to the stomach and liver by hard drinking are attended with similar symptoms, and terminate in the same manner.\n\nDr Heberden observes, that the slightest wound by a fine-pointed instrument is known upon some occasions to bring on the greatest disturbances, and the most alarming symptoms, nay even death itself. For not only the wounded part will swell and be painful, but by turns almost every part of the body; and very distant parts have been known to come even to suppuration. These symptoms are constantly accompanied with this irregular intermittent, which lasts as long as any of them remain.\n\nPrognosis. This anomalous fever is never less dangerous than when it originates from a kindly suppuration, into which all the diseased parts are melted down, and for which there is a proper outlet.\n\nThe symptoms and danger from some small punctures, with their concomitant fever, most frequently give way in a few days; though in some persons they have continued for two or three months, and in others have proved fatal.\n\nThe inflammation of internal scirrhus glands, or of those in the breasts, sometimes goes off, and the fever, which depended upon it, ceases; but it much oftener happens, that it proceeds to cancerous and gangrenous ulcers, and terminates only in death. Death is also, almost universally, the consequence of hectic fever from tubercles of the lungs, which have in general at least been considered as glandular bodies in a scirrhus state.\n\nCure. It is not to be expected that the same remedies will in every case be adapted to a fever which, arising from very different causes, is attended with such a variety of symptoms. A mixture of astringent and opium has in some persons seemed singularly serviceable in this fever, when brought on by a small wound; but in most other cases the principal if not the sole attention of the physician must be employed in relieving the symptoms, by tempering the heat, by preventing both coliciveness and purging, by procuring sleep, and by checking the sweats. If, at the same time, continues Dr Heberden, he put the body into as good general health as may be, by air, exercise, and a proper course of mild diet, he can perhaps do nothing better than to leave all the rest to nature. In some few fortunate patients, nature appears to have such resources, as may afford reason for entertaining hopes of cure, even in very bad cases. For some have recovered from this fever attended with every symptom of an abdominal viscus incurably diseased, after all probable methods of relief from art had been tried in vain, and after the flesh and strength were so exhausted as to leave scarce any hopes from nature. In these deplorable\nble circumstances, there has arisen a swelling not far from the probable seat of the disorder, and yet without any discoverable communication with it. This swelling has come to an abscess; in consequence of which the pulse has soon returned to its natural state, as have also the appetite, flesh, and strength. What nature has performed in those rare cases, Dr Heberden acquaints us, he has often endeavoured to imitate, by making issues or applying blisters near the seat of the disease; but he cannot say with the same success.\n\nIt seems at present, Dr Heberden observes, to be the opinion of many practitioners, that gangrenes will be stopped, and suppuration become more kindly, by the use of Peruvian bark; and therefore this remedy is always either advised or permitted in the irregular fever joined with suppurations and gangrenes. But he affirms he does not remember ever to have seen any good effect from cinchona in this fever unattended with an apparent ulcer; and even in gangrenes it so often fails, that in successful cases, where it has been administered, there must be room for suspicion that the success was owing to another cause. Dr Heberden acknowledges at the same time, that he never saw any harm from cinchona, in these, or indeed in any other cases, except a slight temporary purging or sickness, where it has happened to disagree with the stomach, or where the latter has been loaded by taking the medicine too fast, especially in dry boluses wrapped in wafer-paper.\n\nIn hectic illnesses, where all other means have proved ineffectual, a journey to Bath is usually proposed by the friends, and wished for by the sick; but Dr Heberden justly observes, that, besides the fatigue and many inconveniences of a journey to a dying person, the Bath waters are peculiarly hurtful in this fever, which they never fail to increase, and thereby aggravate the sufferings and hasten the death of the patient.\n\n**Order II.

Vog. 348.\nParaphimosis, Vog. 349.\n\nFor the cure of inflammations, Dr Cullen lays down the following indications. 1. To remove the remote causes when they are evident and continue to operate. 2. To take off the phlogistic diathesis affecting the whole system, or the particular part. 3. To take off the spasm of the particular part, by remedies applied to the whole system, or to the part itself.\n\nThe means of removing the remote causes will readily occur, from considering the particular nature and circumstances of the different kinds. Acrid matters must be removed, or their action must be prevented, by the application of demulcents. Compressing and overstretching powers must be taken away; and from their several circumstances, the means of doing so will be obvious.\n\nThe means of taking off the phlogistic diathesis of the system are the same with those already mentioned under the cure for synocha. The means of taking off the spasm also from the particular part, are much the same with those already mentioned. Only it is to be remembered, that topical bleedings, such as cupping with scarifications, applying leeches, &c., are in this case much more indicated; and that some of the other remedies are to be directed more particularly to the part affected, as shall be more fully considered when we treat of those diseases attended with particular inflammations.\n\nWhen a tendency to suppuration is perceived, the proper indication is to promote the production of perfect pus as much as possible. For this purpose various remedies, supposed to possess a specific power, have been proposed; but it does not appear that any of them are possessed of a virtue of this kind; and, in Dr Cullen's opinion, all that can be done is to favour the suppuration by such applications as may support a moderate heat in the part, by some tenacity confine the perspiration, and by an emollient quality may weaken the cohesion of the teguments, and favour their erosion. As all abscesses are occasioned by the effusion of fluids, and as in the case of certain effusions a suppuration becomes\nPractice.\n\nPhlegma comes not only unavoidable but desirable, it may be supposed that most of the means of procuring a resolution, by diminishing the force of circulation, &c., ought to be avoided. But as we observe on the one hand, that a certain degree of increased impetus, or of the original symptoms of inflammation, is necessary to produce a proper suppuration; so it is then especially necessary to avoid those means of resolution which may diminish too much the force of circulation. And on the other hand, as the impetus of the blood, when violent, is found to prevent the proper suppuration; so, in such cases, though a tendency to suppuration may have begun, it may be proper to continue those means of resolution which moderate the force of the circulation.\n\nWith respect to the opening of abscesses when completely formed, see the article Surgery.\n\nWhen an inflammation has taken a tendency to gangrene, that event is to be prevented by every possible means; and these must be different according to the nature of the several causes: but after a gangrene has in some degree taken place, it can be cured only by the separation of the dead from the living parts. This in certain circumstances can be performed, and most properly, by the knife. In other cases it can be done by exciting a suppuratory inflammation on the verge of the living part, whereby its cohesion with the dead part may be everywhere broken off, so that the latter may fall off by itself. While this is doing, it is proper to prevent the further putrefaction of the part, and its spreading wider. For this purpose various antiseptic applications have been proposed: but Dr Cullen is of opinion, that while the teguments are entire, these applications can hardly have any effect; and therefore, that the fundamental procedure must be to scarify the part so as to reach the living substance, and, by the wounds made there, to excite the suppuration required. By the same incisions also we give access to antiseptics, which may both prevent the progress of the putrefaction in the dead, and excite the inflammation necessary on the verge of the living parts.\n\nWhen the gangrene proceeds from loss of tone, and when this, communicated to the neighbouring parts, prevents that inflammation which, as we have said, is requisite to the separation of the dead parts from the living, it will be necessary to obviate this loss of tone by tonic medicines given internally; and for this purpose cinchona has been found to be most effectual. But when the gangrene arises from the violence of inflammation, the bark may not only fail of proving a remedy, but may do harm: for its power as a tonic is especially suited to those cases of gangrene which proceed from an original loss of tone, as in the case of palsy and oedema; or in those cases where a loss of tone takes place after the original inflammatory symptoms are removed.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr Bell is of opinion, that incisions made with a view to admit the operation of antiseptic remedies in gangrenes, as well as the remedies themselves, must be pernicious from the irritation they occasion, and from the danger of wounding blood-vessels, nerves, or tendons, and also by allowing a free passage for the putrefactive fluids into the parts not yet affected. And unless they be carried so deep as to reach the found parts, applications of the antiseptic kind can never have any effect in answering the purpose for which they were intended. The same author also remarks, that all the advantages commonly observed from the great number of applications recommended for gangrene, are obtained with more ease, and generally too with more certainty, from the use of some gentle stimulating embrocation; which, by exciting a slight irritation upon the surface, especially when assisted by a free use of cinchona, produces for the most part such a degree of inflammation as is wished for. With this view he has frequently known a weak solution of sal ammoniac, a dram of the salt to two ounces of vinegar and six of water, form a mixture of very proper strength for every purpose of this kind. But the degree of stimulus can easily be either increased or diminished according to circumstances, by using a larger or smaller proportion of the salt.\n\nWhenever, either by the means recommended, or by a natural exertion of the system, a slight inflammation appears between the diseased and sound parts, we may in general, with tolerable certainty, expect, that in due time the parts will be separated; and when a full suppuration is once fairly established, there can be little doubt that the mortified parts will be soon and easily removed.\n\nA complete separation being effected, the sore is to be treated in the manner described under the article Surgery; with a proper attention, at the same time, to the support of the general system by the continuance of nourishing diet, and cinchona with such quantities of wine as may seem necessary.\n\nWith regard to the bark, however, it is proper to take notice of another case of mortification in which it is likewise unsuccessful, as well as in that attended with a high degree of inflammation; and that is, in those mortifications of the toes and feet, common in old people, or which arise from any cause increasing the rigidity of the vessels to such a degree as to prevent the motion of the fluids through them. In this case Mr Pott has discovered, that all kinds of warm applications are very unsuccessful; but by the free use of opium, together with sedatives and relaxants externally applied, he has frequently seen the tumefaction of the feet and ankles subside, the skin recover its natural colour, and all the mortified parts separate in a very short time, leaving a clean sore. But as to scarifications, or any other attempt to separate artificially the mortified from the sound parts, he thinks them very prejudicial, by giving pain; which is generally of itself violent in this disease, and which seems to have a great share in producing the other evils.\n\nThe other terminations of inflammation either do not admit of any treatment except that of preventing them by resolution, or properly belong to the article Surgery.\n\nSp.

The difference between the phlegmon or preceding species, and erythema, according to Dr Cullen, is, that, in the former, the inflammation seems particularly to affect the vessels on the internal surface of the skin, communicating with the lax adjacent cellular texture; whereas a more copious effusion, and that too of serum convertible into pus, takes place. In the erythema the affection is of the vessels on the external surface of the skin communicating with the rete mucosum. This affection does not admit of any effusion but what separates the cuticle, and gives occasion to the formation of a blister, while the smaller size of the vessels admits only of the effusion of a thin fluid very seldom convertible into pus.

Dr Cullen observes, that the inflammation of the eye may be considered as of two kinds; according as it is seated in the membranes of the ball of the eye, when it is named ophthalmia membranarum; or as it is seated in the sebaceous glands placed in the tarbus, or edges of the eyelids, in which case it may be termed ophthalmia tarbi. These two kinds are very frequently connected together, as the one may excite the other; but they are still to be distinguished according as the one or the other may happen to be the primary affection.\n\n1. The inflammation of the membranes of the eye affects especially, and most frequently, the adnata, and appears in a turgescence of its vessels; so that the red vessels which are naturally there, become not only increased in size, but many more appear than in a natural state. This turgescence of the vessels is attended with pain, especially upon the motion of the ball of the eye; and this irritation, like every other, applied to the surface of the eye, produces an effusion of tears from the lachrymal gland.\n\nThe inflammation commonly, and chiefly, affects the adnata spread on the anterior part of the bulb of the eye; but usually spreads also along the continuation of the adnata on the inside of the palpebrae; and as that is extended on the tarbus palpebrarum, the excretories of the sebaceous glands opening there are also frequently affected. When the affection of the adnata is considerable, it may be communicated to the subjacent membranes of the eye, and even to the retina itself; which thereby acquires so great sensibility, that every impression of light becomes painful. The inflammation of the membranes of the eye is in different degrees, according as the adnata is more or less affected, or according as the inflammation is either of the adnata alone, or of the subjacent membranes also; and upon these differences, different species have been established; but they seem all to differ only in degree, and are to be cured by the same remedies more or less employed.\n\nThe proximate cause of ophthalmia is not different from that of inflammation in general; and the different circumstances of ophthalmia may be explained by\nby the difference of its remote causes, and by the different parts of the eye which it happens to affect; as may be understood from what has been already said. We shall therefore proceed to give an account of the method of cure.\n\nThe great objects to be aimed at in the treatment of ophthalmia, are, in the first place, the resolution of the inflammation which has already taken place; and, secondly, the removal of those consequences which frequently arise from the inflammation, especially if it have been of long standing. But besides these, while it has appeared from former observation, that there is a peculiar disposition to the disease, practices may often be successfully employed to combat this disposition, and thus prevent the return of the affection.\n\nThe ophthalmia membranarum requires the remedies proper for inflammation in general; and when the deeper-seated membranes are affected, and especially when a pyrexia is present, large general bleedings may be necessary. But this last is seldom requisite, and, for the most part, the ophthalmia is an affection merely local, accompanied with little or no pyrexia. General bleedings therefore have little effect upon it, and the cure is chiefly to be obtained by topical bleedings, that is, blood drawn from the vessels near the inflamed part; and opening the jugular vein, or the temporal artery, may be considered as in some measure of this kind. It is commonly sufficient to apply a number of leeches round the eye; but it is perhaps still better to draw blood by cupping and scarifying from the temples. In many cases, the most effectual remedy is to scarify the internal surface of the inferior eyelid, and to cut the turgid vessels upon the adnata itself.\n\nBesides bloodletting, purging, as a remedy suited to inflammation in general, has been considered as peculiarly adapted to inflammation in any part of the head, and therefore to ophthalmia; and it is sometimes useful: but, for the reasons given before with respect to general bleeding, purging in the case of ophthalmia does not prove useful in any proportion to the evacuation excited.—For relaxing the spasm in the part, and taking off the determination of the fluids to it, blistering near the part has commonly been found useful. When the inflammation does not yield to the application of blisters after topical bleeding, great benefit is often obtained by supporting a discharge from the blistered part, under the form of an issue, by which means a more permanent determination of blood from the part is obtained.\n\nIt is probably also on the same principle that the good effects obtained from the use of ermine medicines in obstinate cases of ophthalmia are to be accounted for. By these ermines, in particular, which occasion and support for some time a great discharge from the nose, great benefit has often been obtained. The powder of afarabacca, or the infusion of hippocastanum, snuffed up the nose at bedtime in proper doses, are often productive of the best effects, when many other remedies have been tried in vain.\n\nOphthalmia, as an external inflammation, admits of topical applications. All those, however, which increase the heat and relax the vessels of the part, prove hurtful; and the admission of cool air to the eye, and the application of cooling and astringent medicines, which at the same time do not produce irritation, prove useful. Of all these the solution of acetite of lead, affluently applied, is perhaps the best. In the cure of this distemper, indeed, all irritation must carefully be avoided, particularly that of light; and the only certain means of doing this is by keeping the patient in a very dark chamber.\n\n2. In the ophthalmia tarfi, the same medicines may be necessary, as have been already recommended for the ophthalmia membranarum. However, as the ophthalmia tarfi may often depend upon an acrimony deposited in the sebaceous glands of the part, so it may require various internal remedies according to the variety of the acrimony in fault; for which we must refer to the consideration of icropula, fishyils, or other diseases with which this ophthalmia may be connected; and where these shall not be evident, certain remedies more generally adapted to the evacuation of acrimony, such as mercury, may be employed. In the ophthalmia tarfi, it almost constantly happens that some ulcerations are formed on the tarfius. These require the application of mercury and copper, which alone may sometimes cure the whole affection; and they may be useful even when the disease depends upon a fault of the whole system.\n\nBoth in the ophthalmia membranarum, and in the ophthalmia tarfi, it is necessary to obviate that gluing together of the eyelids which commonly happens in sleep; and which may be done by infusing a little of any mild unctuous medicine between the eyelids before the patient shall go to sleep.\n\nThe lighter kinds of inflammations from the dust or the sun, may be removed by fomenting with warm milk and water, adding a small portion of brandy; and by anointing the borders of the eyelids with unguentum tutiae, or the like, at night, especially when those parts are excoriated and sore. But in bad cases, after the inflammation has yielded a little to evacuations, the cataplasm aluminis of the London Pharmacopoeia spread on lint, and applied at bedtime, has been found the best external remedy. Before the use of the latter, the solution of sulphate of zinc is prescribed with advantage; and in violent pains it is of service to foment frequently with a decoction of white poppy-heads. One of the most common and most disagreeable consequences of ophthalmia, is an effusion of the cornea, so far obstructing the passage of light as to diminish or prevent vision. This is sometimes so considerable as to admit of removal by operation; but in lighter cases it may often be removed by the application of different gentle escharotics; and in this way, without the least danger of any inconvenience, good effects are often obtained, from gently introducing into the eye at bedtime a powder consisting of equal parts of supertartrate of potash and sugar, reduced together to a fine powder.\n\nWhere there is a disposition to frequent returns of this affection, cinchona is often employed with success in combating it: But nothing in general answers better than frequent and regular cold bathing of the eyes.\n\nBesides the various species of ophthalmia which were before known in Britain, another has lately been introduced, that contagious ophthalmia, viz. with which the\nBritish troops were affected in Egypt, and which they have imported into this island on their return from thence.\n\nOf this affection many interesting accounts have been published. Perhaps the best is an elaborate treatise by Mr Edmonston, who has had many opportunities of witnessing the affection, and extensive practice in the treatment of the disease, both in Egypt and in Britain. To his work therefore we may refer those who wish for the most full information respecting it. We shall only observe, that now, no doubt can be entertained respecting the contagious nature of the disease; and that therefore the first great object necessary in the treatment is the complete separation of the diseased from the sound.\n\nGENUS IX.

The distemper when present may be known by the following signs:\n\nThe veins of the head swell, and the temporal arteries throb much; the eyes are fixed, sparkly, and have a fierce aspect; the speech is incoherent, and the patient behaves very roughly to the bystanders, with furious attempts to get out of bed, not indeed continually, but returning as it were by paroxysms; the tongue is dry, rough, yellow, or black; there is a coldness of the external parts; a proneness to anger; chattering of the teeth; a trembling of the hands, with which the sick seem to be gathering something, and actually do gather the naps off the bed-clothes.\n\nCauses, and persons subject to this disorder. People of a hot and bilious habit of body, and such as are of a passionate disposition, are apt to be affected with phrenitis. In the same danger are those who make much use of spices, or are given to hot and spirituous liquors; who have been exposed more than usual to the sun, or obliged to undergo immoderate studies or watchings; who are subject to headaches, or in whom some customary hemorrhages have been stopped; or the disease may arise from some injury offered to the head externally. Sir John Pringle observes, that the phrenitis, when considered as an original disease, is apt to attack soldiers in the summer-season when they are exposed to the heat of the sun, and especially when asleep and in liquor. A symptomatic phrenitis is also more frequent in the army than elsewhere, on account of the violence done to all fevers when the sick are carried in waggon from the camp to an hospital, where the very noise or light alone would be sufficient, with more delicate natures, to raise a phrensy. From these and similar causes, a state of active inflammation, affecting some parts within the cranium, is produced: and there can be no doubt, that from this all the symptoms of the disease arise, and particularly that peculiar delirium which characterizes it. But in what manner local diseases, even of the brain itself, produce affections of the mind, we are still totally in the dark.\n\nPrognosis. Every kind of phrenitis, whether idiopathic or symptomatic, is attended with a high degree of danger; and, unless removed before the fourth day, a gangrene or sphacelus of the meninges readily takes place, and the patient dies delirious. The following are the most fatal symptoms: A continual and furious delirium, with watching; thin watery urine, white faeces, the urine and stools running off involuntarily, or a total suppression of these excretions; a ready disposition to become stupid, or to faint; trembling, rigor, chattering of the teeth, convulsions, hiccup, coldness of the extremities, trembling of the tongue, shrill voice, a sudden cessation of pain, with apparent tranquillity. The following are favourable: Sweats, apparently critical, breaking out; a seeming effort of nature to terminate the disease by a diarrhea; a large hemorrhage from the nose; swellings of the glands behind the ears; hemorrhoids.\n\nCure. From what has been said of the theory of this disease, the cure must entirely depend on obtaining a resolution of the inflammation. The objects chiefly to be aimed at with this view are, 1. The removal of such exciting causes as continue to operate. 2. The diminution of the momentum of the blood in the circulating system in general. 3. The diminution of impetus at the brain in particular: and, 4. The avoiding...\ning circumstances which tend either to accelerate the motion of the blood or to give determination to the head.\n\nDifferent practices may be used with these intentions; but the most powerful remedies are to be immediately employed. Large and repeated bleedings are especially necessary; and these too taken from vessels as near as possible to the part affected. The opening the temporal artery has been recommended, and with some reason: but as the practice is attended with inconveniences, perhaps the opening of the jugular veins may in general prove more effectual; with which, however, may be joined the drawing of blood from the temples by cupping and scarifying. It is also probable, that purging may be of more use in this than in some other inflammatory affections, as it may operate by revulsion. For the same purpose of revulsion, warm pediluvia are a remedy, but rather ambiguous. The taking off the force of the blood in the vessels of the head by an erect posture is generally useful. Blistering is also useful, but chiefly when applied near to the part affected. In short, every part of the antiphlogistic regimen is here necessary, and particularly the admission of cold air. Even cold substances applied to the head have been found useful; and the application of such refrigerants as vinegar is certainly proper. Opiates are thought to be hurtful in every inflammatory state of the brain. On the whole, however, it must be remarked, that practitioners are very uncertain with regard to the means proper to be used in this disease; and the more so, that the symptoms by which the disease is commonly judged to be present, appear sometimes without any internal inflammation; and on the other hand, dilutions have shown that the brain has been inflamed, where few of the peculiar symptoms of inflammation had appeared before death.\n\nGENUS X.

CYNANCHE TONSILLARIS.\nThe Inflammatory Cynyst.\n\nCynanche tonsillaris, Sauv. sp. 1.\nAngina inflammatoria, sp. 5. Boerh. 805.\n\nDescription. This is an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the fauces, affecting principally that congeries of mucus follicles which forms the tonsils; and from thence spreading along the velum and uvula, so as frequently to affect every part of the mucous membrane. The disease appears by some tumour and redness of the parts; is attended with a painful and difficult deglutition; a troublesome clamminess of the mouth and throat; a frequent but difficult excretion of mucus; and the whole is accompanied with pyrexia. The inflammation and tumour are commonly at first most considerable in one tonsil; and afterwards, abating in that, increase in the other. This disease is not contagious.\n\nCauses of, and persons subject, to this disorder. This disease is commonly occasioned by cold externally applied, particularly about the neck. It affects especially the young and sanguine; and a disposition to this often acquired by habit. It occurs especially in the spring, Gynanche, and autumn, when vicissitudes of heat and cold frequently take place.\n\nPrognosis. This species of cynanche terminates frequently by resolution, sometimes by suppuration, but hardly ever by gangrene; though in some cases sloughy spots appear on the fauces: the prognosis therefore is generally favourable.\n\nCure. As the principal morbid affection in this disease, on which all its characteristic symptoms immediately depend, is the active inflammation in the tonsils and neighbouring parts, the object first and principally to be aimed at in the cure is to obtain a resolution of this inflammation. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to have recourse to practices, with the view of obviating urgent symptoms before a resolution can be effected: and in other cases, where a resolution cannot be obtained, it must be the aim of the practitioner to promote a speedy and favourable suppuration. After suppuration has taken place, the proper means of promoting a discharge of the purulent matter will conclude the cure. Here some bleeding may be necessary; but large and general evacuations are seldom beneficial. The opening of the ranular veins is an insignificant remedy, according to Dr Cullen, but is recommended as efficacious by Sir John Pringle: more benefit, however, may in general be derived from leeches to the external fauces. The inflammation may be often relieved by moderate astringents, and particularly by acids applied to the parts affected. In many cases, nothing has been found to give more relief than the vapour of warm water received into the fauces.\n\nBesides these, blistering, and still more frequently rubefacient medicines, are applied with success, as well as antiphlogistic purgatives; and every part of the antiphlogistic regimen is to be observed, except the application of cold. Sir John Pringle recommends a thick piece of flannel moistened with two parts of common sweet oil, and one of spirit of hartshorn (or in a larger proportion, if the skin will bear it), to be applied to the throat, and renewed once every four or five hours. By this means the neck, and sometimes the whole body, is put into a sweat, which after bleeding either carries off or lessens the inflammation. When the disease has a tendency to suppuration, nothing will be more useful than receiving into the fauces the fleams of warm water. Benefit is also obtained from poultices applied to the external fauces. When the abscess is attended with much swelling, if it break not spontaneously, it ought to be opened by a lancet; and this does not require much caution, as even the inflammatory state may be relieved by some scarification of the tonsils. When this disease runs very rapidly to such a height as to threaten suffocation, it is sometimes necessary to have recourse to bronchotomy as the only mean of saving the life of the patient. But there is reason to believe that this operation has sometimes been employed where it was not necessary: and we may safely venture to say, that it is but seldom requisite; insomuch that Dr Cullen tells us, he has never in his practice seen any case requiring bronchotomy.\n\nSp.

This distemper is not particularly described by the ancient physicians; though perhaps the Syrian and Egyptian ulcers mentioned by Aretaeus Cappadoc, and the pestilent ulcerated tonsils we read of in Actius Amideus, were of this nature. Some of the scarlet fevers mentioned by Morton seem also to have approached near to it. In the beginning of the last century, a disease exactly similar to this is described by the physicians of that time, as raging with great violence and mortality in Spain and some parts of Italy; but no account of it was published in this country till the year 1748, when a very accurate one was drawn up by Dr Fothergill, and in 1752 by Dr Huxham. The latter observes, that this disease was preceded by long, cold, and wet seasons; by which probably the bodies of people were debilitated, and more apt to receive contagion, which possibly also might be produced by the stagnant and putrid waters.\n\nThe attack of this disease was very different in different persons. Sometimes a rigor, with fulness and forenses of the throat, and painful stiffness of the neck, were the first symptoms complained of. Sometimes alternate chills and heats, with some degree of giddiness, drowsiness, or headache, ushered in the distemper. It seized others with more severe feverish symptoms; great pain of the head, back, and limbs; a vast oppression of the precordia, and continual sighing. Some grown persons went about for days in a drooping state, with much uneasiness and anxiety, till at last they were obliged to take to their beds.—Thus various was the disease, says Dr Huxham, at the onset. But it commonly began with chills and heats, load and pain of the head, forenses of throat, and hoarseness; some cough, sickness at stomach, frequent vomiting and purging, in children especially, which were sometimes very severe; though a contrary state was more common to the adult. There was in all a very great depression of spirits, very sudden weakness, great heaviness on the breast, and faintness, from the very beginning. The pulse in general was quick, small, and fluttering, though sometimes heavy and undulating. The urine was commonly pale, thin, and crude; however, in many grown persons, it was passed in small quantities and high-coloured, or like turbid whey. The eyes were heavy, reddish, and as it were weeping; the countenance very often full, flushed, and bloated, cynanche, though sometimes pale and sunk.\n\nHow flight forever the disorder might appear in the daytime, at night the symptoms became greatly aggravated, and the feverish habit very much increased, nay, sometimes a delirium occurred on the very first night; and this exacerbation constantly returned through the whole course of the disease. Indeed, when it was considerably on the decline, our author says he has been often pretty much surprised to find his patient had passed the whole night in a phrensy, whom he had left tolerably cool and fedate in the day.\n\nSome few hours after the seizure, and sometimes contemporary with it, a swelling and forenses of the throat was perceived, and the tonsils became very tumid and inflamed, and many times the parotid and maxillary glands swelled very much, and very suddenly, even at the very beginning; sometimes so much as even to threaten strangulation. The fauces also very soon appeared of a high florid red, or rather of a bright crimson, colour, very shining and glossy; and most commonly on the uvula, tonsils, velum palatinum, and back part of the pharynx, several whitish or ash-coloured spots appeared scattered up and down, which oftentimes increased very fast, and soon covered one or both the tonsils, uvula, &c.: those in the event proved floughs of superficial ulcers (which sometimes, however, are very deep into the parts). The tongue at this time, though only white and moist at the tip, was very foul at the root, and covered with a thick, yellowish or brown coat. The breath also now began to be very nauseous; which offensive smell increased hourly, and in some became at length intolerable, and that too sometimes even to the patients themselves.\n\nThe second or third day every symptom became much more aggravated, and the fever much more considerable; and those that had struggled with it tolerably well for 30 or 40 hours, were forced to submit. The restlessness and anxiety greatly increased, as well as the difficulty in swallowing. The head was very giddy, pained, and loaded; there was generally more or less of a delirium; sometimes a pervigilium and perpetual phrensy, though others lay very stupid, but often starting and muttering to themselves. The skin was very hot, dry, and rough; there was very rarely any disposition to sweat. The urine was pale, thin, crude; often yellowish and turbid. Sometimes vomiting was urgent, and sometimes a very great loofness, in children particularly. The floughs were now much enlarged, and of a darker colour, and the surrounding parts tended much more to a livid hue. The breathing became much more difficult; with a kind of a rattling flektor, as if the patient was actually strangling, the voice being exceeding hoarse and hollow, exactly resembling that from venereal ulcers in the fauces: this noise in speaking and breathing was so peculiar, that any person in the least conversant with the disease might easily know it by this odd noise; from whence indeed the Spanish physicians gave it the name of garrotillo, expressing the noise made by persons when they are strangled with a rope. Dr Fothergill never observed in one of them the shrill barking noise that we frequently hear in inflammatory cynanche. The breath...\nbreath of all the diseased was very nauseous; of some infufferably fetid, especially in the advance of the distemper to a crisis; and many about the fourth or fifth day spit off a vast quantity of stinking purulent mucus tinged sometimes with blood; and sometimes the matter was quite livid, and of an abominable smell. The nostrils likewise in many were greatly inflamed and excoriated, continually dripping down a very sharp ichor or fumious matter, so excessively acrid, that it not only corroded the lips, cheeks, and hands of the children that laboured under the disease, but even the fingers and arms of the very nurses that attended them: as this ulceration of the nostrils came on, it commonly caused an almost incessant sneezing in the children; but few adults were affected with it, at least to any considerable degree. It was surprising what quantities of matter some children discharged this way, which they would often rub on their face, hands, and arms, and blister them all over. A sudden stoppage of this rheum from the mouth and nostrils actually choked several children; and some swallowed such quantities of it, as occasioned excoriations of the intestines, violent gripings, dysentery, &c. nay, even excoriations of the anus and buttocks. Not only the nostrils, fauces, &c. were greatly affected by this extremely sharp matter, but the wind-pipe itself was sometimes much corroded by it, and pieces of its internal membrane were spit up, with much blood and corruption; and the patients lingered on for a considerable time, and at length died tabid; though there were more frequent instances of its falling suddenly and violently on the lungs, and killing in a peripneumonic manner.\n\nDr Huxham was astonished sometimes to see several swallow with tolerable ease, though the tumour of the tonsils and throat, the quantity of thick mucus, and the rattling noise in breathing, were very terrible; which he thinks pretty clearly shows, that this malignant angina was more from the acrimony and abundance of the humours than the violence of the inflammation.\n\nMost commonly the angina came on before the exanthemata; but many times the cuticular eruption appeared before the sore-throat, and was sometimes very considerable, though there was little or no pain in the fauces: on the contrary, a very severe angina seized some patients that had no manner of eruption; and yet, even in these cases, a very great itching and desquamation of the skin sometimes ensued; but this was chiefly in grown persons, very rarely in children. In general, however, a very considerable efflorescence broke out on the surface of the body, particularly in children; and it most commonly happened the second, third, or fourth day: sometimes it was partial, sometimes it covered almost the whole body, though very seldom the face: sometimes it was of an erysipelasous kind; sometimes more pustular: the pustules frequently eminent, and of a deep fiery red colour, particularly on the breast and arms; but oftentimes they were very small, and might be better felt than seen, and gave a very odd kind of roughness to the skin. The colour of the efflorescence was commonly of a crimson hue, or as if the skin had been smeared over with juice of raspberries, and this even to the fingers ends; and the skin appeared inflamed and swollen, as it were; the arms, hands, and fingers, were often evidently so, and very stiff, and somewhat painful. This crimson colour of the skin seemed indeed peculiar to this disease. Though the eruption seldom failed of giving some manifest relief to the patient, as to anxiety, sickness at stomach, vomiting, purging, &c. yet there was observed an universal fiery eruption on some persons, without the least abatement of the symptoms, nay almost every symptom seemed more aggravated, particularly the fever, load at breast, anxiety, and delirium; Dr Huxham knew more than one or two patients die in the most raging phreny, covered with the most universal fiery rash he ever saw: so that, as in the highly confluent smallpox, it seemed only to denote the quantity of the disease, as he terms it.\n\nHe had under his care a young gentleman, about 12 years of age, whose tongue, fauces, and tonsils, were as black as ink, and he swallowed with extreme difficulty; he continually spit off immense quantities of a black, fumious, and very fetid matter, for at least eight or ten days:—about the seventh day, his fever being somewhat abated, he fell into a bloody dysentery, though the bloody, fumious, fetid expectoration still continued, with a most violent cough. He at length indeed got over it, to the very great surprise of every one that saw him. Now, in this patient, a severe and universal rash broke out upon the second and third day; and the itching of his skin was so intolerable, that he tore it all over his body in a most shocking manner; yet this very great and timely eruption very little relieved his fever and phreny, or prevented the other dreadful symptoms mentioned.\n\nAn early and kindly eruption, however, was most commonly a very good omen; and, when succeeded by a very copious desquamation of the cuticle, one of the most favourable symptoms that occurred: but when the eruption turned of a dusky or livid colour, or prematurely or suddenly receded, every symptom grew worse, and the utmost danger impended, especially if purple or black spots appeared up and down, as sometimes happened; the urine grew limpid, and convulsions came on, or a fatal suffocation soon clost the tragedy.\n\nThe disease was generally at the height about the fifth or sixth day in young persons, in the elder not so soon; and the crisis many times was not till the 11th or 12th, and then very imperfect; some adults, however, were carried off in two or three days; the distemper either falling on the lungs, and killing in a peripneumonic manner; or on the brain, in which case the patient either died raving or comatose. In some, the disease brought on a very troublesome cough, purulent expectoration, haemoptoe, and hectic fever; in which they lingered on for several weeks, and then died tabid.\n\nIf a gentle easy sweat took place on the third or fourth day; if the pulse became more slow, firm, and equal; if the floughs of the fauces cast off in a kindly manner, and appeared at the bottom tolerably clean and florid; if the breathing was more soft and free, and some degree of vigour and quickness returned in the eyes; all was well, and a salutary crisis followed soon by a continuance of the sweat, and a turbid, subsiding, farinaceous urine, a plentiful expectoration, and a very large desquamation of the cuticle. But if a rigor came on, and the exanthemata suddenly disappeared or turned livid;\nlivid; if the pulse grew very small and quick, and the skin remained hot and parched as it were, the breathing more difficult, the eyes dead and glaify, the urine pale and limpid, a phrensy or coma succeeded, with a coldish clammy sweat on the face or extremities; life was despaired of, especially if a fingultus and choking or gulping in the throat attended, with sudden, liquid, involuntary, livid stools, intolerably fetid. In some few patients Dr Huxham observed, some time before the fatal period, not only the face bloated, fallow, shining and greasy as it were, but the whole neck very much swollen, and of a cadaverous look; and even the whole body became in some degree oedematous; and the impression of a finger would remain fixed in a part, the skin not rising again as usual; an indication that the blood stagnated in the capillaries, and that the elasticity of the fibres was quite lost.\n\nMedical writers are still much divided in opinion, whether the cynanche maligna is to be considered as the same disease with the scarlatina anginosa, afterwards to be treated of, or not. This question will afterwards come to be more fully discussed. At present we may only observe, that although ulcerous sore throats of a malignant nature often appear sporadically, yet that the disease above described appears only as an epidemic, and is always the consequence of contagion.\n\nWe have, therefore, no doubt that the cynanche maligna of Huxham, Fothergill, and Cullen, is precisely the same disease with the scarlatina anginosa of Sauvage, Withering, and other late writers. This is abundantly demonstrated by the diversities which take place in the appearance of the disease among children of the same family during the same epidemic.\n\nPrognosis. This may be easily gathered from the above description. The malignant and putrid tendency of the disease is evident, and an increase of the symptoms which arise from that putrefactive disposition of the body must give an unfavourable prognostic. On the contrary, a decrease of these, and an apparent increase of the vis vitae, are favourable: in general, what is observed to be favourable in the nervous and putrid malignant fevers, is also favourable in this, and vice versa.\n\nCauses. Since the accurate accounts given by Dr Fothergill and Huxham of the epidemics which prevailed about 50 years ago, this disease has frequently been observed at times epidemic in almost every different part of Britain. Like small-pox, measles, and croup, it seems in every case to be the effect of a peculiar and specific contagion. It has been observed to prevail, equally generally in every situation, and at every season; and on exposure to the contagion, no age, sex, or condition, is exempted from it. But the having once had the disease, seems in this affection to afford the same security against future contagion as in the small-pox; at least instances, where it can be said that the same individual has been twice affected with it, are both very rare and very doubtful, as well as in small-pox.\n\nCure. Like other febrile contagions, the malignant ulcerous sore throat is terminated only by a natural course; and the chief business of the practitioner is to combat unfavourable occurrences. In this the septic tendency of the disease is chiefly to be kept in view. The debility with which it is attended renders all evacuations by bleeding and purging improper, except in a few instances where the debility is less, and the inflammatory symptoms more considerable. The fauces are to be preserved from the effects of the acrid matter poured out upon them, and are therefore to be frequently washed out by antiseptic gargles or injections; and the putrefactive state of the whole system should be guarded against and corrected by internal antiseptics, especially by the Peruvian bark given in the beginning and continued through the course of the disease. Great benefit is also often derived from the liberal use of the mineral acids. Both the sulphuric and muriatic, in a state of proper dilution, have been highly extolled by different medical writers, and are productive of the best effects in actual practice, when they can be introduced to a sufficient extent. In particular, the oxygenated muriatic acid, as recommended by Mr Braithwaite, has been found productive of the greatest advantages. Emetics, both by vomiting and nauseating, prove useful. When any considerable tumor occurs, blisters applied externally will be of service, and in any case may be proper to moderate the inflammation.\n\nVery lately, the internal use of the capsicum annum, or Cayenne pepper as it is commonly called, has been highly celebrated in this affection; and it is particularly said to have been employed with singular success in the West Indies.\n\nBut of all the remedies lately proposed, none has been more highly extolled than the external use of cold water. It has even been contended by some that by dashing cold water on the surface of the body, an immediate artificial cure of this disease may be obtained. We are, however, fully persuaded, that cold water will no more destroy the contagion of this disease than of smallpox; and we cannot help thinking that the practice is seldom necessary, and sometimes hurtful.\n\nSp.

He informs us, that it consists in an inflammation of the glottis, larynx, or upper part of the trachea, whether it affect the membranes of these parts or the muscles adjoining. It may arise first in these parts, and continue to subsist in them alone; or it may come to affect these parts from the cynanche tonsillaris, or maligna, spreading into them.\n\nIn either way it has been a rare occurrence, and few instances of it have been marked and recorded by physicians. It is to be known by a peculiar croaking sound of the voice, by difficult respiration, with a sense of straitening about the larynx, and by a pyrexia attending it.\n\nFrom the nature of these symptoms, and from the diffusion of the bodies of persons who died of this disease, there is no doubt of its being of an inflammatory kind. It does not, however, always run the course of inflammatory affections; but frequently produces such an obstruction of the passage of the air, as suffocates, and thereby proves suddenly fatal.\n\nIt particularly proves fatal, in consequence of the trachea being obstructed by a membranous substance lining the inside of it, and very nearly approaching in appearance to the inflammatory exudation often discovered on the intestinal canal in those dying of enteritis.\n\nIf we judge rightly of the nature of this disease, it will be obvious, that the cure of it requires the most powerful remedies of inflammation to be employed upon the very first appearance of the symptoms. When a suffocation is threatened, whether any remedies can be employed to prevent it, is not yet determined by sufficient experience: but it is evident, that in certain cases the life of the patient can be preserved only by the removal of that matter which obstructs the passage of air through the trachea.\n\nThe accounts which books have hitherto given us of inflammations of the larynx, and the parts connected with it, amount to what we have now said; and many instances are recorded of the disease happening in adult persons: but there is a peculiar affection of this kind happening to infants, which has been little taken notice of till lately. Dr Francis Home is the first who has given any distinct account of this disease; but, since he wrote, several other authors have taken notice of it, and have given different opinions concerning it.\n\nThis disease seldom attacks infants till after they have been weaned. After this period, the younger they are, the more they are liable to the disease. The frequency of it becomes less as children become more advanced; and there are few instances of children above 12 years of age being affected with it. It attacks children of the midland countries, as well as those who live near the sea; but it occurs much more frequently at certain places than at others. It does not appear to be contagious; and its attacks are frequently repeated in the same child. It is often manifestly the effect of cold applied to the body; and cynanche therefore appears most frequently in the winter and spring seasons. It very commonly comes on with the ordinary symptoms of a catarrh; but sometimes the peculiar symptoms of the disease show themselves at the very first.\n\nThese peculiar symptoms are the following: A hoarseness, with some thrillings and ringing sound, both in speaking and coughing, as if the noise came from a brazen tube. At the same time, there is a sense of pain about the larynx, some difficulty of respiration, with a whizzing sound in inspiration, as if the passage of the air were straitened. The cough which attends it, is commonly dry; and if anything be spit up, it is matter of a purulent appearance, and sometimes films resembling portions of a membrane. With all these symptoms, there is a frequency of pulse, a rattling, and an uneasy sense of heat. When the internal fauces are viewed, they are sometimes without any appearance of inflammation; but frequently a redness, and even swelling, appears; and sometimes there is an appearance of matter like that rejected by coughing, together with the symptoms now described, and particularly with great difficulty of breathing, and a sense of strangling in the fauces, by which the patient is sometimes suddenly taken off.\n\nMany dissections have been made of infants who had died of this disease, and almost constantly there has appeared a preternatural substance, apparently membranous, lining the whole internal surface of the upper part of the trachea, and extending in the same manner downwards into some of its ramifications. This preternatural membrane may be easily separated, and sometimes has been found separated in part from the subjacent proper membrane of the trachea. This last is commonly found entire, that is, without any appearance of erosion or ulceration; but it frequently shows the vestiges of inflammation, and is covered by a matter resembling pus, like to that rejected by coughing; and very often a matter of the same kind is found in the bronchiae, sometimes in considerable quantity.\n\nFrom the remote causes of this disease; from the catarrhal symptoms commonly attending it; from the pyrexia constantly present with it; from the same kind of preternatural membrane being found in the trachea when the cynanche maligna is communicated to it; and from the vestiges of inflammation on the trachea discovered upon dissection; we must conclude, that this disease consists in an inflammatory affection of the mucous membrane of the larynx and trachea, producing an exudation analogous to that found on the surface of inflamed viscera, and appearing partly in a membranous crust, and partly in a fluid form resembling pus.\n\nThough this disease consists in an inflammatory affection, it does not commonly end either in suppuration or gangrene. The most troublesome circumstance of it seems to consist in a spasm of the muscles of the glottis, threatening suffocation.\n\nWhen this disease terminates in health, it is by resolution of the inflammation, by ceasing of the inflammation of the glottis, by an expectoration of the matter exuding from the trachea, and of the crusts formed there.\nthere, and frequently it ends without any expectoration, or at least with such only as attends an ordinary catarrh. But in some instances, a salutary termination has very speedily taken place, in consequence of the discharge of the membranous substance from the trachea, even under its proper tubular form.\n\nWhen the disease ends fatally, it is by suffocation seemingly depending upon a spasm affecting the glottis; but sometimes, probably, depending upon a quantity of matter filling the bronchia, or obstructing the trachea.\n\nAs we suppose the disease to be an inflammatory affection, so we attempt the cure of it by the usual remedies of inflammation. Bleeding, both general and topical, has often given immediate relief, and, by being repeated, has entirely cured the disease. Blistering also, near to the part affected, has been found useful. Upon the first attack of the disease, vomiting, immediately after bleeding, seems to be of considerable use, and sometimes suddenly removes the disease. But emetics are still more useful in advanced periods. By the employment of these, the matter obstructing the trachea, and inducing spasmodic affections, has often been successfully removed, when the situation of the patient seemed to be almost desperate. And as in the progress of the disease fresh effusions of this matter are very apt to take place, the frequent repetition of emetics becomes necessary. It is often necessary to have recourse to those operating the most expeditiously, such as sulphate of zinc even in large doses. In every stage of the disease, the antiphlogistic regimen is necessary, and particularly the frequent use of laxative glysters. Some practitioners consider mercury, particularly under the form of calomel, as an almost infallible remedy in this disease. It has particularly been extolled by Mr James Anderson, an eminent surgeon in Edinburgh. But we are sorry to say that in some cases at least, after the fairest trial, it has been found to fail. Though we suppose that a spasm affecting the glottis is often fatal in this disease, anti-spasmodic medicines have not in general been found of great service. Some, however, have strongly recommended the use of atalantia under the form of injection; others place great confidence in oil, or oily mixtures, taken by the mouth; but more immediate benefit is derived from tepid bathing, and the employment of sulphuric ether, both externally and internally.\n\nBy these, when the disease is spasmodic, it is often successfully removed. But by much the most dangerous form of the disease is the inflammatory state giving the exudation. And when this inflammatory exudation has even been removed from the upper part of the trachea, yet it has sometimes proved fatal, from the inflammation and exudation extending to the branches of the aorta arteria. By such an occurrence, the writer of the present article had the misfortune to lose a favourite son; an amiable youth, in the fourteenth year of his age, who was highly admired and sincerely regretted by all to whom he was known.\n\nSp.

Tozetti, Racolta ima, p. 176.\n\nThis is a disease well known to the vulgar, but little taken notice of by medical writers. It is often epidemic, and manifestly contagious. It comes on with the usual symptoms of pyrexia, which is soon after attended with a considerable tumor of the external fauces and neck. The swelling appears first as a glandular moveable tumor at the corner of the lower jaw; but it soon becomes uniformly diffused over a great part of the neck, sometimes on one side only, but more commonly on both. The swelling continues to increase till the fourth day; but from that period it declines, and in a few days more goes off entirely. As the swelling of the fauces recedes, it not unfrequently happens that some tumor affects the testicles in the male sex, or the breasts in the female. These tumors are sometimes large, hard, and somewhat painful; but are seldom either very painful or of long continuance. The pyrexia attending this disease is commonly slight, and goes off with the swelling of the fauces; but sometimes, when the swelling of the testicles does not succeed to that of the fauces, or when the one or the other has been suddenly repressed, the pyrexia becomes more considerable, is often attended with delirium, and has sometimes proved fatal.\n\nAs this disease commonly runs its course without either dangerous or troublesome symptoms, so it hardly requires any remedies. An antiphlogistic regimen, and avoiding cold, are all that will be commonly necessary. But when, upon the receding of the swellings, the pyrexia comes to be considerable, and threatens an affection of the brain, it will be proper, by warm fomentations, to bring back the swelling; and by vomiting, bleeding, or blistering, to obviate the consequences of its absence.\n\nGenus XI.

Pneumonic inflammation, however various in the seat, always discovers itself by pyrexia, difficult breathing, cough, and pain in some part of the thorax. It almost always comes on with a cold stage, and is accompanied with the other symptoms of pyrexia; though in some few instances the pulse may not be more frequent, nor the heat of the body increased beyond what is natural. Sometimes the pyrexia is from the beginning accompanied with the other symptoms; but frequently it is formed some hours before them, and particularly before the pain is felt. The pulse for the most part is frequent, full, strong, hard, and quick; but, in a few instances, especially in the advanced state of the disease, it is weak, soft, and at the same time irregular. The difficulty of breathing is most considerable in inspiration, both because the lungs do not easily admit of a full dilatation, and because the dilatation increases the pain attending the disease. The difficulty of breathing is also greater when the patient is in one posture of the body rather than another. It is generally greater when he lies on the side affected; though sometimes the contrary happens. Very often the patient cannot lie upon either side, and can find ease only when lying on the back; and sometimes he cannot breathe readily, except when in somewhat of an erect posture. The cough, in different cases, is more or less urgent or painful. It is sometimes dry, or without any expectoration; especially in the beginning of the disease; but more commonly it is, even from the beginning, moist, and the matter spit up various both in consistence and colour, and frequently it is streaked with blood. The pain is also different in different cases, and felt in different parts of the thorax, but most frequently in one side. It has been said to affect the right side more frequently than the left; but this is uncertain, and we are sure that the left side has been very often affected. Sometimes it is felt as if it was under the sternum; sometimes in the back between the shoulders; and when in the sides, its place has been higher or lower, more forward or backward; but the place of all most frequently affected is about the fifth or seventh rib, near the middle of its length, or a little more forward. The pain is often severe and pungent; but sometimes more dull and obtuse, with a sense of weight rather than of pain. It is most especially severe and pungent when occupying the place last mentioned. For the most part it continues fixed in one part, but sometimes shoots from the side to the scapula on one hand, or to the sternum and clavicle on the other.\n\nDr Cullen supposes that the disease is always seated, or at least begins, in some part of the pleura, taking that membrane in its greatest extent, as now commonly understood; that is, as covering not only the internal surface of the cavity of the thorax, but also as forming the mediastinum, and as extended over the pericardium, and over the whole surface of the lungs. But as the symptoms never clearly indicate where the seat of the disease is, there is but little foundation for the different names by which it has been distinguished. The term pleurify is improperly limited to that inflammation which begins in and chiefly affects the pleura costalis. This Dr Cullen thinks is a rare occurrence; and that the pneumonia much more frequently begins in the pleura involving the lungs, producing all the symptoms which belong to what hath been called the pleuritis vera. The word peri-pneumony has been applied to an inflammation beginning in the parenchyma, or cellular texture of the lungs, and having its seat chiefly there. But to Dr Cullen it seems very doubtful if any acute inflammation of the lungs, or any disease which has been called peri-pneumony, be of that kind. It seems probable,\nthat every acute inflammation begins in membranous parts; and in every dislocation of persons who have died of peripneumony, the external membrane of the lungs, or some part of the pleura, has appeared to have been considerably affected. An inflammation of the pleura covering the upper surface of the diaphragm, has been distinguished by the appellation of paraphrenitis, as supposed to be attended with the peculiar symptoms of delirium, risus sardonius, and other convulsive motions: but it is certain, that an inflammation of that portion of the pleura, and affecting also even the muscular substance of the diaphragm, has often taken place without any of the symptoms above-mentioned; and neither the dislocations which have fallen under Dr Cullen's observation, nor any accounts of dislocations, support the opinion that an inflammation of the pleura covering the diaphragm is attended with delirium more commonly than any other pneumonic inflammation.—It is to be observed, however, that though the inflammation may begin in one particular part of the pleura, the morbid affection is commonly communicated to the whole extent of the membrane.\n\nThe pneumonic inflammation, like others, may terminate by resolution, suppuration, or gangrene: but it has also a termination peculiar to itself; namely, when it is attended with an effusion of blood into the cellular texture of the lungs, which, soon interrupting the circulation of the blood through the vasa, produces a fatal suffocation. This indeed appears to be the most common termination of pneumonic inflammation when it ends fatally; for upon the dislocation of almost every person who has died of this disease, it appears that such an effusion had happened. From the same dislocations we learn, that pneumonic inflammation commonly produces an exudation from the internal surface of the pleura, which appears partly as a soft viscid crust, often of a compact membranous form, covering everywhere the surface of the pleura, and particularly those parts where the lungs adhere to the pleura costalis, or mediastinum; and this crust seems always to be the cement of such adhesion. The same exudation shows itself also by a quantity of a serous fluid commonly found in the cavity of the thorax; and some exudation or effusion is usually found to have been made into the cavity of the pericardium. It seems likewise probable, that an effusion of this kind is sometimes made into the cavity of the bronchiae; for in some persons who have died after labouring under a pneumonic inflammation for a few days only, the bronchiae have been found filled with a considerable quantity of serous and thickish fluid, which must be considered rather as the effusion abovementioned, having had its thinner parts taken off by respiration, than as a pus so suddenly formed in the inflamed part. It is, however, not improbable, that this effusion, as well as that made into the cavities of the thorax and pericardium, may be a matter of the same kind with that which in other inflammations is poured into the cellular texture of the parts inflamed, and there converted into pus; but in the thorax and pericardium it does not always put on this appearance, because the crust covering the surface prevents the absorption of the thinner part. This absorption, however, may be compensated in the bronchiae, by the drying power of the air; and therefore the effusion into them may assume a more purulent appearance. In many cases of Pneumonic inflammation, when the expectoration is very copious, it is difficult to suppose that the whole proceeds from the mucous follicles of the bronchiae; and it seems probable that a great part of it may come from the effused serous fluid just mentioned; and this too will account for the appearance of the expectoration being so often purulent. Perhaps the same thing will account for that purulent matter found in the bronchiae, which Mr de Haen says he had often observed when there was no ulceration in the lungs, and which he accounts for in a very strange manner, namely, by supposing a pus formed in the circulating blood.\n\nDr Cullen is of opinion, that the effusion into the bronchiae above-mentioned often concurs with the effusion of red blood into the cellular substance of the lungs to occasion the fatal suffocation which frequently terminates peripneumony; that the effusion of serum alone may have this effect; and that the serum poured out in a certain quantity, rather than any debility in the powers of expectoration, is the cause of that cessation of spitting which precedes the fatal event; for in many cases the expectoration has ceased, when no other symptoms of debility have appeared, and when, upon dislocation the bronchiae have been full of liquid matter. Nay, it is even probable, that in some cases such an effusion may take place without any symptoms of violent inflammation; and in other cases the effusion taking place may seem to remove the symptoms of inflammation which had appeared before, and thus account for those unexpected fatal terminations which have sometimes happened.\n\nPneumonic inflammation seldom terminates by resolution, without being attended with some evident evacuation. An hemorrhage from the nose happening on some of the first days of the disease has sometimes put an end to it; and it is said, that an evacuation from the hemorrhoidal veins, a bilious evacuation by stool, and an evacuation of urine with a copious sediment, have frequently had the same effect; but such occurrences have been rare. The evacuation most frequently attending, and seeming to have the greatest effect in promoting resolution, is an expectoration of a thick, white, or yellowish matter, a little streaked with blood, copious, and brought up without much or violent coughing. Very frequently the resolution of this disease is attended with, and perhaps produced by, a sweat, if it be warm, fluid, copious, over the whole body, and attended with an abatement of the frequency of the pulse, heat of the body, and other febrile symptoms. Although, from the history now given, it appears that pleurisy and peripneumony cannot with propriety be considered as different diseases, yet it is certain that in different cases this affection occurs with an assemblage of symptoms separate and distinct. Thus even Dr Cullen himself, in his Nosology, has defined pleurisy to consist in pyrexia, attended with pungent pain of the side, painful respiration, difficulty of lying down, particularly on the affected side, and distressing cough, in the beginning dry, but afterwards humid, and often with bloody expectoration. While again he has defined peripneumony to consist in pyrexia, attended with a dull pain under the sternum and between the shoulders, anxiety, difficulty of breathing, humi\nmid cough, expectoration generally bloody, a soft pulse, and a tumid livid appearance of the countenance. It is highly probable, that the first of these sets of symptoms chiefly arises from a state of active inflammation, and the second from effusion. Thus, in certain cases, the symptoms may appear perfectly separate and distinct; but more frequently both inflammation and effusion are united; and thus the symptoms in both definitions are in general combined in the same patient. But still pleuritis, strictly so called, may be considered as characterized by the acute pungent pain at a particular spot of the chest, and that pain much aggravated on a full inspiration; while proper peripneumonia is distinguished by the dull gravitative pain extended over the whole chest, and by the laborious respiration.\n\nCauses of, and persons subject to, this disorder. The remote cause of pneumonic inflammation is commonly cold applied to the body, obstructing perspiration, and determining to the lungs, while at the same time the lungs themselves are exposed to the action of cold. These circumstances operate chiefly when an inflammatory diathesis prevails in the system; and therefore those principally affected with this disease are persons of the greatest vigour, in cold climates, often in the winter season, but particularly in the spring, when vicissitudes of heat and cold are frequent. This disease, however, may arise in any season when such varieties take place. Other remote causes also may have a share in producing this distemper; such as every means of obstructing, straining, or otherwise injuring, the pulmonary organs. The pneumonic inflammation has sometimes been so much an epidemic, that it hath been suspected of depending on a specific contagion; but Dr Cullen never met with an instance of its being contagious.\n\nPrognosis. In pneumonic inflammations, a violent pyrexia is always dangerous. The danger, however, is chiefly denoted by the difficulty of breathing. When the patient can lie on one side only; when he can lie on neither side, but only on his back; when he cannot breathe with tolerable ease, except when the trunk of his body is erect; when even in this posture the breathing is very difficult, and attended with a turgescence and flushing of the face, with partial sweats about the head and neck, and an irregular pulse; these circumstances mark the difficulty of breathing in different degrees; and consequently, in proportion, the danger of the disease. A frequent violent cough, aggravating the pain, is always the symptom of an obfinate disease; and as the disease is seldom or never resolved without some expectoration, so a dry cough must always be an unfavourable symptom.\n\nThe proper characteristics of the expectoration have been already laid down; and though an expectoration which has not these marks must indicate a doubtful state of the disease, yet the colour alone can give no certain prognostic. An acute pain, very much interrupting inspiration, is always the mark of a violent disease; but not of a more dangerous disease than an obtuse pain, attended with very difficult respiration, demonstrating effusion into the cells.\n\nWhen the pains, which had at first affected one side only, shall afterwards spread into the other; or when, leaving the side first affected, they pass entirely into the other; these are always marks of a dangerous disease.\n\nA delirium coming on during a pneumonic inflammation is always a symptom denoting much danger.\n\nWhen pneumonic disorders terminate fatally, it is on one or other of the days of the first week, from the third to the seventh. This is the most common case; but, in a few instances, death has happened at a later period. When the disease is violent, but admitting of resolution, this also happens frequently in the course of the first week; but in a more moderate disease the resolution is often put off to the second week. The disease generally suffers a remission on some of the days from the third to the seventh; which, however, may be often fallacious, as it sometimes returns again with as much violence as before; and in such a case with great danger. Sometimes it disappears on the third day, while an erysipelas makes its appearance on some external part; and if this continue fixed, the pneumonic inflammation does not recur. If the disease continue beyond the tenth day, it will terminate in a suppuration, or phthisis. The termination by gangrene is much more rare than has been imagined; and when it does occur, it is usually joined with the termination by effusion; the symptoms of the one being hardly distinguishable from those of the other.\n\nCure. This must proceed upon the general plan mentioned under Synocha; but, on account of the importance of the part affected, the remedies must be employed early, and as fully as possible; and these are chiefly directed with one of three views, viz., for obtaining a resolution of the inflammation in the thorax, for mitigating the urgent symptoms before a resolution can be effected, and for counteracting or obviating the consequences of the disease. Venesection is the remedy chiefly to be depended on; and may be performed in either arm, as the surgeon finds most convenient; and the quantity taken away ought in general to be as large as the patient's strength will allow. The remission of pain, and the relief of respiration, during the flowing of the blood, may limit the quantity to be then drawn; but if these symptoms of relief do not appear, the bleeding should be continued to a considerable extent, unless symptoms of a beginning syncope come on. It is seldom that one bleeding, however large, will cure this disease; and though the pain and difficulty of breathing may be much relieved by the first bleeding, these symptoms commonly and after no long interval recur, often with as much violence as before. In this case the bleeding is to be repeated even on the same day, and perhaps to the same quantity as before. Sometimes the second bleeding may be larger than the first. There are persons who, by their constitution, are ready to faint even upon a small bleeding; and in such persons this may prevent the drawing so much blood at first as a pneumonic inflammation may require; but as the same persons are found to bear after-bleedings better than the first, this allows the second and subsequent bleedings to be larger, and to such a quantity as the symptoms of the disease may seem to require.\n\nBleedings are to be repeated according to the state of the symptoms, and they will be more effectual when prolonged in the course of the first three days than afterwards; but they are not to be omitted though four days of the disease may already have elapsed. If the physician has not been called in time, or the first bleed-\nings have not been sufficiently large, or even though they should have procured some remission, yet upon the return of the urgent symptoms, bleeding may be repeated at any time within the first fortnight, or even after that period, if a suppuration be not evident, or if after a seeming solution the disease shall have returned.\n\nWith respect to the quantity of blood which may be taken away with safety, no general rules can be given; as it must be very different according to the state of the disease, and the constitution of the patient. In an adult male of tolerable strength, a pound of blood is a full bleeding. Any quantity above 20 ounces is a large, and any quantity below 12 is a small, bleeding. An evacuation of four or five pounds, in the course of two or three days, is generally as much as most patients will bear; but if the intervals between the bleedings, and the whole of the time during which the bleedings have been employed, have been long, the quantity taken upon the whole may be greater.\n\nWhen a large quantity of blood has been taken from the arm, and it is doubtful if more can be taken in that manner with safety, some blood may still be taken by cupping and scarifying. This will especially be proper, when the recurrence of the pain, rather than the difficulty of breathing, becomes the urgent symptom; and then the cupping and scarification should be made as near as possible to the pained part.\n\nAn expectoration sometimes takes place very early in this disease; but if the symptoms continue urgent, the bleedings must be repeated notwithstanding the expectoration; but in a more advanced state, and when the symptoms have suffered a considerable remission, we may then trust the cure to the expectoration alone. It is not observed that bleeding, during the first days of the disease, stops expectoration; on the contrary, it has been often found to promote it; and it is only in a more advanced state of the disease, when the patient has been already exhausted by large evacuations and a continuance of his illness, that bleeding seems to put a stop to expectoration; and even then, this stoppage seems not to take place so much from the powers of expectoration being weakened by bleeding, as by its favouring the serous effusion in the bronchiae, already taken notice of.\n\nBesides bleeding, every part of the antiphlogistic regimen ought here to be carefully employed: the patient must keep out of bed as much as he can bear; must have plenty of warm diluting drinks, impregnated with vegetable acids, accompanied with nitre or some other cooling neutral salt; and the belly also ought to be kept open by emollient clysters or cooling laxative medicines. Vomiting in the beginning is dangerous; but in a somewhat advanced state of the disease emetics have been found the best means of promoting expectoration. Fomentations and poultices to the pained part have been found useful; but blistering is found to be much more effectual. A blister, however, ought not to be applied till at least one bleeding has been premised, as venefication is less effectual when the irritation of a blister is present. If the disease be moderate, a blister may be applied immediately after the first bleeding; but in violent cases, where it may be presumed that a second bleeding may soon be necessary after the first, it will be proper to delay the blister till after the second bleeding, when it may be supposed that the irritation occasioned by the blister pneumonia will be over before another bleeding becomes necessary. It may frequently be of use in this disease to repeat the blistering; and in that case the plasters should always be applied somewhere on the thorax, for when applied to more distant parts they have less effect. The keeping the blistered parts open, and making what is called a perpetual blister, has much less effect than a repeated blistering.\n\nMany methods have been proposed for promoting expectoration, but none appear to be sufficiently effectual; and some of the expectorants, being acid stimulant substances, are not very safe. The gums usually employed seem to be too heating; the squills less so; but they are not very powerful, and sometimes inconvenient, by the constant nausea they occasion. The volatile alkali may be of service as an expectorant, but it ought to be reserved for an advanced state of the disease. Mucilaginous and oily demulcents appear to be useful, by allaying that acrimony of the mucus which occasions too frequent coughing; and which coughing prevents the stagnation and thickening of the mucus, and thereby its becoming mild. The receiving into the lungs the steams of warm water, impregnated with vinegar, has often proved useful in promoting expectoration; and, for this purpose, the machine called the Inhaler, lately invented by Dr Mudge of Plymouth, promises to be of great service. But of all others, the antimonial emetics, given in nauseating doses, are perhaps the most powerful for promoting expectoration. The kermes mineral has been greatly recommended; but does not seem to be more efficacious than tartarite of antimony or antimonial wine; and the dose of the kermes is much more uncertain than that of the others.\n\nThough this disease often terminates by a spontaneous sweating, this evacuation ought not to be excited by art, unless with much caution. When, after some remission of the symptoms, spontaneous sweats arise, they may be encouraged; but it ought to be without much heat, and without stimulant medicines. If, however, the sweats be partial and clammy only, and a great difficulty of breathing still remain, it will be very dangerous to encourage them.\n\nPhysicians have differed much with regard to the use of opiates in pneumonic affections. It appears, however, that in the beginning of the disease, and before bleeding and blistering have produced some remission of the pain, and of the difficulty of breathing, opiates have had a bad tendency, by their increasing the difficulty of breathing and other inflammatory symptoms. But in a more advanced state of the disease, when the difficulty of breathing has abated, and when the urgent symptom is a cough, proving the chief cause of the continuance of pain and want of rest, opiates may be employed with great advantage and safety. The interruption of the expectoration which they seem to occasion, is for a short time only; and they seem often to promote it, as they occasion a stagnation of what was by frequent coughing dissipated infensibly; and therefore give the appearance of what physicians have called concocted matter.\n\nOpium combined with calomel has of late been highly extolled in this and other inflammatory diseases by Dr Hamilton of Lynn-Regis; who has given a full account\ncount of the success attending his practice with this remedy, for the space of 16 years, in the 9th volume of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries. And since his recommendation, the same remedy has often been employed by others with great benefit.\n\n**Vomica, or Abscesses of the Lungs.**\n\n*Vomica, Boerh. 835.* *Junck. 35.*\n\nPleurodyne vomica, *Sauv. sp. 21.*\n\nPhthisis sometimes follows pneumonia, though the case is not frequent. The symptoms of it so much resemble ordinary phthisis, that it can most properly be treated under that head.\n\n**Empyema.**\n\nThis is another consequence of a pneumonia terminating unfavourably, and is occasioned by the effusion of a quantity of purulent matter into the cavity of the thorax, producing a lingering and painful disorder, very often incurable.\n\n**Description.** The first sign of an empyema is a sensation of the pain in the breast, which before was continual; this is followed by a sensation of weight on the diaphragm; and a fluctuation of matter, sometimes making a noise that may be heard by the bystanders; the acute fever is changed into a hectic, with an exacerbation at night; a continual and troublesome dry cough remains. The respiration is exceedingly difficult, because the lungs are prevented by the matter from fully expanding themselves. The patient can lie easily on that side where the matter is effused, but not on the other, because then the weight of the matter on the mediastinum produces uneasiness. The more the hectic heat is augmented, the more is the body emaciated, and its strength decayed. In some there is danger of suffocation when they lie down, which goes off when they alter that posture of the body; and in some there is a purulent spitting.—These symptoms are accompanied with great anxiety, palpitations of the heart, and faintings. Sometimes the patients have a sensation like a hot vapour ascending from the cavity of the thorax to their mouth. Others, in a more advanced state of the disease, have a putrid taste in the mouth. At the same time, profuse night sweats waste the body, and greatly weaken the patient. The face at first grows red on that side where the matter lies, at last the Hippocratic face comes on, and the eyes become hollow. The pulse is quick, but more frequently intermittent. Sometimes the nails are crooked, and pustules appear on the thorax; and frequently, according to the testimony of Hippocrates, the feet swell, and, on the affected side of the breast, there is an inflation and swelling of the skin.\n\n**Causes, &c.** An empyema may arise either from the bursting of a vomica of the lungs, or from a suppuration taking place after the inflammatory stage of pneumonia; or sometimes from a suppuration in the case of a quinify, when the inflammation had extended to the aspera arteria; from whence arises a kind of bloody fistule, and the patients are afflicted with an empyema, unless they die on the 7th day of the disease, according to the observation of Hippocrates. It may arise also from external violence, as wounds of the thorax, &c., blood extravasated, corrupted, or changed into pus.\n\nLike the vomica, it is a rare distemper, but may attack all those subject to pneumonia.\n\n**Prognosis.** Very few recover after an empyema has been once formed, especially if the operation of paracentesis be neglected. After this operation is performed, if a great quantity of bloody fetid pus be discharged, if the fever continue, and if the patient spit up a purulent, pale, frothy, livid, or green matter, with a decay of strength, there is no hope: But when a small quantity of pus, of a white colour, not very fetid, is discharged; when the fever and thirst presently cease, the appetite returns, and faeces of a good consistence are discharged, the strength also returning in some degree; there is then hope of a perfect recovery. If the matter be not dried up in seven weeks' time, the disease readily changes to a fistulous ulcer, which is very difficult to cure. An empyema affecting both sides of the thorax is more dangerous than that which affects only one.\n\n**Cure.** This consists in evacuating the purulent matter contained in the cavity of the thorax, which is best done by the operation of paracentesis of the thorax. See Surgery. Afterwards the ulcer is to be treated with abfertent and consolidating medicines, and the same internal ones are to be given as in a Phthisis.\n\n---\n\n**GENUS XIII.

On dissection, the heart and pericardium are found very much inflamed, and even ulcerated, with many polypous concretions.\n\n**Causes, &c.** The same as in the pneumonia.\n\n**Prognosis.** In the carditis the prognosis is more unfavourable than in the pneumonia; and indeed, unless the disease very quickly terminates, it must prove fatal, on account of the constant and violent motion of the heart, which exasperates the inflammation, and increases all the symptoms.\n\n**Cure.** Here bleeding is necessary in as great a degree as the patient can possibly bear, together with blistering, and the antiphlogistic regimen likewise carried to a greater height than in the pneumonia; but the general method is the same as in other inflammatory diseases.\n\n---\n\n**GENUS XIV.

The inflammation of the stomach is attended with great heat and pain in the epigastric region, extreme anxiety, an almost continual and painful hiccup, with a most painful vomiting of everything taken into the stomach. Sometimes a temporary madness ensues; and there is an insatiate in the Edinburgh Medical Essays of the disorder being attended with an hydrophobia. The pulse is generally more sunk than in other inflammations, and the fever inclines to the nature of a typhus. The disorder is commonly of the remitting kind, and during the remissions the pulse frequently intermitt. During the height of the disease, a mortal phrenzy frequently supervenes. The disease terminates on the fourth, seventh, or ninth day, or from the eleventh to the fifteenth; and is more apt to end in a gangrene than pneumonic inflammations, and more frequently in a scirrhus than in an abscess.\n\nCauses, &c. The inflammation of the stomach may arise from any acrid substance taken into it; from a vehement passion, too large draughts of cold liquor, especially when the person is very hot; from a surfeit; a stoppage of perspiration; repulsion of the gout; inflammations of the neighbouring viscera; or from external injuries, such as wounds, contusions, &c.—It affects chiefly those of a plethoric habit and hot bilious constitution.\n\nPrognosis. This disease is always very dangerous, and the prognosis doubtful, which also must always be in proportion to the severity of the symptoms. A cessation of pain, coldness about the praecordia, great debility, with a languid and intermittent pulse, with an abatement of the hiccup, denote a gangrene and speedy death. From the sensibility of the stomach also, and its great connexion with the rest of the system, it must be obvious, that an inflammation of it, by whatever causes produced, may be attended with fatal consequences; particularly, by the great debility it produces, it may prove suddenly fatal, without running through the usual course of inflammations.—Its tendency to admit of resolution may be known by its having arisen from no violent cause, by the moderate state of the symptoms, and by a gradual remission of these symptoms in the course of the first or at most of the second week of the disease. The tendency to gangrene may be suspected from the symptoms continuing with unremitting violence, notwithstanding the use of proper remedies; and a gangrene already begun may be known by the symptoms above mentioned, particularly great debility and sudden cessation of pain. The tendency to suppuration may be known by the symptoms continuing but in a moderate degree for more than one or two weeks, and by a considerable remission of the pain, while a sense of weight and anxiety still remain. When an abscess has been formed, the frequency of the pulse is first abated; but soon after it increases, with frequent cold shivering, and an exacerbation in the afternoon and evening; followed by night sweats, and other symptoms of hectic fever. These at length prove fatal, unless the abscess opens into the cavity of the stomach, the pus be evacuated by vomiting, and the ulcer soon healed.\n\nCure. It appears from dissections, that the stomach may very often be inflamed when the characteristic marks of it have not appeared; and therefore we are often exposed to much uncertainty in the cure. But when we have sufficient evidence that a state of active inflammation has taken place in the stomach, the principal object to be aimed at is to obtain a resolution. Before, however, this can be accomplished, it will often be necessary to employ measures with the view of obviating urgent symptoms. When the symptoms appear in the manner above described, the cure is to be attempted by large and repeated bleedings employed early in the disease; and from these we are not to be deterred by the weakness of the pulse, for it will commonly become fuller and softer after the operation. A blister ought also to be applied to the region of the stomach; and the cure will be assisted by fomentations of the whole abdomen, and by frequent emollient and laxative clysters. The irritability of the stomach in this disease will admit of no medicines being thrown into it; and if any can be supposed necessary, they must be exhibited in clysters. Diluting drinks may be tried; but they must be of the very mildest kind, and given in very small quantities at a time. Opiates, in whatever manner exhibited, cannot be retained in the stomach during the first days of the disease; but when the violence of the disease shall have abated, and when the pain and vomiting recur at intervals only, opiates give in clysters are frequently employed with advantage; and after bleeding and blisters, no remedy is more effectual either in allaying the pain or vomiting. As soon as the stomach will retain any laxative, gentle refrigerant cathartics, taken by the mouth, such as the soda phosphorata, soda tartarifata, or the like, are\nPractice:\n\nPhlema are productive of great benefit. A tendency to gangrene in this disease is to be obviated only by the means just now mentioned; but when it does actually supervene, it admits of no remedy. A tendency to suppuration is to be obviated by the same means employed early in the disease. After a certain period it cannot be prevented by any means whatever; and, when actually begun, must be left to nature; the only thing that can be done by art being to avoid all irritation.\n\nB. Gastritis Erysipelatosa, or the Erysipelatous Gastritis.\n\nDescription. This species of inflammation takes place in the stomach much more frequently than the former. From dissections it appears that the stomach has been often affected with inflammation, when neither pain nor fever had given any notice of it; and such is justly looked upon to have been of the erysipelas kind. This kind of inflammation also is especially to be expected from acrimony of any kind applied to the stomach; and would certainly occur much more frequently, were not the interior surface of this organ commonly defended by mucus exuding in large quantity from the numerous follicles placed immediately under the villous coat. On many occasions, however, the exudation of mucus is prevented, or the liquid poured out is of a less viscid kind, so as to be less fitted to defend the subjacent nerves; and it is in such cases that acid matters may readily produce an erysipelas affection of the stomach.\n\nIn many cases this kind of inflammation cannot be discovered, as it takes place without pain, pyrexia, or vomiting: but in some it may; namely, when it spreads into the oesophagus, and appears on the pharynx and on the whole internal surface of the mouth. When therefore an erysipelas inflammation affects the mouth and fauces, and there shall be at the same time in the stomach an unusual sensibility to all acids, and also a frequent vomiting, there can be little doubt of the stomach's being affected in the same manner. Even when no inflammation appears in the fauces, if some degree of pain be felt in the stomach, if there be a want of appetite, an anxiety and frequent vomiting, an unusual sensibility with regard to acids, some thirst, and frequency of pulse, there will then be room to suspect an inflammation in the stomach; and such symptoms, after some time, have been known to discover their cause by the inflammation rising to the fauces or mouth. Inflammation of this kind is often disposed to pass from one place to another on the same surface, and, in doing so, to leave the place it had at first occupied. Such an inflammation has been known to spread successively along the whole tract of the alimentary canal; occasioning, when in the intestines, diarrhoea, and in the stomach vomitings; the diarrhoea ceasing when the vomitings came on, and the vomitings on the coming on of the diarrhoea.\n\nCauses, &c. An erysipelas inflammation may arise from acid matters taken into the stomach; or from some internal causes not yet well known. It frequently occurs in putrid diseases, and in those recovering from fevers.\n\nCure. When the disease is occasioned by acid matters taken internally, and these may be supposed still present in the stomach, they are to be washed out by drinking a large quantity of warm and mild medicines, and exciting gentle vomiting. At the same time, if the nature of the acrimony and its proper corrector be known, this should be thrown in; or if a specific corrector be not known, some general demulcents should be employed.\n\nThese measures, however, are more suited to prevent than to cure inflammation after it has taken place. When this last may be supposed to have happened, if it be attended with a sense of heat, with pain and pyrexia, according to the degree of these symptoms, the measures proposed for the cure of the other kind are to be more or less employed. When an erysipelas inflammation of the stomach has arisen from internal causes, if pain and pyrexia occur, bleeding may be employed in persons not otherwise weakened; but in case of its occurring in putrid diseases, or where the patients are already debilitated, bleeding is inadmissible; all that can be done being to avoid irritation, and only throwing into the stomach what quantity of acids and acetic aliments it shall be found able to bear. In some conditions of the body in which this disease is apt to occur, cinchona and bitters may seem to be indicated; but an erysipelas state of the stomach with seldom allow them to be used.\n\nGenus XVI.

Enteritis Phlegmonodema, or the Acute Enteritis.\n\nEnteritis illaca, Sauv. sp. 1.\n\nEnteritis colica, Sauv. sp. 2. Boerh. 963.\n\nDescription. This disease shows itself by a fixed pain in the abdomen, attended with fever, vomiting, and costiveness. The pain is often felt in different parts of the abdomen, but more frequently spreads over the whole, and is particularly violent about the navel.\n\nCauses, &c. Inflammations of the intestines may arise from the same causes as those of the stomach; though commonly the former will more readily occur from cold applied to the lower extremities, or to the belly itself. It is also found supervening on the spasmodic colic, incarcerated hernia, and volvulus.\n\nPrognosis. Inflammations of the intestines have the same terminations with those of the stomach, and the prognosis in both cases is much the same.\n\nCure. The cure of enteritis is in general the same with that of gastritis; but in this disease there is commonly more opportunity for the introduction of liquids, of acid, acetic, and other cooling remedies, and even of laxatives; but as a vomiting frequently attends the enteritis, care must be taken not to excite that vomiting by the quantity or quality of anything thrown into the stomach. With regard to the suppuration\nration and gangrene of the intestines following the enteritis, the observations made respecting these terminations of gastritis are equally applicable in this disease.\n\nSp. II. ENTERITIS ERYSPILATOSA, or Erysipelatous Enteritis.\n\nConcerning this nothing farther can be said, than what hath been already delivered concerning the gastritis.\n\nGENUS XVII. HEPATITIS.\n\nInflammation of the Liver.\n\nHepatitis, Sauv. gen. 113. Lin. 35. Vog. 58. Sag. gen. 312. Boerh. 914. Hoffm. ii. 14. Junck. 66.\n\nDescription. The inflammation of the liver is thought to be of two kinds, acute and chronic; but the latter very often does not discover itself except by an abscess found in the liver after death, and which is supposed to have been occasioned by some degree of inflammation; for this reason the chronic inflammation often eludes observation, and we shall here only treat of the acute hepatitis.\n\nThe acute hepatitis is attended with considerable fever; a frequent, strong, and hard pulse; high coloured urine; an acute pain in the right hypochondrium, increased by pressing upon the part. The pain is very often in such a part of the side as to make it appear like a pleurisy; and frequently, like that, is increased on inspiration. The disease is also commonly attended with a cough, which is generally dry, though sometimes moist; and when the pain thus resembles a pleurisy, the patient cannot lie easily except upon the side affected. The pain is frequently extended to the clavicle, and to the top of the shoulder; and is attended sometimes with hiccupping, and sometimes with vomiting. Some have added jaundice, or a yellowness of the eyes, to the symptoms of this distemper; but experience shows that it has often occurred without any such symptom.\n\nWhen hepatitis is of the chronic kind, depending more on an accumulation and effusion in the liver, than on an increased action of its small vessels, the patient complains rather of a sense of weight than of pain; and the fever is by no means either acute or constant: but it often returns in paroxysms somewhat resembling the attacks of an intermittent. This disease is very slow in its progress, frequently continuing for many months, and at last terminating in a very considerable suppuration. In most cases, however, it may be discovered by careful examination of the region of the liver externally. By this means, a considerable enlargement of that viscus may in general be detected.\n\nCauses, &c. The remote causes of hepatitis are not always to be discerned, and many have been assigned on a very uncertain foundation. It is principally a disease of warm climates. It has been supposed that the disease may be an affection either of the extremities of the hepatic artery, or those of the vena portarum; and the supposition is by no means improbable. The opinion, however, most commonly adopted is, that the acute hepatitis is an affection of the external membrane of the liver, and the chronic kind an affection of the parenchyma of that viscus. The acute Hepatitis disease may be seated either on the convex or concave surface of the liver; and in the former case a more pungent pain and hiccupping may be produced, and the respiration is more considerably affected. In the latter there occurs less pain; and a vomiting is produced, commonly by some inflammation communicated to the stomach. The inflammation on the concave surface of the liver may be readily communicated to the gall-bladder and biliary ducts; and this, perhaps, is the only case of idiopathic hepatitis attended with jaundice.\n\nPrognosis. The inflammation of the liver, like others, may end by resolution, suppuration, or gangrene; and the tendency to the one or to the other of those events may be known from what has been already mentioned concerning the prognosis in gastritis. The resolution of hepatitis is often the consequence of, or is attended with, evacuations of different kinds. A haemorrhage sometimes from the nose, and sometimes from the hemorrhoidal vessels, gives a solution of the disease. Sometimes the same thing is accomplished by a bilious diarrhoea; and sometimes the resolution is attended with sweating, and an evacuation of urine depositing a copious sediment. Sometimes it may be cured by an erysipelas appearing in some external part. When the disease has ended in suppuration, the pus collected may be discharged by the biliary ducts; or, if the suppurated part does not adhere anywhere closely to the neighbouring parts, it may be discharged into the cavity of the abdomen: but if, during the first state of inflammation, the affected part of the liver shall have formed a close adhesion to some of the neighbouring parts, the discharge after suppuration may be various, according to the different seat of the abscesses. When seated on the convex part of the liver, if the adhesion be to the peritoneum lining the common teguments, the pus may make its way through these, and be discharged outwardly: or if the adhesion shall have been to the diaphragm, the pus may penetrate through this, and into the cells of the lungs; from whence it may be discharged by coughing. When the abscess is seated on the concave part of the liver, in consequence of adhesions, the pus may be discharged into the stomach or intestines; and into these last, either directly, or by the intervention of the biliary ducts. Upon a consideration of all these different circumstances, therefore, together with the general principles of inflammation, must the prognosis of this disease be established.\n\nCare. For the cure of hepatitis, we must have recourse to the general means of resolving other inflammatory disorders. Bleeding is to be used according to the degree of fever and pain. Blistering are to be applied: fomentations of the external parts, emollient clysters, gentle laxatives, diluents and refrigerants, are also useful. The cure, however, particularly in warm climates, where the disease is much more common than it is in Britain, is chiefly trusted to mercury. Not only in cases of the chronic kind, but in acute hepatitis also, after an attempt has been made to alleviate the urgent symptoms by bleeding and blistering, recourse is immediately had to this powerful mineral. It is employed by different practitioners, and\nPhlegma— in different cases, under various forms. Some are very fond of the use of calomel. But the preference is in general given, and perhaps with justice, to friction with mercurial ointment over the region of the liver. But under whatever form it may be employed, it is necessary that it should be introduced to such an extent as to keep the patient on the verge of salivation for some length of time; the duration being regulated by the circumstances of the case.\n\nFrom the liberal use of mercury, there can be no doubt that a successful resolution has been obtained in many cases, which would otherwise have infallibly terminated in suppuration. But notwithstanding the most careful employment of it in some cases, suppuration will ensue; and then it is very doubtful whether any benefit will be derived from the continuance of it. But when a suppuration has been formed, and the abscess points outwardly, the part must be opened, the pus evacuated, and the ulcer healed according to the ordinary methods in use for healing abscesses and ulcers in other parts.\n\nChronic hepatitis often terminates in scirrhus. Against this, after mercury has failed, nitric acid taken internally has sometimes been employed with success.\n\nGENUS XVIII. SPLENITIS.\n\nInflammation of the Spleen.\n\nSplenitis, Sauv. gen. 114, Lin. 36, Vog. 59.\nJunck. 67, Sag. gen. 313.\nLienis inflammatio, Boerh. 958. et Van Swieten, Comm.\nSplenitis phlegmonodæa, Sauv. sp. 1. Foreß, l. xx. obi. 5, 6. De Haen, apud Van Swieten, p. 958.\nPleuritis splenica, Sauv. sp. 19.\nSplenalgia suppuratoria, Sauv. sp. 3.\n\nDescription. This disease, according to Juncker, comes on with a remarkable shivering, succeeded by a most intense heat and very great thirst; a pain and tumour are perceived in the left hypochondrium, and the paroxysms for the most part assume a quartan form. When the patients expose themselves for a little to the free air, their extremities immediately grow very cold. If a hemorrhage happens, the blood flows out of the left nostril. The other symptoms are the same with those of the hepatitis. Like the liver, the spleen is also subject to a chronic inflammation, which often happens after agues; and the tumour which succeeds the inflammation is in many cases very considerable, and is called theague cake, though that name is also frequently given to a scirrhus tumour of the liver succeeding intermittents.\n\nCauses, &c. The causes of this distemper are in general the same with those of other inflammatory disorders; but those which determine the inflammation to that particular part more than another, are very much unknown. It attacks persons of a very plethoric and sanguine habit of body rather than others.\n\nPrognosis. What has been said of the inflammation of the liver applies also to that of the spleen, though the latter is less dangerous than the former. Here also a vomiting of black matter, which in other acute cases is such a fatal symptom, sometimes proves critical, according to the testimony of Juncker. Sometimes the hemorrhoids prove critical; but very often the inflammation terminates by scirrhus.\n\nCure. This is not at all different from what has been already laid down concerning the hepatitis.\n\nGENUS XIX. NEPHRITIS.\n\nInflammation of the Kidneys.\n\nNephritis, Sauv. gen. 115. Lin. 37. Vog. 65.\nSag. gen. 314.\nNephritis vera, Sauv. sp. 1.\n\nDescription. The nephritis has the same symptoms which take place in other inflammations; but its distinguishing mark is the pain in the region of the kidney, which is sometimes obtuse, but more frequently pungent. The pain is not increased by the motion of the trunk of the body so much as a pain of the rheumatic kind affecting the same region. It may also frequently be distinguished by the pain shooting along the course of the ureter, and it is often attended with a drawing up of the testicle, and a numbness of the limb on the side affected; though indeed these symptoms most commonly attend the inflammation arising from a calculus in the kidney or ureter. The disease is also attended with frequent vomiting, and often with colic pains and colic pains. The urine is most commonly of a deep red colour, and is voided frequently and in a small quantity at a time. In more violent cases the urine is commonly colourless.\n\nCauses, &c. The remote causes of this disease may be various; as external contusion, violent or long-continued riding; strains of the muscles of the back incumbent on the kidneys; various acids in the course of circulation conveyed to the kidneys; and perhaps some other internal causes not yet well known: the most frequent is that of calculous matter obstructing the tubuli uriniferi, or calculi formed in the pelvis of the kidneys, and either sticking there or falling into the ureter.\n\nPrognosis. This is not different from that of other inflammatory diseases.\n\nCure. When any of those causes operating as inducing the inflammation still continue to act, the first object in the cure must be the removal of these; but the principal intention to be had in view, is the resolution of the inflammation which has already taken place. But when, notwithstanding efforts for this purpose, the disease terminates in suppuration, it must be the endeavour of the practitioner to promote the discharge of purulent matter, and the healing of the ulceration in the kidney.\n\nThese different objects are principally accomplished by bleeding, external fomentation, frequent emollient clysters, antiphlogistic purgatives, and by the free use of mild and demulcent liquids. The use of blisters is scarcely admissible, or at least will require great care to avoid any considerable absorption of the cantharides.\n\nThe other species of nephritis enumerated by authors are only symptomatic.\nGENUS XX. CYSTITIS.\n\nInflammation of the Bladder.\n\nCyflitis, Sauv. gen. 108. Lin. 31. Vog. 66. Sag. gen. 309.\nInflammatio vesicæ, Hoffm. ii. 157.\n\nThe Cystitis from Internal Causes.\n\nCyflitis spontanea, Sauv. sp. 1.\n\nThe Cystitis from External Causes.\n\nCyflitis à cantharidibus, Sauv. sp. 2.\nCyflitis traumatica, Sauv. sp. 3.\n\nThe inflammation of the bladder from internal causes is a very rare distemper; and when it does at any time occur, is to be cured in the same manner with other inflammations, avoiding only the use of blisters. When the disease arises from the internal use of these flies, camphor is recommended, besides other cooling medicines, and particularly cooling and emollient clysters.\n\nGENUS XXI. HYSTERITIS.\n\nInflammation of the Uterus.\n\nHysteritis, Lin. 38. Vog. 63.\nMetritis, Sauv. gen. 107, Sag. gen. 315.\nInflammatio et febris uterina, Hoffm. II. 156.\n\nDescription. This disease is often confounded with that called the puerperal or child-bed fever; but is essentially distinct from it, as will be shown in its proper place. The inflammation of the uterus is often apt to terminate by gangrene: there is a pain in the head, with delirium; and the uterine region is so exceedingly tender, that it cannot bear the most gentle pressure without intolerable pain. When the fundus uteri is inflamed, there is great heat, throbbing, and pain, above the pubes; if its posterior part, the pain is more confined to the loins and rectum, with a tenesmus; if its anterior part, it flows from thence towards the neck of the bladder, and is attended with a frequent irritation to make water, which is voided with difficulty; and if its sides or the ovaria are affected, the pains will then dart into the inside of the thighs.\n\nCauses, &c. Inflammations of the uterus, and indeed of the rest of the abdominal viscera, are very apt to take place in child-bed women; the reason of which seems to be the sudden change produced in the habit, and an alteration in the course of the circulating blood by the contraction of the uterus after delivery. The prelude of the gravid uterus being suddenly taken off from the aorta descendens after delivery, the resistance to the impulse of the blood passing through all the vessels derived from it, and distributed to the contiguous viscera, will be considerably lessened: it will therefore rush into those vessels with a force superior to their resistance; and, by putting them violently on the stretch, may occasion pain, inflammation, and fever. This contraction of the uterus also renders its vessels impervious to the blood which had freely passed through them for the service of the child during pregnancy; and consequently a much larger quantity will be thrown upon the contiguous parts, which will still add to their distention, and increase their tendency to inflammation.\n\nPrognosis. An inflammation of the uterus may in general be expected to produce an obstruction of the lochia; but the fever produced seldom proves fatal, unless the inflammation be violent, and end in a gangrene.\n\nCure. This is to be attempted by the same general means already recommended, and the management of this disorder entirely coincides with that of the puerperal fever.\n\nGENUS XXII.

The rheumatism is particularly distinguished by pains affecting the joints, and for the most part the joints alone; but sometimes also the muscular parts. Very often they shoot along the course of the muscles from one joint to another, and are always much increased by the action of the muscles belonging to the joint or of joints affected. The larger joints are those most frequently affected, such as the hip joint and knees, of the lower extremities, and the shoulders and elbows of the upper ones. The ankles and wrists are also frequently affected; but the smaller joints, such as those of the toes or fingers, seldom suffer. Sometimes the disease is confined to one part of the body, yet very frequently it affects many parts; and then it begins with a cold stage, which is immediately succeeded by the other symptoms of pyrexia, and particularly by a frequent, full, and hard pulse. Sometimes the pyrexia is formed before any pains are perceived; but more commonly pains are felt in particular parts before any symptoms of fever occur. When no pyrexia is present, the pain may be confined to one joint only; but when any considerable pyrexia takes place, though the pain may chiefly be felt in one joint, yet it seldom happens that it does not affect several joints, often at the very same time, but for the most part shifting their place, and having abated in one joint they become more violent in another. They do not commonly remain long in the same joint, but frequently shift from one to another, and sometimes return to joints formerly affected; and in this manner the disease often continues for a long time.\n\nThe fever attending these pains has an exacerbation every evening, and is most considerable during the night, when the pains also become more violent; and it is at the same time that the pains shift their place from one joint to another. These seem to be also increased during the night by the body being covered more closely, and kept warmer.\n\nA joint, after having been for some time affected with pain, commonly becomes also affected with some swelling and redness, which is painful to the touch. It seldom happens that a swelling coming on does not take off the pain entirely, but it rarely secures the joint against a return of it. This disease is commonly attended with more or less sweating, which occurs early, but is seldom free or copious, and seldom proves critical, though it may give temporary relief of the pain. The urine is high-colored, and in the beginning without sediment. This, however, does not prove entirely critical, for the disease often continues long after such a sediment has appeared in the urine. The blood is always fizzy. The acute rheumatism differs from all other inflammatory diseases, in not being liable to terminate in suppuration: this almost never happens; but the disease sometimes produces effusions of a transparent gelatinous fluid into the sheaths of the tendons; but if these effusions be frequent, it is certain that the liquor must often be absorbed; for it very seldom happens, that considerable or permanent tumours have been produced, or such as required to be opened and to have the contained fluid evacuated. Such tumors, however, have sometimes occurred, and the opening made in them has produced ulcers very difficult to heal.\n\nSometimes rheumatism will continue for several weeks; but it seldom proves fatal, and it is rare that the pyrexia continues to be considerable for more than two or three weeks. While the pyrexia abates in its violence, if the pains of the joints continue, they are less violent; more limited in their place, being confined commonly to one or a few joints only; and are less ready to change their place.\n\nIt is often a very difficult matter to distinguish rheumatism from gout: but in rheumatism there in general occurs much less affection of the stomach; it affects chiefly the larger joints, and several of these are often affected with severe pain at the same time; it occurs at an earlier period of life than gout; it is not observed to be hereditary; and it can in general be traced to some obvious exciting cause, particularly to the action of cold.\n\nCauses, &c. This disease is frequent in cold, and more uncommon in warm climates. It appears most frequently in autumn and spring; less frequently in winter, while the frost is constant; and very seldom during the heat of summer. It may, however, occur at any season, if vicissitudes of heat and cold be for the time frequent. For the most part, the acute rheumatism arises from the application of cold to the body when unusually warm; or when the cold is applied to one part of the body, whilst the other parts are kept warm; or lastly, when the application of the cold is long continued, as when moist or wet clothes are applied to any part of the body.—These causes may affect persons of all ages; but the rheumatism seldom appears either in very young or in elderly persons, and most commonly occurs from the age of puberty to that of 35. These causes may also affect persons of any constitution, but they most commonly affect those of a sanguine temperament.\n\nWith respect to the proximate cause of rheumatism, there have been various opinions. It has been imputed to a peculiar acrimony; of which, however, there is no evidence; and the consideration of the remote causes, the symptoms, and cure, render it very improbable. A disease of a rheumatic nature, however, may be occasioned by an acrid matter applied to the nerves, as is evident from the toothache, a rheumatic affection generally arising from a carious tooth. Pains arising from deep-seated suppurations may also resemble the rheumatism; and many cases have occurred in which such suppurations occasioned pains resembling the lumbago and sciatica; but from what has been already said, it seems improbable that ever any pure rheumatic case should end in suppuration.\n\nThe proximate cause of rheumatism has by many been supposed to be a lentor in the fluids obstructing the vessels of the part; but in the observations formerly made, sufficient reasons have been already laid down for rejecting the doctrine of lentor. While we cannot therefore find either evidence or reason for supposing that the rheumatism depends on any change in the state of the fluids, we must conclude that the proximate cause of it is the same with that of other inflammations not depending upon a direct stimulus.\nIn the case of rheumatism, it is supposed that the most common remote cause of it, that is, cold applied, operates especially on the vessels of the joints, these being less covered by a cellular texture than those of the intermediate parts of the limbs. It is further supposed, that the application of cold produces a constriction of the extreme vessels, and at the same time an increase of tone or phlogistic diathesis in the course of them, from which arises an increased impetus of the blood, and at the same time a resistance to the free passage of it, and consequently inflammation and pain. It is also supposed, that the resistance formed excites the vis medicatrix to a further increase of the impetus of the blood; and to support this, a cold stage arises, a spasm is formed, and a pyrexia and phlogistic diathesis are produced in the whole system.\n\nHence the cause of rheumatism appears to be exactly analogous to that of inflammations depending on an increased influx of blood to a part while it is exposed to the action of cold. But there seems to be further in this disease some peculiar affection of the muscular fibres. These seem to be under some degree of rigidity; and therefore less easily admit of motion, and are pained upon the exertions of it. This also seems to be the affection which gives opportunity to the propagation of pains from one joint to another, and which are most severely felt in the extremities terminating in the joints, because beyond these the oscillations are not propagated. This affection of the muscular fibres explains the manner in which strains and spasms produce rheumatic affections; and, on the whole, shows, that with an inflammatory affection of the sanguineous system, there is also in rheumatism a peculiar affection of the muscular fibres, which has a considerable share in producing the phenomena of the disease. And it would even appear, that in what has commonly been called acute rheumatism, in contradiction to the chronic, of which we are next to treat, there exists not only a state of active inflammation in the affected parts, but also of peculiar irritability; and that this often remains after the inflammation is very much diminished or has even entirely ceased. Hence a renewal of the inflammation and recurrence of the pain take place from very slight causes; and in the treatment of the disease both the state of inflammation and irritability must be had in view.\n\nCure. For counteracting the state of active inflammation, the chief aim of the practitioner must be to diminish the general impetus of the circulation, and the impetus at the part particularly affected. For counteracting the state of irritability, he must endeavour to remove the disposition to increased action in the vessels; to prevent the action of causes exciting painful sensations; and to obviate their influence on the part. The cure therefore requires, in the first place, an antiphlogistic regimen, and particularly a total abstinence from animal food, and from all fermented or spirituous liquors; substituting a mild vegetable or milk diet, and the plentiful use of soft diluting liquors. On this principle also, blood-letting is the chief remedy of acute rheumatism. The blood is to be drawn in large quantity; and the bleeding is to be repeated in proportion to the frequency, fulness, and hardness of the pulse, and the violence of the pain. For the most part, large and repeated bleedings during the first days of the disease seem to be necessary, and accordingly have been very much employed; but to this some bounds are to be set; for very profuse bleedings occasion a slow recovery, and are ready to produce a chronic rheumatism.\n\nTo avoid that debility of the system which general bleedings are apt to occasion, the urgent symptom of pain may be often relieved by topical bleedings; and when any swelling or redness has come upon a joint, the pain may very certainly be relieved by this evacuation: but as the pain and continuance of the disease seem to depend more upon the phlogistic diathesis of the whole system than upon the affection of particular parts, so topical bleedings will not supply the place of the general bleedings proposed above in most instances.\n\nTo take off the phlogistic diathesis prevailing in this disease, purging may be useful, if procured by medicines which do not stimulate the whole system, as neutral salts, and other medicines which have a refrigerant power. Purging, however, is not so useful as bleeding in removing the phlogistic diathesis; and when the disease has become general and violent, frequent stools are inconvenient, and even hurtful, by the motion and pain which they occasion.\n\nNext to blood-letting, nothing is of so much service, both in alleviating the pains in this disease and in removing the phlogistic diathesis, as the use of sudorifics: and of all the medicines belonging to this class, what has commonly been known by the name of Dover's powder, a combination of powder of ipecacuan and opium, is the most convenient and the most effectual. Copious sweating, excited by this medicine, and supported for 10 or 12 hours by tepid diluents, such as decoction of the woods, or the like, will in most instances produce a complete remission of the pain; and by this practice, combined with blood-letting and proper regimen, the disease may often be entirely removed.\n\nIf, however, after complete intermissions from pain for some length of time have been obtained by these means, it be found that there is a great tendency to a return of the pains without any obvious cause, recourse may be had with very great benefit to the use of the Peruvian bark. By the early use of this, where a complete intermission from pain is obtained, the necessity of repeated blood-letting and sweating is often superfluous; but where a complete remission cannot be obtained, it has been suspected by some to be hurtful: and in these cases, when blood-letting and sudorifics have been pulsed as far as may be thought prudent, without being productive of the desired effect, very great benefit is often derived from the use of calomel combined with opium, as recommended in the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, by Dr Hamilton of Lynn-Regis.\n\nIn this disease, external applications are of little service. Fomentations in the beginning of the disease rather aggravate than relieve the pains. The rubefacients and camphire are more effectual; but they commonly only move them from one part to another, and do not prove any cure of the general affection. Blistering may also be very effectual in removing the pain.\nPractice.\n\nPhlegma fixe.\n\nPain from a particular part; but will be of little use, except where the pains are much confined to one place.\n\n**ARTHRODYNAIA, or Chronic Rheumatism.**\n\n*Rheumatismus chronicus Auctorum.*\n\n**Description.** When the pyrexia attending the acute rheumatism has ceased; when the swelling and redness of the joints are entirely gone, but pains still continue to affect certain joints, which remain stiff, feel uneasy upon motion, changes of weather, or in the night time only, the disease is then called the *chronic rheumatism*, as it often continues for a very long time.\n\nThe limits between the acute and chronic rheumatisms are not always exactly marked. When the pains are still ready to shift their place; when they are especially severe in the night time; when, at the same time, they are attended with some degree of pyrexia, and with some swelling, and especially some redness of the joints; the disease is to be considered as partaking of the nature of the acute rheumatism. But when there is no longer any degree of pyrexia remaining; when the pained joints are without redness; when they are cold and stiff; when they cannot easily be made to sweat; or when, while a free and warm sweat is brought out on the rest of the body, it is only clammy and cold on the pained joints; and, when, further, the pains of these are increased by cold, and relieved by heat, applied to them; the case is to be considered as that of a purely chronic rheumatism: or perhaps more properly the first of the conditions now described may be termed the state of irritability, and the second the state of atony.\n\nThe chronic rheumatism, or rather the atonic, may affect different joints; but is especially apt to affect those which are surrounded with many muscles, and those of which the muscles are employed in the most constant and vigorous exertions. Such is the case of the vertebrae of the loins, the affection of which is named *lumbago*; or of the hip-joint, when the disease is named *ischias* or *sciatica*.\n\nViolent strains and spasms occurring on sudden and somewhat violent exertions, bring on rheumatic affections, which at first partake of the acute, but very soon change into the nature of the chronic, rheumatism.—Such are frequently the lumbago, and other affections, which seem to be more seated in the muscles than in the joints. The distinction of the rheumatic pains from those resembling them which occur in the syphilis and scurvy must be obvious, either from the seat of the pains, or from the concomitant symptoms peculiar to those diseases. The distinction of the rheumatism from the gout will be more fully underflood from what is laid down under the genus Podagra.\n\n**Cautles, &c.** The phenomena of the purely chronic rheumatism lead us to conclude, that its proximate cause is an atony both of the blood-vessels and of the muscular fibres of the part affected, together with such a degree of rigidity and contraction in the latter as frequently attend them in a state of atony: and indeed this atony, carried to a certain extent, gives rise to a state of paralysis, with an almost total loss of motion in the affected limbs. The paralytic state of rheumatism therefore may be pointed out as a fourth condition of the disease, often claiming the attention of the practitioner.\n\n**Cure.** From the view just now given of the proximate cause of chronic rheumatism, the chief indication of cure must be, to restore the activity and vigour of the part, which is principally to be done by increasing the tone of the moving fibres, but which may sometimes also be aided by giving condensation to the simple fluid. When, however, the disease has degenerated into the state of paralysis, the objects to be aimed at are, the restoration of a due condition to the nervous energy in the part affected; the obtaining free circulation of blood through the vessels of the part; and the removal of rigidity in membranes and ligaments.\n\nFor answering these purposes, a great variety of remedies, both external and internal, are had recourse to. The chief of the external are, the supporting the heat of the part, by keeping it constantly covered with flannel; the increasing the heat of the part by external heat, applied either in a dry or humid form; the diligent use of the flesh-brush, or other means of friction; the application of electricity in sparks or shocks; the application of cold water by affusion or immersion; the application of essential oils of the most warm and penetrating kind; the application of salt brine; the employment of the warm bath or of the vapour baths, either to the body in general or to particular parts; and, lastly, the employment either of exercise of the part itself as far as it can easily bear, or by riding or other modes of gymnastic.\n\nThe internal remedies are, large doses of essential oils drawn from resinous substances, such as turpentine; substances containing such oils, as guaiac; volatile alkaline salts, &c. These or other medicines are directed to procure sweat; and calomel, or some other preparation of mercury, in small doses, may be continued for some time. But of all the remedies which have been found useful in atonic rheumatism, perhaps the best is cinchona. It is particularly serviceable in the earlier periods of the disease. It has often been highly efficacious in preventing the degeneracy of the inflammatory into the atonic state of the disease; and by some practitioners, particularly Dr Haygarth of Bath, it has been highly extolled in acute rheumatism. Besides these, there are several other remedies recommended. The eucata, aconitum, and hyoscyamus, have in particular been highly extolled; and an infusion of the rhododendron chrysanthum is said to be employed by the Siberians with very great success. An account of the Siberian mode of practice is given by Dr Matthew Guthrie of Petersburgh, in the fifth volume of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, and has been followed with success at other places. Among other internal remedies for rheumatism, the use of arsenic has of late been recommended by Dr Bardley of Liverpool. It is advised to be given under the form of the mineral solution, proposed by Dr Fowler as a remedy in intermittent fever and in periodic headaches. Under this form, it is now ascertained by extensive experience that arsenic may be taken internally with as much safety as any other active medicine; and in some cases of rheumatism in which it has been employed at Edinburgh, there is reason to believe that it has been productive of benefit.\nGENUS XXIII.

This well known disease makes its attack by a most violent pain in the teeth, most frequently in the molars, more rarely in the incisors, reaching sometimes up to the eyes, and sometimes backward into the cavity of the ear. At the same time there is a manifest determination to the head; and a remarkable tension and inflation of the vessels takes place, not only in the parts next to that where the pain is seated, but over the whole head.\n\nCauses, &c. The toothache is sometimes merely a rheumatic affection, arising from cold, but more frequently from a carious tooth. It is also a symptom of pregnancy, and takes place in some nervous disorders; it may attack persons at any time of life, though it is most frequent in the young and plethoric.\n\nCure. Many empirical remedies have been proposed for the cure of the toothache, but none have in any degree answered the purpose. When the affection is purely rheumatic, blistering behind the ear will almost always remove it; but when it proceeds from a carious tooth, the pain is much more obstinate. In this case it has been recommended to touch the pained part with a hot iron, or with sulphuric acid, in order to destroy the aching nerve; to hold strong spirits in the mouth; to put a drop of oil of cloves into the hollow of the tooth, or a pill of equal parts of opium and camphor; but one of the most useful applications of this kind is strong nitrous acid, diluted with three or four times its weight of spirit of wine, and introduced into the hollow of a tooth from which great pain arises, either by means of a hair pencil or a little cotton. Cinchona has also been recommended, and perhaps with more justice, on account of its tonic and antiseptic powers; but very often all these remedies will fail, and the only infallible cure is the extraction of the tooth.

The Retrocedent Gout.\n\nSp. IV. The Misplaced Gout.\n\nDescription. What we call a paroxysm of the gout is principally constituted by an inflammatory affection of some of the joints. This sometimes comes on suddenly, without any warning, but is generally preceded by several symptoms; such as the ceasing of a sweating which the feet had been commonly before affected with; an unusual coldness of the feet and legs; a frequent numbness, alternating with a sense of prickling along the whole of the lower extremities; frequent cramps of the muscles of the legs; and an unusual turbulence of the veins.\n\nWhile these symptoms take place in the lower extremities, the body is affected with some degree of torpor and languor, and the functions of the stomach in particular are more or less disturbed. The appetite is diminished; and flatulency, or other symptoms of indigestion, are felt. These symptoms take place for several days, sometimes for a week or two, before a paroxysm comes on; but commonly, upon the day immediately preceding it, the appetite becomes keener than usual.\n\nThe circumstances of paroxysms are chiefly the following. They come on most commonly in the spring, and sooner or later according as the vernal heat succeeds sooner or later to the winter's cold, and, perhaps, sooner or later also, according as the body may happen to be more or less exposed to vicissitudes of heat and cold.\n\nThe attacks are sometimes felt first in the evening, but more commonly about two or three o'clock in the morning. The paroxysm begins with a pain affecting one foot, most frequently in the ball or first joint of the great toe, but sometimes in other parts of the foot. With the attack of this pain, there is commonly more or less of a cold shivering; which, as the pain increases, gradually ceases; and is succeeded by a hot stage of pyrexia, which continues for the same time with the pain itself. From the first attack, the pain becomes, by degrees, more violent, and continues in this state with great reflexions of the whole body till next midnight, after which it gradually relieves; and, after it has continued for twenty-four hours from the commencement of the first attack, it commonly ceases almost entirely; and, with the coming on of a gentle sweat, allows the patient to fall asleep. The patient, upon coming out of this sleep in the morning, finds the pained part affected with some redness and swelling, which, after having continued for some days, gradually abates.\n\nWhen a paroxysm has thus come on, although the violent pain after 24 hours be considerably abated, the patient is not entirely relieved from it. For some days...\ndays he has every evening a return of more considerable pain and pyrexia, and these continue with more or less violence till morning. After going on, in this manner, for several days, the disease sometimes goes entirely off, not to return till after a long interval.\n\nWhen the disease, after having thus remained for some time in a joint, ceases entirely, it generally leaves the person in very perfect health, enjoying greater ease and alacrity in the functions of both body and mind than he had for a long time before experienced.\n\nAt the beginning of the disease, the returns of it are sometimes only once in three or four years; but as it advances, the intervals become shorter, and at length the attacks are annual; afterwards they come twice each year; and at length recur several times during the course of autumn, winter, and spring; and as, when the fits are frequent, the paroxysms become also longer, so, in the advanced state of the disease, the patient is hardly ever tolerably free from it, except perhaps for two or three months in summer.\n\nThe progress of the disease is also marked by the parts which it affects. At first, it commonly affects one foot only; afterwards every paroxysm affects both feet, the one after the other; and as the disease proceeds, it not only affects both feet at once, but, after having ceased in the foot which was last attacked, returns again into the first, and perhaps a second time also into the other. Its changes of places are not only from one foot to another, but from the feet into other joints, especially those of the upper extremities; so that there is hardly a joint of the body which, on one occasion or another, is not affected. It sometimes affects two different joints at the very same time; but more commonly it is at any one time severe in a single joint only, and passes in succession from one joint to another; so that the patient's affliction is often protracted for a long time.\n\nWhen the disease has often returned, and the paroxysms have become very frequent, the pains are commonly less violent than they were at first; but the patient is more affected with sickness, and the other symptoms of the atomic gout, which shall be hereafter mentioned.\n\nAfter the first paroxysm of the disease, the joints which have been affected are entirely restored to their former suppleness and strength; but after the disease has recurred very often, the joints affected do neither so suddenly nor entirely recover their former state, but continue weak and stiff; and these effects at length proceed to such a degree, that the joints lose their motion entirely.\n\nIn many persons, but not in all, after the disease has frequently recurred, concretions of a chalky nature are formed upon the outside of the joints, and for the most part immediately under the skin. The matter seems to be deposited at first in a fluid form, afterwards becoming dry and firm. In their firm state, these concretions are a hard earthy substance, very entirely soluble in acids. After they have been formed, they contribute, with other circumstances, to destroy the motion of the joint.\n\nIn most persons who have laboured under the gout for many years, a nephritic affection comes on, and discovers itself by all the symptoms which usually attend calculous concretions in the kidneys, and which we shall have occasion to describe in another place.\n\nAll that is necessary to be observed here is, that the nephritic affection alternates with paroxysms of the gout; and that the two affections, the nephritic and the gouty, are hardly ever present at the same time. This also may be observed, that children of gouty or nephritic parents commonly inherit one or other of these diseases; but whether the principal disease of the parent may have been either gout or nephritis alone, some of the children have the one and some the other. In some of them, the nephritic affection occurs alone, without any gout supervening; and this happens to be frequently the case with the female children of gouty parents.\n\nIn the whole of the history already given, we have described the most common form of the disease, and which therefore, however diversified in the progress of it, may be still called the regular state of the gout.—Upon some occasions, however, the disease assumes different appearances: but as we suppose the disease to depend always upon a certain diathesis, or disposition of the system; so every appearance which we can perceive to depend upon that same disposition, we still consider as symptomatic, and view the disease to be a case of the gout. The principal circumstance, in what we term the regular gout, is the inflammatory affection of the joints; and whatever symptoms we can perceive to be connected with, or to depend upon, the disposition which produces that inflammatory affection, but without its taking place or being present at the same time, we name the irregular gout.\n\nOf such irregular gout there are three different states, which may be named the atomic, the retrocedent, and the misplaced gout.\n\nThe first is, when the gouty diathesis prevails in the system; but, from certain causes, does not produce the inflammatory affection of the joints. In this case, the morbid symptoms which appear, are chiefly affections of the stomach, such as loss of appetite, indigestion, and its various attendants of sickness, nausea, vomiting, fulness, acid eructations, and pains in the region of the stomach. These symptoms are frequently accompanied with pains and cramps in several parts of the trunk and the upper extremities of the body, which are relieved by the discharge of wind from the stomach. Together with these affections of the stomach, there commonly occurs a coughing; but sometimes a loofness, with colic pains. These affections of the alimentary canal are often attended with all the symptoms of hypochondriasis, such as dejection of mind, a constant and anxious attention to the slightest feelings, an imaginary aggravation of these, and an apprehension of danger from them.\n\nIn the same atomic gout, the viscera of the thorax also are sometimes affected, and palpitations, faintings, and asthma, occur.\n\nIn the head also occur headaches, giddiness, apoplectic and paralytic affections.\n\nWhen the several symptoms now mentioned occur in habits having the marks of a gouty disposition, this may be suspected to have laid the foundation for them; and especially when either, in such habits, a manifest tendency to the inflammatory affection has formerly appeared, or when the symptoms mentioned are...\nare intermixed with, and are relieved by some degree of the inflammatory gout. In such cases there can be no doubt of conferring the whole as a state of the gout.\n\nAnother state of the disease we name the retrocedent gout. This occurs when an inflammatory state of the joints has, in the usual manner, come on, but without arising to the ordinary degree of pain and inflammation; or at least without these continuing for the usual time, or without their receding gradually in the usual manner; these affections of the joints suddenly and entirely cease, while some internal part becomes affected. The internal part most commonly attacked is the stomach; which then is affected with anxiety, sickness, vomiting, or violent pain; but sometimes the internal part is the heart, which gives occasion to a syncope; sometimes it is the lungs, which are affected with asthma; and sometimes it is the head, giving occasion to apoplexy or palsies. In all these cases there can be no doubt that the symptoms are all a part of the same disease, however different the affection may seem to be in the parts which it attacks.\n\nThe third state of irregular gout, which we name the misplaced, is when the gouty diathesis, instead of producing the inflammatory affection of the joints, produces an inflammatory affection of some internal part, and which appears from the same symptoms that attend the inflammations of those parts arising from other causes.\n\nWhether the gouty diathesis does ever produce such inflammation of the internal parts without having first produced it in the joints, or whether the inflammation of the internal part be always a translation from the joints previously affected, we dare not determine; but, even supposing the latter to be always the case, we think the difference of the affection of the internal part must still distinguish the misplaced from what we have named the retrocedent gout.\n\nWith regard to the misplaced gout, Dr Cullen, whom we here follow, tells us, that he never met with any cases of it in his practice, nor does he find any distinctly marked by practical writers, except that of a pneumonic inflammation.\n\nThere are two cases of a translated gout; the one of which is an affection of the neck of the bladder, producing pain, strangury, and a catarrhus vesicae; the other is an affection of the rectum, sometimes indicated by pain alone in that part, and sometimes by hemorrhoidal symptoms. In gouty persons such affections have been known to alternate with inflammatory affections of the joints; but whether these belong to the retrocedent or to the misplaced gout, Dr Cullen pretends not to determine.\n\nIt is commonly supposed, that there are some cases of rheumatism which are scarcely to be distinguished from the gout; but these, Dr Cullen thinks, are but few; and that the two diseases may be for the most part distinguished with great certainty, by observing the predisposition, the antecedent circumstances, the parts affected, the recurrences of the disease, and its connection with the system; which circumstances, for the most part, appear very differently in the two diseases.\n\nCauses, &c. The gout is generally an hereditary disease; but some persons, without any hereditary dis-\nPractice.\n\nPhlegma-tain morbific matter always present in the body; and that this matter, by certain causes, thrown upon the joints or other parts, produces the several phenomena of the disease.\n\nThis doctrine, however ancient and generally received, appears to Dr Cullen to be very doubtful. For,\n\nFirst, There is no direct evidence of any morbific matter being present in persons disposed to the gout. There are no experiments or observations which show that the blood or other humours of gouty persons are in any respect different from those of the sound. Previous to attacks of the gout, there appear no marks of any morbid state of the fluids; for the disease generally attacks those persons who have enjoyed the most perfect health, and appear to be in that state when the disease comes on. At a certain period of the disease, a peculiar matter indeed appears in gouty persons; but this, which does not appear in every instance, and which appears only after the disease has subsisted for a long time, seems manifestly to be the effect, not the cause, of the disease. Further, Though there be certain acids which, taken into the body, seem to excite the gout, it is probable that these acids operate otherwise in exciting the disease, than by affording the material cause of it. In general, therefore, Dr Cullen thinks there is no proof of any morbific matter being the cause of the gout.\n\nSecondly, The suppositions concerning the particular nature of the matter producing the gout, have been so various, and so contradictory, as to allow us to conclude, that there is truly no proof of the existence of any of them. With respect to many of these suppositions, they are so inconsistent with chemical philosophy, and with the laws of the animal economy, that they must be entirely rejected.\n\nThirdly, The supposition of a morbific matter as the cause, is not consistent with the phenomena of the disease, particularly with its frequent and sudden translations from one part to another.\n\nFourthly, The supposition is further rendered improbable by this, that, if a morbific matter did exist, its operation should be similar in the several parts which it attacks; whereas it seems to be very different, being stimulant, and exciting inflammation, in the joints; but sedative and destroying tone in the stomach; which, upon the supposition of the same particular matter acting in both cases, is not to be explained by any difference in the part affected.\n\nFifthly, Some facts alleged in proof of a morbific matter, are not confirmed; such as those which would prove the disease to be contagious. There is, however, no proper evidence of this, the facts given being not only few, but exceptionable, and the negative observations innumerable.\n\nSixthly, Some arguments brought in favour of a morbific matter are founded upon a mistaken explanation. The disease has been supposed to depend upon a morbific matter, because it is hereditary. But the inference is not just: for most hereditary diseases do not depend upon any morbific matter, but upon a particular conformation of the structure of the body transmitted from the parent to the offspring; and this last appears to be particularly the case in the gout. It may also be observed, that hereditary diseases depending upon a morbific matter, appear always much more early in life than the gout commonly does.\n\nSeventhly, The supposition of a morbific matter being the cause of the gout, has been hitherto useless, as it has not suggested any successful method of cure. Particular theories of gout have often corrupted the practice, and have frequently led from those views which might have been useful, and from that practice which experience had approved. Further, Though the supposition of a morbific matter has been generally received, it has been as generally neglected in practice. When the gout has affected the stomach, nobody thinks of correcting the matter supposed to be present there, but merely of restoring the tone of the moving fibres.\n\nEighthly, The supposition of a morbific matter is quite superfluous: for it explains nothing, without supposing that matter to produce a change in the state of the moving powers; and a change in the state of the moving powers, produced by other causes, explains every circumstance without the supposition of a morbific matter; and it may be observed, that many of the causes exciting the gout, do not operate upon the state of the fluids, but directly and solely upon that of the moving powers.\n\nLastly, Dr Cullen contends that the supposition of a morbific matter is superfluous; because, without that, the disease can be explained, he thinks, in a manner more consistent with its phenomena, with the laws of the animal economy, and with the method of cure which experience has approved. We now proceed to give this explanation; but, before entering upon it, we must premise some general observations which Dr Cullen states.\n\nThe first observation is, That the gout is a disease of the whole system, or depends upon a certain general conformation and state of the body, which manifestly appears from the facts above mentioned. But the general state of the system depends chiefly upon the state of its primary moving powers; and therefore the gout may be supposed to be an affection of these.\n\nThe second observation is, That the gout is manifestly an affection of the nervous system; in which the primary moving powers of the whole system are lodged. The occasional or exciting causes are almost all such as act directly upon the nerves and nervous system; and the greater part of the symptoms of the atonic or retrocedent gout are manifestly affections of the same system. This leads us to seek for an explanation of the whole of the disease, in the laws of the nervous system, and particularly in the changes which may happen in the balance of its several parts.\n\nThe third observation is, That the stomach, which has so universal a concern with the rest of the system, is the internal part that is the most frequently, and often very considerably, affected by the gout. The paroxysms of the disease are commonly preceded by an affection of the stomach; many of the exciting causes act first upon the stomach; and the symptoms of the atonic and retrocedent gout are most commonly and chiefly affections of the same organ. This observation leads us to remark, that there is a balance subsisting between the state of the internal and that of the external parts; and, in particular, that the state of the stomach is connected with that of the external parts, so that the\nThese observations being premised, Dr Cullen offers the following pathology of the gout.\n\nIn some persons there is a certain vigorous and plethoric state of the system, which at a certain period of life is liable to a loss of tone in the extremities. This is in some measure communicated to the whole system, but appears more especially in the functions of the stomach. When this loss of tone occurs while the energy of the brain still retains its vigour, the vis medicatrix nature is excited to restore the tone of the parts; and accomplishes it, by exciting an inflammatory affection in some part of the extremities. When this has subsided for some days, the tone of the extremities and of the whole system is restored, and the patient returns to his ordinary state of health.\n\nThis is the course of things in the ordinary form of the disease, which we name the regular gout; but there are circumstances of the body, in which this course is interrupted or varied. Thus, when the atony has taken place, if the reaction do not succeed, the atony continues in the stomach, or perhaps in other internal parts; and produces that state which Dr Cullen, for reasons now obvious, named the atonic gout.\n\nA second case of variation in the course of the gout is, when to the atony the reaction and inflammation have to a certain degree succeeded, but from causes either internal or external the tone of the extremities and perhaps of the whole system is weakened; so that the inflammatory state, before it had either proceeded to the degree, or continued for the time, requisite for restoring the tone of the system, suddenly and entirely ceases; whence the stomach, and other internal parts, relapse into the state of atony; and perhaps have that increased by the atony communicated from the extremities; all which appears in what has been termed the retrocedent state of the gout.\n\nA third case of variation from the ordinary course of the gout is, when to the atony, usually preceding, an inflammatory reaction finally succeeds, but has its usual determination to the joints prevented by some circumstances; and is therefore directed to some internal part, where it produces an inflammatory affection, and that state of things which we have named the misplaced gout.\n\nThough this theory of Dr Cullen's be supported with much ingenuity, yet we may confidently venture to assert, that on this subject he has been less successful in establishing his own opinions, than in combating those of others; and this theory, as well as others formerly propounded, is liable to numerous and unsurmountable objections. According to the hypothesis, a vigorous and plethoric habit should in every case exist prior to the appearance of gout; which is by no means consistent with fact; nor is it true that a vigorous and plethoric habit is liable at a certain age to a loss of tone in the extremities; which is another necessary condition in the hypothesis. Loss of tone often occurs in the extremities without exerting any peculiar influence on the stomach; and why a loss of tone in the stomach should excite the vis medicatrix nature to restore it, by exciting an inflammatory affection in some part of the extremities, is very inconceivable. Were the hypothesis true, every dyspeptic patient should infallibly be affected with gout; which Podagra, however, is by no means the case. In short, every step in the theory is liable to unsurmountable objections; and it by no means, any more than former hypotheses, explains the phenomena of the disease, particularly what Dr Cullen has himself so accurately pointed out, the connection of gouty with calculous complaints.\n\nA very ingenious work has lately been published by an anonymous author, entitled \"a Treatise on Gravel and upon Gout;\" in which the sources of each are investigated, and effectual means of preventing or removing these diseases recommended. In this treatise an attempt is made to prove, that both diseases depend upon a peculiar concreting acid, the acid of calculi, or the lithic or uric acid, as it has been styled by some. He supposes this acid, constantly present to a certain degree in the circulating fluids, to be precipitated by the introduction of other acids; and in this manner he explains the influence of acid wines and other liquors, as claret, cider, &c., inducing gout; for he considers the circumstance chiefly constituting the disease as being an inflammation in parts of which the functions have been interrupted by the redundant acid precipitated. Although this theory be supported with much ingenuity, yet it is also liable to many objections. The sudden attack of the affection; its sudden transition from one part of the body to another; the instant relief of one part when another comes to be affected; and the various anomalous forms which the disease puts on, having an exact resemblance to different affections; are altogether irreconcilable to the idea of its depending on any fixed obstruction at a particular part arising from concreting acid. Nor does the plan of prevention and cure which he proposes, and which consists chiefly in abstinence from acid, and in the destruction of acid, by any means correspond in every particular to the best established facts respecting the treatment of gout; to which we next proceed.\n\nCure. In entering upon this, we must observe, in the first place, that a cure has been commonly thought impossible; and we acknowledge it to be very probable, that the gout, as a disease of the whole habit, and very often depending upon original conformation, cannot be cured by medicines, the effects of which are always very transitory, and seldom extend to the producing any considerable change of the whole habit.\n\nIt would perhaps have been happy for gouty persons if this opinion had been implicitly received by them; as it would have prevented their having been so often the dupes of self-interested pretenders, who have either amused them with inert medicines, or have rashly employed those of the most pernicious tendency. Dr Cullen, who has treated of the cure of the disease with great judgement, as he has done the theory with much ingenuity, is much disposed to believe the impossibility of a cure of the gout by medicines; and more certainly still inclined to think, that, whatever may be the possible power of medicines, yet no medicine for curing the gout has hitherto been found. Although almost every age has presented a new remedy, all hitherto offered have, very soon after, been neither neglected as useless, or condemned as pernicious.\n\nBut, though unwilling to admit the power of medicines, yet he contends, that a great deal can be done towards\ntowards the cure of the gout by a regimen: and he is firmly persuaded, that any man who, early in life, will enter upon the constant practice of bodily labour, and of abstinence from animal food, will be preserved entirely from the disease.\n\nWhether there be any other means of radically curing the gout, the Doctor is not able to say. There are histories of cases of the gout, in which it is said, that by great emotions of mind, by wounds, and by other accidents, the symptoms have been suddenly relieved, and never again returned; but how far these accidental cures might be imitated by art, or would succeed in other cases, is at least extremely uncertain.\n\nThe practices proper and necessary in the treatment of the gout, are to be considered under two heads: First, As they are to be employed in the intervals of paroxysms; or, secondly, As during the time of these. In the intervals of paroxysms, the indications are, to prevent altogether the return of paroxysms; or at least to render them less frequent and more moderate. During the time of paroxysms, the indications are, to moderate the violence and shorten the duration of them as much as can be done with safety.\n\nIt has been already observed, that the gout may be entirely prevented by constant bodily exercise, and by a low diet; and Dr Cullen is of opinion, that this prevention may take place even in persons who have a hereditary disposition to the disease. Even when the disposition has discovered itself by several paroxysms of inflammatory gout, he is persuaded that labour and abstinence will absolutely prevent any returns of it for the rest of life. These, therefore, are the means of answering the first indication to be pursued in the intervals of paroxysms.\n\nExercise in persons exposed to the gout, in Dr Cullen's opinion, operates by answering two purposes: One of these is the strengthening of the tone of the extreme vessels; and the other, the guarding against a plethoric state. For the former, if exercise be employed early in life, and before intemperance has weakened the body, a very moderate degree of it will answer the purpose; and, for the latter, if abstinence be at the same time observed, less exercise will be necessary.\n\nWith respect to exercise, this in general is to be observed, that it should never be violent; for if violent, it cannot be long continued, and must always endanger the bringing on an atony in proportion to the violence of the preceding motions.\n\nIt is also to be observed, that the exercise of gestation, though considerable and constant, will not, if it be entirely without bodily exercise, answer the purpose of preventing the gout. For this end, therefore, the exercise must be in some measure that of the body; and must be moderate, but at the same time constant and continued through life.\n\nIn every case and circumstance of the gout in which the patient retains the use of his limbs, bodily exercise, in the intervals of paroxysms, will be always useful; and in the beginning of the disease, when the disposition to it is not yet strong, exercise may prevent a paroxysm which otherwise would have come on. In more advanced states of the disease, however, when there is some disposition to a paroxysm, much walking will bring it on; either as it weakens the tone of the lower extremities, or as it excites an inflammatory disposition in them; and thus it seems to be that sprains or contusions often bring on a paroxysm of the gout.\n\nAbstinence, the other part of the regimen for preventing the gout, is of more difficult application. If an abstinence from animal food be entered upon early in life, while the vigour of the system is yet entire, Dr Cullen has no doubt of its being both safe and effectual; but if the motive for this diet shall not have occurred till the constitution has been broken by intemperance, or by the decline of life, a low diet may then endanger the induction of an atonic state.\n\nFurther, if a low diet be entered upon only in the decline of life, and be at the same time a very great change from the former manner of living, the withdrawing of an accustomed stimulus of the system may readily throw it into an atonic state.\n\nThe safety of an abstemious course will be greater or less according to the management of it. Animal food especially disposes to the plethoric and inflammatory state, and that food is to be therefore especially avoided; but, on the other hand, vegetable aliment of the lowest quality is in danger of weakening the system too much by not affording sufficient nourishment, and more particularly of weakening the tone of the stomach by its aceticity. It is therefore a diet of a middle nature that is to be chosen; and milk is precisely of this kind, as containing both animal and vegetable matter.\n\nAs approaching to the nature of milk, and as being a vegetable matter containing the greatest portion of nourishment, the farinaceous seeds are next to be chosen, and are the food most proper to be joined with milk.\n\nWith respect to drink, fermented liquors are useful only when they are joined with animal food, and that by their aceticity; and their stimulus is only necessary from custom. When, therefore, animal food is to be avoided, fermented liquors are unnecessary; and by increasing the aceticity of vegetables, these liquors may be hurtful. The stimulus of fermented or spirituous liquors is not necessary to the young and vigorous, and when much employed impairs the tone of the system. These liquors, therefore, are to be avoided, excepting as custom and the declining state of the system may have rendered them necessary. For preventing or moderating the regular gout, water is the only proper drink.\n\nWith respect to an abstemious course, it has been supposed, that an abstinence from animal food and fermented liquors, or the living upon milk and farinacea alone for the space of one year, might be sufficient for a radical cure of the gout: and it is possible that, at a certain period of life, in certain circumstances of the constitution, such a measure might answer the purpose. But this is very doubtful: and it is more probable, that the abstinence must, in a great measure, be continued, and the milk diet be persisted in, for the remainder of life. It is well known, that several persons who had entered on an abstemious course, and had been thereby delivered from the gout, have, however, upon returning to their former manner of full living, had the disease return upon them with as much violence\nviolence as before, or in a more irregular and more dangerous form.\n\nIt has been alleged, that, for preventing the return of the gout, blood-letting or scarifications of the feet, frequently repeated, and at stated times, may be practised with advantage; but of this Dr Cullen tells us he has had no experience; and the benefit of the practice is not, as far as we know, confirmed by the observation of any other practitioner.\n\nExercise and abstinence are the means of avoiding the plethoric state which gives the disposition to the gout; and are therefore the means proposed for preventing the paroxysms, or at least for rendering them less frequent and more moderate. But many circumstances prevent the steadiness necessary in pursuing these measures; and therefore in such cases, unless great care be taken to avoid the exciting causes, the disease may frequently return, and, in many cases, the preventing of paroxysms is chiefly to be obtained by avoiding those exciting causes already enumerated.\n\nA due attention in avoiding these different causes will certainly prevent fits of the gout; and the taking care that the exciting causes be never applied in a great degree, will certainly render fits more moderate when they do come on. But, upon the whole, it will appear, that a very strict attention to the general conduct of life, is in this matter necessary; and therefore, when the predisposition has taken place, it will be extremely difficult to avoid the disease.\n\nDr Cullen is firmly persuaded, that, by obviating the predisposition, and by avoiding the exciting causes, the gout may be entirely prevented: but, as the measures necessary for this purpose will, in most cases, be pursued with difficulty, and even with reluctance, men have been very desirous to find a medicine which might answer the purpose without any restraint on their manner of living. To gratify this desire, physicians have proposed, and, to take advantage of it, empirics have feigned, many remedies. Of what nature several of these remedies have been, it is difficult to say: but of those which are unknown, we conclude, from their having been only of temporary fame, and from their having soon fallen into neglect, that they have been either inert or pernicious. We shall therefore make no inquiry after them; and shall now remark only upon one or two known remedies for the gout which have been lately fashionable.\n\nOne of these is what has been named in England the Portland powder. This is not a new medicine, but is mentioned by Galen, and, with some little variation in its composition, has been mentioned by the writers of almost every age since that time. It appears to have been at times in fashion, and to have again fallen into neglect; and Dr Cullen thinks that this last has been owing to its having been found to be, in many instances, pernicious. In every instance which he has known of its exhibition for the length of time prescribed, the persons who had taken it were indeed afterwards free from any inflammatory affection of the joints; but they were affected with many symptoms of the atomic gout; and many, soon after finishing their course of the medicine, have been attacked with apoplexy, asthma, or dropsy, which proved fatal.\n\nAnother remedy which has had the appearance of preventing the gout, is alkali in various forms; such as the fixed alkali, both mild and caustic, lime water, soap, and absorbent earths; and of late the alkaline aerated water has been more fashionable than any other. Since it became common to exhibit these medicines in nephritic and calculous cases, it has often happened that they were given to those who were at the same time subject to the gout; and it has been observed, that under the use of these medicines, gouty persons have been longer free from the fits of their disease. That, however, the use of these medicines has entirely prevented the returns of gout, Dr Cullen does not know; because he never pushed the use of them for a long time, being apprehensive that the long-continued use of them might produce a hurtful change in the state of the fluids.\n\nAs the prevention of gout depends very much on supporting the tone of the stomach, and avoiding indigestion; so coctiveness, by occasioning this, is very hurtful to gouty persons. It is therefore necessary for such persons to prevent or remove coctiveness, by a laxative medicine, when needful; but it is at the same time proper, that the medicine employed should be such as may keep the belly regular, without much purging. Aloetis, rhubarb, magnesia alba, oleum ricini, or flowers of sulphur, may be employed, as the one or the other may happen to be best suited to particular persons.\n\nThese are the several measures to be pursued in the intervals of the paroxysms; and we are next to mention the measures proper during the time of them.\n\nAs during the time of paroxysms the body is in a feverish state, no irritation should then be added to it; every part, therefore, of the antiphlogistic regimen, except the application of cold, ought to be strictly observed.\n\nAn exception to the general rule, however, may occur when the tone of the stomach is weak, and when the patient has been before much accustomed to the use of strong drink; for then it may be allowable, and even necessary, to give some animal food and a little wine.\n\nThat no irritation is to be added to the system during the paroxysms of gout, except in the cases mentioned, is agreed upon among physicians; but it is a more difficult matter to determine, whether, during the time of paroxysms any measures may be pursued to moderate the violence of reaction and of inflammation. Dr Sydenham has given it as his opinion, that the more violent the inflammation and pain, the paroxysm will be the shorter, as well as the interval between the present and the next paroxysm longer; and, if this opinion be admitted as just, it will forbid the use of any remedies which might moderate the inflammation; which is, to a certain degree, undoubtedly necessary for the health of the body. On the other hand, acute pain prefers for relief; and although a certain degree of inflammation may seem absolutely unnecessary, there is reason to believe, a moderate degree of it may answer the purpose; and it is even probable, that in many cases the violence of inflammation may weaken the tone of the parts, and thereby invite a return of paroxysms. It seems to be in this way, that, as the disease advances, the paroxysms become more frequent.\nFrom these last considerations, it seems probable, that, during the time of paroxysms some measures may be taken to moderate the violence of the inflammation and pain, and particularly, that in first paroxysms, and in the young and vigorous, blood-letting at the arm may be practised with advantage; but this practice cannot be repeated often with safety; because blood-letting not only weakens the tone of the system, but also contributes to produce plethora. However, bleeding by leeches on the foot, and upon the inflamed part, may be practised and repeated with greater safety; and instances have been known of its having been employed with safety to moderate and shorten paroxysms; but how far it may be carried, we have not had experience enough to determine.\n\nBesides blood-letting and the antiphlogistic regimen, it has been proposed to employ remedies for moderating the inflammatory spasms of the part affected, such as warm bathing and emollient poultices. These have sometimes been employed with advantage and safety; but, at other times, have been found to give occasion to a retrocession of the gout.\n\nBlistering is a very effectual means of relieving and diffusing a paroxysm of the gout; but has also frequently had the effect of rendering it retrocedent. The stinging with nettles is analogous to blistering; and probably would be attended with the same danger. The burning with moxa, or other substances, is a remedy of the same kind; but though not found hurtful, there is no sufficient evidence of its proving a radical cure.\n\nCamphor, and some aromatic oils, have the power of allaying the pain, and of removing the inflammation from the part affected; but these remedies commonly make the inflammation only shift from one part to another, and therefore with the hazard of its falling upon a part where it may be more dangerous; and they have sometimes rendered the gout retrocedent.\n\nAmong other remedies which have of late been highly extolled during a paroxysm of gout, some have recommended the use of strong purgatives frequently repeated; others have highly extolled the affluence application of cold water to the affected foot. But we may safely venture to assert that both practices are very doubtful, if not very dangerous.\n\nFrom these reflections it will appear, that some danger must attend every external application to the parts affected during a paroxysm; and that therefore the common practice of committing the person to patience and flannel alone, is established upon the best foundation. Opiates give the most certain relief from pain; but, when given in the beginning of gouty paroxysms, it has by some been thought that they occasion these to return with greater violence. When, however, the paroxysms shall have abated in their violence, but still continue to return, so as to occasion painful and restless nights, opiates may be given with safety and advantage; especially in the case of persons advanced in life, and who have been often affected with the disease. When, after paroxysms have ceased, some swelling and stiffness still remain in the joints, these symptoms are to be diffused by the diligent use of the flesh-brush. Purging immediately after a paroxysm will be always employed with the hazard of bringing it on again; but keeping the belly gently open even during the continuance of the paroxysm is highly proper.\n\nThus far of the regular gout. We now proceed to consider the management of the disease when it has become irregular.\n\nIn the atomic gout, the cure is to be accomplished by carefully avoiding all debilitating causes; and by employing, at the same time, the means of strengthening the system in general, and the stomach in particular.\n\nFor strengthening the system in general, Dr Cullen recommends frequent exercise on horseback, and moderate walking. Cold bathing also may answer the purpose; and may be safely employed, if it appear to be powerful in stimulating the system, and be not applied when the extremities are threatened with any pain.\n\nFor supporting the tone of the system in general, when threatened with atomic gout, some animal food ought to be employed, and the more acetic vegetables ought to be avoided. In the same case, some wine also may be necessary; but it should be in moderate quantity, and of the least acetic kinds, and if every kind of wine shall be found to increase the acidity of the stomach, ardent spirits and water must be employed.\n\nFor strengthening the stomach, bitters and the Peruvian bark may be used; but care must be taken that they be not constantly employed for any great length of time.\n\nThe most effectual medicine for strengthening the stomach is iron, which may be employed under various preparations; but the best appears to be the rust in fine powder, which may be given in large doses.\n\nFor supporting the tone of the stomach, aromatics may be exhibited; but should be used with caution, as the frequent and copious use of them have an opposite effect; and they should therefore be given only in compliance with former habits, or for palliating present symptoms.\n\nWhen the stomach happens to be liable to indigestion, gentle vomits may be frequently given, and proper laxatives should be always employed to obviate or to remove coarseness.\n\nIn the atomic gout, or in persons liable to it, to guard against cold is especially necessary; and the most certain means of doing this, is by repairing to a warm climate during the winter season. In the more violent cases, blistering the lower extremities may be useful; but that remedy should be avoided when any pain threatens the extremities. In persons liable to the atomic gout, infuses may be established in the extremities as in some measure a supplement to the disease.\n\nA second case of the irregular gout, is the retrocedent.\n\nWhen this affects the stomach and intestines, relief is to be instantly attempted by the free use of strong wines, joined with aromatics, and given warm; or, if these shall not prove powerful enough, ardent spirits must be employed, and are to be given in a large dose. In moderate attacks, ardent spirits, impregnated with garlic or with asafoetida, may be used; or, even without the ardent spirits, a solution of asafoetida with the volatile alkali, may answer the purpose. Opiates are often an effectual remedy; and may be\njoined with aromatics, as in the electuarium opiatum; or they may be usefully joined with volatile alkali and camphor. Musk has likewise proved useful in this disease.\n\nWhen the affection of the stomach is accompanied with vomiting, this may be encouraged, by taking draughts of warm water, at first with wine, and afterwards without it; having at length recourse, if necessary, to some of the remedies above mentioned, and particularly the opiates.\n\nIn like manner, if the intestines be affected with diarrhoea, this is to be at first encouraged by taking plentifully of weak broth; and when this shall have been done sufficiently, the tumult is to be quieted by opiates.\n\nWhen the retrocedent gout shall affect the lungs, and produce asthma, this is to be cured by opiates, by antispasmodics, and perhaps by blistering on the back or breast.\n\nWhen the gout, leaving the extremities, shall affect the head, and produce pain, vertigo, apoplexy, or palsy, our resources are very precarious. The most probable means of relief is, blistering the head; and, if the gout shall have receded very entirely from the extremities, blisters may be applied to these also. Together with these blisterings, aromatics, and the volatile alkali, may be thrown into the stomach.\n\nThe third case of the irregular place is the misplaced; that is, when the inflammatory affection of the gout, instead of falling upon the extremities, falls upon some internal part. In this case, the disease is to be treated by blood-letting, and by such other remedies as would be proper in an idiopathic inflammation of the same parts.\n\nWhether the translation so frequently made from the extremities to the kidneys, is to be considered as an instance of the misplaced gout, seems uncertain; but Dr Cullen is disposed to think it something different; and therefore is of opinion, that, in the nephralgia calcarea produced upon this occasion, the remedies of inflammation are to be employed no farther than they may be sometimes necessary in that disease, arising from other causes than the gout.\n\nBesides what have been mentioned, a variety of other practices may be necessary and proper against the various anomalous symptoms, which are at times produced by irregular gout. But of these we cannot propose to treat. And we may conclude with observing, that in every form of gout, the cure principally depends on avoiding occasional causes, particularly luxury and laziness.\n\nGENUS XXV.

The erysipelas of the face, where this affection very frequently appears, comes on with a cold shivering, and other symptoms of pyrexia. The hot stage of this is frequently attended with a confusion of the head, and some degree of delirium; and almost always with drowsiness, and perhaps coma. The pulse is always frequent, and commonly full and hard.—When these symptoms have continued for one, two, or at most three days, an erythema appears on some part of the face. This at first is of no great extent; but gradually spreads from the part it first occupied to the other parts of the face, till it has affected the whole; and frequently from the face it spreads over the hairy scalp, or descends on some part of the cheek. As the redness spreads, it commonly leaves, or at least is abated in the parts it had before occupied. All the parts which the redness affects are also affected with some swelling, which continues for some time after the redness has abated. The whole face becomes considerably turgid; and the eyelids are often so much swelled as entirely to shut up the eyes. When the redness and swelling have continued for some time, there commonly arise, sooner or later, blisters of a larger or smaller size on several parts of the face. These contain a thin colourless liquor, which sooner or later runs out. The surface of the skin, in the blistered places, sometimes becomes livid and blackish; but this seldom goes deeper, or discovers any degree of gangrene affecting the cutis vera. On the parts of the face not affected with blisters, the cuticle suffers, towards the end of the disease, a considerable desquamation. Sometimes the tumor of the eyelids ends in a suppuration.\n\nThe inflammation coming upon the face does not produce any remission of the fever which had before prevailed; and sometimes the fever increases with the spreading and increasing inflammation. The inflamma-\ntion commonly continues for eight or ten days; and for the same time, the fever and symptoms attending it also continue. In the progress of the disease, the delirium and coma attending it sometimes go on increasing, and the patient dies apoplectic on the seventh, ninth, or eleventh day of the disease. In such cases it has been commonly supposed, that the disease is translated from the external to the internal parts. But Dr. Cullen thinks that the affection of the brain is merely a communication from the external affection, as this continues increasing at the same time with the internal. When a fatal event does not take place, the inflammation, after having affected the whole face, and perhaps the other external parts of the head, ceases, and with that the fever also; and, without any other crisis, the patient returns to his ordinary health. This disease is not commonly contagious; but as it may arise from an acrid matter externally applied, so it is possible that the disease may sometimes be communicated from one person to another; and certainly there are several well authenticated instances of its prevailing in such a manner, even in particular wards of hospitals, as to leave no doubt respecting its contagious nature. Persons who have once laboured under this disease are liable to return of it.\n\nPrognosis. The event of this disease may be foreseen from the state of the symptoms which denote more or less the affection of the brain. If neither delirium nor coma come on, the disease is seldom attended with any danger; but when these symptoms appear early in the disease, and are in a considerable degree, the utmost danger is to be apprehended.\n\nCure. The erysipelas of the face is to be cured, according to the opinion of most practitioners, much in the same manner as phlegmonic inflammations; by blood-letting, cooling purgatives, and by employing every part of the antiphlogistic regimen. Many observations, however, would lead us to conclude, that in not a few cases the concomitant fever has here a tendency to the typhoid type; and therefore evacuations, apparently serviceable in the first instance, have afterwards a bad effect. The evacuations of blood-letting and purging are to be employed more or less according to the urgency of symptoms; particularly those which mark an affection of the brain. As the pyrexia continues, and often increases with the inflammation of the face, so the evacuations above mentioned are to be employed at any time of the disease. When, however, the fever, in place of marks of the phlogistic diathesis, particularly a full, hard, and strong pulse, is attended with symptoms of great debility, and with a small pulse easily compressible; evacuations, particularly under the form of blood-letting, must be used with very great caution. Even in such cases, however, the use of refrigerant cathartics may still be permitted in with more safety and greater advantage. But whether evacuants have been employed or not, when symptoms of debility run to a great height, and marks of a putrefactive tendency appear, recourse must be had to wine and the cinchona. In cases which at the commencement require evacuation, these are often in the after periods employed with very great benefit.\n\nIn this, as in other diseases of the head, when that part happens to be the seat of erysipelas, it is proper to put the patient, as often as he can easily bear it, into somewhat of an erect posture; and as there is always an external affection, so various external applications have been proposed to be made to the part affected; but almost all of them are of doubtful effect.\n\nAn erysipelas frequently appears on other parts of the body besides the face, and such other erysipelas inflammations frequently end in suppuration; but these cases are seldom dangerous. At coming on they are sometimes attended with drowsiness, and even with some delirium; but this seldom happens, and these symptoms do not continue after the inflammation is formed; and Dr. Cullen does not remember to have seen an instance of the translation of an inflammation from the limbs to an internal part; and though these inflammations of the limbs be attended with pyrexia, they seldom require the same evacuations as the erysipelas of the face.\n\nSp.

Of this distemper Dr. Cullen declines giving any particular history, because he never saw it; from the accounts of other authors, however, he is of opinion, that the circumstances regularly characteristic of it, especially of its more violent and dangerous states, are: 1. The great loss of strength in the animal functions, which often appears early in the disease. 2. The stupor, giddiness, and consequent staggering, which resembles drunkenness, or the headache and various delirium, all of them denoting a great disorder in the functions of the brain. 3. Anxiety, palpitation, syncope, and especially the weakness and irregularity of the pulse, denoting a considerable disturbance in the action of the heart. 4. Nausea and vomiting, particularly the vomiting of bile, which flows\nan accumulation of vitiated bile in the gall-bladder and biliary ducts, and from thence derived into the intestines and stomach; and which denote a considerable spasm, and loss of tone in the extreme vessels on the surface of the body. 5. The buboes and carbuncles, which denote an acrimony prevailing in the fluids; and, lastly, The petechiae, hemorrhages, and colligative diarrhoea, which denote a putrefactive tendency prevailing in a great degree in the mals of blood.\n\nTo these characteristics of the plague enumerated by Dr Cullen, we shall add one mentioned by Sir John Pringle, which, though perhaps less frequent than the others, yet seems worthy of notice. It is this, That in the plague there is an extraordinary enlargement of the heart and liver. In nine dissections of bodies dead of the plague at Marseilles, this extraordinary enlargement of the heart is taken notice of in all of them, and of the liver in seven of them. The account was sent to the Royal Society by M. Didier, one of the physicians to the king of France, and has been published in the Philosophical Transactions. In the first case, the author takes notice, that \"the heart was of an extraordinary bigness; and the liver was of double the natural size.\"—Case 2. The heart was of a prodigious bigness, and the liver much enlarged.—Case 3. The heart double the natural bigness.—Case 4. The heart was very large, and the liver was bigger and harder than ordinary.—Case 5. The heart was of a prodigious bigness.—Case 6. The heart was larger than in its natural state; the liver also was very large.—Case 7. The heart was of a prodigious size, and the liver was very large.—Case 8. The heart was much larger than natural, and the liver of a prodigious size.—Case 9. The heart was double the natural bigness, and the liver was larger than ordinary.\"\n\nThis supernatural enlargement, Sir J. Pringle thinks, is owing to the relaxation of the solid parts, by which means they become unable to resist the impetus of blood, and therefore are easily extended; as in the case of infancy, where the growth is remarkably quick. And a similar enlargement he takes notice of in the fever, and other putrid diseases.\n\nA very elaborate work has lately been published on the subject of the plague by Dr Patrick Russel, formerly physician to the British factory at Aleppo. In this work, a very full history is given of the various forms and varieties of the disease. He makes particular observations on the following symptoms, which, in addition to the pellitential eruptions, he considers as the most important concomitants of plague, viz. fever, delirium, coma, impediment or loss of speech, deafness, muddiness of the eyes, white tongue, state of the pulse, respiration, anxiety, pain at the heart, inquietude, debility, fainting, convulsion, appearances of the urine, perspiration, vomiting, loofenefs, and hemorrhage; and he concludes these remarks with some observations on the occurrence of the plague with pregnant women.\n\nTo point out more distinctly the stable varieties of the disease, he arranges the pellitential cases which fell under his observation at Aleppo under six classes: and he concludes his description with a very minute and particular account of the pellitential eruptions, appearing under the form either of buboes, carbuncles, or other exanthemata. The presence of the two first, he observes, either separately or conjunctly, leaves the nature of the distemper unequivocal. But fatal has been the error of rashly pronouncing a distemper not to be a plague from their absence. Buboes affected the inguinal, axillary, parotid, maxillary, and cervical glands. But the first were the most commonly affected, and the two latter seldom observed to swell, without either the parotid swelling at the time, or soon after. Of the carbuncles, Dr Russel describes five different varieties. The other exanthemata, which he observed sometimes, though less frequently, attending the plague, were petechiae, a marbled appearance of the skin, an erysipelasous redness, streaks of a reddish purple or livid colour, vibices or weals, and large blue or purple spots, the macule magna of authors. In some cases, an extraordinary concurrence of eruptions took place, which was chiefly observed among children under ten years of age.\n\nCauses, &c. From a consideration of the symptoms above mentioned, Dr Cullen concludes, that the plague is owing to a specific contagion, often suddenly producing the most considerable debility in the nervous system, or moving powers, and a general putrefaction in the fluids. Dr Russel also considers the disease as being universally the consequence of what may be called pellitential contagion; and has judiciously repelled the objections which have been brought against this doctrine.\n\nPrevention. Here we must refer to all those methods of preventing and removing the incipient contagion of putrid fevers, which have been so fully enumerated. Dr Cullen is persuaded that the disease never arises in the northern parts of Europe, but in consequence of being imported from some other country. The magistrate's first care, therefore, ought to be, to prevent the importation; and this may generally be done by a due attention to bills of health, and to the proper performance of quarantines.—With respect to the latter, he is of opinion, that the quarantines of persons may with safety be much less than forty days; and if this were allowed, the execution of the quarantine would be more exact and certain, as the temptation to break it would be in a great measure avoided. With respect to the quarantine of goods, it cannot be perfect unless the suspected goods be unpacked, duly ventilated, and other means be employed for correcting the infection they may carry; and if all this be properly done, it is probable that the time commonly prescribed for quarantine may be also shortened.\n\nA second measure in the way of prevention is required, when an infection has reached and prevailed in any place, to prevent that infection from spreading into others. This can only be done by preventing the inhabitants or the goods of any infected place from going out of it till they have undergone a proper quarantine.\n\nThe third measure, and which ought to be employed with great care, is, to prevent the infection from spreading among the inhabitants of a place in which it has arisen. And in this case, a great deal may be done by the magistrate: 1. By allowing as many of the inhabitants as are free from infection, and are not necessary to the service of the place, to go out of it. 2. By discharging all assemblies, or unnecessary intercourse of the people. 3. By ordering some necessary communications to be performed without contact.\ncontact. 4. By making such arrangements and provisions as may render it easy for the families remaining to shut themselves up in their own houses. 5. By allowing persons to quit houses where an infection appears, upon condition that they go into lazarettos. 6. By ventilating and purifying, or destroying, at the public expense, all infected goods. 7. By avoiding hospitals, and providing separate apartments for infected persons.\n\nThe fourth and last part of the business of prevention respects the conduct of persons necessarily remaining in infected places, especially those obliged to have some communication with persons infected. Those obliged to remain in places infected, but not to have any near communication with the sick, must avoid all near communication with other persons or their goods; and it is probable, that a small distance will serve, if, at the same time, there be no stream of air to carry the effluvia of persons or goods to some distance. Those who are obliged to have a near communication with the sick ought to avoid any of the debilitating causes which render the body susceptible of infection, as a spare diet, intemperance in drinking, excess in venery, cold, fear, or other depressing passions of the mind. A full diet of animal food is also to be avoided, because it increases the irritability of the body, and favours the operation of contagion; and indigestion, whether from the quantity or quality of the food, contributes very much to the same end.\n\nBesides these, it is probable that the moderate use of wine and spirituous liquors, moderate exercise, and the cold bath, may be of use; tonic medicines also, of which cinchona is deservedly accounted the chief, may be used with some probability of success. If anything is to be expected from antiseptics, Dr Cullen thinks camphor preferable to every other. In general, however, every one is to be indulged in the medicine of which he has the best opinion, provided it is not evidently hurtful. Whether these be useful in preserving from the effects of contagion, is a matter of doubt. Dr Russel in his treatise enters very fully into the consideration of the means of prevention, both with respect to quarantines, lazarettos, and bills of health. He is of opinion, that the present laws on these subjects are in many respects defective; and he thinks, that a set of new regulations would have the best chance of a deliberate and impartial discussion in the senate, if the inquiry were taken at a time free from all apprehension of immediate danger.\n\nCure. According to Dr Cullen, the indications are the same as in fever in general, but are not all equally important. The measures for moderating the violence of reaction, which operate by diminishing the action of the heart and arteries, have seldom, he thinks, any place here, excepting that the antiphlogistic regimen is generally proper. Some physicians have recommended bleeding, and Sydenham even seems to think it an effectual cure; but Dr Cullen supposes, that for the most part it is unnecessary, and in many cases might do much hurt. Dr Russel, however, who on this subject speaks from experience and actual observation, is of a different opinion. With most of his patients, a single bleeding was employed with advantage; and even where the sick under his inspection were bled oftener than once, he did not find that the low state was thereby hurried on. Purgings has also been recommended; and in some degree it may be useful in drawing off the putrefactive matter frequently present in the intestines; but a large evacuation in this way may certainly be hurtful.\n\nThe moderating the violence of reaction, as far as it can be done, by taking off the spasm of the extreme vessels, is a measure, in Dr Cullen's opinion, of the utmost necessity in the cure of the plague; and the whole of the means formerly mentioned, as suited to this indication, are extremely proper. The giving an emetic, at the first approach of the disease, would probably be of great service; and it is probable, that, at some other periods of the disease, emetics might be useful, both by evacuating bile abounding in the alimentary canal, and by taking off the spasm of the extreme vessels. Indeed Baron Ash, and some other of the Russian practitioners, represent the early and repeated use of emetics as the only effectual mode of cure.\n\nAccording to the observations of Dr de Mertens, who wrote a very interesting treatise on the fatal plague which raged at Moscow in 1771, and which carried off upwards of 20,000 inhabitants in the space of one month, emetics were often of the greatest service.\n\nFrom some principles with respect to fever in general, and with respect to the plague in particular, Dr Cullen is of opinion, that after the exhibition of the first vomit, the body should be disposed to sweat; but this sweat should be raised only to a moderate degree, though it must be continued for 24 hours or more if the patient bears it easily. The sweating is to be excited and conducted according to the rules laid down under SYNOCHA; and must be promoted by the plentiful use of diluents rendered more grateful by vegetable acids, or more powerful by being impregnated with some portion of neutral salts. To support the patient under the continuance of the sweat, a little weak broth, acidulated with the juice of lemons, may be given frequently, and sometimes a little wine if the heat of the body be not considerable. If sudorific medicines be judged necessary, opiates will be found more effectual and safe; but they should not be combined with aromatics, and probably may be more effectual if joined with a portion of emetics and of neutral salts. But if, notwithstanding the use of emetics and sudorifics in the beginning, the disease should still continue, the cure must turn upon the use of means for obviating debility and putrefaction; and for this purpose tonic medicines, especially cinchona and cold drink, are the most proper.\n\nGENUS XXVIII.

In the distinct smallpox, the disease begins with a synocha or inflammatory fever. This fever generally comes on about mid-day, with some symptoms of a cold stage, and commonly with a considerable languor and drowsiness. A hot stage is soon formed, and becomes more considerable on the second and third day. During this course children are liable to frequent startings from their slumber; and adults, if they are kept in bed, are disposed to much sweating. On the third day, children are sometimes affected with one or two epileptic fits. Towards the end of the third day the eruption commonly appears, and gradually increases during the fourth; appearing first on the face, and successively on the inferior parts, so as to be completed over the whole body on the fifth day. From the third day the fever abates, and by the fifth it entirely ceases. The eruption appears first in small red spots hardly eminent, but by degrees rising into pimples. There are generally but few on the face; but, even when more numerous, they are separate and distinct from one another. On the fifth or sixth day, a small vesicle, containing an almost colourless fluid, appears on the top of each pimple. For two days these vesicles increase in breadth only, and there is a small hollow pit in their middle, so that they are not raised into fisheroidal pustules till the eighth day. These pustules from their first formation continue to be surrounded with an exactly circular inflamed margin, which when they are numerous diffuses some inflammation over the neighbouring skin, so as to give somewhat of a darkish rose colour to the spaces between the pustules. As the pustules increase in size the face swells considerably if they are numerous on it; and the eye-lids particularly are so much swelled, that the eyes are entirely shut. As the disease proceeds, the matter in the pustules becomes by degrees more opaque and white, and at length assumes a yellowish colour. On the 11th day the swelling of the face is abated, and the pustules seem quite full. On the top of each a darker spot appears; and at this place the pustule, on the 11th day, or soon after, is spontaneously broken, and a portion of the matter oozes out; in consequence of which the pustule is shrivelled, and subsides; while the matter oozing out dries, and forms a crust upon its surface. Sometimes only a little of the matter oozes out; and what remains in the pustule becomes thick and even hard. After some days, both the crusts and the hardened pustules fall off, leaving the skin which they covered of a brownish red colour; nor doth it resume its natural colour till many days after. In some cases, where the matter of the pustules has been more liquid, the crusts formed from it are later in falling off; and the part they covered suffers some desquamation, which occasions a small hollow or pit.\n\nOn the legs and hands the matter is frequently absorbed; so that at the height of the disease, these pustules appear as empty as vesicles. On the 10th and 11th days, as the swelling of the face subsides, a swelling arises in the hands and feet; but which again subsides as the pustules come to maturity. When the pustules on the face are numerous, some degree of pyrexia appears on the 10th and 11th days; but disappears again after the pustules are fully ripened, or perhaps remains in a very slight degree till the pustules on the feet have finished their course; and it is seldom that any fever continues longer in the distinct smallpox. When the pustules are numerous on the face, upon the fifth or seventh day some uneasiness of the throat, with a hoarseness of the voice, comes on, and a thin liquid is poured out from the mouth. These symptoms increase with the swelling of the face; and the liquids of the mouth and throat becoming thicker are with difficulty thrown out; and there is at the same time some difficulty in swallowing, so that liquids taken in to be swallowed are frequently rejected or thrown out by the nose. But all these affections of the fauces are abated as the swelling of the face subsides.\n\nIn the confluent smallpox all the symptoms above-mentioned are much more severe. The eruptive fever particularly is more violent; the pulse is more frequent and more contracted, approaching to that state of pulse which is observed in typhus. The coma is more considerable, and there is frequently a delirium. Vomiting also frequently attends, especially at the beginning of the disease. In very young infants epileptic fits are sometimes frequent on the first days of the disease, and sometimes prove fatal before any eruption appears, or they suffer in a very confluent and putrid smallpox. But at the same time, it has been justly remarked by Dr Sydenham, and other accurate observers, that epileptic attacks more frequently precede distinct and mild than malignant and confluent smallpox. The eruption appears in the confluent more early on the third day, and it is frequently preceded or accompanied with an erysipelasous efflorescence. Sometimes\nExanthematous times the eruption appears in clutters, like the measles.\n\nWhen the eruption is completed, the pimples are always more numerous upon the face, and at the same time smaller and less eminent. Upon the eruption the fever suffers some remission, but never goes off entirely; and after the fifth or sixth day it increases again, and continues to be considerable throughout the remaining part of the disease. The vesicles formed on the top of the pimples appear sooner; and while they increase in breadth, they do not retain a circular, but are every way of an irregular figure. Many of them run into one another, in such a manner that very often the face is covered with one vesicle rather than with a number of pustules. The vesicles, as far as they are any way separated, do not arise to a spheroidal form, but remain flat, and sometimes the whole of the face appears an even surface. When the pustules are in any measure separated, they are not bounded by an inflamed margin, but the part of the skin that is free from pustules is commonly pale and flaccid. The liquor that is in the pustules changes from a clear to an opaque appearance, and becomes whitish or brownish, but never acquires the yellow colour and thick consistence that appears in the distinct smallpox. The swelling of the face, which only sometimes attends the distinct smallpox, always attends the confluent kind; it also comes on more early, and arises to a greater height, but abates considerably on the tenth or eleventh day. At this time the pustules or vesicles break and shrivel; pouring out at the same time a liquor, which is formed into brown or black crusts, which do not fall off for a long time after. Those of the face, in falling off, leave the skin subject to a desquamation, which pretty certainly produces pitting. On the other parts of the body the pustules of the confluent smallpox are more distinct than on the face; but never acquire the same maturity and consistence of pus as in the properly distinct kind.\n\nThe salivation, which sometimes only attends the distinct smallpox, very constantly attends the confluent; and both the salivation and the affection of the faucies above-mentioned occur, especially in adults, in a higher degree. In infants a diarrhoea comes frequently in place of a salivation.\n\nIn this kind of smallpox there is often a very considerable putrefaction of the fluids, as appears from petechiae, from serous vesicles, under which the skin shows a disposition to gangrene, and from bloody urine or other haemorrhages; all of which symptoms frequently attend this disease. In the confluent smallpox also, the fever, which had only suffered a remission from the eruption to the maturation, at or immediately after this period is frequently renewed again with considerable violence. This is what has been called the secondary fever, and is of various duration and event.\n\nCauses, &c. It is evident that the smallpox is originally produced by a contagion; and that this contagion is a ferment with respect to the fluids of the human body, which assimilates a considerable portion of them to its own nature: or, at least, we have every reason to believe that a small quantity of contagious matter introduced, is somehow multiplied and increased in the circulating fluids of the animal body. This quantity passes again out of the body, partly by insensible perspiration, and partly by being deposited in pustules: Variola.\n\nThe causes which determine more of the variolous matter to pass by perspiration, or to form pustules, are probably certain circumstances of the skin, which determine more or less of the variolous matter to stick in it, or to pass freely through it. The circumstance of the skin, which seems to determine the variolous matter to stick in it, is a certain state of inflammation depending much on the heat of it: thus we have many instances of parts of the body, from being more heated, having a greater number of pustules than other parts. Thus parts covered with plaister, especially those of the stimulant kind, have more pustules than others.\n\nCertain circumstances also, such as adult age, and full living, determining to a phlogistic diathesis, seem to produce a greater number of pustules, and vice versa. It is therefore probable, that an inflammatory state of the whole system, and more particularly of the skin, gives occasion to a greater number of pustules; and the causes of this may produce most of the other circumstances of the confluent smallpox, such as the time of eruption, the continuance of the fever, the effusion of a more putrefactive matter, and let fit to be converted into pus, together with the form and other circumstances of the pustules.\n\nPrognosis. The more exactly the disease retains the form of the distinct kind, it is the safer; and the more completely the disease takes the form of the confluent kind, it is the more dangerous. It is only when the distinct kind shows a great number of pustules on the face, or otherwise by fever or putrefaction, approaching to the circumstances of the confluent, that the distinct kind is attended with any danger.\n\nIn the confluent kind the danger is always very considerable; and the more violent and permanent the fever is, the greater the danger; and especially in proportion to the increase of the symptoms of putrefaction. When the putrid disposition is very great, the disease sometimes proves fatal before the eighth day; but in most cases death happens on the eleventh, and sometimes not till the fourteenth or seventeenth day.\n\nThough the smallpox may not prove immediately fatal, the more violent kinds are often followed by a morbid state of the body, sometimes of very dangerous event. These consequences, according to Dr Cullen, may be imputed sometimes to an acid matter produced by the preceding disease, and deposited in different parts; and sometimes to an inflammatory diathesis produced and determined to particular parts of the body.\n\nSince the introduction of smallpox into Europe, there is perhaps no disease which has produced a greater number of deaths. But, fortunately, a discovery is now made, by which there is reason to hope that this loathsome disease may be altogether exterminated; its prevention, viz. by the inoculation of the vaccine or cowpox.\n\nThis most important discovery we owe to the successful exertions of Dr Edward Jenner; to whom, for these exertions, repeated rewards have been voted by the British legislature, but who unquestionably enjoys a much higher reward in the satisfaction of having conferred an inestimable blessing on the human species.\nFor an account of the progress of this discovery, we must refer our readers to Dr Jenner's publication. Here we shall only observe, that it had long been remarked in some parts of England, particularly in the neighbourhood of Berkley, where Dr Jenner resided, that cows were liable to a pustular disease on their udders, somewhat resembling smallpox; that this disease was communicated by contact to the fingers of those employed in milking the cows; and, finally, that those thus infected with cowpox, were completely protected against the contagion of smallpox.\n\nFounding on these observations, Dr Jenner ascertained by experiment, that the inoculation of vaccine matter was an infallible preventive of smallpox; and that this vaccine matter had equal power in preventing variola, when transferred from one human subject to another, as when obtained immediately from the cow. It is not therefore wonderful that this practice of vaccine inoculation should soon have become general, both in Britain and in every quarter of the world. Nor is it perhaps surprising, that it should have been violently opposed by ignorant and obstinate men. Hence numerous publications have of late appeared both for and against this practice. Many mistakes have undoubtedly been committed by ignorance and inattention; and thus the preventive has been supposed to fail. For the best account both of the method of performing the operation, of conveying the vaccine matter from one place to another, and of the tests of constitutional affection in those cases in which the inflammation is slight, and in which no fever is perceptible, we may refer our readers to a treatise published at Edinburgh in 1802, by Mr James Bryce, entitled Practical Observations on the Inoculation of Cowpox.\n\nOf the efficacy of vaccine inoculation as a preventive of smallpox few candid men will entertain any doubt, after the following report on vaccination, from the Royal College of Physicians in London, ordered to be printed on the 8th of July 1807, by the British parliament.\n\nREPORT, &c.\n\nThe Royal College of Physicians of London, having received his majesty's commands, in compliance with an address from the house of commons, \"to inquire into the state of vaccine inoculation in the united kingdom, to report their opinion and observations upon that practice, upon the evidence which has been adduced in its support, and upon the causes which have hitherto retarded its general adoption;\"—have applied themselves diligently to the business referred to them.\n\nDeeply impressed with the importance of an inquiry which equally involves the lives of individuals, and the public prosperity, they have made every exertion to investigate the subject fully and impartially. In aid of the knowledge and experience of the members of their own body, they have applied separately to each of the licentiates of the college; they have corresponded with the colleges of physicians of Dublin and Edinburgh; with the colleges of surgeons of London, Edinburgh, and Dublin; they have called upon the societies established for vaccination, for an account of their practice, to what extent it has been carried on, and what has been the result of their experience; and they have, by public notice, invited individuals to contribute whatever information they had severally collected. They have in consequence been furnished with a mass of evidence communicated with the greatest readiness and candour, which enables them to speak with confidence upon all the principal points referred to them.\n\nI. During eight years which have elapsed since Dr Jenner made his discovery public, the progress of vaccination has been rapid, not only in all parts of the united kingdom, but in every quarter of the civilized world. In the British islands some hundreds thousands have been vaccinated, in our possessions in the East Indies upwards of 800,000, and among the nations of Europe the practice has become general. Professional men have submitted it to the fairest trials, and the public have, for the most part, received it without prejudice. A few indeed have stood forth the adversaries of vaccination, on the same grounds as their predecessors who opposed the inoculation for the smallpox, falsely led by hypothetical reasoning in the investigation of a subject which must be supported, or rejected, upon facts and observation only. With these few exceptions, the testimony in favour of vaccination has been most strong and satisfactory, and the practice of it, though it has received a check in some quarters, appears still to be upon the increase in most parts of the united kingdom.\n\nII. The college of physicians, in giving their observations and opinions on the practice of vaccination, think it right to premise, that they advance nothing but what is supported by the multiplied and unequivocal evidence which has been brought before them, and they have not considered any facts as proved but what have been stated from actual observation.\n\nVaccination appears to be in general perfectly safe; the instances to the contrary being extremely rare. The disease excited by it is slight, and seldom prevents those under it from following their ordinary occupations. It has been communicated with safety to pregnant women, to children during dentition, and in their earliest infancy; in all which respects it possesses material advantages over inoculation for the smallpox; which, though productive of a disease generally mild, yet sometimes occasions alarming symptoms, and is in a few cases fatal.\n\nThe security derived from vaccination against the smallpox, if not absolutely perfect, is as nearly so as can perhaps be expected from any human discovery; for amongst several hundred thousand cases, with the results of which the college have been made acquainted, the number of alleged failures has been surprisingly small, so much so, as to form certainly no reasonable objection to the general adoption of vaccination; for it appears that there are not nearly so many failures, in a given number of vaccinated persons, as there are deaths in an equal number of persons inoculated for the smallpox. Nothing can more clearly demonstrate the superiority of vaccination over the inoculation of the smallpox, than this consideration; and it is a most important fact, which has been confirmed in the course of this inquiry, that in almost every case, where the smallpox has succeeded vaccination, whether by inoculation or by casual infection, the disease has varied much from its ordinary course; it has neither been the same in the violence, nor in the duration of its symptoms, but has,\nwith very few exceptions, been remarkably mild, as if\nthe smallpox had been deprived, by the previous vac-\ncine disease, of all its usual malignity.\n\nThe testimonies before the college of physicians are\nvery decided in declaring, that vaccination does less\nmischief to the constitution, and less frequently gives\nrise to other diseases, than the smallpox, either natural\nor inoculated.\n\nThe college feel themselves called upon to state this\nstrongly, because it has been objected to vaccination,\nthat it produces new, unheard-of, and monstrous dis-\neases. Of such affections no proofs have been produ-\nced, and, after diligent inquiry, the college believe\nthem to have been either the inventions of designing,\nor the mistakes of ignorant men. In these respects\nthen, in its mildness, its safety, and its consequences,\nthe individual may look for the peculiar advantages of\nvaccination. The benefits which flow from it to so-\nciety are infinitely more considerable, it spreads no in-\nfection, and can be communicated only by inoculation.\nIt is from a consideration of the pernicious effects of\nthe smallpox, that the real value of vaccination is to be\nestimated. The natural smallpox has been supposed to\ndestroy a sixth part of all whom it attacks; and that\neven by inoculation, where that has been general in\nparishes and towns, about one in 300 has usually died.\nIt is not sufficiently known, or not adverted to, that\nnearly one-tenth, some years more than one-tenth of\nthe whole mortality in London, is occasioned by the\nsmallpox; and however beneficial the inoculation of the\nsmallpox may have been to individuals, it appears to\nhave kept up a constant source of contagion, which has\nbeen the means of increasing the number of deaths by\nwhat is called the natural disease. It cannot be doubted\nthat this mischief has been extended by the inconsiderate\nmanner in which great numbers of persons, even\nsince the introduction of vaccination, are still every\nyear inoculated with the smallpox, and afterwards re-\nquired to attend two or three times a-week at the\nplaces of inoculation, through every stage of their ill-\nnesses.\n\nFrom this, then, the public are to expect the great\nand uncontroverted superiority of vaccination, that it\ncommunicates no casual infection, and, while it is a\nprotection to the individual, it is not prejudicial to the\npublic.\n\nIII. The college of physicians, in reporting their\nobservations and opinions on the evidence adduced in\nsupport of vaccination, feel themselves authorized to state\nthat a body of evidence so large, so temperate, and so\nconfident, was perhaps never before collected upon any\nmedical question. A discovery so novel, and to which\nthere was nothing analogous known in nature, though\nresting on the experimental observations of the inventor,\nwas at first received with diffidence: it was not, how-\never, difficult for others to repeat his experiments, by\nwhich the truth of his observations was confirmed, and\nthe doubts of the cautious were gradually dispelled by\nextensive experience. At the commencement of the\npractice, almost all that were vaccinated were after-\nwards submitted to the inoculation of the smallpox;\nmany underwent this operation a second, and even a\nthird time, and the uniform success of these trials\nquickly bred confidence in the new discovery. But the\nevidence of the security derived from vaccination against\nthe smallpox does not rest alone upon those who after-\nwards underwent various inoculation, although amounting to many thousands; for it appears, from nu-\nmerous observations communicated to the college, that\nthose who have been vaccinated are equally secure\nagainst the contagion of epidemic smallpox. Towns,\nindeed, and districts of the country, in which vaccina-\ntion had been general, have afterwards had the small-\npox prevalent on all sides of them without suffering\nfrom the contagion. There are also in the evidence a\nfew examples of epidemic smallpox having been sub-\ndued by a general vaccination. It will not, therefore,\nappear extraordinary that many who have communicat-\ned their observations should state, that though at first\nthey thought unfavourably of the practice, experience\nhad now removed all their doubts.\n\nIt has been already mentioned, that the evidence is\nnot universally favourable, although it is in truth nearly\nso, for there are a few who entertain sentiments differ-\ning widely from those of the great majority of their\nbrethren. The college, therefore, deemed it their du-\nty, in a particular manner, to inquire upon what\ngrounds and evidence the opposers of vaccination rested\ntheir opinions. From personal examination, as well as\nfrom their writings, they endeavoured to learn the full\nextent and weight of their objections. They found\nthem without experience in vaccination, supporting\ntheir opinions by hearsay information and hypothetical\nreasoning; and, upon investigating the facts which\nthey advanced, they found them to be either misappre-\nhended or misrepresented; or that they fell under the\ndescription of cases of imperfect smallpox, before noticed,\nand which the college have endeavoured fairly to\nappreciate.\n\nThe practice of vaccination is but of eight years\nstanding, and its promoters, as well as opponents, must\nkeep in mind, that a period so short is too limited to ac-\nertain every point, or to bring the art to that perfec-\ntion of which it may be capable. The truth of this\nwill readily be admitted by those acquainted with the\nhistory of inoculation for the smallpox. Vaccination is\nnow, however, well understood, and its character accu-\nrately described. Some deviations from the usual course\nhave occasionally occurred, which the author of the\npractice has called spurious cowpox, by which the pub-\nlic have been misled, as if there were a true and a false\ncowpox; but it appears, that nothing more was meant,\nthan to express irregularity or difference from that com-\nmon form and progress of the vaccine pustule from\nwhich its efficacy is inferred. Those who perform vac-\ncination ought therefore to be well instructed, and\nshould have watched with the greatest care the regular\nprogress of the pustule, and learnt the most proper time\nfor taking the matter. There is little doubt that some\nof the failures are to be imputed to the inexperience of\nthe early vaccinators, and it is not unreasonable to ex-\npect that farther observation will yet suggest many im-\nprovements that will reduce the number of anomalous\ncases, and furnish the means of determining, with great-\ner precision, when the vaccine disease has been effec-\ntually received.\n\nThough the college of physicians have confined them-\nselves in estimating the evidence to such facts as have\noccurred in their own country, because the accuracy of\nthem could best be ascertained, they cannot be infini-\nble to the confirmation these receive from the reports of the successful introduction of vaccination, not only into every part of Europe, but throughout the vast continents of Asia and America.\n\nIV. Several causes have had a partial operation in retarding the general adoption of vaccination; some writers have greatly undervalued the security it affords, while others have considered it to be of a temporary nature only; but if any reliance is to be placed on the statements which have been laid before the college, its power of protecting the human body from the smallpox, though not perfect indeed, is abundantly sufficient to recommend it to the prudent and dispassionate, especially as the smallpox, in the few instances where it has subsequently occurred, has been generally mild and transient. The opinion that vaccination affords but a temporary security is supported by no analogy in nature, nor by the facts which have hitherto occurred. Although the experience of vaccine inoculation be only of a few years, yet the same disease, contracted by the milkers of cows, in some districts has been long enough known to ascertain that in them, at least the susceptibility of the smallpox contagion does not wear out by time.\n\nAnother cause, is the charge against vaccination of producing various new diseases of frightful and monstrous appearance. Representations of some of these have been exhibited in prints in a way to alarm the feelings of parents, and to instil dread and apprehension into the minds of the uninformed. Publications with such representations have been widely circulated, and though they originate either in gross ignorance, or wilful misrepresentation, yet have they lessened the confidence of many, particularly of the lower classes, in vaccination; no permanent effects, however, in retarding the progress of vaccination, need be apprehended from such causes, for, as soon as the public shall view them coolly and without surprise, they will excite contempt, and not fear.\n\nThough the college of physicians are of opinion that the progress of vaccination has been retarded in a few places by the above causes, yet they conceive that its general adoption has been prevented by causes far more powerful, and of a nature wholly different. The lower orders of society can hardly be induced to adopt precautions against evils which may be at a distance; nor can it be expected from them, if these precautions are attended with expense. Unless therefore, from the immediate dread of epidemic smallpox, neither vaccination nor inoculation appear at any time to have been general, and when the cause of terror has passed by, the public have relapsed again into a state of indifference and apathy, and the salutary practice has come to a stand. It is not easy to suggest a remedy for an evil so deeply imprinted in human nature. To inform and instruct the public mind may do much, and it will probably be found that the progress of vaccination in different parts of the united kingdom will be in proportion to that instruction. Were encouragement given to vaccination, by offering it to the poorer classes without expense, there is little doubt but it would in time supersede the inoculation for the smallpox, and thereby various sources of various infection would be cut off; but till vaccination becomes general, it will be impossible to prevent the constant recurrence of the natural smallpox by means of those who are inoculated, except it should appear proper to the legislature to adopt, in its wisdom, some measure by which those who still, from terror or prejudice, prefer the smallpox to the vaccine disease, may, in thus consulting the gratification of their own feelings, be prevented from doing mischief to their neighbours.\n\nFrom the whole of the above considerations, the college of physicians feel it their duty strongly to recommend the practice of vaccination. They have been led to this conclusion by no preconceived opinion, but by the most unbiased judgement, formed from an irresistible weight of evidence which has been laid before them. For when the number, the respectability, the disinterestedness, and the extensive experience of its advocates, is compared with the feeble and imperfect testimonies of its few opposers; and when it is considered that many, who were once adverse to vaccination, have been convinced by further trials, and are now to be ranked among its warmest supporters, the truth seems to be established as firmly as the nature of such a question admits; so that the college of physicians conceive that the public may reasonably look forward with some degree of hope to the time when all opposition shall cease, and the general concurrence of mankind shall at length be able to put an end to the ravages at least, if not to the existence, of the smallpox.\n\nLUCAS PEPYS, PRESIDENT.\n\nRoyal College of Physicians,\n\n16th April, 1807.\n\nJA.

A variety of causes operated to retard its general adoption, amongst which the novelty of the practice, and the extraordinary effects attributed to vaccination, would naturally take the lead.\n\n\"Variolous inoculation had been long, almost exclusively, in the hands of a particular branch of the profession, whose prejudices and interests were strongly opposed to the new practice; and by their being the usual medical attendants in families, and especially employed in the diseases of children, their opinions had greater effect upon the minds of parents. The smallpox is rendered a much less formidable disease in this country by the frequency of inoculation for it, than it is in other parts of his majesty's dominions, where prejudices against inoculation have prevailed; hence parents, not unnaturally, objected to the introduction of a new disease, rather than not recur to that, with the mildness and safety of which they were well acquainted.\n\n\"In the beginning of the year 1804, the cowpox institution was established under the patronage of the earl of Hardwicke, and it is from this period that we may date the general introduction of vaccination into this city, and throughout all parts of Ireland.\n\n\"The success of the institution, in forwarding the new practice, is to be attributed in a great measure to the respectability of the gentlemen who superintend it, and to the diligence, zeal, and attention of Dr Labatt, their secretary and inoculator. In order to show the progress which has been made in extending vaccination, your committee refer to the reports of the Cowpox Institution for the last two years, and to extracts from their register for the present year.\n\n| Year | Patients Inoculated | Packets Issued to Practitioners in General | Packets to Army Surgeons |\n|------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 1804 | 578                 | 776                                      | 236                     |\n| 1805 | 1032                | 1124                                     | 178                     |\n| 1806 | 1356                | 1340                                     | 220                     |\n| Total| 2966                | 3240                                     | 634                     |\n\n\"In the above statement, the numbers are averaged to the end of the present year, on the supposition of patients referring to the institution as usual. The correspondence of the institution appears to be very general throughout every part of Ireland, and by the accounts received, as well from medical practitioners as others, the success of vaccination seems to be uniform and effectual. At the present period, in the opinion of your committee, there are few individuals in any branch of the profession, who oppose the practice of vaccination in this part of his majesty's dominions.\n\n\"It is the opinion of your committee, that the practice of cowpox inoculation is safe, and that it fully answers all the purposes that have been intended by its introduction. At the same time, your committee is willing to allow that doubtful cases have been reported to them as having occurred, of persons suffering from smallpox, who had been previously vaccinated. Upon minute investigation, however, it has been found, that these supposed instances originated generally in error, misrepresentation, or the difficulty of discriminating between smallpox and other eruptions, no case having come to the knowledge of your committee, duly authenticated by respectable and competent judges, of genuine smallpox succeeding the regular vaccine disease.\n\n\"The practice of vaccination becomes every day more extended; and, when it is considered that the period at which it came into general use in Ireland is to be reckoned from so late a date, your committee is of opinion, that it has made already as rapid a progress as could be expected.\n\n(Signed) \"James Cleghorn.\n\"Daniel Mills.\n\"Hugh Ferguson.\"\n\nN°. II.\n\nPhysicians Hall, Edinburgh, 26th Nov. 1806.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nTHE Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh have but little opportunity themselves of making observations on vaccination, as that practice is entirely conducted by surgeon apothecaries, and other medical practitioners not of their college, and as the effects produced by it are so inconsiderable and slight, that the aid of a physician is never required.\n\nThe College know that in Edinburgh it is universally approved of by the profession, and by the higher and middle ranks of the community; and that it has been much more generally adopted by the lower orders of the people than ever the inoculation for smallpox was, and they believe the same to obtain all over Scotland.\n\nWith regard to any causes which have hitherto prevented its general adoption, they are acquainted with none except the negligence or ignorance of parents among the common people, or their mistaken ideas of the impropriety or criminality of being accessory to the production of any disease among their children, or the difficulty or impossibility, in some of our country districts, of procuring vaccine matter, or a proper person to inoculate.\n\nThe evidence in favour of vaccination appeared to the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh so strong and decisive, that in May last, they spontaneously and unanimously elected Dr Jenner an honorary fellow of their college—a mark of distinction which they very rarely confer, and which they confine almost exclusively to foreign physicians of the first eminence.\n\nThey did this with a view to publish their opinion with regard to vaccination, and in testimony of their conviction of the immense benefits which have been, and which will in future be derived to the world, from inoculation for the cowpox, and as a mark of their sense of Dr Jenner's very great merits and ability in introducing and promoting this invaluable practice.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nGentlemen,\n\nYour most obedient humble servant,\n\nTH.

III.\nAt a special court of assistants of the Royal College of Surgeons, convened by order of the Master, and held at the College on Tuesday the 17th day of March 1807;\n\nMr Governor Lucas in the chair:\n\nMr Long, as chairman of the board of curators, reported, that the board are now ready to deliver their report on the subject of vaccination.\n\nIt was then moved, seconded, and resolved, that a report from the board of curators, on the subject of vaccination, which was referred to their consideration by the court of assistants, on the 21st day of November last, be now received.\n\nMr Long then delivered to Mr Governor Lucas (presiding in the absence of the master) a report from the board of curators.\n\nIt was then moved, seconded, and resolved, that the report, delivered by Mr Long, be now read; and it was read accordingly, and is as follows:\n\nTo the Court of Assistants of the Royal College of Surgeons in London.\n\nTHE report of the Board of Curators, on the subject of vaccination, referred to them by the court, on the 21st day of November 1806; made to the court on the 17th of March 1807.\n\nThe court of assistants having received a letter from the Royal College of Physicians of London, addressed to this college, stating, that his majesty had been graciously pleased, in compliance with an address from the honourable House of Commons, to direct his Royal College of Physicians of London to enquire into the state of vaccination in the united kingdom, to report their observations and opinion upon that practice, upon the evidence adduced in its support, and upon the causes which have hitherto retarded its general adoption; that the college were then engaged in the investigation of the several propositions thus referred to them, and requesting this college to co-operate and communicate with them, in order that the report thereupon might be made as complete as possible.\n\nAnd having, on the 21st day of November last, referred such letter to the consideration of the board of curators, with authority to take such steps respecting the contents thereof as they should judge proper, and report their proceedings thereon, from time to time, to the court: the board proceeded with all possible dispatch to the consideration of the subject.\n\nThe board being of opinion, that it would be proper to address circular letters to the members of this college, with a view of collecting evidence, they submitted to the consideration of the court, holden on the 17th day of December last, the drafts of such letter as appeared to them best calculated to answer that end; and the same having been approved by the court, they caused copies thereof to be sent to all the members of the college in the united kingdom, whose residence could be ascertained, in the following form; viz,\n\n\"Sir,\n\n\"The Royal College of Surgeons being desirous to co-operate with the Royal College of Physicians of London, in obtaining information respecting vaccination, submit to you the following questions, to which the favour of your answer is requested.\n\n\"By order of the Court of Assistants,\n\n\"Okey Belfour, Secretary.\"\n\nLincoln's-Inn Fields,\nDec. 15, 1806.\n\n\"1st. How many persons have you vaccinated?\n\"2nd. Have any of your patients had the smallpox after vaccination? In the case of every such occurrence, at what period was the vaccine matter taken from the vehicle? How was it preserved? How long before it was infected? What was the appearance of the inflammation? And what the interval between vaccination and the variolous eruption?\n\"3rd. Have any bad effects occurred in your experience in consequence of vaccination? And if so, what were they?\n\"4th. Is the practice of vaccination increasing or decreasing in your neighborhood; if decreasing, to what cause do you impute it?\"\n\nTo such letters the board have received 426 answers: and the following are the results of their investigation:\n\nThe number of persons, stated in such letters to have been vaccinated, is 164,381.\nThe number of cases in which smallpox had followed vaccination is 56.\n\nThe board think it proper to remark under this head, that, in the enumeration of cases in which smallpox has succeeded vaccination, they have included none but those in which the subject was vaccinated by the surgeon reporting the facts.\n\nThe bad consequences which have arisen from vaccination are, eruptions of the skin in 66 cases, and inflammation of the arm in 24 instances, of which three proved fatal.\n\nVaccination, in the greater number of counties from which reports have been received, appears to be increasing; it may be proper however to remark, that, in the metropolis, it is on the decrease.\n\nThe principal reasons assigned for the decrease are,\n\nImperfect vaccination,\nInstances of smallpox after vaccination,\nSupposed bad consequences,\nPublications against the practice,\nPopular prejudices.\n\nAnd such report having been considered, it was moved, seconded, and\n\nResolved, That the report now read, be adopted by this court, as the answer of the court to the letter of the Royal College of Physicians, of the 23rd day of October last, on the subject of vaccination.\n\nResolved, That a copy of these minutes and resolutions, signed by Mr Governor Lucas (presiding at this court in the presence of the master) be transmitted by the secretary to the register of the Royal College of Physicians.\n\n(Signed) Wm Lucas.\n\nNo. IV.\nSir,\n\nEdinburgh, March 3, 1807.\n\nI mentioned in my former letter, that I would take the earliest opportunity of laying before the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the communication with which the Royal College of Physicians of London had honoured them, on the 23rd of October last:\n\nI am now directed by the Royal College to send the following answer on that important subject.\n\nThe practice of vaccine inoculation, both in private, and at the vaccine institution established here in 1801, is increasing so rapidly, that for two or three years past, the smallpox has been reckoned rather a rare occurrence, even among the lower orders of the inhabitants of this city, unless in some particular quarters about twelve months ago; and, among the higher ranks of the inhabitants, the disease is unknown.\n\nThe members of the Royal College of Surgeons have much pleasure in reporting, that, as far as their experience goes, they have no doubt of the permanent security against the smallpox which is produced by the constitutional affection of the cowpox; and that such has hitherto been their success in vaccination, as also to gain for it the confidence of the public, inasmuch that they have not been required, for some years past, to inoculate any person with smallpox who had not previously undergone the inoculation with the cowpox.\n\nThe members of the Royal College have met with no occurrence in their practice of cowpox inoculation which could operate in their minds to its disadvantage; and they beg leave particularly to notice, that they have seen no instance of obstinate eruptions, or of new and dangerous diseases, which they could attribute to the introduction among mankind this of mild preventive of smallpox. The Royal College of Surgeons know of no causes which have hitherto retarded the adoption of vaccine inoculation here; on the contrary, the practice has become general within this city; and from many thousand packets of vaccine matter having been sent by the members of the Royal College, and the vaccine institution here, to all parts of the country, the Royal College have reason to believe that the practice has been as generally adopted throughout this part of the united kingdom as could have been expected from the distance of some parts of the country from proper medical assistance, and other circumstances of that nature.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\nWM FARQUHARSON,\n\nPresident of the Royal College and Incorporation of Surgeons of Edinburgh.\n\nNo. V.\n\nRoyal College of Surgeons in Ireland,\n\nDublin, February 4th, 1807.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to transmit to you the inclosed report of a committee of the College of Surgeons in Ireland, to whom was referred a letter from the Royal College of Physicians in London, relative to the present state of vaccination in this part of the united kingdom; and to state, that the College of Surgeons will be highly gratified by more frequent opportunities of corresponding with the English College of Physicians on any subject which may conduce to the advancement of science, and the welfare of the public.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour most obedient humble servant,\n\nJAMES HENTHORN, Secretary.\n\nAt a meeting of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, held at their Theatre, on Tuesday the 13th day of January 1807.\n\nFRANCIS M'EVoy, ESQ. President.\n\nMr Johnson reported from the committee, to whom was referred a letter from the College of Physicians, London, relative to the present state of vaccination in the united kingdom, &c. &c. that they met, and came to the following resolutions:\n\nThat it appears to this committee, That inoculation with vaccine infection is now very generally adopted by the surgical practitioners in this part of the united kingdom, as a preventive of smallpox.\n\nThat it appears to this committee, that from the 25th day of March 1806 to the 25th of November 1806, 11,504 persons have been inoculated with vaccine infection at the dispensary for infant poor, and 2831 at the cowpox institution, making a total of 14,335; exclusive of the number inoculated at hospitals and other places, where no registry is made and preserved.\n\nThat it is the opinion of this committee, that the cowpox has been found to be a mild disease, and rarely attended with danger, or any alarming symptom, and that the few cases of smallpox which have occurred in this country, after supposed vaccination, have been satisfactorily proved to have arisen from accidental circumstances, and cannot be attributed to the want of efficacy in the genuine vaccine infection as a preventive of smallpox.\n\nThat it is the opinion of this committee, that the causes which have hitherto retarded the more general adoption of vaccination in Ireland, have, in a great measure, proceeded from the prejudices of the lower classes of the people, and the interest of some irregular practitioners.\n\nTo which report the College agreed.\n\nExtract from the minutes,\n\nJAMES HENTHORN, Secretary.\n\nAfter this report, we cannot help thinking that the British legislature would be fully warranted for passing an act prohibiting the inoculation of smallpox under very severe penalties, and ordering all those who may be subjected to smallpox by accidental contagion to be confined to lazarettoes, or at least to their own houses, under a proper guard, to prevent the communication of infection, till their complete recovery. By such an act, there is good ground to believe, that the loathsome and dangerous disease of smallpox would in a few years be exterminated in Britain.\nBut although providence has thus furnished mankind with an easy mode of preserving their offspring from the danger of smallpox, by the inoculation of the cowpox at an early period of life, yet not a few deaths from the natural smallpox have occurred in Britain even during the course of the present year.\n\nWhen the preventive has not been duly employed, after the contagion of variola is introduced into the body, nothing yet known will prevent the disease from running its course, either under the mild or confluent form; and the endeavours of the medical practitioner are altogether to be employed in rendering that course as favourable as possible by mitigating symptoms.\n\nIn the mild or distinct smallpox, the strictest antiphlogistic regimen is to be enjoined. Gentle refrigerant cathartics are often useful, and mild diluents should be copiously employed. Under these remedies the disease will generally run its course without much inconvenience. But it will sometimes be necessary to employ remedies for obviating particular urgent symptoms, such as gargarisms or blisters for affections of the throat.\n\nIn the malignant smallpox, besides the same refrigerant plan of cure which is best accommodated to the mild, as the secondary fever shews evident marks of a putrid tendency, it is necessary to employ those remedies which are accommodated to typhus, and accordingly recourse is not only had to opiates and cardiacs, but to wine, cinchona, and the mineral acids.\n\nGenus XXIX. VARICELLA.\n\nCHICKENPOX.\n\nVaricella, Vog. 42.\nVariola lymphatica, Sauv. fp. 1.\nAnglis, The CHICKENPOX, Edin. Med. Essays, vol. ii. art. 2. near the end. Heberden, Med. Transact. art. 17. The Watery-Pox.\n\nThis is in general a very slight disease; and is attended with so little danger, that it would not merit any notice, if it were not apt to be confounded with the smallpox, and thus give occasion to an opinion that a person might have the smallpox twice in his life; or they are apt to deceive into a false security those who have never had the smallpox, and make them believe that they are safe when in reality they are not. This eruption breaks out in many, according to Dr Heberden, without any illness or previous sign; in others it is preceded by a slight degree of chilliness, languor, cough, broken sleep, wandering pains, loss of appetite, and feverish state for three days.\n\nIn some patients the chickenpox make their first appearance on the back; but this perhaps is not constant. Most of them are of the common size of the smallpox, but some are less. Dr Heberden never saw them confluent, nor very numerous. The greatest number was about 12 on the face, and 200 over the rest of the body.\n\nOn the first day of the eruption they are reddish. On the second day there is at the top of most of them a very small bladder, about the size of a millet seed. This is sometimes full of a watery and colourless, sometime of a yellowish liquor, contained between the cuticle and skin. On the second, or, at the farthest, on the third day from the beginning of the eruption, as many of these pocks as are not broken seem arrived at their full maturity; and those which are fullest of that yellow liquor very much resemble what the genuine smallpox are on the fifth or sixth day, especially where there happens to be a larger space than ordinary occupied by the extravasated serum. It happens to most of them, either on the first day that this little bladder arises, or on the day after, that its tender cuticle is burst by the accidental rubbing of the clothes, or by the patient's hands to allay the itching which attends this eruption. A thin scab is then formed at the top of the pock, and the swelling of the other part abates, without its ever being turned into pus, as it is in the smallpox. Some few escape being burst; and the little drop of liquor contained in the vesicle at the top of them, grows yellow and thick, and dries into a scab. On the fifth day of the eruption they are almost all dried and covered with a slight crust. The inflammation of these pocks is very small, and the contents of them do not seem to be owing to suppuration, as in the smallpox, but rather to what is extravasated under the cuticle by the ferosus vesicles of the skin, as in a common blister. It is not wonderful, therefore, that this liquor appears so soon as on the second day; and that, upon the cuticle being broken, it is presently succeeded by a flight scab: hence too, as the true skin is so little affected, no mark or fear is likely to be left, unless in one or two pocks, where, either by being accidentally much fretted, or by some extraordinary sharpness of the contents, a little ulcer is formed in the skin.\n\nThe patients scarce suffer anything throughout the whole progress of this illness, except some languidness of strength, spirits, and appetite; all which is probably owing to the confining of themselves to their chamber.\n\nRemedies are not likely to be much wanted in a disease attended with hardly any inconvenience, and which in so short a time is certainly cured of itself.\n\nThe principal marks by which the chickenpox may be distinguished from the smallpox are,\n\n1. The appearance, on the second or third day from the eruption, of that vesicle full of serum upon the top of the pock.\n\n2. The crust, which covers the pocks on the fifth day; at which time those of the smallpox are not at the height of their suppuration.\n\nForeign medical writers hardly ever mention the name of this distemper: and the writers of our own country scarce mention any thing more of it than its name. Morton speaks of it as if he supposed it to be a very mild genuine smallpox. But these two distempers are certainly totally different from one another, not only on account of their different appearances above mentioned, but because those who have had the smallpox are capable of being infected with the chickenpox; but those who have once had the chickenpox are not capable of having it again, though to such as have never had this distemper, it seems as infectious as the smallpox. Dr Heberden wetted a thread in the most concealed pus-like liquor of the chickenpox which he could find; and after making a slight incision,\nExanthemata, it was confined upon the arm of one who had formerly had it; the little wound healed up immediately, and showed no signs of any infection.\n\nFrom the great similitude between the two distempers, it is probable, that instead of the smallpox, some persons have been inoculated from the chickenpox; and that the distemper which has succeeded, has been mistaken for the smallpox by hasty or unexperienced observers.\n\nThere is sometimes seen an eruption, concerning which Dr Heberden is in doubt whether it be one of the many unnoticed cutaneous distempers, or only a more malignant sort of chickenpox.\n\nThis disorder is preceded for three or four days by all the symptoms which forerun the chickenpox; but in a much higher degree. On the fourth or fifth day the eruption appears, with a very little abatement of the fever: the pains likewise of the limbs and back still continue, to which are joined pains of the gums. The pox are redder than the chickenpox, and spread wider; and hardly rise so high, at least not in proportion to their size. Instead of one little head or vesicle of a fleshy matter, there have from four to ten or twelve. They go off just like the chickenpox, and are distinguishable from the smallpox by the same marks; besides which, the continuance of the pains and fever after the eruption, and the degree of both these, though there be not above 20 pocks, are circumstances never happening in the smallpox.\n\nGenus XXX.

This disease begins with a cold stage, which is soon followed by a hot, with the ordinary symptoms of thirst, anorexia, anxiety, sickness, and vomiting; and these are more or less considerable in different cases. Sometimes from the beginning the fever is sharp and violent: often, for the first two days, it is obscure and inconsiderable; but always becomes violent before the eruption, which commonly happens on the fourth day. This eruptive fever, from the beginning of it, is always attended with hoarseness, a frequent hoarse dry cough, and often with some difficulty of breathing. At the same time, the eyelids are somewhat swelled; the eyes are a little inflamed, and pour out tears; and with this there is a coryza, and frequent sneezing. For the most part, a constant drowsiness attends the beginning of this disease. The eruption, as we have said, commonly appears upon the fourth day, first on the face, and successively on the lower parts of the body. It appears first in small red points; but, soon after, a number of these appear in clusters, which do not arise in visible pimples, but, by the touch, are found to be a little prominent. This is the case on the face; but, in other parts of the body, the prominency, or roughness, is hardly to be perceived. On the face, the eruption retains its redness, or has it increased for two days; but on the third, the vivid redness is changed to a brownish red; and in a day or two more the eruption entirely disappears, while a mealy desquamation takes place. During the whole time of the eruption, the face is somewhat turbid, but seldom considerably swelled. Sometimes, after the eruption has appeared, the fever ceases entirely: but this is seldom the case; and more commonly the fever continues or is increased after the eruption, and does not cease till after the desquamation. Even then the fever does not always cease, but continues with various duration and effect. Though the fever happen to cease upon the eruption's taking place, it is common for the cough to continue till after the desquamation, and sometimes much longer. In all cases, while the fever continues, the cough also continues, generally with an increase of the difficulty of breathing; and both of these symptoms sometimes arise to a degree which denotes a pneumonic affection. This may happen at any period of the disease; but very often it does not come on till after the desquamation of the eruption.\n\nAfter the same period, also, a diarrhoea frequently comes on, and continues for some time.\n\nIt is common for measles, even when they have not been of a violent kind, to be followed by inflammatory affections, particularly ophthalmia and phthisis. If blood be drawn from a vein in the measles, with circumstances necessary to favour the separation of the fibrine, this always appears separated, and lying on the surface of the crustamentum, as in inflammatory diseases. For the most part, the measles, even when violent, are without any putrid tendency; but in some cases, such a tendency appears both in the course of the disease, and especially after the ordinary course of it is finished.\n\nCause. The measles are occasioned by a peculiar kind of contagion, the nature of which is not understood; and which, like that of the smallpox, affects a person only once in his life.\n\nPrognosis. From the description of this distemper already given, it appears that the measles are attended with a catarrhal affection, and with an inflammatory diathesis to a considerable degree; and therefore the danger of them is to be apprehended chiefly from the coming on of a pneumonic inflammation.\n\nCure. In measles, as well as in smallpox, the disease from its nature must necessarily run a determined course; and therefore the sole aim of a practitioner is to conduct this course in the easiest manner, by preventing and obviating urgent symptoms.\n\nFrom the consideration mentioned in the prognosis,\nit will be obvious, that the remedies especially necessary are those which may obviate and diminish the inflammatory diathesis; and therefore, in a particular manner, blood-letting. This remedy may be employed at any time in the course of the disease, or after the ordinary course of it is finished. It is to be employed more or less, according to the urgency of the symptoms of fever, cough, and dyspnea; and generally may be employed very freely. But as the symptoms of pneumonic inflammation seldom come on during the eruptive fever, and as this is sometimes violent immediately before the eruption, though a sufficiently mild disease be to follow; bleeding is seldom very necessary during the eruptive fever, and may often be referred for the times of greater danger which are perhaps to follow.\n\nIn all cases of measles, where there are no marks of putrefaction, and where there is no reason, from the known nature of the epidemic, to apprehend putrefaction, bleeding is the remedy most to be depended upon; but assistance may also be drawn from cooling purgatives; and from blistering on the sides or between the shoulders. The dry cough may be alleviated by the large use of demulcent pectorals, mucilaginous, oily, or sweet. It may, however, be observed, with respect to these demulcents, that they are not so powerful in involving and correcting the acrimony of the mass of blood as has been imagined; and that their chief operation is by lubricating the fauces, and thereby defending them from the irritation of acids, either arising from the lungs or distilling from the head. For moderating and quieting the cough in this disease, opiates certainly prove the most effectual means, whenever they can be safely employed. In the measles, in which an inflammatory state prevails in a considerable degree, opiates have indeed by some been supposed to be inadmissible; but experience abundantly demonstrates, that the objection made to their use is merely hypothetical; and even in cases where, from a high degree of pyrexia and of dyspnea, there is reason to fear the presence, or at least the danger, of pneumonic inflammation, opiates are highly useful, after bleeding, to obviate or abate the inflammatory state, has been duly employed: in such cases, while the cough and watchfulness are the urgent symptoms, opiates may be safely exhibited, and with great advantage. In all the exanthemata, there is an acrimony diffused over the system, which gives a considerable irritation; and, for obviating the effects of this, opiates are useful, and always proper, when no particular contraindication prevails.\n\nWhen the desquamation of the measles is finished, though then there should be no disorder remaining, physicians have thought it necessary to purge the patient several times, with a view to draw off what have been called the dregs of this disease; that is, a portion of the morbid matter which is supposed to remain long in the body. Dr Cullen does not reject this supposition; but at the same time cannot believe that the remains of the morbid matter, diffused over the whole mass of blood, can be wholly drawn off by purging; and therefore thinks, that, to avoid the consequence of the measles, it is not the drawing off the morbid matter which we need to study, so much as to obviate and remove the inflammatory state of the system which had been induced by the disease. With this last view, indeed, purging may still be a proper remedy; but bleeding, in proportion to the symptoms of inflammatory disposition, is still more so.\n\nFrom our late experience of the use of cold air in the eruptive fever of the smallpox, some physicians have been of opinion that the practice may be transferred to the measles; but this point has not yet been determined by sufficiently extensive experience. We are certain, that external heat may be very hurtful in the measles, as in most other inflammatory diseases; and therefore, that the body ought to be kept in a moderate temperature during the whole course of the disease; but how far, at any period of the disease, cold air may be applied with safety, is still uncertain. Analogy, though so often the resource of physicians, is frequently fallacious; and further, though the analogy with the smallpox might lead to the application of cold air during the eruptive fever of the measles, the analogy with catarrh seems to be against the practice.\n\nWhen the eruption is upon the skin, there are many instances of cold air making it disappear, and thereby producing much disorder in the system; and there are also frequent instances of these symptoms being removed by restoring the heat of the body, and thereby again bringing out the eruption.\n\nUpwards of 20 years ago, inoculation for the measles was proposed, and practiced in several instances with success, by Dr Home of Edinburgh. His method of communicating the infection was, by applying to an incision in each arm cotton moistened with the blood of a patient labouring under the measles; but with others who have made similar trials, the attempt has not yet succeeded. Attempts have been made to inoculate this disease by means of the fluid discharged under the form of tears, the squamae falling from the surface, and the like; but there is reason to believe, that where it was imagined the infection had thus been communicated, the contagion was only carried about the person inoculating and communicated in the ordinary way.\n\nFrom inoculation of the measles, it is imagined that several advantages may be obtained; and among others, it is thought the soreness of the eyes may be mitigated, the cough abated, and the fever rendered less severe. But the practice was never much employed, and now is scarce ever heard of.\n\nGenus XXXI. MILIARIA.\n\nThe Miliary Fever.\n\nMiliaria, Liv. 7.\nMiliaris, Sauv. gen. 95.

This disease is said to have been unknown to the ancients, and that it appeared for the first time in Saxony about the middle of the last century. It is said to have since spread from thence into all the other countries of Europe; and since the period mentioned, to have appeared in many countries in which it had never appeared before.\n\nFrom the time of its having been first taken notice of, it has been described and treated of by many different writers; and by all of them, till very lately, has been considered as a peculiar idiopathic disease. It is said to have been constantly attended with peculiar symptoms. It comes on with a cold stage, which is often considerable. The hot stage, which follows, is attended with great anxiety, and frequent sighing. The heat of the body becomes great, and soon produces profuse sweating, preceded, however, with a sense of pricking, as of pin points in the skin; and the sweat is of a peculiar rank and disagreeable odour. The eruption appears sooner or later in different persons, but at no determined period of the disease. It seldom or never appears upon the face; but appears first upon the neck and breast; and from thence often spreads over the whole body.\n\nThe eruption named military, is said to be of two kinds; the one named the red, the other the white military. The former, which in English is strictly named a rub, is commonly allowed to be a symptomatic affection; and as the latter is the only one that has any pretensions to be considered as an idiopathic disease, it is this only that we shall more particularly describe and treat of under this genus.\n\nWhat is then called the white military eruption, appears at first like the red, in very small red pimples, for the most part distinct, but sometimes cluttered together. Their little prominence is better distinguished by the finger than by the eye. Soon after the appearance of this eruption, and, at least, on the second day, a small vesicle is visible upon the top of the pimples. At first the vesicle is whey-coloured; but soon becomes white, and stands out like a little globule. In two or three days, these globules break, or are rubbed off; and are succeeded by small crusts, which soon after fall off in small scales. While one set of pimples takes this course, another set arises to run the same; so that the disease often continues upon the skin, for many days together. Sometimes when one crop of this eruption has disappeared, another, after some interval, is produced. And it has been further observed, that in some persons there is such a disposition to this disease, that they have been affected with it several times in the course of their lives.\n\nThis disease is said to affect both sexes, and persons of all ages and constitutions; but it has been observed at all times, to affect especially, and most frequently, lying-in women.\n\nIt is often accompanied with violent symptoms, and has frequently proved fatal. The symptoms, however, attending it are very various; but no symptom, or concurrence of symptoms, are steadily the same in different persons, so as to give any specific character to the disease. When the disease is violent, the most common symptoms are phrenetic, comatose, and convulsive affections, which are also symptoms of all fevers treated by a very warm regimen.\n\nWhile there is such a variety of symptoms appearing in this disease, it is not to be expected that any one particular method of cure can be proposed; and, accordingly, we find in different writers different methods and remedies prescribed; frequent disputes about the most proper; and those received and recommended by some opposed and deserted by others.\n\nIt appears, however, to Dr. Cullen, very improbable, that this was really a new disease, when it was first considered as such. There are very clear traces of it in authors who wrote long before that period; and though there were not, we know that ancient descriptions were often inaccurate and imperfect, particularly with respect to cutaneous affections; and we know also that those affections which commonly appeared as symptomatic only, were often neglected, or confounded together under a general appellation.\n\nThe antecedent symptoms of anxiety, sighing, and pricking of the skin, which have been spoken of as peculiar to this disease, are, however, common to many others; and perhaps to all those in which sweatings are forced out by a warm regimen. Of the symptoms said to be concomitant of this eruption, there are none which can be affirmed to be constant and peculiar but that of sweating. This, indeed, always precedes and accompanies the eruption; and, while the military eruption attends many different diseases, it never, however, appears in any of these but after sweating; and in persons labouring under the same diseases it does not appear, if in such persons sweating be avoided. It is therefore probable, that the eruption is the effect of sweating; and that it is the effect of a matter not before prevailing in the vessels of blood, but generated under particular circumstances in the skin itself. That it depends upon particular circumstances of the skin, is also probable from its being observed that the eruption seldom or never appears upon the face, although it affects the whole of the body besides; and that it comes upon those places especially which are more closely covered; and that it can be brought out upon particular places by external applications.\n\nIt is to be observed, that this eruptive disease differs from the other exanthemata in many circumstances, especially the following; that it is not contagious, and therefore never epidemic; that the eruption appears at no determined period of the disease; that the eruption has no determined duration; that successive eruptions frequently appear in the course of the same fever,\nExanthemata, fever, and that such eruptions frequently recur in the course of the same person's life. All this renders it very probable, that, in the miliary fever, the morbid matter is not a subtilising contagion communicated to the blood, and thence, in consequence of fever and assimilation, thrown out upon the surface of the body, but a matter occasionally produced in the skin itself by sweating.\n\nThis conclusion is further rendered probable from hence, that, while the miliary eruption has no symptoms or concourse of symptoms peculiar to itself, it, upon occasions, accompanies almost every febrile disease, whether inflammatory or putrid, if these happen to be attended with sweating; and from thence it may be presumed, that the miliary eruption is a symptomatic affection only, produced in the manner we have said.\n\nBut as this symptomatic affection does not always accompany every instance of sweating, it may be proper to inquire, what are the circumstances which especially determine this eruption to appear? And to this Dr Cullen gives no full and proper answer. He cannot say that there is any one circumstance which in all cases gives occasion to this eruption; nor can he say what different causes, in different cases, may give occasion to it. There is only one observation that can be made to the purpose; and it is, that these persons, sweating under febrile diseases, are especially liable to the miliary eruption, who have been previously weakened by large evacuations, particularly of blood. This will explain why it happens to lying-in women more frequently than to any other persons; and to confirm this explanation, he has observed, that the eruption has happened to other women, though not in childbed, but who had been much subjected to a frequent and copious menstruation, and to an almost constant flux albus. He has also observed it to have happened to men in fevers, after wounds from which they had suffered a great loss of blood.\n\nFurther, That this eruption is produced by a certain state of debility, is, he thinks, probable, from its so often attending fevers of the putrid kind, which are always accompanied with great debility. It is true, that it also sometimes attends inflammatory diseases, when it cannot be accounted for in the same manner; but he believes it may be observed, that it especially attends those inflammatory diseases in which the sweats have been long protracted, or frequently repeated, and which have thereby produced a debility, and perhaps a debilitating putrid diathesis.\n\nThat, however, the miliary eruption is not necessarily or even generally connected with a certain state of debility, is abundantly evident from its being entirely wanting in by much the greater number of instances of typhoid fever, and in a variety of other diseases where every possible degree of debility occurs: And that it is not connected with any certain state of debility, still farther appears, both from the condition of those affected with it in different instances, which in point of strength is very various; and likewise from the continuance of fresh eruptions with the same individual, although during that time in very different states with respect to debility. It appears, therefore, much more probable, that it depends on some peculiar state of the surface, induced by the concurring influence of certain predisposing and occasional causes.\n\nIt appears so clearly that this eruption is always a Miliaria symptomatic and factitious affection, that Dr Cullen is persuaded it may be, in most cases, prevented merely by avoiding sweats. Spontaneous sweatings, in the beginning of diseases, are very rarely critical; and all sweatings not evidently critical should be prevented, or at least moderated; and the promoting them, by increasing external heat, is commonly very pernicious. Even critical sweats should hardly be encouraged by such means. If, therefore, spontaneous sweats arise, they are to be checked by the coolness of the chamber; by the lightness and looseness of the bedclothes; by the persons laying out their arms and hands; and by their taking cold drink: and in this way Dr Cullen thinks he has frequently prevented miliary eruptions, which were otherwise likely to have appeared, particularly in puerperal women.\n\nBut it may happen, when these precautions have been neglected, or from other circumstances, that a miliary eruption does actually appear; and the question will then be put, how the case is to be treated? This is a question of consequence; as there is reason to believe that the matter here generated is often of a virulent kind; it is often the offspring of putrefaction; and, when treated by increasing the external heat of the body, it seems to acquire a virulence which produces those symptoms mentioned above, and proves certainly fatal.\n\nIt has been an unhappy opinion with most physicians, that eruptive diseases were ready to be hurt by cold; and that it was therefore necessary to cover up the body very closely, and thereby increase the external heat. We now know that this is a mistaken opinion; that increasing the external heat of the body is very generally mischievous; and that several eruptions not only admit, but require the application of cold air. Dr Cullen is persuaded, therefore, that the practice which formerly prevailed in the case of miliary eruptions, of covering up the body closely, and both by external means and internal remedies encouraging the sweatings which accompany this eruption, was highly pernicious, and commonly fatal. He is therefore of opinion, that even when a miliary eruption has appeared, in all cases in which the sweating is not manifestly critical, we should employ all the means of stopping the sweating that are mentioned above; and he has sometimes had occasion to observe, that even the admission of cool air was safe and useful.\n\nThis is, in general, the treatment of miliary eruptions: but at the same time, the remedies suited to the primary disease are to be employed; and therefore when the eruption happens to accompany inflammatory affections, and the fulness and hardness of the pulse or other symptoms show an inflammatory state present, the case is to be treated by blood-letting, purging, and other antiphlogistic remedies.\n\nOn the other hand, when the miliary eruption attends diseases, in which debility and putrefaction prevail, it will be proper to avoid all evacuations, and to employ tonic and antiseptic remedies, particularly the cinchona, cold drink, and cold air.\n\nThe most distressing circumstance attending this affection, is the almost unsupportable sickness at stomach which frequently occurs, and which is often observed to precede fresh eruptions taking place during...\nExanthemata. The course of the disease. With the view of counteracting and alleviating this symptom, recourse is had to wine and other cordial medicines. But with many patients nothing is found to have so much influence as the use of camphor, particularly when introduced gradually in small doses, under the form of the *mifura camphorata* of the London Pharmacopoeia, or of the *emulso camphorata* of that of Edinburgh.\n\n**GENUS XXXII.

II. The SCARLET FEVER with Ulcerated Sore Throat.\n\nScarlatina anginosa. Withering on the Scarlet Fever.\n\nThe mild scarlet fever is described by Sydenham, who tells us that he can scarce account it a disease; and indeed nothing more seems to be necessary in the treatment of it than an antiphlogistic regimen, avoiding the application of cold air and cold drink. The disease, however, often rages epidemically, and is attended with very alarming symptoms, in which case it is called *scarlatina anginosa*.—The best description of this distemper has been published by Dr Withering in the year 1778. This disease made its appearance, we are told, at Birmingham and the neighbouring villages, about the middle of May 1778. It continued in all its force and frequency to the end of October; varying, however, in some of its symptoms, as the air grew colder. In the beginning of November it was rarely met with; but towards the middle of that month, when the air became warmer, it increased again, and in some measure resumed those appearances it presented in the summer months, but which it had lost during the cold winds in October.\n\nIt affected children more than adults; but seldom occurred in the former under two years of age, or in the latter if they had passed their fifth year.\n\n**Description.** With various general symptoms of fever, the patient at first complains of a dejection of spirits, a slight forenoon or rather stiffness in the neck, with a sense of tightness in the muscles of the neck and shoulders, as if they were bound with cords. The second day of the fever this soreness in the throat increases, and the patients find a difficulty in swallowing; but the difficulty seems less occasioned by the pain excited in the attempt, or by the tightness of the passage, than by an inability to throw the necessary muscles into action. The skin feels hot and dry, but not hard; and the patients experience frequent, small, pungent pains, as if touched with the point of a needle. The breath is hot and burning to the lips, and thirst makes them wish to drink; but the tendency to sickness, and the exertions necessary in deglutition, are so unpleasant, that they seldom care to drink much at a time. They have much uneasiness also from want of rest during the night. In the morning of the third day, the face, neck and breast appear redder than usual; in a few hours this redness becomes universal; and increases to such a degree of intensity, that the face, body, and limbs, resemble a boiled lobster in colour, and are evidently swollen. Upon pressure the redness vanishes, but soon returns again. The skin is smooth to the touch, nor is there the least appearance of pimples or pustules. The eyes and nostrils partake more or less of the general redness; and in proportion to the intensity of this colour in the eyes, the tendency to delirium prevails.\n\nThings continue in nearly this state for two or three days longer, when the intense scarlet gradually abates, a brown colour succeeds, and the skin becoming rough, peels off in small scales. The tumefaction subsides at the same time, and the patients gradually recover their strength and appetite.\n\nDuring the whole course of the disease, the pulse is quick, small, and uncommonly feeble, the urine small in quantity; the sub-maxillary glands somewhat enlarged and painful to the touch. The velum pendulum palati, the uvula, the tonsils, and gullet, as far as the eye can reach, partake of the general redness and tumefaction; but although collections of thick mucus, greatly resembling the specks or floughs in the putrid sore throat, sometimes occur, yet those are easily washed off; and real ulcerations of those parts were never observed.\n\nThese are the most usual appearances of this disorder; but it too frequently assumes a much more fatal form. In some children the delirium commences in a few hours after the first attack; the skin is intensely hot; the scarlet colour appears on the first or second day, and they die very early on the third. Others again, who survive this rapid termination, instead of recovering, as is usual, about the time the skin begins to get its natural colour, fall into a kind of lingering, and die at last in the course of six or eight weeks.\n\nIn adults, circular livid spots were frequently observed about the breast, knees, and elbows; also large blotches of red, and others of white intermixed, and often changing places.\n\nIn the month of October, when the air became colder, the scarlet colour of the skin was both less frequent and less permanent. Many patients had no appearance of it at all; while others, especially adults, had a few minute red pimples, crowned with white pellucid heads. The inside of the throat was considerably tumefied, its colour a dull red, sometimes tending to a livid. The pulse beat in general 130 or 140 strokes in a minute; was small, but hard, and sometimes sufficiently so to justify the opening of a vein; and the blood thus taken away, in every instance, when cool, appeared fizzy, and the whole countenance firm.\n\nHappy would it be, Dr Withering observes, if the baneful influence of this disorder terminated with the febrile symptoms. But in ten or fifteen days from the cessation of the fever, and when a complete recovery might be expected, another train of symptoms occurs, which at last frequently terminate fatally. The patients, after a few days amendment, feel something that prevents their farther approach to health;\nhealth; an unaccountable languor and debility prevails, a flabbiness in the limbs, an accelerated pulse, disturbed sleep, disrelish to food, and a scarcity of urine. These symptoms, we are told, are soon succeeded by swellings of a real dropsical nature, forming sometimes an anaëma, and on other occasions an ascites; and not unfrequently scarlatina has proved fatal, from supervening hydrothorax in consequence of the effusion of water into the chest. It is unnecessary to remark, that when this happens, a fatal termination is more sudden than from any other modification of dropsy.\n\nDr Withering, after examining the accounts given of this disease by different authors, proceeds to the diagnosis. It may be distinguished, he observes, from the petechial fever, by the eruption in the latter appearing seldom before the fourth day, by the regularity and distinctness of the spots, and by its principally occupying the neck, the back, and the loins. On the other hand, in the scarlet fever, the eruption generally appears about the third day; and consists either of broad blotches, or else one continued redness, which spreads over the face and the whole body.\n\nIn the fever called purpura, the pustules are prominent, keep their colour under pressure, and never appear early in the disease; whereas in the scarlet fever, the eruption appears more early, is not prominent, but perfectly smooth to the touch, and becomes quite white under pressure.\n\nAlthough the purple fever and scarlatina may be connected by some general cause, yet our author takes occasion to observe, that they cannot be mere modifications of the same eruption; for examples occur, he says, of the same person being first seized with one of these disorders, and afterwards with the other; but he never met with an instance of the same person having the scarlet fever twice; and he believes it to be as great an improbability as a repetition of the smallpox.\n\nThis disorder is particularly distinguished from the measles, we are told, by the want of that cough, watery eye, and running at the nose, which are known to be the predominant symptoms in the early state of the measles, but are never known to exist in the scarlatina.\n\nFrom the erysipelas this disease is distinguishable, by the limited seat of the former, together with its not being contagious.\n\nThe cynanche maligna, however, is according to Dr Withering more difficult to distinguish from this disease than any other; and yet the distinction is, he thinks, a matter of the greatest importance, as the method of treatment, according to him, ought to be extremely different.—Although, in a number of circumstances, these two diseases bear a very great resemblance, yet, with a little attention, the one may in general, he thinks, be distinguished from the other. From Dr Fothergill's account of the sore throat attended with ulcers, our author has made out the following characteristic circumstances of the two diseases, contrasted to one another.\n\n| Scarlatina Anginosa. | Angina Gangrenosa. |\n|---------------------|--------------------|\n| Season. Summer . . Autumn. | Season. Spring . . Winter. |\n\nIt is not pretended, Dr Withering remarks, that all the above-contrasted symptoms will be met with in every case. It is enough, he observes, that some of them appear; and that if, conjoined with the consideration of the prevailing constitution, they enable us to direct that mode of treatment which will most contribute to the relief of the sick.\n\nBut notwithstanding the attention which Dr Withering has bestowed upon this subject, we are still decidedly of opinion, that the disease which he has so accurately described under the title of scarlatina anginosa, is in reality the same affection with the malignant ulcerous sore throat of Huxham and Fothergill. During different epidemics, this disease, like smallpox and measles in different seasons, is considerably varied in its appearance. But still there occurs such a similarity as clearly marks the sameness of the affection. And indeed this, as in the case of the smallpox, is abundantly demonstrated by infection from one contagion giving protection against succeeding ones, although the appearances be much varied. This has particularly appeared at Edinburgh, where the disease has of late prevailed as an epidemic on five different years, viz. 1774-75, 1782-83, 1789-90, 1797-98, and 1804-5. During the first of these occasions, in the greater part of patients, the sore throats were of a very gangrenous and malignant nature; during the second, the disease more commonly appeared under the form of what might be called simple scarlatina; and during the other epidemics, the contagion was, if we may be allowed the expression, of an intermediate nature. But it is farther to be remarked, that during every one of those epidemics, when several children of a family were at the same time subjected\nMEDICINE.\n\nExanthemata subjected to the infection, in one the disease would have been attended with almost all the symptoms mentioned in the column of scarlatina anginosa, with respect to skin, eyes, throat, breath, bowels, termination of the affections, &c. In another, would have occurred all the symptoms with respect to those particulars which he has mentioned under the column of angina gangrenosa. While at the same time, in numberless instances, even in the same patient, the disease at its commencement has shown evident marks of an inflammatory, and at its termination of a putrid tendency. And there cannot be a doubt, that both the scarlatina anginosa of Withering, and the cynanche maligna, as described by Fothergill and Huxham, have occurred in every season and situation, and have affected persons of every age and constitution not before subjected to either disease.\n\nCauses. Dr Withering affirms, that the immediate cause of this disease is a poison of a peculiar kind communicable by contagion.\n\n2. That this poison first takes possession of the mucous membrane lining the fauces and the nose; and either by its action upon the secretory glands, or upon the mucus itself, assimilates that mucus to its own nature.\n\n3. That it is from this beginning, and from this only, that it spreads to the stomach, &c. and at length acts upon the system at large.\n\n4. That its first action upon the nerves is of a sedative or debilitating nature.\n\n5. That in consequence of certain laws of the nervous system, when the debilitating effects operate upon the sensorium commune, a reaction takes place; and that this reaction is, ceteris paribus, proportioned to the debilitating power.\n\n6. That, in consequence of this reaction of the nervous system, the vibratory motion of the capillary blood-vessels dependant thereon is greatly increased; an unusually large quantity of blood is accumulated in those vessels; the heart and large blood-vessels are deprived of their customary proportion; and hence, though stimulated to more frequent contraction, the pulse must necessarily be feeble.\n\n7. That as violent exertions are followed by debility, upon the cessation of the fever, the capillary vessels, which had acted with such unusual violence, are left in a state of extreme debility, and are long in recovering their tone; hence it is that so many patients afterwards become dropical.\n\nDr Withering next proceeds to the consideration of the different remedies, which either are at present in common use, or have been recommended as proper in this disease.\n\nCure. Blood-letting has been recommended by authors; but such was the state of the pulse in this disorder, at least during the summer months, that it was not in any instance thought advisable to take away blood. In some cases, indeed, where the fiery redness of the eyes seemed to demand the use of leeches, they were had recourse to, but never with any advantage. In the harvest months, when the pulse was more firm, and when suffocation seemed to be threatened from the swelling in the fauces, blood-letting was sometimes advised; but still with less advantage than one would have expected in almost any other situation.\n\nVomiting.] This, Dr Withering observes, seems to be the remedy of nature; and he is surprised how it should have been omitted by several authors who have gone before him. Vomiting, he says, most amply fulfils the indications arising both from a consideration of the cause and of the effects; and a liberal use of the remedy he holds forth as the true foundation for successful practice in scarlet fever and sore throat. His common form of emetic is a combination of tartar emetic and ipecacuanha, given in pretty smart doses; and these are to be repeated at least once in 48 hours, and in the worst cases so often as twice in 24 hours.\n\nPurging.] The action of purgatives is considered by Dr Withering as altogether repugnant to the curative indications in this disease: for the poisons, as formerly remarked, being received into the system by the fauces, the operation of a purge, instead of discharging it, can only promote its diffusion along the alimentary canal; and in fact, we are told, that when even a spontaneous purging supervenes in this disease, the patients think to amazingly fast, that it is not within the reach of art to support them. When, however, a considerable quantity of acrid matter passing from the fauces into the stomach, makes its way to the rectum, a considerable degree of looseness often takes place. And although evacuations from the system in general by means of cathartics may be hurtful, yet patients often obtain great relief from a free discharge of this matter; and by discharging it, purgatives have the effect even of preventing an evacuation from the system, which would otherwise take place.\n\nSudorifics. Cordials. Alexipharmics.] None of these remedies were found beneficial. With respect to cordials, Dr Withering observes, that although they seem to be indicated by the great loss of strength and feeble pulse, yet the certain consequence of their use always was, an increase of restlessness, of the delirium, and of the heat.\n\nDiuretics.] These were found very beneficial. The vegetable fixed alkali is recommended as the most proper article of this kind: a dram or two may be easily swallowed every 24 hours, by giving a small quantity in every thing the patient drinks. Diuretics, however, have been found principally serviceable, by practitioners in general, in those cases where the urine is observed to be scanty, and where dropical symptoms have taken place.\n\nCinchona.] No medicine, we are told, ever had a fairer trial in any disease than the Peruvian bark had in this epidemic; for the feeble pulse, great prostration of strength, with here and there a livid spot, were thought to be such undeniable evidences of a putrid tendency, that cinchona was poured down not with a sparing hand. But this was only at first; for these livid spots and the floughs in the throat being found to be the effects of inflammation instead of putrefaction, and the bark instead of diminishing, rather increasing these symptoms, it was at last entirely laid aside by Dr Withering in his practice. But although cinchona may not have been successful with a particular epidemic at a particular place; yet from the concurring testimony of many practitioners, it is very commonly\nmonly found to be productive of good effects: And there is perhaps no remedy on which greater dependence is in general put, particularly in the advanced periods of the disease, where the factor is considerable.\n\nUpon the same principles that cinchona was prescribed, fixable air was at first likewise advised, but with no evident effects either one way or another. Dulcified acids were also had recourse to, but with no advantage.\n\nOpiates.] These, although recommended by some authors for the removal of inquietude and watchfulness, yet in this epidemic, instead of effecting their purpose, always increased the distress of the patient.\n\nBlistering.] In the former appearance of the disease, blisters were universally detrimental; they never failed to hasten the delirium; and if the case was of the worst kind, they too often confirmed its fatal tendency. But although this may have been the case during the epidemic which Dr Withering describes, it has by no means been generally observed. On the contrary, by the early application of blisters to the external sores, both the glandular swellings and likewise the discharge from the mouth and sores have been much diminished; and practitioners have believed, not without probable reason, that the after-attacks of the throat were less considerable than would otherwise have been the case.\n\nInjected gargles of contrayerva decoction, sweetened with oxymel of squills, &c. were found very beneficial in bringing always large quantities of viscid ropy stuff from the sores.\n\nThe immersion of the feet and legs in warm water, although it did no harm, yet did not either procure sleep or abate the delirium, as it frequently does in other kinds of fever.\n\nAs in summer it was found difficult to keep the patients sufficiently cool, they were ordered to lie upon a mattress instead of a feather-bed; a free circulation of air was kept up; and where the patients strength would admit of it, they were ordered frequently out of doors. Animal food and fermented liquors were denied them, and nothing allowed but tea, coffee, chocolate, milk and water, gruel, barley-water, and such articles.\n\nWith respect to the tropical disorder which so frequently succeeds to this complaint, it was never observed, Dr Withering remarks, when the preceding symptoms had been properly treated.\n\nWhen called upon to patients in the tropical state, he began his practice by a dose of calomel at night, and a purgative in the morning. When a febrile pulse attended the other symptoms, emetics were useful, as well as the saline draughts and other neutral salts. When great debility, comatose or peripneumonic symptoms occurred, blisters were found very serviceable; but when tropical symptoms were the principal cause of complaint, small doses of rhubarb and calomel were advised; recourse was also had to diluted solutions of fixed alkalies, squills, Seltzer waters, and other diuretics.\n\nWhen the urine flows freely, steel and other tonics are recommended; together with gentle exercise, high-feathered food, wine, and the wearing of flannel in contact with the skin.\n\nDr Withering concludes his essay with an enumeration of several cases, treated according to the principles above laid down. The successful termination of these cases demonstrates the propriety of the practice which he has recommended; at least for the epidemic under the form in which it then appeared.\n\nSince Dr Withering's publication, two other practices have obtained considerable celebrity in this disease. The one is dashing cold water on the surface of the body in the manner recommended by Dr Currie in proper fevers. It is, however, very certain that although this may obviate symptoms, and particularly diminish the heat when very urgent, yet it never produces an artificial termination of the disease as some have alleged. When the contagion of scarlatina is introduced into a human body, never before subjected to the disease, it must, like smallpox and measles, run a certain course, and the attention of the practitioner must merely be employed in endeavouring to render that course as mild as he can, principally by obviating urgent symptoms.\n\nThe other remedy, lately introduced, and highly commended in scarlatina anginosa, is the oxygenated muriatic lead. This has been particularly extolled by Mr John Ayre Braithwaite, surgeon at Lancaster. One dram of the oxygenated muriatic acid is mixed with eight ounces of distilled water. This quantity he directs to be taken by a patient at the age of puberty every day. But the quantity must be regulated by the age and situation of the patient. This remedy also is only useful as obviating symptoms, particularly the affection of the throat. But with this intention we have often employed it with great advantage.\n\nGENUS XXXIII. URTICARIA.\n\nNETTLE-RASH.\n\nFebris urticata, Vog. 40.\nUredo, Lin. 8.\nPurpura urticata, Funk. 75.\nScarlatina urticata, Sauv. fp. 2.\nErytipeletis species altera, Sydenham, sect. vi. cap. 6.\nFebris scarlatina, et febris urticata, Meyerey, Mal. des armées, 291 et seq.\n\nDescription. This disease has its English name of nettle-rash from the resemblance of its eruption to that made by the stinging of nettles. These little elevations upon the skin in the nettle-rash often appear instantaneous, especially if the skin be rubbed or scratched, and seldom stay many hours in the same place, and sometimes not many minutes. No part of the body is except from them; and where many of them rise together, and continue an hour or two, the parts are often considerably swelled; which particularly happens in the face, arms, and hands. These eruptions will continue to infect the skin, sometimes in one place and sometimes in another, for one or two hours at a time, two or three times every day, or perhaps for the greatest part of the 24 hours.—In some persons they last only a few days, in others many months; nay, sometimes the disease has lasted for years with very short intervals.\n\nBut though the eruption of the urticaria resembles, as already observed, that produced by the stinging of nettles,\nExanthemata, it is sometimes accompanied with long weals, as if the part had been struck with a whip. Whatever be the shape of these eminences, they always appear solid, without having any cavity or head containing either water or any other liquor; and this affords an easy mark whereby this disease may be distinguished from the itch. For it often happens, that the insufferable itching with which this eruption is attended, provokes the patient to scratch the parts so violently, that a small part of the cuticle on the top of these little tumors is rubbed off; a little scab succeeds; and, when the swelling is gone down, there is left an appearance hardly to be distinguished from the itch, but by the circumstances just now mentioned. The nettle-rash also further differs from the itch, in not being infectious.\n\nCayley, &c. Dr Heberden is inclined to ascribe this difference to some mechanical cause outwardly applied to the skin. He observes, that most people suffer in a similar manner from the real stinging of nettles. Cowhage, or, as it is corruptly called, cow-itch, a sort of phaeolus, or French bean, the pod of which is covered over with a kind of down or hair, and the effect of which upon the skin is much the same as that of nettles; and almost any hairs cut equally short, and sprinkled upon the skin, whenever they happen to stick in it, will make the part itch or smart in such a manner as to give great uneasiness; it is also a considerable time before the skin can be cleared of the finer ones, when once they are screwed upon it.\n\nReaumur, in the fourth memoir of his History of Insects, describes a species of caterpillars to which belong a fort of hairs almost invisible to the naked eye, which are easily detached, and frequently float in the air round their nests, though it have not been at all disturbed. The touch of these hairs has a similar effect with the cow-itch; that is, they occasion intolerable itchings, with little bumps and redness, arising sometimes to a slight inflammation. These he found would continue four or five days, if the animal or the nest had been much handled; and though they had not been touched at all, yet, by only walking near their nests, the same effects would be brought on, but for a shorter time. These hairs affect the skin in this manner by sticking in it, as he could perceive with a glass of a great magnifying power; for with one of a small power they were not visible. The uneasy sensations caused by these small wounds, not only, as he says, last several days, but move from one part of the body to another; so that they will cease upon one wrist, and immediately begin on the other; from the wrist they will go to the fingers or the face, or even to the parts of the body which are covered. He supposes, that the motions of the body, when much of this fine down lies near or upon the skin, may drive it from one part to another, or change what was lying there inoffensively to a situation fit to make it penetrate into the skin. Neither cold water, nor oil, nor spirit of wine, with which the parts affected were bathed, had any effect in removing the itching. He thinks the most efficacious remedy which he tried for this complaint was, to rub the parts strongly with parsley, which instantly lessened the sensations, and after two or three hours, entirely freed the patient from them. It is also well known, that many species of caterpillars, by only walking over the hands, will produce something like this effect on the parts which they touch, and undoubtedly from the same cause.\n\nDr Heberden asks, Is it impossible that the nettle-rash should arise from the same causes, or from others similar, which we miss by looking too deeply for them in the blood and humours? Such, says he, may have been its origin in some instances, where it has lasted only a few days; but where this affection has continued for some years, in persons who change their linen every day, and who bathe frequently all the time, it can hardly be ascribed to such an external cause. He has observed it frequently to arise from cantharides; but though it has continued many weeks after the removal of the blister, yet it might be suspected that this arose from the fine spicules of the cantharides sticking all this time about the skin; it being customary to throw much of the dry powder of the cantharides over the blister-plaster, whence it may readily be carried to other parts of the body. But it is certain that similar effects will sometimes follow the internal use of wild valerian root, or the eating of fish not sufficiently dried; muscles, shrimps, and even honey, and the kernels of fruits, will also sometimes produce symptoms of a similar kind. But whatever be its cause, Dr Heberden never saw any reason to suppose that the nettle-rash had in any way vitiated the humours to such a degree as to require the use of internal remedies; and if the itching could be certainly and expeditiously allayed, there would be no occasion for any farther cure. He concludes this history of the disorder with a case communicated to him by Dr Monney, physician of Chelsea College, and in which the disease appeared with uncommon violence.\n\nW. A., aged near 30, of a thin spare habit, was seized with a disorder attended with symptoms of a very uncommon kind. Whenever he went into the air, if the sun shined bright, he was seized with a tickling of his flesh on those parts exposed to the sun; this tickling, by his continuing in the air, increased to a violent itching, attended with great heat and pain; the skin would then be almost as red as vermillion, and thicken like leather; and this remained till he went out of the open air, and then abated in about 15 or 20 minutes. This happened only when the sun was above the horizon; at other times he was what he called quite well.—But it was not owing to the heat of the sun; for the sun in winter affected him full as much, if not more, and the heat of the fire had no such effect. Thus he was confined to the house for 10 years. He tried several hospitals, and had advices from many physicians, without the least abatement of his complaints. At last it was agreed by a consultation of physicians, that he should try dipping in salt water; which he did at Yarmouth for 13 weeks, without any visible amendment. One hot day, having pulled off his clothes and gone into the sea in the middle of the day, the heat diffused itself so violently all over his body, that, by the time he had put on his clothes, his eyesight began to fail, and he was compelled to lie down upon the ground to save himself from falling. The moment he lay down, the faintness went off; upon this he got up again; but had no sooner arisen, than he found himself in the former condition; he therefore lay...\ndown again, and immediately recovered. He continued alternately getting up and lying down, till the disorder began to be exhausted, which was in about half an hour; and he was frequently obliged to have recourse to the same expedient.\n\nHaving at last accidentally met with Dr Monsey, this physician questioned him concerning the cause of the disorder; but nothing could be guessed at, excepting that the patient owned he had one winter lived entirely upon bullock's liver and porter, from inability to purchase better victuals. A comrade lived with him at that time, on the same provisions; and he also was affected in a similar manner, though in a less degree, and had recovered. This patient was then first put upon a course of Dover's sweating powder without any effect, and afterwards tried a course of nitrous ones with the same bad success. At last Dr Monsey determined to try the effect of mercury, which happily proved effectual in removing this obstinate and uncommon distemper. The patient began with taking five grains of calomel for three nights running, and a cathartic next morning. In this course he went on for near a fortnight, at the end of which he found himself very sensibly relieved. This encouraged him to go on rather too boldly, by which means a slight salivation ensued; however, that went off soon, and in about six weeks he was quite well.—Some time after, he was threatened with a return of his disorder; but this was effectually relieved by a dose of calomel, which he had afterwards occasion to repeat for the same reason, and with the same success; but at last the disorder seemed to be radically cured, by his having no further symptoms of a relapse.\n\nGENUS XXXIV.

He declines taking the descriptions of foreign physicians: we shall therefore content ourselves with giving an instance of this very uncommon distemper, as it was observed in the Infirmary at Aberdeen, and was treated by the late Dr David Stuart, then physician to that hospital, who soon after published an account of it in the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries. A private folder of the 73d regiment, aged eighteen years, formerly a pedlar, and naturally of a healthy constitution, was received into the hospital at Aberdeen on the 25th of April. About twenty days before that, he had been seized with the measles when in the country; and, in marching to town, on the second day of their eruption, he was exposed to cold; upon which they suddenly disappeared.\n\nHaving arrived at Aberdeen, he was quartered in a damp, ill-aired, under-ground apartment. He then complained of sickness at stomach, great oppression about the precordia, headache, latitude, and weariness, on the least exertion; with stiffness and rigidity of his knees and other joints. The surgeon of the regiment visited him: he was purged, but with little benefit. About ten days before, he observed on the inside of his thighs a number of very small, distinct, red spots, a little elevated above the surface of the skin, and much resembling the first appearance of smallpox. This eruption gradually spread itself over his whole body, and the pustules continued every day to increase in size.\n\nUpon being received into the hospital, he complained of headache, sickness at stomach, oppression about the precordia, thirst, sore throat, with difficulty of swallowing; his tongue was foul, his skin felt hot and feverish; pulse from 110 to 120, rather depressed; belly colicive; eyes dull and languid, but without delirium. The whole surface of his skin was interspersed with vesicles, or phlyctaneae, of the size of an ordinary walnut; many of them were larger, especially on the arms and breast. In the interstices, between the vesicles, the appearance of the skin was natural, nor was there any redness round their base; the distance from one to another was from half an inch to a hand-breadth or more. In some places two or three were joined together, like the pustules in the confluent smallpox. A few vesicles had burst of themselves, and formed a whitish scab or crust. These were chiefly on the neck and face; others showed a tolerably laudable pus. However, by far the greatest number were perfectly entire, turgid, and of a bluish colour. Upon opening them, it was evident that the cuticle elevated above the cutis, and diffused with a thin, yellowish, semipellucid serum, formed this appearance. Nor was the surface of the cutis ulcerated or livid; but of a red florid colour, as when the cuticle is separated by a blister, or superficial burning. No other person laboured under a similar disease, either in the part of the country from which he came, or when he resided in Aberdeen.\n\nThis case was treated in the following manner. The largest of the vesicles were snipped, and dressed with unguent, &c. In the evening he was vomited with a solution of tartar emetic, given in small quantities and at intervals. This also procured two loose stools. And he was ordered for drink, water-gruel acidulated with lemon juice.\n\n\"April 16. He still complained of sickness, some oppression about his breast, and sore throat; he had slept little during the night; his tongue was foul and blackish; his skin, however, was not so hot as the preceding day; his urine was high-coloured, but had the appearance of separation; his pulse 90, and soft; most of the fores on the trunk of the body looked clean. Others, particularly where the vesicles were confluent, seemed beginning to ulcerate, and to have a bluish sublivid appearance. They were dressed afresh with cerate, and he was ordered the following medicines:\n\nRp Decoët, Cort. Peruvian. 3 vj. Vini rubri. Lusitan. 3ij. M. Hujus mixturæ capiat 3 B. tercia quaque hora.\n\n\"His\n\"His acidulated drink was continued; and on account of the very offensive smell on approaching near him, some vinegar was placed in a basin before the bed, and sprinkled on the floor; and the room was kept properly aired.\n\n\"April 17. His sores looked tolerably clean, unless on his arms and thighs; where they were livid, a little ulcerated, and discharged a bloody ichor.\n\n\"His headache, sickness, &c., were almost gone; his tongue was rather cleaner; pulse 68, and soft. As the decoction of the bark sat easily on his stomach, the following prescription was ordered:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rp Pulv. subtilis Cort. Peruv. } \\frac{3}{5} \\text{S. Vini rubri Lusitan. Aque fontan. } \\frac{2}{5} \\text{S. M. ft. Hault. tertia quaque hora repetend.} \\]\n\nThe acidulated drink was continued, and fresh dressings applied to the sores.\n\n\"April 18. The little ulcers in his arms and thighs still discharged a bloody ichor, and looked ill; his other complaints were better; pulse 82. The bark had not nauseated him, and it was continued as well as his former drink.\n\n\"April 19. His sores looked much cleaner and better; the fever was gone, his pulse natural, and he had no complaint but weakness and a troublesome itching of the skin: The Peruvian bark, &c., were continued.\n\n\"April 20. Some of the ulcers still poured forth a bloody ichor; most of them, however, looked well, and had begun to heal—fever gone—medicines continued.\n\n\"From the 21st of April, he went on gaining strength, and his sores appeared to heal fast; he was desired to take only four doses every day; and by the 27th his sores, &c., were totally dried up—he had no complaint, and was dismissed cured.\"\n\nSince the publication of this case of pemphigus by Dr Stuart, observations on this disease have been published by Dr Stephen Dickson of Dublin, in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy. In these observations, an account is given of six different cases which Dr Dickson has had an opportunity of seeing. Judging from these, Dr Dickson thinks that Dr Cullen's definition of this disease requires correction; and that it ought to be defined, \"a fever accompanied with the successive eruption, from different parts of the body, internal as well as external, of vesicles about the size of an almond, which become turgid with a faintly yellowish serum, and in three or four days subside.\"\n\nFrom the cases which have fallen under Dr Dickson's observation, he concludes, that the disease varies considerably as to its mildness or malignity. In three of the cases which he has seen, the symptoms were extremely mild, but in the other three strong symptoms of putrefaction were manifested, and the life of the patient was in great danger. With respect to the method of cure, he is of opinion, that the general symptoms of weakness, and tendency to putrefaction, obviously point out the proper treatment. Nourishment must be supplied, and the Peruvian bark and wine carefully administered; and when vesicles appear on internal parts, irritation must be guarded against by opiates, demulcents, and gentle laxatives.\n\nSome additional observations on the subject of pemphigus have lately been published in the London Medical Journal by Mr Thomas Christie. From a case which Mr Christie describes, he is disposed to agree with Dr Dickson in thinking that sometimes at least pemphigus is not contagious. He remarks, however, that the pemphigus described by some foreign writers was extremely infectious; which he thinks may lead to a division of the disease into two species, the pemphigus simplex and complicatus; both of which, but especially the latter, seem to vary much with respect to mildness and malignity.\n\n**GENUS XXXV. APHTHA.**\n\n*The Thrush.*\n\nAphtha, Sauv. gen. 100. Lin. 9. Sag. 298. Boerh. 978. Hoffm. II. 478. Junck. 137.\n\nFebris aphthosa, Vog. 44.\n\nThe only idiopathic species is the thrush to which infants are subject; (Aphtha lactucimem, Sauv. lp. 1.)\n\nThe aphtae are whitish or ash-coloured pustules, invading the uvula, fauces, palate, tonsils, inside of the cheeks, gums, tongue, and lips. They for the most part begin at the uvula, sending forth a glutinous mucus, and the pustules covering all or the greatest number of the parts above mentioned, with a thick whitish crust adhering most tenaciously. This crust does not induce an ulcer on the parts on which it lies by eating into them, but comes off in whole pieces after the pustules have arrived at maturity. This will often happen in a short time, so that the throat and internal parts of the mouth are frequently observed to be clean, which a few years before were wholly covered with white crusts. Neither is this disease confined to the throat and fauces, but is said to affect the oesophagus, stomach, and all parts of the alimentary canal. Of this indeed there is no other proof, than that, after a great difficulty of swallowing, there is sometimes an immense quantity of aphtae evacuated by stool and vomiting, such as the mouth could not be thought capable of containing.\n\nCautery, &c. The aphtous fever seems to be produced by cold and moisture, as it is found only in the northern countries, and especially in marshy places; and in them the aphtae often appear without any fever at all.\n\nPrognosis. There is no symptom by which the coming out of aphtae can be foretold, though they are common in many fevers; but they themselves are in general a bad symptom, and always signify a very tedious disorder: the danger denoted by them is in proportion to the difficulty of deglutition; and a diarrhoea accompanying them is likewise bad. This indeed generally carries off old people when they become affected with aphtae. The dark-coloured aphtae also are much more dangerous than such as are of a brown or ash colour; but it is a good sign when the appetite returns, and the dark-coloured ones are succeeded by others of a whiter colour. Neither are those which are unaccompanied with fever so dangerous as the other kind.\n\nCure. As the aphtae are seldom a primary disease, we must generally endeavour to remove the disorder upon which they depend, after which they will fall off;\nORDER IV. HÆMORRHAGIÆ.\n\nHæmorrhagiae, Vog.

The milder species of this hæmorrhage comes on more frequently in summer than in winter, and for the most part without giving any warning, or being attended with any inconvenience; but the less benign kind is preceded by several remarkable symptoms. These are, congestions of the blood sometimes in one part, and sometimes in another, and which are often very troublesome in the sides of the head: there is a redness of the cheeks; an inflation of the face, and of the vellus of the neck and temples; a tinnitus aurium; a heavy pain of the eyes, with a prominence, dryness, and sparks; there is a vertiginous affection of the head, with an itching of the nostrils, and a sense of weight, especially about the root of the nose. In some the sleep is disturbed with dreams about blood, fire, &c. Frequently the belly is colicive, there is a diminution of the quantity of urine, a suppression of sweat, coldness of the lower extremities, and tension of the hypochondria, especially the right one.\n\nCause, &c. This hæmorrhage may occur at any time of life; but most commonly happens to young persons, owing to the peculiar state of the system at that time. Sometimes, however, it happens after the axum and during the state of manhood, at which time it is to be imputed to a plethoric state of the system; to a determination of the blood, by habit, to the vellus of the nose; or to the particular weakness of these vessels.\n\nIn all these cases the disease may be considered as an arterial hæmorrhage, and depending upon an arterial plethora; but it sometimes occurs in the decline of life, and may then be considered as the sign of a venous plethora in the vellus of the head. It often happens at any period of life in certain febrile diseases, which are altogether or partly of an inflammatory nature, and which show a particular determination of the blood to the vessels of the head. As by this evacuation, other diseases are often removed, it may on these occasions be deemed truly critical. It happens to persons of every constitution and temperament; but most frequently to the plethoric and languid, and more commonly to men than women.\n\nPrognosis. In young people, the bleeding at the nose may be considered as a slight disease, and scarce worth notice. But, even in young persons, when it recurs very frequently and in great quantity, it is alarming; and is to be considered as a mark of an arterial plethora, which in the decline of life may give the blood a determination to parts from which the hemorrhage would be more dangerous; and this will require more particular attention, as the marks of plethora and congestion preceding the hemorrhage are more considerable, and as the flowing of the blood is attended with a more considerable degree of febrile disorder. These consequences are more especially to be dreaded, when the epistaxis happens to persons after their axum, returning frequently and violently. Even in the decline of life, however, it may be considered as in itself very salutary; but at the same time it is a mark of a dangerous state of the system, i.e., of a strong tendency to a venous plethora in the head, and it has accordingly been often followed by apoplexy, palsy, &c. When it happens in febrile diseases, and is in pretty large quantity, it may be generally considered as critical and salutary; but it is very apt to be too profuse, and thus becomes dangerous. It sometimes occurs during the eruptive fever of some exanthemata, and is in such cases sometimes salutary; but if these exanthemata be accompanied with any putrid disposition, this hæmorrhage, as well as artificial bleedings, may have a very bad tendency.\n\nCare. The treatment in cases of epistaxis may be referred to two heads. 1st, The treatment during the time of the discharge; and, 2dly, The treatment after the discharge is stopt, with the view of preventing the return of it. During the former of these periods, it is necessary in the first place to consider whether the discharge should be left to its natural course or stopped by artificial means. In determining this question, regard must be paid to the quantity of the discharge; the appearance of the blood; the constitution with which epistaxis occurs; the former habit of the patient; and the consequences which result from the discharge. When, from due consideration of these circumstances, there is reason to fear that further evacuation would be attended with bad consequences, though this disease has been generally thought very slight, it should seldom be left to the conduct of nature; and in all cases it should be moderated by keeping the patient in cool air, by giving cold drink, by keeping the body and head erect, by avoiding any blowing of the nose, speaking, or other irritation; and if the blood has flowed for some time without showing any tendency to stop, we are to attempt the suppression of the hæmorrhage, by pressing the nostril from which the blood flows, washing the face with cold water, or applying this to some other parts of the body. These measures Dr Cullen judges to be proper even on the first attacks, and even in young persons where the disease is in the least hazardous; but they will still be more requisite if the disease frequently recurs without any external violence; if the returns happen to persons not disposed.\ndisposed to a plethoric habit; and more particularly if no signs of plethora appear in the symptoms preceding the discharge.\n\nWhen the bleeding is so profuse that the pulse becomes weak and the face pale, every means must be used to put a stop to it, and that whether the patient be young or old. Besides those methods above mentioned, we must use astringents both internal and external; but the latter are the most powerful, and the choice of these may be left to the surgeon. The internal astringents are either vegetable or fossil; but the vegetable astringents are seldom powerful in the cure of any hemorrhages except those of the alimentary canal. The fossil astringents are more active, but differ considerably in strength from one another.—The chalkbeats appear to have little strength; the preparations of lead are more powerful; but cannot be employed, on account of their pernicious qualities, unless in cases of the utmost danger. The *tinctura naturna*, or *antiphtisica*, is a medicine of very little efficacy, either from the small quantity of lead it contains, or from the particular state in which it is. The safest, and at the same time the most powerful astringent, seems to be alum.\n\nFor suppressing this and other hemorrhages, many superstitious remedies and charms have been used, and said to have been employed with success. This has probably been owing to the mistake of the by-standers, who have supposed that the spontaneous cessation of the hemorrhage was owing to their remedy. At the same time Dr Cullen is of opinion, that such remedies have sometimes been useful, by impressing the mind with horror or dread. Opiates have sometimes proved successful in removing hemorrhages; and when the fulnels and inflammatory diathesis of the system have been previously taken off by bleeding, they may, in Dr Cullen's opinion, be used with safety and advantage. Ligatures have been applied upon the limbs, for retarding the return of the venous blood from the extremities; but their use seems to be ambiguous. In the case of profuse hemorrhages, no care is to be taken to prevent the patient from fainting, as this is often the most certain means of stopping them.\n\n**GENUS XXXVII.

The Vicarious Hæmoptysis.**\n\n*Hæmoptysis catamenialis*, Sauv. sp. 4.\n*Hæmoptysis periodica*, Sauv. sp. 5.\n\n**Description.** This hemorrhage commonly begins with a sense of weight and anxiety in the chest, some uneasiness in breathing, pain of the breast or other parts of the thorax, and some sense of heat under the sternum; and very often it is preceded by a saltish taste in the mouth. Immediately before the appearance of blood, a degree of irritation is felt at the top of the larynx. The person attempts to relieve this by hawking, which brings up a little florid and somewhat frothy blood. The irritation returns; and in the same manner blood of a similar kind is brought up, with some noise in the windpipe, as of air passing through a fluid. Sometimes, however, at the very first, the blood comes up with coughing, or at least somewhat of coughing, and accompanies the hawking above mentioned.\n\nThe blood is often at first in very small quantity, and soon disappears; but in other cases, especially when it frequently recurs, it is in greater quantity, and often continues to appear at times for several days together. It is sometimes profuse, but rarely in such quantity as either by its excess or by a sudden suffocation to prove immediately mortal.\n\nIt is not always easy to discover whether the blood evacuated by the mouth proceeds from the internal surface of the mouth itself, from the fauces or adjoining cavities of the nose, from the stomach, or from the lungs. It is, however, very necessary to distinguish these different cases; and for this Dr Cullen offers the following considerations.\n\n1. When the blood proceeds from some part of the internal surface of the mouth, it comes out without any hawking or coughing; and generally, upon inspection, the cause is evident.\n\n2. When blood proceeds from the fauces, or adjoining cavities of the nose, it may be brought out by hawking, and sometimes by coughing. In this case, there may be a doubt concerning its real source, and the patient may be allowed to please himself with the thought that the blood does not come from the lungs. But the physician must remember that the lungs are much more frequently the source of a hemorrhage than the fauces. The latter seldom happens but to persons who have before been liable to a hemorrhage from the nose, or to some evident cause of erosion; and in most cases, by looking into the fauces, the distillation of the blood from thence will be perceived.\n\n3. When blood proceeds from the lungs, the manner in which it is brought up will commonly show from whence it comes; but, independent of that, it may also be known from the causes of hemoptysis from the lungs, to be afterwards mentioned, having preceded.\n\n4. When vomiting accompanies the throwing out of blood from the mouth, we may generally know the source from whence it proceeds, by considering that blood does not proceed so frequently from the stomach as from the lungs: that blood proceeding from the stomach commonly appears in greater quantity than from the lungs. The pulmonary blood also is usually of a florid colour, and mixed with a little frothy mucus.\nmucus only; but the blood from the stomach is of a darker colour, more grumous, and mixed with the other contents of the stomach. The coughing or vomiting, as the one or the other happens first to arise, may sometimes point out the source of the blood; and this has also its peculiar antecedent signs and causes.\n\nCauses, &c. A haemoptysis may be produced at any time of life by external violence; and, in adult persons, while the arterial plethora prevails in the system, i.e., from the age of 16 to 35, a haemoptysis may at any time be produced merely by a plethoric state of the lungs. More frequently, however, it arises from a faulty proportion between the capacity of the lungs and that of the rest of the body. Thus it is often an hereditary disease, which implies a peculiar and faulty conformation.\n\nThis disease especially happens to persons who discover the smaller capacity of their lungs by the narrowness of their chest, and by the prominence of their shoulders; which last is a mark of their having been long liable to a difficulty of respiration. In such cases, too, the disease very frequently happens to persons of a sanguine temperament, in whom particularly the arterial plethora prevails. It happens also to persons of a slender delicate make, of which a long neck is a mark; to persons of much sensibility and irritability, and therefore of quick parts; to persons who have formerly been liable to hemorrhages from the nose; to those who have suffered a suppression of any usual hemorrhage, the most frequent instance of which is in females who have suffered a suppression of their menstrual flux; and, lastly, to persons who have suffered the amputation of a limb.\n\nAll this constitutes the predisposing cause of haemoptysis; and the disease may happen merely from the predisposing cause arising to a considerable height. But in those who are already predisposed, it is often brought on by the concurrence of various occasional and exciting causes. One of these, and perhaps a frequent one, is external heat; which, even when in no great degree, brings on the disease in spring, and the beginning of summer, while the heat rarifies the blood more than it relaxes the folds, which had before been contracted by the cold of winter. Another exciting cause is a sudden diminution of the weight of the atmosphere, especially when concurring with any effort in bodily exercise. The effort alone, may often be the exciting cause in those who are already predisposed; and more particularly any violent exercise of respiration. In the predisposed, also, the disease may be occasioned by any degree of external violence.\n\nPrognosis. Haemoptysis may sometimes be no more dangerous than a hemorrhage from the nose; as when it happens to females, in consequence of a suppression of their menses; when, without any marks of predisposition, it arises from external violence; or, from whatever cause it may proceed, when it leaves no cough, dyspnea, or other affection of the lungs, behind it. But, even in these cases, a danger may arise from too large a wound being made in the vessels of the lungs, from any quantity of red blood being led to stagnate in the cavity of the bronchi, and particularly from any determination of the blood being made into the vessels of the lungs, which by renewing the hemorrhage may have these consequences.\n\nCure. In the treatment of this disease, with a view of stopping the discharge, it is first necessary to have recourse to those measures which tend to diminish the impetus by which the blood is expelled. This is to be effected by a removal of plethora when it exists; by diminishing the general impetus of circulation; by diminishing local increased action when it takes place in the vessels of the lungs; and by producing a determination of blood to other parts of the system remote from the lungs. But besides practices diminishing impetus, it is often also necessary to employ such as augment the resistance to the passage of blood through the ruptured vessels of the lungs. With these views a variety of practices may be employed, particularly blood-letting, refrigerants, sedatives, astringents, and the like.\n\nOn this subject Dr Cullen differs from those who prefer chalybeates and cinchona in the cure of haemoptysis. Both of these, he observes, contribute to increase the phlogistic diathesis then prevailing in the system, and the haemoptysis from predisposition is always accompanied with such a diathesis. Instead of these, therefore, he recommends blood-letting in greater or smaller quantity, and more or less frequently repeated as the symptoms shall direct. At the same time cooling purgatives are to be employed, and every part of the antiphlogistic regimen is to be strictly enjoined. In the London Medical Observations, the use of nitre is greatly recommended by Dr Dickson, to whom its efficacy was made known by Dr Letherland, physician to St Thomas's Hospital. The most commodious method of exhibiting it he found was in an electuary. Four ounces of conserve of roses were made into an electuary with half an ounce of nitre; of which the bulk of a large nutmeg was directed to be given, four, six, or eight times a day, according to the urgency of the case. The good effects of this, he tells us, have often astonished him; and when given early in the disease, he says he can depend as much upon it for the cure of an haemoptysis, as on cinchona for the cure of an intermittent. He agrees with Dr Cullen, however, that in those cases where there is any hardness in the pulse, and which almost always happens, there is a necessity for venefication. A cool regimen, and quiet of body and mind, are certainly useful; but Dr Cullen observes that some kinds of gestation, such as sailing, and travelling in an easy carriage on smooth roads, have often proved a remedy. When the cough is very troublesome, it is absolutely necessary to exhibit frequently a small dose of an opiate. Dr Dickson also informs us, that the nitre joined with spermaceti, or pulv. tragacanth. comp., has produced equally good effects with the electuary above mentioned; in the composition of which he at first considered the conserve only as a vehicle for the nitre, though he means not to insinuate that the former is totally destitute of efficacy.\n\nWhen this hemorrhage has resisted other modes of cure, and there is reason to apprehend, even from the mere quantity of blood evacuated, that the patient may sink under the discharge, blisters, particularly when applied to the breast, are often had recourse to with great advantage; and the sulphuric acid, properly diluted,\nPHTHISIS.\n\nPULMONARY CONSUMPTION.\n\nPhthisis, Sauv. gen. 276.

The Confirmed Phthisis, with an expectoration of Pus.\n\nPhthisis confirmata acutiorum.\nPhthisis humida, Sauv. sp. 2.\n\nSometimes, notwithstanding all the care that can be taken, the haemoptysis will degenerate into a phthisis pulmonalis, or consumption of the lungs; and sometimes haemoptysis will be the consequence of this dangerous disorder. It has indeed been supposed, that an ulceration of the lungs, or phthisis, was the natural and almost necessary consequence of haemoptysis; but according to Dr Cullen, this is in general a mistake; for there are many instances of ja haemoptysis from external violence without being followed by any ulceration. The same thing has often been observed where the haemoptysis arose from an internal cause; and this not only in young persons, when the disease returned for several times, but when it has often recurred during the course of a long life; and it may easily be conceived, that a rupture of the vessels of the lungs, as well as of the vessels of the nose, may be sometimes healed. The causes of phthisis, therefore, Dr Cullen reduces to five heads. 1. A haemoptysis. 2. A suppuration of the lungs in consequence of a pneumonia. 3. A catarrh. 4. An asthma; and 5. Tubercles.\n\n1. When a phthisis arises from a haemoptysis, it is probable that it is occasioned by particular circumstances; and what these circumstances are, may not always be easily known. It is possible, that merely the degree of rupture, or frequently repeated rupture, preventing the wound from healing, may occasion an ulcer; or it is possible, that red blood effused, and not brought up entirely by coughing, may, by stagnating in the bronchiæ, become acrid, and erode the parts. But these hypotheses are not supported by any certain evidence; and from many observations we are led to think, that several other circumstances must concur in producing the disease from haemoptysis.\n\n2. The second cause of an ulceration of the lungs mentioned above is a suppuration formed in consequence of pneumonia. When a pneumonia, with symptoms neither very violent nor very slight, has continued for many days, it is to be feared it will end in a suppuration; but this is not to be determined by the number of days; for, not only after the fourth, but even after the tenth day, there have been examples of a pneumonia ending by a resolution; and if the disease has suffered some intermission, and again recurred, there may be instances of a resolution happening at a much later period from the beginning of the disease than that now mentioned. But if a moderate disease, in spite of proper remedies employed, be protracted to the 14th day without any considerable remission, a suppuration is pretty certainly to be expected; and it will be more certain still, if no signs of resolution have appeared, or if an expectoration which had appeared shall have again ceased, and the difficulty of breathing has continued or increased, while the other symptoms have been rather abated.\n\nThat in a pneumonia, the effusion is made which may lay the foundation of a suppuration, may be concluded from the difficulty of breathing becoming greater when the patient is in a horizontal posture, or when the patient can lie more easily on the affected side. That, in such cases, a suppuration is actually begun, may be inferred from the patient's being frequently affected with slight cold shiverings, and with a sense of cold felt sometimes in one sometimes in another part of the body. We form the same conclusion also from the state of the pulse, which is commonly less frequent and softer, but sometimes quicker than before. That a suppuration is already formed, may be inferred from there being a considerable remission of the pain which had before subsided; while with this the cough, and especially the dyspnoea, continue, and are rather increased. At the same time the frequency of the pulse is rather increased, the feverish state suffers considerable exacerbations every evening, and by degrees a hectic fever in all its circumstances comes to be formed.\n\nIn this state of symptoms, we conclude very confidently, that an abscess, or, as it is called, a vomica, is formed in some part of the pleura, and most frequently in that portion of it involving the lungs. Here purulent matter frequently remains for some time, as if enclosed in a cyst; but commonly not long before it comes to be either absorbed and transferred to some other part of the body, or breaks through into the cavity of the lungs, or into that of the thorax. In the latter case it produces the disease called empyema; but it is when the matter is poured into the cavity of the bronchiæ that it properly constitutes the phthisis-pulmonalis. In the case of empyema, the chief circumstances of a phthisis are indeed also present; but we shall here consider only that case in which the abscess of the lungs gives occasion to purulent expectoration.\n\nAn abscess of the lungs, in consequence of pneumonia, is not always followed by a phthisis: for sometimes a hectic fever is not formed; the matter poured into the bronchiæ is a proper and benign pus, which frequently is coughed up very readily, and spit out; and though this purulent expectoration should continue for some time, if it be without hectic fever, the ulcer soon heals, and every morbid symptom disappears. This has so frequently happened, that we may conclude, that neither the access of the air, nor the constant motion of the lungs, will prevent an ulcer of these parts from healing, if the matter of it be well-conditioned. An abscess of the lungs, therefore, does not necessarily produce phthisis pulmonalis; and if it be followed by such a disease, it must be in consequence of particular circumstances which corrupt the purulent...\npurulent matter produced, render it unsuitable to the healing of the ulcer, and at the same time make it afford an acrimony, which, absorbed, produces a hectic fever and its consequences.\n\nThe corruption of the matter of such abscesses may be owing to several causes; as, 1. That the matter effused during the inflammation had not been a pure serum fit to be converted into a laudable pus, but had been joined with other matters which prevented that, and gave a considerable acrimony to the whole. Or, 2. That the matter effused and converted into pus, merely by long stagnation in a vomica, or by its connexion with an empymema, had been so corrupted as to become unfit for the purpose of pus in the healing of the ulcer. These seem to be possible causes of the corruption of matter in abscesses, so as to make it the occasion of a phthisis in persons otherwise sound; but it is probable that a pneumonic abscess especially produces phthisis when it happens to persons previously disposed to that disease, and therefore only as concurring with some other cause of it.\n\n3. The third cause supposed to produce a phthisis is a catarrh; which, in many cases, seems in length of time to have the expectoration of mucus proper to it gradually changed to an expectoration of pus; and at the same time, by the addition of a hectic fever, the disease, which was at first a pure catarrh, is changed into a phthisis. But this supposition is, in the opinion at least of some physicians, liable to several difficulties. The catarrh is properly an affection of the mucous glands of the trachea and bronchiae, analogous to the coryza and less violent kinds of cynanche tonsillaris, which very seldom end in suppuration. And although a catarrh should be disposed to do so, the ulcer produced might readily heal up, as it does in the case of a cynanche tonsillaris; and therefore should not produce a phthisis.\n\nFarther, The catarrh, as purely the effect of cold, is generally a mild disease as well as of short duration; and, according to Dr Cullen, there are at most but very few of the numerous cases of it, which can be said to have ended in a phthisis. In all these cases in which this seems to have happened, he thinks it probable that the persons affected were peculiarly predisposed to phthisis; and the beginning of phthisis so often resembles a catarrh, that it may have been mistaken for such a disease. It often happens also, to increase the fallacy, that the application of cold, which is the most frequent cause of catarrh, is also frequently the exciting cause of the cough, which proves to be the beginning of a phthisis.\n\nMany physicians have supposed that an acrimony of the fluids eroding some of the vessels of the lungs is a frequent cause of ulceration and phthisis; but this appears to Dr Cullen to be a mere supposition. He acknowledges, that in many cases an acrimony subsisting in some part of the fluids is the cause of the disease; but observes that it is at the same time probable, that this acrimony operates by producing tubercles, rather than by any direct erosion.\n\nBut notwithstanding these objections, experience affords numerous examples of cases in which a disease long subsisting under the form of catarrh has at last degenerated into phthisis, and proved fatal from supervening hectic fever. It must, however, at the same time be allowed, that catarrh, degenerating into a phthisis, chronic state after subsiding for many years, has of itself often proved fatal without inducing phthisis.\n\n4. If phthisis does not frequently follow catarrh, it is still more rarely a consequence of asthma. Innumerable examples are unquestionably afforded of that disease subsiding for many years without any symptom whatever of phthisis as a consequence of it. But at the same time, there are unquestionable examples of phthisis deriving its origin from asthma; which, however, probably happens only in cases where a peculiar state of the lungs at the same time takes place: But without the concurrence of asthma, this state would not of itself have been sufficient for inducing the affection.\n\n5. Of all the causes formerly mentioned, phthisis most frequently arises from tubercles. Dr Simmons informs us, that he has had opportunities of inspecting the bodies of many people who died in this way, and never found them totally absent. He has likewise seen them in subjects of different ages, who had been troubled with no symptoms of an affection of the breast during their lifetime. In these, however, they were small, and few in number. This proves that they may exist without inconvenience till they begin to disturb the functions of the lungs by their size and number; or till some degree of inflammation be excited, either by accidental causes, or by certain changes that take place within their substance; for as yet we know but little of their true nature. These little tumors vary in their consistence; in some they are composed of a pulpy substance, and in others approach more to the nature of scirrhus. They are most commonly formed in consequence of a certain constitutional predisposition; but whatever is capable of occasioning a morbid irritability of the lungs seems also to be capable of generating them. Thus the spasmodic asthma frequently ends in tubercles and consumption; and it is not unusual for millers, stone-cutters, and others, to die consumptive, from their being so constantly exposed to dust, which in these cases probably acts by producing similar concretions: Dr Kirkland observes, that the teeth-grinders are subject to a disease of the lungs, from particles of sand mixing with iron dust, which among themselves they call the grinders rot. Tubercles, however, in by much the greater number of instances, have their source from a scrophulous disposition; and some eminent physicians have supposed that the generality of pulmonary consumptions are of this kind. This notion, however, they have perhaps carried too far: they have probably been misled by those tuberculous concretions which, without good reason, have been supposed to be diseased glands, and of course analogous to the glandular affections we meet with in the scrophula. Tubercles may likewise sometimes be owing to the sudden repulsion of cutaneous eruptions, or of the matter of exanthemata, &c. or to other causes.\n\nThe persons who are most liable to consumption are those of a fair complexion, fine and soft skin, florid cheeks, and a slender make; with high cheek-bones, hollow temples, long neck, shoulders standing out like wings, narrow chest, and a remarkable prominence of the processes of the os sacrum. To these marks we may add, that of sound teeth, which, as the disease advances,\nvances, usually become of a milky white colour, and more or less transparent. Of those who are carried off by this disease, Dr Simmons affirms, the greater number will be found never to have had a carious tooth. This circumstance, however, does not seem to us to hold so generally as Dr Simmons is disposed to imagine; and instances not unfrequently occur of patients dying of phthisis, although they have had many teeth subjected to caries; and some of these beginning even at an early period of life.\n\nPersons of the above description often remain for a long time without feeling any other inconvenience than some oppression at the breast in moist weather, or in hot apartments. Their breathing is easily hurried, sometimes by the slightest motion; and they become languid, paler, and thinner. All this time, however, they feel no heat or painful sensation in the breast. As the evil increases, the patient begins to be attacked with a slight, frequent, and dry cough, which is most troublesome in the night-time. But this, by proper care, is often relieved; and the patient remains in this state for a considerable time, and even for many years, if he be sensible of his danger, and careful to guard against it by a suitable manner of living. More commonly, however, we find the cough increasing, and sometimes accompanied with more or less catarrh. This is usually ascribed to cold; and but too generally neglected, till the disease become alarming by its obstinacy and its effects. This may be considered as the beginning, or first period, of the disease. During this stage, the cough is sometimes dry from the first; and sometimes, when it begins in the form of a catarrh, is attended with more or less expectoration of mucus.\n\nWhen the cough begins in the form of a catarrh, and appears to be occasioned by an increased secretion of a thin fetid mucus irritating the membrane of the trachea, all judicious practitioners agree in recommending an attention to regimen, the free use of diluting liquors, bland emulsions, small doses of nitre, the taking away a few ounces of blood if there be much inflammation, the inhaling the steams of warm water by means of the machine contrived for that purpose, and the occasional use of such a dose of elixir paregoricum as will be sufficient to allay the irritation of the bronchiae, and to promote a gentle moisture on the skin. These methods will generally be found to be efficacious, especially if the patient's chamber be of a moderate temperature, and he carefully avoid exposure to a cold, damp, or raw air, till the complaint be removed. In cases in which the cough has been obstinate, and the inflammatory symptoms considerable, Dr Simmons has often experienced the great advantages of the warm bath, the heat of which did not exceed 92°. When this is had recourse to, the patient should remain in it only a very few minutes, and go soon afterwards to bed; but not with a view to force a sweat by an increased weight of bedclothes, as is too often injudiciously practised.\n\nPatients of a consumptive habit, who have had an attack of this kind at the beginning of winter, are particularly liable to a return of the complaint during the continuance of the cold season, on the slightest occasion and with greater violence. A relapse is therefore to be carefully guarded against; and nothing will be found to do this more effectually than the use of flannel and a flannel under-waistcoat. The use of flannel has been condemned by several medical writers as increasing the insensible perspiration; but in the present case, to say nothing of some others in which it may be useful, it will in general be found to have the best effects. It will prevent a too great determination to the lungs, and should not be left off till the approach of summer. In some few instances in which flannel was found to have a disagreeable effect, a piece of dimity, worn over the breast next the skin, will prevent the return of colds and coughs in persons of a delicate habit, who had before been liable to them on the slightest occasions. Shirts made of cotton cloth are much more effectual than linen in preserving an equable temperature of the surface, and guarding against the action of external cold; while at the same time they are much more pleasant to most people than even the finest flannel. In these cases, circumstances that are seemingly of the most trifling nature become of importance.\n\nSometimes the cough is occasioned by an immediate inflammation of some part of the lungs, from some of the usual causes of inflammation; and when this happens, no time is to be lost in removing it. To do this will perhaps require more than one bleeding, together with a strict attention to a cooling plan of diet, diluting drinks, the inhalation of warm steams, and if convenient, the use of the warm bath; but above all, the speedy application of a large blister as near as may be to the supposed seat of the inflammation. The cough, in this case, will often remain after the original complaint is abated. A prudent use of opiates at bedtime, either by themselves or combined with gummy and mucilaginous medicines, will then generally be useful as a sedative and antiphlogistic.\n\nIn this, as well as in the catarrhal cough just now mentioned, many practitioners are too eager to administer cinchona, with the view, as they term it, of bringing up the patient; but this never fails to increase the cough, and of course to do great and very irreparable mischief.\n\nAnd here it will not be foreign to our subject to observe, that a symptomatic cough, which has its rise not from catarrh, or from an immediate inflammation of the lungs, but from their sympathy with the stomach, has sometimes laid the foundation of phthisis, from its having been mistaken, and of course improperly treated. It seems to be owing to a redundancy or vitiated state of the bile, or to some affection of the stomach, which it is perhaps not easy to define. It is sometimes a concomitant of other bilious symptoms; and when this happens to be the case, it cannot easily be mistaken; but we sometimes find it occurring singly, and in general attacking persons of a sedentary life. Dr Stoll of Vienna, who has noticed this cough, has very properly given it the name of suffus stomachica. This complaint is so far from being relieved by bleeding, that it constantly grows worse after it, especially if the evacuation be in any considerable quantity. The oily remedies seldom fail to exasperate this cough, which at first is dry, frequent, and often extremely violent, but which seldom fails to give way to one or two gentle pakes, and the occasional use of mild cathartics. The cough, as in other cases, often continues from habit after the cause\nthat gave rise to it has been removed, and may then be checked by opiates.\n\nWhen the disease has been neglected, or our attempts to remove it in the beginning have failed, both of which circumstances but too frequently happen, the patient begins to complain of a forenses, and of slight lancinating pains shooting through the breast, sometimes in the direction of the mediastinum, and sometimes confined chiefly to one side. The forenses is pretty constant, and much increased by the cough. The pain in the side often prevents the patient from lying on the side affected; and this inability of lying, except on one side, frequently occurs even when no such pain is felt. In this stage of the disease, flushing heats are felt in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; the breathing is short and laborious; and it is not long before the patient begins to expectorate a thin and frothy phlegm, at first in small quantities, coughed up with difficulty, and some pain of the breast, and now and then streaked with blood: this may be considered as the inflammatory period of the disease, to which succeeds the suppurative stage. In the latter, the expectoration becomes more copious and purulent, the breath proportionably offensive, and the exacerbations of the hectic fever more considerable: an increased quickness of the pulse comes on about the middle of the day; but the most considerable paroxysm of the fever is at night, and at first continues till towards morning, commonly till three or four o'clock; when it terminates in a sweat, which usually begins upon the breast. As the disease advances, these sweats become more profuse, and sometimes come on almost as soon as the pulse begins to quicken, but without affording any relief to the patient. During the exacerbations, we observe a circumcubed redness of the cheeks, while the rest of the face is pale, and appears as if it were not clean washed. The colifluviums that commonly accompanies the beginning of the disease is usually succeeded by a diarrhoea; the spitting lessens, and all the purulent matter seems to be carried downwards. The wasting of the fat and the loss of nourishment occasion the nails to curve inwards, the hair to fall off, and the eyes to sink in their sockets. In the meantime, the legs commonly swell; till at length death closes a scene which is melancholy to all but the patient himself, who in general continues sensible to the last moment, and even then indulges a vain hope of prolonging a miserable existence. In some cases, and that not unfrequently, a delirium comes on towards the close of the disease.\n\nThe hectic fever that attends this and some other chronic diseases, is evidently the effect of acrimony, and most commonly of pus absorbed and carried into the circulation. The nature of this acrimony, and the different irritability of different patients, are probably the sources of the variety we observe in fevers of this denomination; a variety which is doubtless much greater than we are aware of. Thus we find that the matter of the smallpox excites a fever of this kind; but this secondary fever, as it is called, differs from the hectic attendant on consumptions; nor does the latter correspond with that which sometimes accompanies the suppuration of a cancerous ulcer. In the pulmonary consumption, or at least in the third stage of it, the fever induced often appears to be of the putrid kind, and has been denominated febris hectica putrida by the judicious Morton, who considers it as being combined with a peri-pneumonic or inflammatory fever, which recurs as often as fresh tubercles begin to inflame. For although we have named one period of the disease the inflammatory, and another the suppurative period, yet we are not to suppose that the latter is exempt from inflammation. While matter is poured into the bronchiae, or absorbed and carried into the system from one part of the lungs, other parts are in a state of inflammation, or advancing towards suppuration; so that, on examining the lungs of persons who die consumptive, we find some tubercles that are small and just formed, some that are large and full of matter, and others that are in a state of ulceration. This easily accounts for the occasional combination of inflammatory symptoms with those of the putrid hectic. When the matter absorbed is a laudable pus, as in the case of the pustules abscesses, we find the form of the hectic fever differing from either of those we have mentioned.\n\nCure. In these different periods of the disease, the curative indications are sufficiently obvious. To prevent the formation of fresh tubercles; to obviate the inflammation of those already formed; to promote their resolution; to allay morbid irritability, the cough, and other troublesome symptoms; and, above all, to check the tendency to the hectic state, are the views that every rational physician proposes to himself in the treatment of the genuine consumption. We know of no medicines that can exert their specific effects upon the lungs by dissolving tuberculous concretions; nor is it probable, from what we know of the animal economy, that any such will ever be discovered. Yet medicines that operate in a general manner upon the system, may, by promoting absorption, and diminishing the determination to the lungs, tend to disperse tubercles, or to prevent their formation. There are not wanting instances of wonderful recoveries, in cases where the evil was supposed to be beyond the power of physic; and in some, where nature was left to herself; so that a physician who has observed the various and powerful resources nature has within herself, will be very cautious how he affords that a disease is incurable.\n\nThe most formidable effects of ulcerated lungs are the abortion and consequent hectic. It seems evident, that, in many cases, death is brought on by this, rather than by the lungs themselves being rendered unfit for the purposes of respiration. So that if we can obviate the effects of the abortion, diminish the premature determination to the lungs, and fulfil the other general indications just now mentioned, we may very often enable nature to recover herself. It may be alleged indeed, that the physicians art has hitherto proved very unsuccessful in these cases; but may not this be owing to the remedies that are employed being very often such as are inimical to the cure?\n\nThe cinchona is, perhaps, the most commonly employed of any, and often considered in as an ultimate resource in these cases. But besides this, the sulphuric acid, the balsams, and frequent bleedings, have each had their partizans. The use of blisters and issues, opiates, a milk and vegetable diet, exercise, and change of air, are pretty generally recommended by all. Concerning cinchona, Deffault long ago observed, that it had been productive\nproductive of great mischief in consumptive cases; and Dr Fothergill, in a paper lately published by him on this subject, very judiciously remarks, that it is so far from curing the hectic fever arising from disordered lungs, that according to the best of his observations, it not only takes up that time which might probably have been better employed in the use of other medicines, but for the most part aggravates the disease beyond remedy. Indeed it has been the opinion of several attentive observers, that whenever pus or any kind of matter excites an hectic fever, by being absorbed and carried into the circulation, the cinchona will never fail to exacerbate the complaint, especially if it be accompanied with any degree of inflammatory diathesis, unless the matter has a free outlet from the system; as in the case of abscesses, for instance, in which we often find it productive of excellent effects. It is likewise well known to be used as a tonic, to obviate the effects of fluor albus, or any other immoderate evacuation in delicate persons, which, by enfeebling the system, very often lays the foundation of phthisis; but the moment we have reason to suspect that the lungs are ulcerated, especially if this ulceration be attended with an inflammatory disposition; or if the separation of vitiated pus be the consequence of a peculiar increased morbid action of the vessels at the part, it ought to be laid aside; and in the genuine tuberculous consumption, perhaps, it is rarely advisable.\n\nDr Fothergill, however, observes, that there are two causes of consumption, which often produce symptoms so similar to those of the genuine phthisis, as sometimes to have led him to make use of cinchona, in apparent tendencies to a genuine pulmonary consumption, with advantage.\n\nOne of the causes is, the suckling of children longer than is consistent with the mother's ability. This case frequently occurs among the middling and lower classes of females, of constitutions naturally delicate and tender. In such a state of weakness, some slight cold brings on a cough, which increases gradually, till at length it produces the true pulmonary consumption. Here cinchona given early, in moderate doses, and merely as a tonic remedy, is often of excellent use.\n\nAnother cause, is any weakening discharge, either from abscesses, the greater operations of surgery, a copious and constant fluor albus, or similar enfeebling evacuations. That cinchona is, for the most part, of use in these cases, when the lungs are not inflamed, is indubitable; and if they be so affected, but not beyond a certain degree, it is also efficacious in preventing the progress of the consumption.\n\nIn phthisical complaints succeeding such situations, a prudent trial of cinchona seems necessary. Small doses of the decoction, either alone, or joined with the saline mixture or such other additions as the physician thinks proper, may be given. But if the breath becomes more tight and oppressed, the cough dry, the pulse more quick and hard, and especially if slight transitory pains or stitches about the thorax are more frequently complained of, a perseverence in the use of cinchona will increase the disease. If such also should be the appearances in the progress of the disease, or, from whatever cause, if cinchona be accompanied with such effects, the use of it ought to be withheld.\n\nIf, on the other hand, no pain, tightness, or oppression, is perceived, and there appear a manifest abatement of the symptoms, it will be advisable to proceed. The administration of this medicine, however, requires a judicious observer; and it ought neither to be given in the early inflammatory stage of this disease, nor be continued in any subsequent period, if it produce the effects above mentioned.\n\nBy its tonic virtues it will often enable nature to conquer many difficulties. In confirmation of this remark, Dr Fothergill farther observes, that he has seen it of use in promoting expectoration, when this became deficient from want of strength towards the end of peri-pneumonic fevers; but that it stops this discharge, changes flight wandering pains into such as are fixed, and increases them with all their consequences, in a variety of cases.\n\nThe elixir of vitriol, or the sulphuric acid properly diluted, though in many instances a highly useful remedy, is often exhibited in consumptive cases with no less impropriety than cinchona. This medicine, from its astringency, is obviously improper in the inflammatory state of the disease. But in the latter stage, when a general tendency to putrefaction takes place, it is serviceable in resisting the effect; it restrains the colligative sweats; and if the lungs be not injured past reparations, it is allowed to be a very useful auxiliary.\n\nVarious are the opinions concerning the efficacy of Bristol water in this disease. The experienced author last mentioned informs us, that he has seen many persons recover from pulmonary diseases after drinking these waters, whose cure seemed to be doubtful from any other process; and he thinks this circumstance, added to the general reputation of Bristol waters in phthisical cases, affords sufficient inducement to recommend the trial of them in the early stages of such complaints. It is, however, before the approach of a confirmed phthisis that patients ought to repair to Bristol; otherwise a journey thither will not only be without benefit, but may even prove detrimental.\n\nSome have imagined, that the journey, a better air, change of situation and of objects, have contributed to the patient's recovery; and these may doubtless be of advantage. It seems, however, that the water drank fresh at the pump, actually contains principles conducive to the recovery of patients affected with phthisical complaints. It seems to possess a slight calcareous astringency, and perhaps the air it contains may also have an antiseptic quality. On the whole, it appears to be an efficacious medicine, and is often found of remarkable benefit to consumptive patients.\n\nChange of air, particularly from bad to good, is of great consequence to all chronic diseases of the lungs. In consumptive cases, the air of all large cities is found to be particularly injurious.\n\nA sea voyage has been much recommended in the cure of this disease. The benefit of exercise has also been strongly urged by many writers; but, however salutary when properly used, it certainly ought to be regulated with discretion. Dr Dickson declares himself of opinion, that riding on horseback in consumptive cases is most commonly hurtful, without such regulations.\nas in general have been little regarded. For instance, he has known a person who, by a ride of an hour or two in the morning, was very much recruited, and who, at another time, in the afternoon and evening, without undergoing more bodily motion, has returned faint and languid, and apparently worse. This observation on the same person has been so frequently made, as to point out clearly the times when this exercise shall not do hurt in consumptive cases. In this disease, the pulse, however calm in the morning, becomes more frequent in the afternoon and night, attended with heat and other feverish symptoms. Exercise therefore, at this time, can only add to the mischief of the fever. For this reason he prudently recommends to all hectic persons, especially those who shall travel to distant places on account of a better air, or the benefit expected from any particular water, that their travelling should be slow, confined to a very few hours, and only in the morning.\n\nExercise on horseback seems to be chiefly beneficial in those cases where consumption is a secondary disease. For example, in the nervous atrophy; in the hypochondriacal consumption; or when it is the effect of long-continued intermittents, or of congestions in any of the abdominal viscera; or, in a word, whenever the consumption is not attended with an inflamed or ulcerated state of the lungs, long journeys on horseback will be beneficial. Such a practice may likewise be highly useful in obviating an attack of phthisis, or in carrying off a dry husky cough in a person of a consumptive habit, when there is reason to suppose that no tubercles are as yet formed. On the other hand, in the confirmed phthisis, when the lungs are inflamed or ulcerated, much or violent exercise will be improper; and there have been instances where the death of the patient was evidently accelerated by it. The exercise therefore should be gentle, proportioned to the strength of the patient, and employed only in the morning. In fine weather, an easy open carriage is perhaps the most eligible, not only on account of its being open to the air, but because it affords that kind of agitation which is most wanted in these cases. For if we consider the different modes of exercise, we shall find that walking, though the best exercise in health, as it employs the most muscles, is the worst for the sickly, who should have the benefit of exercise without fatigue. Riding on horseback agitates the viscera more than walking, and is therefore preferable to it in many chronic diseases; but when a preternatural determination to the lungs has taken place, it will be liable to increase the evil, and may likewise be hurtful by the fatigue that attends it. For these reasons it will be prudent to begin with a carriage; and if the patient gain strength, and the disease abates, recourse may afterwards be had to horse-exercise.\n\nThe gentle motion of a coach has been often found of great utility in pulmonary complaints. Its efficacy seems to depend chiefly on its increasing the determination to the surface of the body. The nausea which this motion excites in some persons is an effect of this increased determination. It has therefore been found beneficial in haemoptysis; and Dr Simmons mentions the case of a lady, who, after trying various remedies to no purpose, was cured of this complaint by travelling several hundred miles through different parts of England in her own coach. At first, whenever she remained three or four days in any place, the disorder began to return again; but at length by persevering in her journeys, it gradually went off. Default, who practised at Bordeaux about 40 years ago, tells us, he sent several consumptive patients to Bareges, and with good success; but that in these cases his reliance was not so much upon the Bareges waters, as upon the motion of the carriage and the change of air in a journey of more than 100 leagues.\n\nIt is now pretty generally acknowledged, that the good effects of sea voyages in consumptive cases depend more upon the constant and uniform motion of the ship, than upon any particular impregnation of the sea air; although this from its coolness and purity may likewise be of great use, especially in the hot months, when sea voyages are generally undertaken by consumptive patients. The ancients were no strangers to this remedy; and amongst the Romans it was no unusual thing for consumptive persons to sail to Egypt. Pliny observes, that this was done not for the sake of the climate, but merely on account of the length of the voyage.\n\nMany of our English physicians have recommended a voyage to Lisbon in these cases. When this is done, the proper season of the year should be carefully attended to. Dr Simmons knew a gentleman who went thither with symptoms of incipient phthisis, and who experienced some relief during the course of the voyage; but happening to arrive at Lisbon at the beginning of the rainy season, the disease was soon greatly increased, and terminated fatally.\n\nAnother species of motion has of late been extolled as highly useful in consumptive cases. Dr James Gar-michael Smyth of London, has lately published an account of the effects of swinging, employed as a remedy in the pulmonary consumption and hectic fever. In this treatise Dr Smyth contends, that sea air, in place of being of advantage, is constantly prejudicial to hectic and consumptive patients, and even to those who have a tendency to such complaints. He thinks, therefore, that the benefit derived from sea voyages must certainly be referred to some other cause. In stating his sentiments on this subject, he attempts to establish a distinction between exercise and motion. By exercise, he understands muscular action, or the exertion of the locomotive powers of the body either alone or combined. This he represents as increasing the force and frequency of the heart's contraction, the velocity and momentum of the blood, the quickness of breathing, the heat, the irritability, and the transpiration of the whole body. By motion, in contradistinction to exercise, he means such motion as is not necessarily accompanied with any agitation or succussion of the body, and which is totally independent of any muscular exertion. The effects of this, both on the heart, the lungs, and indeed on the system in general, he considers as of the sedative kind; thus it suspends the action of coughing, and lessens the frequency of the pulse. He is, therefore, led to refer the good effects of sea voyages entirely to this cause. And on these grounds he was led to conclude, that the motion given by swinging might be of equal if not greater service. This conclusion, we are told, in the treatise above alluded to, experience in many cases\ncases has fully confirmed; and he recommends it as a mode of cure which may be employed with advantage in every stage of phthisis. While, however, the reasoning of Dr Smyth on this subject seems to be liable to many objections, we are sorry to add, that his observations in practice have by no means been confirmed by those of others, who have had recourse to this mode of cure.\n\nThe best adapted diet in consumptive cases is milk; the milk of asses, both as an article of diet and as a medicine, has in particular been highly extolled. It may however be remarked, that there are constitutions in which this salutary nutriment seems to disagree. A propensity to generate bile, or too strong a disposition to aceesity from a weakness of the digestive organs, both merit attention. Whey, either from cows or goats milk, appears to be more suitable in the former case; and for correcting acidity, lime water may be added to the milk. The method of adding rum or brandy to asses or cows milk, should be used with great caution; for when added beyond a certain quantity, as is often the case, they not only coagulate the milk, but heat the body; by which means the milk disagrees with the patient, and the spirit augments the disease.\n\nIn consumptive cases, Dr Simmons observes, that the patient's taste should be consulted; and says that a moderate use of animal food, where the salted and high-seasoned kinds are avoided, is not to be denied. Shellfish, particularly oysters, are useful, as well as snails swallowed whole, or boiled in milk.\n\nRepeated bleedings, in small quantities, are by some considered in consumptive cases as highly advantageous; and in particular circumstances they undoubtedly are so; for instance, when the constitution apparently abounds with blood; when the fluid drawn off is extremely fizzy; when there is much pain in the breast; and when venesection is followed by an abatement of every symptom. In these cases, bleeding is certainly proper, and ought to be repeated so long as it seems to be attended with advantage. In very delicate constitutions, however, even where the pulse is quick, with some degree of fulness, and the blood last drawn considerably fizzy, it may not prove serviceable.\n\nIt deserves to be remarked, that the inflammatory appearance of the blood is not alone a sufficient reason for bleeding; but, in determining the propriety of this evacuation, all other circumstances should be considered; such as the patient's age, strength, habit, and the state of the disease.\n\nA remark which has been judiciously made by Dr Fothergill, ought not to be omitted in the account of this disease. It is, that young delicate females, about the age of 15 or 16, and upwards, are often subject to consumptions. When the disease has advanced considerably, the menstrual flow has made their appearance, most generally cease. This alarms their female friends, and they call upon the physician to use his utmost endeavours for restoring the discharge; believing the cessation of it to be the immediate cause of the phthisical complaint. Induced by their solicitations, medicines have sometimes been administered, which, without obtaining this end, have tended to aggravate the distemper. This deficiency is often of no real disadvantage in these cases; and in many the evacuation would prove injurious, by diminishing the strength, which is already too much impaired. Even small bleedings at the regular periods have often done more harm than good. A sudden suppression may require bleeding; but when the evacuation fails through want of strength, and from poverty of blood, the renewal of it increases the disease.\n\nBesides these remedies, Dr Simmons strongly recommends a frequent repetition of vomits. Many physicians have supposed, that where there is any increased determination to the lungs, vomits do mischief; but Dr Simmons is persuaded, that instead of augmenting, they diminish this determination; and that much good may be expected from a prudent use of this remedy, than which none has a more general or powerful effect on the system. If any remedy be capable of dispersing a tubercle, he believes it to be emetics. The affections of the liver, that sometimes accompany pulmonary complaints, give way to repeated emetics sooner than to any other remedy. In several cases where the cough and the matter expectorated, the flushing heats, loss of appetite, and other symptoms, threatened the most fatal event; the complaints were greatly relieved, and in others wholly removed, by the frequent use of emetics. Other suitable remedies were indeed employed at the same time; but the relief the patients generally experienced after the emetic, was a sufficient proof of its salutary operation. By this, however, he does not mean that vomits will be useless in every period of the disease, or in every patient. In general, it will be found that the earlier in the disease emetics are had recourse to, the more likely they will be to do good, and the less likely to do harm. The cases in which emetics may be reckoned improper, are commonly those in which the disease is rapid in its progress; or in that stage of it when there is great debility, with profuse colliquiative sweats.\n\nIn these cases, when an emetic has been administered twice a-week, and the cough is mitigated, the expectoration facilitated, and the other symptoms relieved, both the patient and the physician will be encouraged to proceed, and to repeat the vomit every second day, or even every day, for several days together, as Dr Simmons has sometimes done when the good effects of it were obvious.\n\nThe choice of emetics to be employed in these cases is by no means a matter of indifference. Carduus tea, chamomile tea, warm water, and others that act by their bulk, and by exciting nausea, relax the tone of the stomach when they are frequently repeated, and of course will be improper. More active emetics are therefore to be preferred; and here some of the preparations of antimony might naturally be thought of. But the operation of these is not confined to the stomach. They produce evacuations by stool, and a disposition to sweat; and are therefore improper in the pulmonary hectic. The mildness and excellence of ipecacuanha as an emetic, are well known; but in these cases, Dr Simmons has often employed the sulphate of copper, concerning the effects of which we meet with some groundless assertions in several medical books. Its operation is confined to the stomach; it acts almost instantaneously; and its altrigency seems to obviate the relaxation that is commonly supposed to attend the frequent use of emetics. In two cases...\nhe experienced its good effects, after vomits of ipecacuanha had been given ineffectually. It should be administered in the morning, and in the following manner:\n\nLet the patient first swallow about half a pint of water, and immediately afterwards sulphate of copper dissolved in a cupful of water. The dose of it must be adapted to the age and other circumstances of the patient, and may be varied from two grains to ten, fifteen, or twenty. As some persons are much more easily puked than others, it will be prudent to begin with a small dose; not that any dangerous effects will be produced by a large one, for the whole of the medicine is instantly rejected; but if the nausea be violent, and of long continuance, the patient may perhaps be discouraged from repeating it. In general, the moment the emetic has reached the stomach it is thrown up again. The patient must then swallow another half pint of water, which is likewise speedily rejected; and this is commonly sufficient to remove the nausea.\n\nDr Marryat, in his New Practice of Physic, prescribes with great freedom what he calls the dry vomit, from its being directed to be taken without drinking. This medicine consists of sulphate of copper and tartarite of antimony. It has the benefit also of producing instantaneous operation; but it is more apt to excite nausea than the sulphate of copper alone, and is liable to some of the objections stated to antimonial emetics.\n\nAnother remedy which Dr Simmons strongly recommends in consumptive cases, both from his own observation, and on the authority also of many other eminent practitioners, is gum-myrh. This given by itself to the extent of a scruple or half a drachm for a dose, two or three times a-day, or, if there be much inflammatory tendency, combined with a proportion of nitre or of cream of tartar, has often been serviceable in cases which were apparently instances of incipient phthisis even of the tuberculous kind. But when the disease is far advanced, or even decidedly marked, as far as our experience goes it has rarely been productive of any benefit.\n\nBesides the use of internal remedies in pulmonary affections, physicians have often prescribed the smoke of resinous and balsamic substances to be conveyed into the lungs. The vapour of sulphuric ether, dropped into warm water, has likewise been used in these cases. The inhaling of fixed air has also been spoken of as an useful practice. Dr Simmons has seen all these methods tried at different times; but without being able to perceive any real advantages from them in the suppurative stage of the disease, where they might be expected to be of the greatest use; and in the beginning he has often found the two first to be too stimulating. He therefore preferred the simple vapour of warm water, and has experienced its excellent effects in several instances; but when the complaint has made any considerable progress, its utility is less obvious; and when the patients have been much weakened, he has seen it bring on profuse sweats, especially when used in bed, and therefore he generally recommended it to be used in the daytime. Formerly he made use of a fumigating machine, described in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1748, in which the air, inspired by the patient, is made to pass through hot water by means of a tube that communicates with the external air, and with the bottom of the vessel: but we have now a more elegant, phthisic, and, on account of the valve and mouth-piece, a more useful instrument of this kind, the inhaler, invented by the ingenious Dr Mudge.\n\nAnother remedy recommended by some as a specific in consumptions is the earth-bath. Van Swieten, in his Commentaries on Boerhaave, tells us, from the information of a person of credit, that in some parts of Spain they have a method of curing the phthisic pulmonary, by the use of this remedy; and he quotes the celebrated Solano de Luque in confirmation of this practice. Solano speaks of the banos de tierra, or earth-baths, as a very old and common remedy in Granada and some parts of Andalusia, in cases of hectic fever and consumptions; and relates several instances of their good effects in his own practice. The method he adopted on these occasions was as follows: He chose a spot of ground on which no plants had been sown, and there he made a hole large and deep enough to admit the patient up to the chin. The interstices of the pit were then carefully filled up with the fresh mould, so that the earth might everywhere come in contact with the patient's body. In this situation the patient was suffered to remain till he began to shiver or felt himself uneasy; and during the whole process, Solano occasionally administered food or some cordial medicine. The patient was then taken out, and, after being wrapped in a linen cloth, was placed upon a mattress, and two hours afterwards his whole body was rubbed with an ointment, composed of the leaves of the folium nigrum and hog's lard. He observes, that a new pit must be made every time the operation is repeated; and advises the use of these baths only from the end of May to the end of October. Dr Fouquet, an ingenious French physician, has tried this remedy in two cases. In one, a confirmed phthisic, he was unsuccessful; but the remedy had not a fair trial. The patient, a man 30 years of age, had been for several months afflicted with cough, hectic fever, and profuse colliquative sweats. He was first put into the earth in the month of June; but soon complained of an uneasy oppression at his stomach, and was removed at the end of seven minutes. The second time he was able to remain in it half an hour, and when taken out was treated in the way prescribed by Solano. In this manner the baths were repeated five times, and the patient was evidently relieved; but having conceived a dislike to the process, he refused to submit to any further trials, and died some months afterwards. In the second case he was more fortunate: the patient, a girl 11 years of age, had been for three months troubled with a cough brought on by the measles, which was at length attended with a purulent expectoration, hectic fever, and night sweats. She began the use of the earth-bath in August, and repeated it eight times in the space of 20 days. At the end of that time the fever and disposition to sweat had entirely ceased, and by the use of the common remedies the patient was perfectly restored. A physician at Warsaw has likewise prescribed the earth-bath with good success in cases of hectic fever. The Spaniards confine it entirely to such cases; but in some other parts of the world we find a similar method employed as a remedy for other diseases, and particularly for the scrofula. Dr Priestley observes, that the Indians, he has been told, have\nPractice.\n\nHaemorrhoidalis fluxus, Hoffm. 219.\nHaemorrhoides, Junck. 11. et 12.\nLeucorrhoea, Vog. 112.\n\nSp. I.

The discharge of blood from small tumors on the verge of the anus constitutes what is called the hemorrhoids or piles. They are distinguished into the external and internal, according to the situation of the tumors, either without or within the anus. Sometimes, however, these tumors appear without discharging any blood; and in this case they are called the hemorrhoides coecae, or blind piles. Sometimes the disease appears without the verge of the anus in distinct separate tumors; but frequently only one tumid ring appears, seeming as it were the anus pushed without the body. Sometimes these tumors appear without any previous disorder of the body; but more frequently, before the blood begins to flow, and sometimes even before the tumors are formed, various affections are perceived in different parts of the body; as headache, vertigo, stupor, difficulty of breathing, sickness, colic pains, pain of the back and loins, and frequently a considerable degree of pyrexia; while along with these symptoms there is a sense of fulness, heat, itching, and pain, in and about the anus. Sometimes the disease is preceded by a serious discharge from the anus; and sometimes this serious discharge, accompanied with swelling, seems to come in place of the discharge of blood, and to relieve the above mentioned disorders of the system. This serious discharge has therefore been named the hemorrhoides alba.\n\nIn this disease the quantity of blood discharged is different upon different occasions. Sometimes it flows only when the person goes to stool, and commonly follows the discharge of feces. In other cases it flows without any discharge of feces; and then generally in consequence of the disorders above mentioned, when it is also commonly in larger quantity. This is often very considerable; and, by the repetition, so great, that we could hardly suppose the body to bear it but with the\nthe hazard of life. Indeed, though rarely, it has been so great as to prove suddenly fatal. These considerable discharges occur especially to persons who have been frequently liable to the disease. They often induce great debility, and frequently a leucophaemia or dropy which proves fatal. Sometimes the tumors and discharges of blood in this disease recur exactly at stated periods. In the decline of life it frequently happens that the hemorrhoidal flux, formerly frequent, ceases to flow; and in that case it generally happens that the persons are affected with apoplexy or palsy. Sometimes hemorrhoidal tumors are affected with inflammation, which ends in suppuration, and gives occasion to the formation of fistulous ulcers in those parts.\n\nThe hemorrhoidal tumors have often been considered as varices or dilatations of the veins; and in some cases various dilatations have appeared upon diffusion. These, however, do not appear in the greater part of cases; and Dr Cullen is of opinion that they are usually formed by an effusion of blood into the cellular texture of the intestine near to its extremity. When recently formed, they contain fluid blood; but after they remain for some time they are usually of a firmer consistence, in consequence of the blood being coagulated.\n\nCauses, &c. It would seem probable, that the hemorrhoidal tumors are produced by some interruption of the free return of the blood from the rectum, by which a rupture of the extremities of the veins is occasioned. But considering that the hemorrhage occurring here is often preceded by pain, inflammation, and a febrile state, and with many other symptoms which show a connection of the topical affection with the state of the whole system, it is probable that the interruption of the blood in the veins produces a considerable resistance to the motion of the blood through the arteries, and consequently that the discharge of blood is commonly from the latter. Some have thought, that a difference of the hemorrhoids, and of its effects upon the system, might arise from the difference of the hemorrhoidal vessels from whence the blood flows. But Dr Cullen is of opinion, that we can scarcely ever distinguish the vessels from which the blood flows, and that the frequent inoculations of both arteries and veins belonging to the lower extremity of the rectum, will render the effects of the hemorrhage much the same, from whatever source it proceeds.\n\nWith regard to the hemorrhoids, however, he is of opinion, that they are, for the most part, merely a topical affection. They take place before the period of life at which a venous plethora happens. They happen to females, in whom a venous plethora determined to the hemorrhoidal vessels cannot be supposed to occur; and they happen to both sexes, and to persons of all ages, from causes which do not affect the system, and are manifestly suited to produce a topical affection only.\n\nThese causes are, in the first place, the frequent voiding of hard and bulky faeces, which, by their long stagnation in the rectum, and especially when voided, must necessarily press upon the veins of that part, and interrupt the course of the blood in them. For this reason the disease so frequently happens to those who are habitually colitive. From the same causes, the disease happens frequently to those who are subject to a prolapsus ani. In voiding the faeces, it almost always happens that the internal coat of the rectum is more or less protruded; and, during this protrusion, it sometimes happens that the sphincter ani is contracted: in consequence of this, a strong constrictive is made, which prevents the protruded gut from being replaced, and at the same time prevents the return of blood from it, occasions a considerable swelling, and the formation of a tumid ring round the anus.\n\nUpon the sphincter's being a little relaxed, as it is immediately after its strong contraction, the portion of the gut which had fallen out is commonly taken into the body again; but by the frequent repetition of the accident, the size and fulness of the ring formed by the prolapsed intestine is much increased. It is therefore more slowly and difficulty replaced; and in this confuses the chief uneasiness of hemorrhoidal persons. As the internal edge of this ring is necessarily divided by clefts, the whole often puts on the appearance of a number of distinct swellings; and it also frequently happens, that some portions of it are more considerably swelled, become more protuberant, and form those small tumors more strictly called hemorrhoids or piles.\n\nFrom considering that the pressure of the faeces, and other causes interrupting the return of venous blood from the lower extremity of the rectum, may operate a good deal higher up than that extremity, we may understand how tumors may be formed within the anus; and probably it also happens, that some of the tumors formed without the anus may continue when taken within the body, and even be increased by the causes just mentioned. Thus may the production of internal piles be explained, which, on account of their situation and bulk, are not protruded on the person's going to stool, and are therefore more painful.\n\nThe production of piles is particularly illustrated by this, that pregnant women are frequently affected with the disease.—This is to be accounted for, partly from the pressure of the uterus upon the rectum, and partly from the colitive habit to which pregnant women are liable. Dr Cullen has known many instances of piles happening for the first time during the state of pregnancy; and there are few women who have born children, that are afterwards entirely free from piles.—Purgatives also, especially those of the more acid kind, and particularly aloetias, are apt to produce the piles when frequently used; and as they stimulate particularly the larger intestines, they may be justly reckoned among the exciting causes of this disease.\n\nPrognosis. Though the hemorrhoids are commonly, as we have said, to be esteemed a topical disease, they may, by frequent repetition, become habitual and connected with the state of the whole system; and this will more readily happen in persons who have been once affected with the disease, if they be frequently exposed to a renewal of the causes which occasioned it. It happens also to persons much exposed to a congestion in the hemorrhoidal vessels, in consequence of their being often in an erect position of the body, and in an exercise which pushes the blood into the depending vessels, while at the same time the effects of these circumstances are much favoured by the abundance and\nand laxity of the cellular texture about the anus. It is to be particularly observed, that when an haemorrhoidal affection has either been originally or has become a disease of the system, it then acquires a particular connexion with the stomach; so that certain affections of the stomach excite the haemorrhoidal disease, and certain states of this disease excite the disorders of the stomach.\n\nIt has been an almost universally received opinion, that the haemorrhoidal flux is a salutary evacuation, which prevents many diseases which would otherwise have happened; and that it even contributes to give long life: and as this opinion has been strenuously adopted by Dr Stahl, it has had a very considerable influence on the practice of physic in Germany. But Dr Cullen maintains that we can never expect to reap much benefit from this flux, which at first is purely topical; and, granting that it should become habitual, it is never, he thinks, proper to be encouraged. It is a disagreeable disease; ready to go to excess, and thereby to prove hurtful, and sometimes even fatal: at best it is liable to accidents, and thus to unhappy consequences. He is therefore of opinion, that even the first approaches of the disease are to be guarded against; and that, though it should have proceeded for some time, it ought always to be moderated, and the necessity of it superseded.\n\nCure. The general intentions of cure in cases of haemorrhoids are much varied, according to the circumstances of the affection at the time. When haemorrhoids exist in the state of tumor, the principal objects are to counteract inflammation, and to promote a discharge of blood from the part. When it is in the state of evacuation, the chief intentions of cure are, to diminish the impetus of blood at the part affected, and to increase the resistance to the passage of blood through the ruptured vessels. And finally, when the disease exists in the state of suppression, the aims of the practitioner must chiefly be, to obviate the particular affections which are induced in consequence of the suppression; to restore the discharge, as a means of mitigating these and preventing others; or, when the discharge cannot with propriety or advantage be restored, to compensate the want of it by vicarious evacuations.\n\nWith these various intentions in different cases, a variety of different remedies may be employed with advantage.\n\nWhen any evident cause for this disease is perceived, we ought immediately to attempt a removal of that cause. One of the most frequent remote causes is an habitual coliciveness; which must be obviated by a proper diet, such as the person's own experience will best direct; or if the management of diet be not effectual, the belly must be kept open by medicines, which may prove gently laxative, without irritating the rectum. In most cases it will be of advantage to acquire a habit with regard to the time of dilatation, and to observe it exactly. Another cause of the haemorrhoids to be especially attended to is the prolapsus ani, which is apt to happen on a person's having a stool. If this shall occur to any considerable degree, and be not at the same time easily and immediately replaced, it most certainly produces piles, or increases them when otherwise produced. Persons therefore who are liable to this prolapsus, should, after having been at stool, take great pains to have the intestine immediately replaced, by lying down in a horizontal posture, and pressing gently upon the anus, till the reduction shall be completely obtained. When this prolapsus is occasioned only by the voiding of hard and bulky feces, it is to be removed by obviating the coliciveness which occasions it. But in some persons it is owing to a laxity of the rectum; and in those it is often most considerable on occasion of a loose stool. In these cases, it is to be treated by astringents, and proper artifices are to be employed to keep the gut in its place.\n\nWhen the disease has frequently recurred from neglect, and is thus in some measure established, the methods above mentioned are no less proper; but in this case some other measures must also be used. It is especially proper to guard against a plethoric state of the body; and therefore to avoid a sedentary life, full diet, and intemperance in the use of strong liquor, which in all cases of hemorrhage is of the most pernicious consequence.\n\nExercise of all kinds is of great service in obviating and removing a plethoric state of the body; but upon occasion of the haemorrhoidal flux, when this is immediately to come on, both walking and riding, as increasing the determination of the blood into the haemorrhoidal vessels, are to be avoided. At other times, when no such determination is already formed, these modes of exercise may be very properly employed.\n\nAnother method of removing plethora is by cold bathing; but this must be employed with caution. When the haemorrhoidal flux is approaching, it may be dangerous to divert it; but during the intervals of the disease, cold bathing may be employed with safety and advantage; and in those who are liable to a prolapsus ani, the frequent washing of the anus with cold water may be useful.\n\nBesides general antiphlogistic regimen, in some cases where the inflammation runs high, recourse may be had with great advantage both to general blood-letting and to leeches applied at the anus. Relief is also often obtained from the external application of emollients, either alone or combined with different articles of the sedative kind, as acetate of lead or opium, by which it is well known that pain in general, particularly when depending on increased sensibility, or augmented action of the vessels, is powerfully allayed.\n\nWhen the flux has actually come on, we are to moderate it as much as possible, by causing the patient lie in a horizontal posture on a hard bed; by avoiding exercise in an erect posture, using a cool diet, and avoiding external heat. But with respect to the further cure of this disease, we must observe, that there are only two cases in which it is common for haemorrhoidal persons to call for medical assistance. The one is, when the affection is accompanied with much pain; and the other, when the piles are accompanied with excessive bleeding. In the first case, we must consider whether the piles be external or internal. The pain of the external piles happens especially when a considerable protrusion of the rectum has taken place; and while it remains unreduced, it is strangled by the constriction of the sphincter; and at the same time no bleeding happens to take off the swelling of the pro-\n\nVol. XIII. Part I.\ntruded portion of the intestine; and sometimes an inflammation supervenes, which greatly aggravates the pain. In this case, emollient fomentations and poultices are sometimes of service, but the application of leeches is generally to be preferred.\n\nIn cases of excessive bleeding, we are on all occasions to endeavour to moderate the flux, even where the disease has occurred as a critical discharge; for if the primary dilate shall be entirely and radically cured, the preventing any return of the haemorrhoids seems perfectly safe and proper. It is only when the disease arises from a plethoric habit, and from a stagnation of blood in the hypochondriac region, or when, though originally topical, it has by frequent repetition become habitual, and has thereby acquired a connection with the system, that any doubt can arise about curing it entirely. In any of these cases, however, Dr Cullen is of opinion, that it will be proper to moderate the bleeding, lest, by its continuance or repetition, the plethoric state of the body, and the particular determination of the blood into the haemorrhoidal vessels, be increased, and the return of the disease be too much favoured. Dr Stahl is of opinion, that the haemorrhoidal flux is never to be accounted excessive, excepting when it occasions great debility or leucophlegmata; but Dr Culjen thinks, that the smallest approach towards producing either of these effects should be considered as an excess which ought to be prevented from going farther; and even in the cases of congestion and plethora, if the plethoric habit and tendency can be obviated and removed, the haemorrhoidal flux may then with safety be entirely supprest. In all cases therefore of excessive bleeding, or any approach to it, astringents both internal and external may be safely and properly applied; not indeed to induce an immediate and total suppression; but to moderate the haemorrhage, and by degrees to suppress it altogether; while at the same time measures are to be taken for the removing the necessity of its recurrence.\n\n**GENUS XXXIX.

An unusual quantity therefore is not always to be considered as morbid; but when a large flow of the menses has been preceded by headache, giddiness, or dyspnoea; has been ushered in by a cold stage; and is attended with much pain of the back and loins, with a frequent pulse, heat, and thirst, it may then be considered as preternaturally morbid. On the other hand, when the face becomes pale, the pulse weak, an unusual debility is felt in exercise, and the breathing is hurried by little labour; when the back becomes pained from any continuance in an erect posture, when the extremities become frequently cold, and when at night the feet appear affected with edematous swelling; from all these symptoms we may conclude, that the flow of the menses has been immoderate, and has already induced a dangerous state of debility. The debility, induced in this case, often appears also by affections of the stomach, an anorexia, and other symptoms of dyspepsia; by a palpitation of the heart, and frequent faintings; by a weakness of mind, liable to strong emotions from slight causes, especially those presented by surprise. A large flow of the menses attended with barrenness in married women, may generally be considered as preternatural and morbid. Generally, also, that flow of the menses may be considered as immoderate, which is preceded and followed by a leucorrhoea.\n\n**Cause, &c.** The proximate cause of the menorrhagia is either the effort of the uterine vessels preternaturally increased, or a preternatural laxity of the extremities of the uterine arteries.—The remote causes may be, 1. Those which increase the plethoric state of the uterine vessels; as a full and nourishing diet, much strong liquor, and frequent intoxications. 2. Those which determine the blood more copiously and forcibly into the uterine vessels; as violent straining of the whole body; violent shocks from falls; strokes or contusions on the lower belly; violent exercise, particularly in dancing; and violent passions of the mind. 3. Those which particularly irritate the vessels of the uterus: as excess in venery; the exercise of venery in the time of menstruation; a coltive habit, giving occasion to violent straining at stool; and cold applied to the feet. 4. Those which have forcibly overstrained the extremities of the uterine vessels; as frequent abortions, frequent childbearing without nursing, and difficult or tedious labours. Or, lastly, Those which induce a general laxity; as living much in warm chambers, and drinking much of warm enervating liquors, such as tea, coffee, &c.\n\n**Cure.** The treatment and cure of the menorrhagia, must be different according to the different causes of the disease. The practices employed, however, are chiefly used with one of two intentions; either with the view of restraining the discharge when present, or of preventing the return of an excessive discharge at the succeeding period. The first is chiefly to be accomplished by employing such practices as diminish the force occasioning the discharge of blood, or as augment the resistance to its passage through the vessels by which it is to be discharged. The last is in some degree to be obtained by avoiding causes which either increase the general impetus of the blood, or the impetus at the uterus in particular; but principally...\npally by giving additional vigour to the uterine vessels.\n\nIn all cases, the first attention ought to be given to avoiding the remote causes, wherever that can be done; and by such attention the disease may be often entirely cured. When the remote causes cannot be avoided, or when the avoiding them has been neglected, and a copious menstruation has come on, it should be moderated as much as possible, by abstaining from all exercise at the coming on or during the continuance of the menstruation; by avoiding even an erect posture as much as possible; by shunning external heat, and of course warm chambers and soft beds; by using a light and cool diet; by taking cold drinks, at least as far as former habits will allow; by avoiding venery; by obviating coffeefees, or removing it by laxatives which give little stimulus. The sex are commonly negligent, either in avoiding the remote causes, or in moderating the first beginnings of this disease. It is by such neglect that it so frequently becomes violent and of difficult cure; and the frequent repetition of a copious menstruation may be considered as a cause of great laxity in the extreme vessels of the uterus.\n\nWhen the coming on of the menstruation has been preceded by some disorder in other parts of the body, and is accompanied with pains of the back, somewhat like parturient pains, with febrile symptoms, and when at the same time the flow seems to be copious, a bleeding at the arm may be proper, but is not often necessary; and it will in most cases be sufficient to employ, with great attention and diligence, those means already mentioned for moderating the discharge.\n\nWhen the immoderate flow of the menses shall seem to be owing to a laxity of the vessels of the uterus, as may be concluded from the general debility and laxity of the person's habit; from the remote causes that have occasioned the disease; from the absence of the symptoms which denote increased action in the vessels of the uterus; from the frequent recurrence of the disease; and particularly from this, that the female in the intervals of menstruation is liable to a leucorrhoea: in such a case, the disease is to be treated, not only by employing all the means above mentioned for moderating the hemorrhage, but also by avoiding all irritation, every irritation having a greater effect in proportion as the vessels are more lax and yielding. If, in such a case of laxity, it shall appear that some degree of irritation occurs, opiates may be employed to moderate the discharge; but in using these much caution is requisite. If, notwithstanding these measures having been taken, the discharge shall prove very large, affinements both external and internal may be employed. In such cases, Dr Cullen asks, May small doses of emetics be of service?\n\nWhen the menorrhagia depends on the laxity of the uterine vessels, it will be proper, in the intervals of menstruation to employ tonic remedies; as cold bathing and chalybeates. The exercises of gestation also may be very useful, both for strengthening the whole system, and for taking off the determination of the blood to the internal parts.\n\nThese remedies may be employed in all cases of menorrhagia, from whatever cause it may have proceeded, if it shall have already induced a considerable degree of debility in the body.\n\nSp.

The fluor albus, female weakness, or whites, as it is commonly called, is a disease of the womb and its contiguous parts; from which a pale-coloured, greenish, or yellow fluid, is discharged, attended with loss of strength, pain in the loins, bad digestion, and a wan sickly aspect.\n\nCauses, &c. The quantity, colour, and consistence of the discharge, chiefly depend upon the time of its duration, the patient's habit of body, and the nature of the cause by which it was produced. Taking cold, strong liquor, immoderate heat and moisture, or violent exercise, are all observed to produce a bad effect, as to its quantity and quality.\n\nWeakly women of lax solids, who have had many children, and long laboured under ill health, are of all the most subject to this disagreeable disease; from which they unfortunately suffer more severe penance than others, as the nicest sensations are often connected with such a delicacy of bodily frame as subjects them to it.\n\nIn Holland it is very frequent, and in a manner peculiar to the place, from the dampness of its situation; the surrounding air being so overcharged with moisture as to relax the body, stop perspiration, and throw it upon the bowels or womb; producing in the first a diarrhoea or flux, in the last the fluor albus or female weakness.\n\nThe discharge often proceeds from the vessels subservient to menstruation; because, in delicate habits, where those vessels are weak, and consequently remain too long...\nlong uncontracted, the *flor albus* sometimes immediately follows the menes, and goes off by degrees as they gradually close. It also comes from the mucous glands of the womb, as is particularly evident in very young females of eight and ten years old; in whom, though very rarely, it has been observed, and where it must then necessarily have escaped from those parts, as the uterine vessels are not sufficiently enlarged for its passage at so early a period.\n\nSometimes, as in women with child, it proceeds from the passage to the womb, and not from the womb itself; which, during pregnancy, is closely sealed up, so that nothing can pass from thence till the time of labour. The application of those instruments called *peffers*, from the pain and irritation they occasion, is also apt to bring on this discharge. Hence we may conclude, that this disease may happen although the blood be in a pure state. Here the fault seems to be placed in the vessels at the part, by which the fluids are vitiated and changed from their natural qualities.\n\nThe *flor albus* has been supposed to supply the want of the menes; because where the first prevails, the last is generally either irregular or totally wanting: but it might more properly be said, that the presence of the *flor albus*, which is a preternatural evacuation, occasions the absence of that which is natural; as is evident from the return of the menes after the *flor albus* has been cured. Indeed, when this discharge appears about the age of 13 or 14, and returns once a month, with symptoms like those of the menes, then it may be deemed strictly natural, and therefore ought not to be flopped.\n\n**Prognosis.** The *flor albus* may be distinguished into two kinds. The first arises from a simple weakness, or the relaxation of the solids; which may either be general, where the whole bodily system is enervated and unstrung; or partial, where the womb only is thus affected, in consequence of hard labour, frequent miscarriages, a suppression or immoderate quantity of the menes, or a sprain of the back or loins.\n\nIn the first case, the discharge being generally mild, may be safely taken away. In the second, it may proceed from a vitiated or impure blood, where the body, from thence, is loaded with gross humours, which nature for her own security and relief thus endeavours to carry off. In such cases, the discharge is often of a reddish colour, like that from old ulcerous sores; being sometimes so sharp as to excoriate the contiguous parts, and occasion a smarting and heat of urine.\n\nA deep seated, darting pain, with a forcing down, attending such a discharge is a very dangerous and alarming sign, and indicates an ulceration or cancerous state of the womb. This malignant state of the disease, if of long continuance, is extremely difficult to cure; and dilposes the patient to barrenness, a bearing down, droopy, or consumption.\n\n**Cure, &c.** The causes of those two kinds of this disease being different, so they will require a very different method of cure. For this purpose, in the first case, nothing will be more proper than nourishing simple food; such as veal broths, jellies, fresh eggs, and milk diet. The acid fruits will also be proper; and the patient may take a restorative, strengthening infusion, which will give firmness to the body, and assist the weakened fibres of the womb in returning to their natural state.\n\nThe same method may be used with success, where the *flor albus* follows the menes, as already observed.\n\nThe Tunbridge or Spa waters may be drank at the same time; and if necessary, an infusion of green tea, or pure smith's forge water, may be used with a womb-fryinge as an injection twice a day. Should the disease prove uncommonly obstinate, the patient may go into the cold bath every second day; and also drink lime-water with milk, which will expedite the cure, and prevent a relapse. Volatile liniment, and afterwards a strengthening plaster, may be applied to the small of the back.\n\nBy way of caution, the female should abstain from the immoderate use of tea; and be removed into a dry clear air; or if she be obliged to remain in one less proper, she may apply the flesh-brush, and wear a flannel shift next her skin, impregnated with the fumes of burning frankincense or any of the grateful aromatic gums. Cold spring water pumped on the loins, or a blistering plaster applied to the bottom of the spine or back, are both very powerful in their effects, and have sometimes succeeded after other remedies had been tried in vain.\n\nIn the second species of the disease, where the discharge is sharp and of long standing, it would be extremely dangerous to suppress it suddenly, either by astringents internally taken, or applied as injections, until the system be restored to a more sound and vigorous condition.\n\nA purging potion may be taken twice a week, and in the intervals an alternative pill night and morning. After this course has been continued a fortnight or three weeks, the may begin with the strengthening bitter infusion, or some other tonic, in the quantity of a tea-cupful twice a day, or to a greater extent if the stomach will allow.\n\nThe same sort of food and regimen will here be proper as in the first kind of the disease. The patient should abstain from malt liquors, and drink rice-water, in each pint of which half an ounce of gum-arabic has been dissolved; or if she be weak, and of a cold bloated habit of body, a little French brandy may be added occasionally.\n\nWhen the begins to take the bitter infusion, it will be proper to use the Tunbridge or Pyrmont water for common drink; but if those cannot conveniently be had, the alkaline aerated water, impregnated with iron, will make an excellent substitute. If it should render her collyve, and occasion headache, she may detest, and drink a solution of crystals of tartar, or a little senna tea sweetened with manna, till those complaints be removed.\n\nIn short, as this is a malady of the most disagreeable kind, which by long continuance or neglect becomes difficult of cure, and often produces an ulceration of the womb, bearing down, barrenness, a droopy, or consumption; it were to be wished that women, on such occasions, would be more attentive to their own safety, by using all possible means, in due time, to prevent those disorders.\n\nDr Leake says he has attended more patients labouring under the *flor albus* in the autumn than at any other season.\nseason of the year, especially when the weather was uncommonly moist and cold; most of them were cured by change of diet, an increased perspiration, and the proper use of cinchona with aromatics. He observed, that several about this time who escaped the disorder, were visited with bad colds, a defluxion on the throat, or a diarrhoea, which were removed by a similar treatment.\n\nAmong other remedies which have been recommended in leucorrhoea, recourse has lately been had to the internal use of cantharides. This remedy for leucorrhoea has, in particular, been highly extolled in a late publication on the powers of cantharides, when used internally, written by Mr John Robertson, surgeon in Edinburgh. The analogy between gleet and leucorrhoea, Mr Robertson tells us, suggested to him, that the cantharides which he had employed with such good effects in gleet, might also be useful in leucorrhoea. The event, he affirms, fully answered his expectations, and he has employed the remedy with very great success. The cantharides were used under the form of tincture: the *Tinctura meliae vehicatorii* of the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia. This medicine he employed in much larger doses than is commonly preferred. Thus a mixture containing an ounce of the tincture of cantharides, diffused in six ounces of water, was taken to the extent of half an ounce, four times a day; nay, in some cases, the tincture was exhibited to the extent of half an ounce in a day, without any inconvenience, and with the best effects. As examples of the power of this remedy, Mr Robertson has given a detail of six cases, selected from a number which have been under his care. In three cases, as being the most inveterate, the effects of the cantharides were most evident. And we shall only observe, that if this remedy be found by other practitioners to be equally successful in the cure of leucorrhoea, it will be a very valuable acquisition in the practice of medicine, especially if it shall be found by others, as well as by Mr Robertson, that not only the general symptoms of leucorrhoea are removed, but that the tone and functions of the uterine system are completely restored by the use of cantharides.\n\nAs women are sometimes connected with those who do not conscientiously regard their safety, it is a circumstance of the utmost consequence to distinguish a fresh venereal infection from the *fluor albus* or whites: for if the first be mistaken for the last, and be either neglected or improperly treated, the worst consequences may arise.\n\nThe following signs will best inform the patient whether there be occasion for her doubts or not.\n\nA fresh infection, called gonorrhoea, is malignant and inflammatory; the *fluor albus* most commonly arises from relaxation and bodily weakness; and therefore the remedies proper in the first disorder would render the last more violent, by locking up and confining the infectious matter.\n\nIn the gonorrhoea, the discharge chiefly proceeds from the parts contiguous to the urinary passage, and continues whilst the menses flow; but in the *fluor albus* it is supplied from the cavity of the womb and its passage, and then the menses are seldom regular.\n\nIn the gonorrhoea, an itching, inflammation, and heat of urine, are the forerunners of the discharge; the orifice of the urinary passage is prominent and painful, *Catarrhus*, and the patient is affected with a frequent irritation to make water. In the *fluor albus*, pains in the loins, and loss of strength, attend the discharge; and if any inflammation or heat of urine follow, they happen in a less degree, and only after a long continuance of the discharge, which, becoming sharp and acrimonious, excoriates the surrounding parts.\n\nIn the gonorrhoea, the discharge suddenly appears without any evident cause; but in the *fluor albus*, it comes on more slowly, and is often produced by irregularities of the menses, frequent abortion, strains, or long-continued illness.\n\nIn the gonorrhoea, the discharge is greenish or yellow, less in quantity, and not attended with the same symptoms of weakness. In the *fluor albus*, although sometimes of the same colour, especially in bad habits of body, and after long continuance, it is usually more offensive and redundant in quantity.\n\nAll the other kinds of haemorrhage enumerated by medical writers, are by Dr Cullen reckoned to be symptomatic.\n\n**Stomacace**, Sauv. gen. 241.

The catarrh is an increased excretion of mucus from the mucous membrane, of the nose, fauces and bronchiae, attended with pyrexia.\n\nPractical writers and nosologists have distinguished the disease by different appellations, according as it happens to affect different parts of the mucous membrane, one part more or less than the other: but Dr Cullen is of opinion that the disease in those different parts is always of the same nature, and proceeds from the same cause in the one as in the other. Very commonly indeed, those different parts are affected at the same time; and therefore there is little room for the distinction mentioned. The disease has been frequently treated of under the title of tuffis or cough; and a cough, indeed, always attends the chief form of catarrh, that is, the increased excretion from the bronchiae; but as it is so often also a symptom of many other affections, which are very different from one another, it is improperly used as a generic title.\n\nThe disease generally begins with some difficulty of breathing through the nose, and with a sense of some fulness stopping up that passage. This again is often attended with some dull pain and a sense of weight in the forehead, as well as a stiffness in the motion of the eyes. These feelings, sometimes at their very first beginning, and always soon after, are attended with the distillation of a thin fluid from the nose, and sometimes from the eyes; and these fluids are often found to be somewhat acrid, both by their taste and by their fretting the parts over which they pass. These symptoms constitute the coryza and graveo of authors, and are commonly attended with a sense of lassitude over the whole body. Sometimes cold shiverings are felt; at least the body is more sensible than usual to the coldness of the air; and with all this the pulse is more frequent than ordinary, especially in the evenings.\n\nThese symptoms have seldom continued long before they are accompanied with some hoarseness, and a sense of roughness and soreness in the trachea, with some difficulty of breathing, expressed by a sense of straitness in the chest, and with a cough which seems to arise from some irritation felt at the glottis. This cough is generally at first dry and painful, occasioning pains about the chest, and more especially in the breast; sometimes, together with these symptoms, pains resembling those of the rheumatism are felt in several parts of the body, particularly about the neck and head. With all these symptoms, the appetite is impaired, some thirst arises, and a feverish lassitude is felt all over the body. These symptoms mark the height and violence of the disease; but commonly it does not continue long. By degrees the cough comes to be attended with a more copious excretion of catarrhus mucus; which is at first thin, but gradually becoming thicker, is brought up with less frequent and less laborious coughing. The hoarseness and soreness of the trachea are also relieved or removed; and the febrile symptoms abating, the expectoration becomes again less considerable, and the cough less frequent, till at length they cease altogether.\n\nSuch is generally the course of this disease, neither tedious nor dangerous; but it is sometimes in both respects otherwise. The body subjected to catarrh seems to be more than usually liable to be affected by cold air; and upon exposure of the body to fresh cold, the disease, which seemed to be yielding, is often brought back with greater violence than before, and is rendered not only more tedious than otherwise it would be, but also more dangerous by the supervening of other diseases. Some degree of the cynanche tonsillaris often accompanies the catarrh; and when this is aggravated by a fresh application of cold, the cynanche also becomes more violent and dangerous from the cough which is present at the same time. When a catarrh has been occasioned by a violent cause, when it has been aggravated by improper management, and especially when it has been rendered more violent by fresh and repeated applications of cold, it often passes into a pneumonic inflammation, attended with the utmost danger.\n\nUnless, however, such accidents as these happen, a catarrh, in sound persons not far advanced in life, is always a slight and safe disease: but, in persons of a phthisical disposition, a catarrh may readily produce a haemoptysis, or perhaps form tubercles in the lungs; and still more readily in persons who have tubercles already formed in the lungs, an accidental catarrh may occasion the inflammation of these tubercles, and in consequence produce a phthisis pulmonalis.\n\nIn elderly persons, a catarrh sometimes proves a dangerous disease. Many persons, as they advance in life, and especially after they have arrived at old age, have the natural mucus of the lungs poured out in greater quantity, and requiring a frequent expectoration. If, therefore, a catarrh happen to such persons, and increase the influx of fluids to the lungs, with some degree of inflammation, it may produce the peripneumonia notha, or more properly chronic catarrh, a disease continuing often for many years, or at least returning regularly every winter; which in such cases is very often fatal.\n\nCauses, &c. The proximate cause of catarrh seems to be an increased influx of fluids to the mucous membrane of the nose, fauces, and bronchiae, along with some degree of inflammation affecting the same. The latter circumstance is confirmed by this, that, in the case of catarrh, the blood drawn from a vein commonly exhibits the same inflammatory crust which appears in the case of phlegmatis. The remote cause of catarrh is most commonly cold applied to the body. This application of cold producing catarrh is generally evident; and Dr Cullen is of opinion that it would always be so, were men acquainted with and attentive to the circumstances which determine cold to act upon the body.\n\nThe application of cold which occasions a catarrh probably operates by stopping the discharge usually made\nPractice.\n\nMEDICINE.\n\nProfuse made by the skin, and which is therefore determined to the mucous membrane of the parts above-mentioned. As a part of the weight which the body daily loses by inensible evacuation, is owing to an exhalation from the lungs, there is probably a connexion between this exhalation and the cutaneous perspiration; so that the one may be increased according as the other is diminished; and therefore we may understand how the diminution of cutaneous perspiration, by the application of cold, may increase the afflux of fluids to the lungs, and thereby produce a catarrh.\n\nDr Cullen remarks that there are some observations of Dr James Keil which may render this matter doubtful; but says there is a fallacy in those observations. The evident effects of cold in producing coryza, leave the matter, in general, without doubt; and there are several other observations which show a connexion between the lungs and the surface of the body.\n\nWhether from the suppression of perspiration, a catarrh be produced merely by an increased afflux of fluids, or whether in addition to this the matter of perspiration be at the same time determined to the mucous glands, and there excites a particular irritation, may be uncertain; but Dr Cullen thinks the latter supposition is most probable.\n\nAlthough in the case of a common catarrh, which is in many instances sporadic, it may be doubtful whether any morbid matter be applied to the mucous glands; yet we are certain that the symptoms of a catarrh do frequently depend upon such a matter being applied to these glands, as appears from the case of measles, chincough, and especially from the frequent occurrence of contagious and epidemic catarrhs.\n\nThe phenomena of contagious catarrhs have been much the same with those of the others; and the disease has always been particularly remarkable for this, that it has been the most widely and generally spreading epidemic known. It has seldom appeared in any one country of Europe, without appearing successively in almost every different part of it; and, in some instances, it has been also transferred to America, and has been spread there in like manner, so far as we have had opportunities of being informed.\n\nThe catarrh from contagion appears with nearly the same symptoms as those above mentioned. It seems often to come on in consequence of the application of cold. And indeed catarrh from cold and contagion are in every respect so similar, that when this epidemic rages, it is impossible to determine with a person having symptoms of catarrh after exposure to cold, whether the disease proceeds from the one cause or the other. In most instances, however, catarrh from contagion comes on with more cold shivering than the catarrh arising from cold alone; and the former does also not only sooner throw febrile symptoms, but to a more considerable degree. Accordingly, it more speedily runs its course, which is commonly finished in a few days. It sometimes ends by a spontaneous sweat; and this, in some persons, produces a military eruption. It is, however, the febrile state of this disease especially that is finished in a few days; for the cough and other catarrhal symptoms do frequently continue longer, and often when they appear to be going off they are renewed by any fresh application of catarrh-cold.\n\nPrognosis. Considering the number of persons who are affected with catarrh, of either the one species or the other, and escape from it quickly without any hurt, it may be allowed to be a disease commonly free from danger; but it is not always to be treated as such; for in some persons it is accompanied with pneumonic inflammation. In the phthisically disposed, it often accelerates the coming on of phthisis; and in elderly persons it often proves fatal in the manner we have explained above, viz., by degenerating into its chronic state. But though chronic catarrh be often the termination of that species which arises from cold, we have not, in any case, observed it to arise as a consequence of a catarrh from contagion. This species of catarrh, however, is not unfrequently followed by phthisis; or rather, where a phthisical tendency before existed, the affection has been begun and its progress accelerated from this cause.\n\nCure. The cure of catarrh is nearly the same, whether it proceeds from cold or contagion; only in the latter case remedies are commonly more necessary than in the former. In the cases of a moderate disease, it is commonly sufficient to avoid cold, or to abstain from animal food for some days. In some cases, where the febrile symptoms are considerable, it is proper for that length of time to lie in bed, and, by taking frequently some mild and diluent drink, a little warmed, to promote a very gentle sweat; and after this to take care to return very gradually only to the use of the free air. When the disease is more violent, not only the antiphlogistic regimen, exactly observed, but various remedies also, become necessary. To take off the phlogistic distaste which always attends this disease, blood-letting, more or less, according as the symptoms shall require, is the proper remedy. After blood-letting, for restoring the determination of the fluids to the surface of the body, and at the same time for expediting the secretion of mucus in the lungs, which may take off the inflammation of its membrane, vomiting is the most effectual means. For the last-mentioned purpose, it has been supposed that squills, gum-ammonia, the volatile alkali, and some other medicines, might be useful; but their efficacy has never been found considerable; and if squills have ever been very useful, it seems to have been rather by their emetic than by their expectorant powers. When the inflammatory affections of the lungs seem to be considerable, it is proper, besides blood-letting, to apply blisters to the back or sides.\n\nAs a cough is often the most troublesome circumstance of this disease, so demulcents may be employed to alleviate it. But after the inflammatory symptoms are much abated, if the cough still remains, opiates afford the most effectual means of relieving it; and, in the circumstances just now mentioned, they may be very safely employed. Very considerable advantage is often derived from employing opiates in such a manner as to act more immediately on the head of the wind-pipe. For this purpose, opium may often be advantageously conjoined with demulcents, melting slowly in the mouth. And perhaps no form is more convenient, or answers the purpose better, than the trochisci glycyrrhiza cum opio of the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia.\nMEDICINE.\n\nPractice.\n\n\"In a catarrhal fever, or any feverish habit attending this cough, it would be proper to take a draught of warm thin whey a few minutes before the inhaler be used; and after the process is over, the sweat which it has produced may be continued by occasional small draughts of weak warm whey or barley-water. The sweating is by no means necessary to the cure of the catarrhous cough, as that the success of the inhaler against that complaint at all depends upon it.\n\n\"After this respiratory process is over, the patient usually passes the night without the least interruption from the cough, and feels no farther molestation from it than once or twice in the morning to throw off the trifling leakage which, unperceived, had dripped into the bronchial vesicles during the night; the thinner parts of which being evaporated, what remains is soon got rid of by a very gentle effort.\n\n\"I cannot, however, take leave of this part of my subject, without pointedly observing, that if the patient means not to be disappointed by my assurances or his own expectations, it is essentially necessary that the following remarks, with regard to the time and manner of using this process, should be strictly attended to.\n\n\"First, That as tender valetudinary people are but too well acquainted with the first notices of the disorder, the remedy must, or ought to be, used the same evening; which will, in an ordinary seizure, be attended with an immediate cure: but if the forenoon of the respiratory organs, or the petulance of the cough, show the cold which has been contracted to have been very severe, the inhaler, without the opiate, should be again repeated for the same time the next morning.\n\n\"Secondly, if the use of the inhaler, &c. be delayed till the second night, it will be always right to repeat it again the next morning without the opiate, but with it if the seizure has been violent.\n\n\"And, lastly, If the cough be of some days standing, it will be always necessary to employ both parts of the process at night and the succeeding morning, as the first simple inflammatory mischief is now most probably aggravated by an additional one of a chronic tendency.\n\n\"But if, through the want of a timely application, or a total neglect of this or any other remedy, the cough should continue to harass the patient, it is, particularly in delicate and tender constitutions, of the utmost consequence to attempt the removal of it as soon as possible, before any floating acrimony in the constitution (from the perpetual irritation) receives an habitual determination to an organ so essential to life as the lungs.\n\n\"If the patient expectorate with ease and freedom a thick and well-digested inoffensive phlegm, there is generally but little doubt of his spitting off the disorder, with common care, in a few days; and till that be accomplished, a proper dose of elixir paregoricum for a few successive nights will be found very useful in suppressing the fatiguing irritation and inefficual cough, occasioned by a matter which, dripping in the early state of the disease into the bronchial during the night, is commonly at that time too thin to be discharged by those convulsive efforts.\n\n\"If, however, notwithstanding a free and copious expectoration, the cough should still continue, and the discharge,\nMEDICINE.\n\nProfluvia, discharge, instead of removing the complaint, should itself, by becoming a disease, be a greater expense than the constitution can well support; it is possible that a tender patient may spit off his life through a weak, relaxed pair of lungs, without the least appearance of purulence, or any suspicion of suppuration. In those circumstances, besides, as was mentioned before, increasing the general perspiration by the salutary friction of a flannel waistcoat, change of situation, and more especially long journeys on horseback, conducted as much as possible through a thin, sharp, dry air, will seldom fail of removing the complaint.\n\n\"But, on the contrary, if the cough should, at the same time that it is pelting and fatiguing to the breast, continue dry, husky, and without expectoration; provided there be reason to hope that no tubercles are forming, or yet actually formed, there is not perhaps a more efficacious remedy for it than half a dram of gum-ammoniacum, with 18 or 20 drops of liquid laudanum, made into pills, and taken at bedtime, and occasionally repeated. This excellent remedy Sir John Pringle did me the honour to communicate to me; and I have accordingly found it, in a great many instances, amazingly successful, and generally very expeditiously so, for it seldom fails to produce an expectoration, and to abate the distressing fatigue of the cough. In those circumstances I have likewise found the common remedy of 3i or 3ij of bals. sulph. anfus. taken twice a-day, in a little powdered sugar or any other vehicle, a very efficacious one. I have also, many times, known a salutary revolution made from the lungs by the simple application of a large plaster, about five or six inches diameter, of Burgundy pitch, between the shoulders; for the perspirable matter, which is locked up under it, becomes so sharp and acid, that in a few days it seldom fails to produce a very considerable itching, some little tendency to inflammation, and very frequently a great number of boils. This application should be continued (the plaster being occasionally changed), for three weeks or a month, or longer, if the complaint be not so soon removed.\n\n\"And here I cannot help observing, that, though seemingly a trifling, it is however by no means an useless caution to the tender patient, not to expose his shoulders in bed, and during the night, to the cold; but when he lies down, to take care they be kept warm, by drawing the bedclothes up close to his back and neck.\n\n\"If, however, notwithstanding these and other means, the cough, continuing dry or unattended with a proper expectoration, should persevere in harassing the patient; if, at last, it should produce, together with a forenoon, shooting pains through the breast and between the shoulders, attended also with shortness of the breath; and if, added to this, flushes of the cheeks after meals, scalding in the hands and feet, and other symptoms of a hectic, should accompany the disorder; there is certainly no time to be lost, as there is the greatest reason to apprehend that some acrimony in the habit is determined to the tender substance of the lungs, and that consequently tubercular suppurations will follow. In this critical and dangerous situation, I think I can venture to say from long experience, that, accompanied with change of air and occasional bleedings, the patient will find his greatest security in a drain from a large scapulary influe, assisted by a diet of asses milk and vegetables.\"\n\nGENUS XLI.

The dysentery is a disease in which the patient has frequent stools, accompanied with much griping, and followed by a tenesmus. The stools, though frequent, are generally in small quantity; and the matter voided is chiefly mucus, sometimes mixed with blood. At the same time, the natural faeces seldom appear; and when they do, it is generally in a compact and hardened form, often under the form of small hard substances known by the name of fecula. This disease occurs especially in summer and autumn, at the same time with autumnal intermittent and remittent fevers; and with these it is often complicated. It comes on sometimes with cold shiverings, and other symptoms of pyrexia; but more commonly the symptoms of the topical affection appear first. The belly is colitive, with an unusual fulness in the bowels. Sometimes, though more rarely, some degree of diarrhoea is the first appearance. In most cases, the disease begins with griping, and a frequent inclination to go to stool. In indulging this, little is voided, but some tenesmus attends it. By degrees the stools become more frequent, the griping more severe, and the tenesmus more considerable. With these symptoms there is a loss of appetite, and frequently sickness, nausea, and vomiting, also affecting the patient. At the same time there is always more or less of pyrexia present. It is sometimes of the remittent kind, and observes a tertian period. Sometimes the pyrexia is manifestly inflammatory, and very often of a putrid kind. These febrile states continue to accompany the disease during its whole course, especially when it terminates soon in a fatal manner. In other cases, the febrile state almost entirely disappears, while the proper dysenteric symptoms remain for a long time after. In the course of the disease, whether for a shorter or a longer time, the matter voided by stool is very various. Sometimes it is merely a mucous matter, without any blood, exhibiting that disease which is named by some the morbus mucosus, and by others the dysenteria alba. For the most part, however, the mucus discharged is more or less mixed with blood. This sometimes appears only in streaks among the mucus; but at other times is more copious, giving a tincture to the whole; and upon some occasions a pure and unmixed blood is voided in considerable quantity. In other respects, the matter voided is variously changed in colour and consistence, and is commonly of a strong and unusually fetid odour. It is probable, that sometimes a genuine pus is voided, and frequently a putrid faeces, proceeding from gangrenous parts. There are very often mixed with the liquid matter some films of a membranous appearance, and frequently some small matters of a seemingly sebaceous matter. While the stools voiding these various matters are, in many instances, exceedingly frequent,\nquent, it is seldom that natural faeces appear in them; and when they do appear, it is, as we have said, in the form of scybala, that is, in somewhat hardened, separate balls. When these are voided, whether by the efforts of nature or as solicited by art, they procure a remission of all the symptoms, and more especially of the frequent stools, griping, and tenesmus.\n\nAccompanied with these circumstances, the disease proceeds for a longer or shorter time. When the pyrexia attending it is of a violent inflammatory kind, and more especially when it is of a very putrid nature, the disease often terminates fatally in a very few days, with all the marks of a supervening gangrene. When the febrile state is more moderate, or disappears altogether, the disease is often protracted for weeks, and even for months; but, even then, after a various duration, it often terminates fatally, and generally in consequence of a return and considerable aggravation of the inflammatory and putrid states. In some cases, the disease ceases spontaneously; the frequency of stools, the griping, and tenesmus, gradually diminishing, while natural stools return. In other cases, the disease, with moderate symptoms, continues long, and ends in a diarrhoea, sometimes accompanied with lienteric symptoms.\n\nCauses, &c. The remote causes of this disease have been variously represented. In general it arises in summer or autumn, after considerable heats have prevailed for some time, and especially after very warm and at the same time very dry states of the weather; and the disease is much more frequent in warm than in cooler climates. It happens, therefore, in the same circumstances and seasons which considerably affect the state of the bile in the human body; but the cholera is often without any dysenteric symptoms, and copious discharges of bile have been found to relieve the symptoms of dysentery; so that it is difficult to determine what connexion the disease has with the state of the bile.\n\nIt has been observed, that the effluvia from very putrid animal substances readily affect the alimentary canal, and, upon occasion, they certainly produce a diarrhoea; but whether they ever produce a genuine dysentery, is not certain.\n\nThe dysentery does often manifestly arise from the application of cold, but the disease is always contagious; and, by the propagation of such contagion, independent of cold, or other exciting causes, it becomes epidemic in camps and other places. It is, therefore, to be doubted if the application of cold ever produces the disease, unless where the specific contagion has been previously received into the body; and, upon the whole, it is probable that a specific contagion is to be considered as being always the remote cause of this disease.\n\nWhether this contagion, like many others, be of a permanent nature, and only shows its effects in certain circumstances which render it active, or if it be occasionally produced, we cannot determine. Neither, if the latter supposition be received, can we say by what means it may be generated. As little do we know any thing of its nature, considered in itself; or at most, only this, that in common with many other contagions, it is very often somewhat of a putrid nature, and capable of inducing a putrefactive tendency in the human body. This, however, does not at all explain Dysentery, the peculiar effect of inducing those symptoms which properly and essentially constitute dysentery. Of these symptoms the proximate cause is still obscure.—The common opinion has been, that the disease depends upon an acrid matter thrown upon or somehow generated in the intestines, exciting their peristaltic motion, and thereby producing the frequent stools which occur in this disease. But this supposition cannot be adopted; for, in all the instances known, of acrid substances applied to the intestines, and producing frequent stools, they at the same time produce copious stools, as might be expected from acrid substances applied to any length of the intestines. This, however, is not the case in dysentery, in which the stools, however frequent, are generally in very small quantity, and such as may be supposed to proceed from the lower parts of the rectum only. With respect to the superior portions of the intestines, and particularly those of the colon, it is probable they are under a preternatural and considerable degree of constrictive; for, as we have said above, the natural faeces are seldom voided; and when they are, it is in a form which gives reason to suppose they have been long retained in the cells of the colon, and consequently that the colon had been affected with a preternatural constrictive. This is confirmed by almost all the dilatations which have been made of the bodies of dysenteric patients; in which, when gangrene had not entirely destroyed the texture and form of the parts, large portions of the great guts have been found affected with a very considerable constrictive.\n\nThe proximate cause of dysentery, or at least the chief part of the proximate cause, seems to consist in a preternatural constrictive of the colon, occasioning, at the same time, those spasmodic efforts which are felt in severe gripings, and which efforts, propagated downwards to the rectum, occasion there the frequent mucous stools and tenesmus. But whether this explanation shall be admitted or not, it will still remain certain, that hardened faeces, retained in the colon, are the cause of the griping, frequent stools, and tenesmus: for the evacuation of these faeces, whether by nature or by art, gives relief from the symptoms mentioned; and it will be more fully and usefully confirmed by this, that the most immediate and successful cure of dysentery is obtained by an early and constant attention to the preventing the constrictive, and the frequent stagnation of faeces in the colon.\n\nCure. In the early periods of this disease, the objects chiefly to be aimed at are the following: The discharge of acrid matter deposited in the alimentary canal; the counteracting the influence of this matter when it cannot be evacuated; the obviating the effects resulting from such acrid matter as can neither be evacuated nor destroyed; and, finally, the prevention of any further separation and deposition of such matter in the alimentary canal. In the more advanced periods of the disease, the principal objects are, the giving a proper defence to the intestines against irritating causes; the diminution of the morbid sensibility of the intestinal canal; and the restoration of due vigour to the system in general, but to the intestines in particular.\n\nThe most eminent of our late practitioners, and\nPractice.\n\nMEDICINE.\n\nProstuvia of greatest experience in this disease, seem to be of opinion, that it is to be cured most effectually by purging, affluently employed. The means may be various; but the most gentle laxatives are usually sufficient; and, as the medicine must be frequently repeated, these are the most safe, more especially as an inflammatory state so frequently accompanies the disease. Whatever laxatives produce an evacuation of natural faeces, and a consequent remission of the symptoms, will be sufficient to effectuate the cure. But if the gentle laxatives shall not produce the evacuation now mentioned, somewhat more powerful must be employed; and Dr Cullen has found nothing more proper or convenient than tartar emetic, given in small doses, and at such intervals as may determine its operation to be chiefly by stool. To the tartarite of antimony, however, employed as a purgative, the great sickness which it is apt to occasion, and the tendency which it has, notwithstanding every precaution, to operate as an emetic, are certainly objections. Another antimonial, at one time considered as an almost infallible remedy for this disease, the vitrum antimonii ceratum, is no less exceptionable, from the uncertainty and violence of its operation; and perhaps the safest and best purgatives are the different neutral salts, particularly those containing fossil alkali; such as the soda vitriolata tartarifata or phosphorata. Rhubarb, so frequently employed, is, Dr Cullen thinks, in several respects, amongst the most unfit purgatives; and indeed from its astringent quality, it is exceptionable at the commencement of the affection, unless it be conjoined with something to render its operation more brisk, such as mild muriated mercury, or calomel as it is commonly called.\n\nVomiting has been held a principal remedy in this disease; and may be usefully employed in the beginning, with a view both to the state of the stomach and of the fever: but it is not necessary to repeat it often; and, unless the emetics employed operate also by stool, they are of little service. Ipecacuanha is by no means a specific; and it proves only useful when so managed as to operate chiefly by stool.\n\nFor relieving the contraction of the colon, and evacuating the retained faeces, clysters may sometimes be useful; but they are seldom so effectual as laxatives given by the mouth; and acrid clysters, if they be not effectual in evacuating the colon, may prove hurtful by stimulating the rectum too much.\n\nThe frequent and severe griping attending this disease, leads almost necessarily to the use of opiates; and they are very effectual for the purpose of relieving from the gripes: but, by occasioning an interruption of the action of the small intestines, they favour the contraction of the colon, and thereby aggravate the disease; and if, at the same time, the use of them supercede in any measure the employing purgatives, it is doing much mischief; and the neglect of purging seems to be the only thing which renders the use of opiates very necessary.\n\nWhen the gripes are both frequent and severe, they may sometimes be relieved by the employment of the fennecupium, or by fomentation of the abdomen continued for some time. In the same case, the pains may be relieved, and the constriction of the colon may be taken off, by blisters applied to the lower belly.\n\nAt the beginning of this disease, when the fever is any way considerable, bloodletting, in patients of tolerable vigour, may be proper and necessary; and, when the pulse is full and hard, with other symptoms of an inflammatory disposition, bloodletting ought to be repeated. But, as the fever attending dysentery is often of the typhoid kind, or does, in the course of the disease, become soon of that nature, bloodletting must be cautiously employed.\n\nFrom our account of the nature of this disease, it will be sufficiently obvious, that the use of astringents in the beginning of it must be very pernicious. But although astringents may be hurtful at early periods of this affection, yet it cannot be denied, that where frequent loose stools remain after the febrile symptoms have subsided, they are often of great service for diminishing morbid sensibility, and restoring due vigour to the intestinal canal. Accordingly, on this ground a variety of articles have been highly celebrated in this affection; among others we may mention the quassia, radix indica lopeziana, verbacum, extractum catechu, and gum kino, all of which have certainly in particular cases been employed with great advantage. And perhaps also, on the same principles we are to account for the benefit which has been sometimes derived from the nux vomica, a remedy highly extolled in cases of dysentery by some of the Swedish physicians; but this article, it must be allowed, often proves very powerful as an evacuant. Its effects, however, whatever its mode of operation may be, are too precarious to allow its ever being introduced into common practice; and in this country, it has, we believe, been but very rarely employed. Whether an acid matter be the original cause of the dysentery, may be uncertain; but, from the indigestion, and the stagnation of fluids, which attend the disease, we may suppose that some acid matters are constantly present in the stomach and intestines; and therefore that demulcents may be always usefully employed. At the same time, from the consideration that mild oily matters thrown into the intestines in considerable quantity always prove laxative, Dr Cullen is of opinion, that the oleaginous demulcents are the most useful. Where, however, these are not acceptable to the patient's taste, those of the mucilaginous and farinaceous kind, as the decoctum hordei, potio cretacea, &c., are often employed with advantage.\n\nAs this disease is so often of an inflammatory or of a putrid nature, it is evident that the diet employed in it should be vegetable and acetic. Milk, in its entire state, is of doubtful quality in many cases; but even some portion of the cream is often allowable, and whey is always proper.—In the first stages of the disease, the sweet and subacid fruits are allowable, and even proper. It is in the more advanced stages only that any morbid acidity seems to prevail in the stomach, and to require some reserve in the use of acids. At the beginning of the disease, absorbents seem to be superfluous; and, by their astringent and septic powers, they may be hurtful; but in after periods they are often of advantage.\n\nWhen this disease is complicated with an intermit-\ntent, and is protracted from that circumstance chiefly, it is to be treated as an intermittent, by administering the cinchona, which in the earlier periods of the disease is hardly to be admitted.\n\n**Class II.

The Sanguineous Apoplexy.**\n\n*Description.* In this disease the patients fall suddenly down, and are deprived of all sense and voluntary motion, but without convulsions. A giddiness of the head, noise in the ears, corrugations before the eyes, and redness of the face, usually precede. The distinguishing symptom of the disease is a deep sleep, attended with violent snoring; if any thing be put into the mouth, it is returned through the nose; nor can anything be swallowed without shutting the nostrils; and even when this is done, the person is in the utmost danger of suffocation. Sometimes apoplectic patients will open their eyes after having taken a large dose of an emetic; but if they show no sign of sense, there is not the least hope of their recovery. Sometimes the apoplexy terminates in a hemiplegia; in which case it comes on with a distortion of the mouth towards the sound side, a drawing of the tongue the same way, and slumbering of the speech. Diseases sometimes show a rupture of some vessels of the meninges, or even vessels of the brain itself; though sometimes, if we may believe Dr Willis, no defect is to be observed either in the cerebrum or cerebellum.\n\n*Cautions,* &c. The general cause of a sanguineous apoplexy is a plethoric habit of body, with a determination to the head. The disease therefore may be brought on by whatever violently urges on the circulation of the blood; such as surfeits, intoxication, violent passions of the mind, immoderate exercise, &c. It takes place, however, for the most part, when the venous plethora has subsided for a considerable time in the system. For that reason it commonly does not attack people till past the age of 60; and that whether the patients are corpulent and have a short neck, or whether they are of a lean habit of body. Till people be past the age of childhood, apoplexy never happens.\n\n*Prognosis.* This disease very often kills at its first attack, and few survive a repetition of the fit; so that those who make mention of people who have survived several attacks of the apoplexy, have probably mistaken the epilepsy for this disease. In no disease is the prognosis more fatal; since those who seem to be recovering from a fit, are frequently and suddenly carried off by its return, without either warning of its approach or possibility of preventing it. The good signs are when the disease apparently wears off, and the patient evidently begins to recover; the bad ones are when all the symptoms continue and increase.\n\n*Cure.* The great object to be aimed at, is to restore the connexion between the sentient and corporeal parts of the system; and when interruption to this connexion proceeds from compression in the brain by blood, this is to be attempted, in the first place, by large and repeated bleedings; after which, the same remedies are to be used as in the sanguineous apoplexy, aforementioned. The body is to be kept in a somewhat erect posture, and the head supported in that situation.\n\n**Sp. II. The Serous Apoplexy.**\n\nApoplexia pituitosa, Sauv. sp. 7.

On dissection, the ventricles of the brain are found to contain a larger quantity of fluid than they ought; the other symptoms are the same as in the former.\n\n*Cautions,* &c. This may arise from anything which induces a debilitated state of the body, such as depressing passions of the mind, much study, watching, &c. It may also be brought on by a too plentiful use of diluting, acidulated drinks. It doth not, how-\nPractice.\n\nConata-\n\never, follow, that the extravafated ferum above mentioned in the ventricles of the brain is always the cause of the disease, since the animal fluids are very frequently observed to ooze out in plenty through the coats of the containing vessels after death, though no extravasation took place during life.\n\nPrognosis. This species is equally fatal with the other; and what hath been said of the prognosis of the sanguineous, may also be said of that of the serous apoplexy.\n\nCure. In this species venesection can scarcely be admitted; acid purgatives, emetics, and stimulating clysters, are recommended to carry off the superabundant ferum; but in bodies already debilitated, they may perhaps be liable to the same exceptions with venesection itself. Volatile salts, cephalic elixirs, and cordials, are also prescribed; and in case of a hemiplegia supervening, the cure is to be attempted by aperient pills, cathartics, and sudorifics; gentle exercise, as riding in a carriage; with blisters and such stimulating medicines as are in general had recourse to in affections originally of the paralytic kind.\n\nSp.

Diff. de hydrocephalo,\n1779.\nAsthena à hydrocephalo, Sauv. l.p. 3.\n\nHistory and description. This disease has been accurately treated within these few years by several eminent physicians, particularly the late Dr Whytt, Dr Fothergill, and Dr Watson; who concur in opinion, with respect to the seat of the complaint, the most of its symptoms, and its general fatality. Out of twenty patients that had fallen under Dr Whytt's observation, he candidly owns that he had been so unfortunate as to cure only one who laboured under the characteristic symptoms of the hydrocephalus; and he supposes that those who imagine they have been more successful, had mistaken another distemper for this. It is by all supposed to consist in a dropsy of the ventricles of the brain; and this opinion is fully established by dissections. It is observed to happen more commonly to healthy, active, lively children, than to those of a different disposition.\n\nDr Whytt supposes that the commencement of this disease is obscure; that it is generally some months in forming; and that, after some obvious urgent symptoms rendering assistance necessary, it continues some weeks before its fatal termination. This, in general, differs from what has hitherto been observed by Dr Fothergill; the latter informing us, that he has seen children, who, from all appearance, were healthy and active, seized with this distemper, and carried off in about 14 days. He has seldom been able to trace the commencement of it above three weeks.\n\nThough the hydrocephalus be most incident to children, it has been sometimes observed in adults; as appears from a case related by Dr Huck, and from some Apoplexia others.\n\nWhen the disease appears under its most common form, the symptoms at different periods are so various as to lead Dr Whytt to divide the disease into three stages, which are chiefly marked by changes occurring in the condition of the pulse. At the beginning it is quicker than natural; afterwards it becomes uncommonly slow; and towards the conclusion of the disease it becomes again quicker than natural, but at the same time often very irregular.\n\nThose who are seized with this distemper usually complain first of a pain in some part below the head; most commonly about the nape of the neck and shoulders; often in the legs; and sometimes, but more rarely, in the arms. The pain is not uniformly acute, nor always fixed to one place; and sometimes does not affect the limbs. In the latter case, the head and stomach have been found to be most disordered; so that when the pain occupied the limbs, the sickness or headache was less considerable; and when the head became the seat of the complaint, the pain in the limbs was seldom or never mentioned. Some had very violent sicknesses and violent headaches alternately. From being perfectly well and sportive, some were in a few hours seized with those pains in the limbs, or with sickness, or headache, in a slight degree, commonly after dinner; but some were observed to droop a few days before they complained of any local indisposition. In this manner they continued three, four, or five days, more or less, as the children were healthy and vigorous. They then commonly complain of an acute deep-seated pain in the head, extending across the forehead from temple to temple; of which, and a sickness, they alternately complain in short and affecting exclamations; doing a little in the intervals, breathing irregularly, and lying much while awake. Sometimes their sighs, for the space of a few minutes, are incessant.\n\nAs the disease advances, the pulse becomes slower and irregular, the strokes being made both with unequal force and in unequal times, till within a day or two of the fatal termination of the disorder, when it becomes exceeding quick; the breathing being at the same time deep, irregular, and laborious. After the first attack, which is often attended with feverish heats, especially towards evening, the heat of the body is for the most part temperate, till at last it keeps pace with the increasing quickness of the pulse. The head and praecordia are always hot from the first attack. The sleeps are short and disturbed, sometimes interrupted by watchfulness; besides which there are startings.\n\nIn the first stage of the disease there seems to be a peculiar sensibility of the eyes, as appears from the intolerance of light. But in the progress of the disease a very opposite state occurs: The pupil is remarkably dilated, and cannot be made to contract by the action even of strong light; such, for example, as by bringing a candle very near to it. In many cases there is reason to believe that total blindness occurs: Often also the pupil of one eye is more dilated than that of another, and the power of moving the eyes is also morbidly affected. Those children, who were never observed to squint before, often become affected with\nComata. with a very great degree of strabismus. The patients are unwilling to be disturbed for any purpose, and can bear no posture but that of lying horizontally. One or both hands are most commonly about their heads. The urine and stools come away insensibly. At length the eyelids become paralytic, great heat accompanied with sweat overspreads the whole body, respiration is rendered totally suspitious, the pulse increases in its trembling undulations beyond the possibility of counting, till the vital motions entirely cease; and sometimes convulsions conclude the scene.\n\nMany of the symptoms above enumerated are so common to worm cases, teething, and other irritating causes, that it is difficult to fix upon any which particularly characterize this disease at its commencement. The most peculiar seem to be the pains in the limbs, with tickles and incessant headache; which, though frequent in other diseases of children, are neither so uniformly nor so constantly attendant as in this. Another circumstance observed to be familiar, if not peculiar to this distemper, is, that the patients are not only colicive, but it is likewise with the greatest difficulty that stools can be procured. These are generally of a very dark greenish colour with an offensive or a glairy bile, rather than the slime which accompanies worms; and they are, for the most part, extremely offensive. No positive conclusion can be drawn from the appearance of the urine; it being various, in different subjects, both in its colour and contents, according to the quantity of liquor they drank, and the time between the discharges of the urine. From their unwillingness to be moved, they often retain their water 12 or 15 hours, and sometimes longer. In complaints arising from worms, and in dentition, convulsions are more frequent than in this disorder. Children subject to fits are sometimes seized with them a few days before they die. Sometimes these continue 24 hours incessantly, and till they expire.\n\nCauses. The causes of internal hydrocephalus are very much unknown. Some suppose it to proceed from a rupture of some of the lymphatic vessels of the brain. But this supposition is so far from being confirmed by any anatomical observation, that even the existence of such vessels in the brain is not clearly demonstrated. That lymphatics, however, do exist in the brain, cannot be doubted; and one of the most probable causes giving rise to an accumulation of water in the brain is a diminished action of these. Here, however, as well as in other places, accumulation may also be the consequence of augmented effusion; and in this way, an inflammatory dilution, as some have supposed, may give rise to the affection. But from whatever cause an accumulation of water in the ventricles of the brain be produced, there can be no doubt that from this the principal symptoms of the disease arise, and that a cure is to be accomplished only by the removal of it. It is, however, probable, that the symptoms are somewhat varied by the position of the water, and that the affection of vision in particular is often the consequence of some morbid state about the thalami nervorum opticorum; at least, in many cases, large collections of water in the ventricles have occurred, without either strabismus, intolerance of light, or dilatation of the pupil. And in cases where these symptoms have taken place to a remarkable degree, while upon dissection after death but a very small collection of water was found in the ventricles, it has been observed, that a peculiar tumid appearance was discovered about the optic nerves, which upon examination was found to arise from water in the cellular texture. This may have given compression producing a state of insensibility; but it may have been preceded, or it may even have originated from some inflammatory affection of these parts, producing the intolerance of light.\n\nPrognosis and Cure. Till very lately this disorder was reckoned totally incurable; but of late it has been alleged, that mercury, if applied in time, will remove every symptom. This remedy was first suggested by Dr Dobson of Liverpool, and afterwards employed apparently with success by Dr Percival, Dr Makie, and others. But the practice has by no means been found to be generally successful. In a great majority of instances, after mercury has had the fairest trial, the disorder has proved fatal. And it is a very remarkable circumstance, that in this disease, after great quantities of mercury have been used both externally and internally, it rarely affects the mouth. But even in cases where salivation has been induced, a fatal conclusion has yet ensued.\n\nOf late the digitalis purpurea has been thought, in some cases of hydrocephalus, as well as in other obliterative disorders, to be employed with benefit. But this also, in the hands of most practitioners, has very generally failed. Perhaps there is no remedy from which benefit has more frequently been observed than from blisters. But we may conclude with observing, that the cure of the apoplexia hydrocephalica still remains to be discovered.\n\nSp. IV. Apoplexy from Atrabilis.\n\nApoplexia atrabilariarum, Sauv. sp. 12.

Carus ab infestatione, Sauv. sp. 12.\nThe poisons which bring on an apoplexy when taken internally may be either of the stimulant or sedative kind, as spirituous liquors, opium, and the more virulent kinds of vegetable poisons. The vapours of mercury, or of lead, in great quantity, will sometimes produce a similar effect; though commonly they produce rather a paralysis, and operate slowly. The vapours of charcoal, or fixed air, in any form, breathed in great quantity, also produce an apoplexy, or a state very similar to it; and even cold itself produces a fatal sleep, though without the apoplectic stertor.—To enumerate all the different symptoms which affect the unhappy persons who have swallowed opium, or any of the stronger vegetable narcotics, is impossible, as they are scarcely to be found the same in any two patients. The state induced by them seems to differ somewhat from that of a true apoplexy; as it is commonly attended with convulsions, but has the particular distinguishing sign of apoplexy, namely, a very difficult breathing or snorting, more or less violent according to the quantity of poisonous matter swallowed.\n\nOf the poisonous effects of fixed air, Dr Percival gives the following account. \"All these noxious vapours, whether arising from burning charcoal, the fermenting grape, the Grotti di Cani, or the cavern of Pyrmont, operate nearly in the same manner. When accumulated and confined, their effects are often instantaneous; they immediately destroy the action of the brain and nerves, and in a moment arrest the vital motions. When more diffused, their effects are slower, but still evidently mark out a direct affection of the nervous system.\n\n\"Those who are exposed to the vapours of the fermenting grape, are as instantly destroyed as they would be by the strongest electrical shock. A state of insensibility is the immediate effect upon those animals which are thrust into the Grotti di Cani, or the cavern of Pyrmont: the animal is deprived of motion, lies as if dead; and if not quickly returned into the fresh air, is irrecoverable. And if we attend to the histories of those who have suffered from the vapours of burning charcoal, we shall in like manner find, that the brain and moving powers are the parts primarily affected.\n\n\"A cook who had been accustomed to make use of lighted charcoal more than his business required, and to stand with his head over these fires, complained for a year of very acute pain in the head; and after this was seized with a paralytic affection of the lower limbs, and a slow fever.\n\n\"A person was left reading in bed with a pan of charcoal in a corner of the room. On being visited early the next morning, he was found with his eyes shut, his book open and laid on one side, his candle extinguished, and to appearance like one in a deep sleep. Stimulants and cupping-glasses gave no relief; but he was soon recovered by the free access of fresh air.\n\n\"Four prisoners, in order to make their escape, attempted to destroy the iron work of their windows, by the means of burning charcoal. As soon as they commenced their operations, the fumes of the charcoal being confined by the closeness of the prison, one of them was struck dead; another was found pale, speechless, and without motion; afterwards he spoke incoherently, was seized with a fever, and died. The other two were with great difficulty recovered.\n\n\"Two boys went to warm themselves in a stove heated with charcoal. In the morning they were found destitute of sense and motion, with countenances as composed as in a placid sleep. There were some remains of pulse, but they died in a short time.\n\n\"A fisherman deposited a large quantity of charcoal in a deep cellar. Some time afterwards his son, a healthy strong man, went down into the cellar with a pan of burning charcoal and a light in his hand. He had scarcely descended to the bottom, when his candle went out. He returned, lighted his candle, and again descended. Soon after, he called aloud for assistance. His mother, brother, and a servant, halted to give him relief; but none of them returned. Two others of the village shared the same fate. It was then determined to throw large quantities of water into the cellar; and after two or three days, they had access to the dead bodies.\n\n\"Cælius Aurelianus says, that those who are injured by the fumes of charcoal become cataleptic. And Hoffman enumerates a train of symptoms, which in no respect correspond with his idea of suffocation. Those who suffer from the fumes of burning charcoal, says he, have severe pains in the head, great debility, faintness, stupor, and lethargy.\n\n\"It appears from the above histories and observations, that these vapours exert their noxious effects on the brain and nerves. Sometimes they occasion sudden death; at other times, the various symptoms of a debilitated nervous system, according as the poison is more or less concentrated. The olfactory nerves are first and principally affected, and the brain and nervous system by sympathy or consent of parts. It is well known, that there is a strong and ready consent between the olfactory nerves and many other parts of the nervous system. The effluvia of flowers and perfumes, in delicate or irritable habits, produce a train of symptoms, which, though transient, are analogous to those which are produced by the vapours of charcoal; viz. vertigo, sickness, faintness, and sometimes a total insensibility. The female malefactor, whom Dr Mead inoculated by putting into the nostrils doffs of cotton impregnated with various matter, was, immediately on the introduction, afflicted with an excruciating headache, and had a constant fever till after the eruption.\n\n\"The vapours of burning charcoal, and other poisonous effluvia, frequently produce their prejudicial, and even fatal effects, without being either offensive to the smell or opprobrious to the lungs. It is a matter of importance, therefore, that the common opinion should be more agreeable to truth; for where suffocation is supposed to be the effect, there will be little apprehension of danger, so long as the breast keeps free from pain or oppression.\n\n\"It may be well to remember, that the poison itself is distinct from that gross matter which is offensive to the smell; and that this is frequently in its most active state when undistinguished by the sense. Were\nthe following cautions generally attended to, they might in some instances be the happy means of preserving life. Never to be confined with burning charcoal in a small room, or where there is not a free draught of air by a chimney or some other way. Never to venture into any place in which air has been long pent up, or which from other circumstances ought to be suspected; unless such suspected place be either previously well ventilated, or put to the test of the lighted candle; for it is a singular and well-known fact, that the life of flame is in some circumstances sooner affected and more expeditiously extinguished by noxious vapours than animal-life; a proof of which I remember to have received from a very intelligent clergyman, who was present at a musical entertainment in the theatre at Oxford. The theatre was crowded; and during the entertainment, the candles were observed to burn dim, and some of them went out. The audience complained only of faintness and languor; but had the animal effluvia been still further accumulated or longer confined, they would have been extinguished as well as the candles.\n\n\"The most obvious, effectual, and expeditious means of relief to those who have unhappily suffered from this cause, are such as will dilodge and wash away the poison, restore the energy of the brain and nerves, and renew the vital motions. Let the patient therefore be immediately carried into the open air, and let the air be fanned backwards and forwards to assist its action; let cold water be thrown on the face; let the face, mouth, and nostrils, be repeatedly washed; and as soon as practicable, get the patient to drink some cold water. But if the case be too far gone to be thus relieved, let a healthy person breathe into the mouth of the patient; and gently force air into the mouth, throat, and nostrils. Frictions, cupping, bleeding, and blisters, are likewise indicated. And if, after the instant danger is removed, a fever be excited, the method of cure must be adapted to the nature and prevailing symptoms of the fever.\"\n\nWith regard to the poison of opium, Dr Mead recommends the following method of cure. Besides evacuations by vomiting, bleeding, and blistering, acid medicines and lixivial salts are proper. These contract the relaxed fibres, and by their diuretic force make a depletion of the vessels. Dr Mead says he has given repeated doses of a mixture of salt of wormwood and juice of lemons, with extraordinary success. But nothing perhaps is of greater consequence, than to use proper means for the prevention of sleep, by rousing and stirring the patient, and by forcing him to walk about; for if he be once permitted to fall into a sound sleep, it will be found altogether impossible to awake him.\n\nOf a kind somewhat akin to the poison of opium seems to be that of laurel-water, a simple water distilled from the leaves of the lauro-cerasus or common laurel. The bad effects of this were particularly observed in Ireland, where it had been customary to mix it with brandy for the sake of the flavour; and thus two women were suddenly killed by it. This gave occasion to some experiments upon dogs, in order to ascertain the malignant qualities of the water in question; and the event was as follows: All the dogs fell immediately into totterings and convulsions of the limbs, which were soon followed by a total paralysis, so that apoplexy, no motion could be excited even by pricking or cutting them. No inflammation was found upon dissection, in any of the internal membranes. The most remarkable thing was a great fulness and distention of the veins, in which the blood was so fluid, that even the lymph in its vessels was generally found tinged with red. The same effects were produced by the water injected into the intestines by way of clyster.\n\nTo make the experiment more fully, Dr Nicholls prepared some of this water so strong, that about a dram of heavy essential oil remained at the bottom of three pints of it, which by frequent shaking was again quite incorporated with it. So virulent was this water, that two ounces of it killed a middle-sized dog in less than half a minute, even while it was passing down his throat. The poison appeared to refer entirely in the above-mentioned essential oil, which comes over by distillation, not only from the leaves of laurel, but from some other vegetables; for ten drops of a red oil distilled from bitter almonds, when mixed with half an ounce of water, and given to a dog, killed him in less than half an hour.\n\nVolatile alkalies are found to be an antidote to this poison; of which Dr Mead gives the following instance. About an ounce of strong laurel-water was given to a small dog. He fell immediately into the most violent convulsions, which were soon followed by a total loss of his limbs. When he seemed to be expiring, a phial of good spirit of sal ammoniac was held to his nose, and a small quantity of the same forced down his throat; he instantly felt its virtue; and by continuing the use of it for some time, he by degrees recovered the motion of his legs; and in two hours walked about with tolerable strength, and was afterwards quite well.\n\nWith regard to the pernicious effects of cold, there is no other way of counteracting them but by the application of external heat. We are apt to imagine, that the following considerable quantities of ardent spirits may be a means of making us resist the cold, and preventing the bad effects of it from arising to such a height as to destroy life; but these do not appear to be in the least possessed of any such virtue in those countries liable to great excesses of cold. The cinchona, by strengthening the fluids, as well as increasing the motion of the fluids, is found to answer better than any other thing as a preservative; but when the pernicious effects have already begun to discover themselves, nothing but increasing by some means or other the heat of the body can possibly be depended upon; and even this must be attempted with great care; for as, in such cases, there is generally a tendency to mortification in some of the extremities, the sudden application of heat will certainly increase this tendency to such a degree as to destroy the parts. But for the external treatment of such mortifications, see the article SURGERY.\n\nSp. VII.

It is said to come on suddenly, being only preceded by some languor of body and mind; and to return by paroxysms. The patients are said to be for some minutes, sometimes (though rarely) for some hours, deprived of their senses, and all power of voluntary motions; but constantly retaining the position in which they were first seized, whether lying or sitting; and if the limbs be put into any other posture during the fit, they will keep the posture in which they are placed. When they recover from the paroxysm, they remember nothing of what passed during the time of it, but are like persons awakened out of sleep.—Concerning the cure of this disorder we find nothing that can be depended upon among medical writers.\n\nSp.

The palsy under all the different forms here mentioned as particular species, shows itself by a sudden loss of tone and vital power in a certain part of the body. In the lighter degrees of the disease, it only affects a particular muscle, as the sphincter of the anus or bladder, thus occasioning an involuntary discharge of excrements or of urine; of the muscles of the tongue, which occasions stammering, or loss of speech; of the muscles of the larynx, by which the patient becomes unable to swallow solids, and sometimes even liquids also.—In the higher degrees of the disease, the paralytic affection is diffused over a whole limb, as the foot, leg, hand, or arm; and sometimes it affects a whole side of the body, in which case it is called hemiplegia; and sometimes, which is the most violent case, it affects all the parts below the waist, or even below the head, though this last be exceedingly rare. In these violent cases, the speech is either very much impeded, or totally lost. Convulsions often take place in the sound side, with the cynic spasm or involuntary laughter, and other distortions of the face. Sometimes the whole paralytic part of the body becomes livid, or even mortifies before the patient's death; and sometimes the paralytic parts gradually decay and shrivel up, so as to become much less than before. Whether the disease be more or less extended, many different varieties may be observed in its form. Sometimes there occurs a total loss of sense while motion is entire; in others a total loss of motion with very slight or even no affection of sense; and in some cases, while a total loss of motion takes place in one side, a total loss of sense has been observed on the other. This depends entirely on the particular nerves or branches of nerves in which the affection is situated; loss of sense depending on an affection of the subcutaneous nerves; and loss of motion on an affection of those leading to the muscles.\n\nCauses, &c. Palpitations most commonly supervene upon the different species of coma, especially the apoplexy. They are also occasioned by any debilitating power applied to the body, especially by excesses in venery. Sometimes they are a kind of crisis to other distempers, as the colic of Poitou, and the apoplexy. The hemiplegia especially often follows the last-mentioned disease. Aged people, and those who are by any other means debilitated, are subject to palsy; which will sometimes also affect even infants, from the repulsion of exanthemata of various kinds. Palpitations are also the infallible consequences of injuries to the large nerves.\n\nPrognosis.\nPrognosis. Except in the lighter cases of palsy, we have little room to hope for a cure; however, death does not immediately follow even the most severe paralytic affections. In hemiplegia it is not uncommon to see the patients live several years; and even in the paraplegia, if death do not ensue within two or three weeks, it may not take place for a considerable time. It is a promising sign when the patient feels a slight degree of painful itching in the affected parts; and if a fever should arise, it bids fair to cure the palsy. When the sense of feeling remains, there is much more room to hope for a cure than where it is gone, as well as the power of motion. But when we observe the flesh to waste, and the skin to appear withered and dry, we may look upon the disease to be incurable. Convulsions supervening on a palsy are a fatal sign.\n\nCure. Many remedies have been recommended in palsies: but it must be confessed, that, except in the lighter cases, medicines seldom prove effectual; and before any plan of cure can be laid down, every circumstance relative to the patient's habit of body and previous state of health should be carefully weighed. If hemiplegia or paraplegia should come on after an apoplexy, attended with those circumstances which physicians have supposed to denote a viscid state of the blood, a course of the attenuant gums, with fixed alkaline salts, and chalybeate waters, may do service; to which it will be proper to add frictions with the volatile liniment down the spine: but in habits where the blood is rather inclined to the watery state, it will be necessary to give entities from time to time; to apply blisters, and infuse fluids.\n\nThe natural hot baths are often found useful in paralytic cases; and where the patients cannot avail themselves of these, an artificial bath may be tried by dissolving salt of steel in water, and impregnating the water with fixed air. Frictions of the parts, and scouring them with nettles, have also been recommended, and may do service, as well as volatile and stimulating medicines taken inwardly. And it is probably by operating in this manner, that the use of camphor, or a mercurial course continued for some length of time to such a degree as gently to affect the mouth, have been found productive of a cure in obstinate cases of this affection. Of late years, an infusion of the arnica montana or German leopard's bane, has been highly extolled in the cure of this disease, by some foreign writers: but the trials made with it in Britain, particularly at Edinburgh, have been by no means equally successful with those related by Dr Collins, who has strongly recommended this medicine to the attention of the public. Another remedy has of late been highly extolled in palsy, the rhus toxicodendron or poison oak. It has been employed with some success in France by Mr Freinot; and Dr Alderson of Hull, in a late dissertation on this plant, has published several cases, even of very obstinate palsy, in which its use was attended with wonderful success. In some cases also at Edinburgh, it has been used with apparent advantage, but in a much greater number without any benefit.\n\nIn certain cases of palsy, unexpected cures have been accomplished both by electricity and by galvanism. But in a considerable majority of instances, palsy from which the patient has not what may be called a natural recovery, will be found incurable by any remedies which have hitherto been recommended.\n\nSp.

A syncope begins with a remarkable anxiety about the heart; after which follows a sudden extinction, as it were, not only of the animal powers and actions, but also of the vital powers, so that the patients are deprived of pulse, senses, and motion, all at once. In those cases which physicians have distinguished by the name of leipothymia, the patient does not entirely lose his senses, but turns cold and pale; and the pulse continues to beat, though weakly; the heart also seems to tremble rather than beat; and the respiration is just perceptible. But in the true syncope or full asphyxia, not the smallest sign of life can be perceived; the face has a death-like pallor, the extremities are cold, the eyes shut, or at least troubled; the mouth sometimes shut, and sometimes gaping wide open; the limbs flaccid, and the strength quite gone; as soon as they begin to recover, they fetch deep and heavy sighs.\n\nCauses, &c. Fainting is occasioned most commonly by profuse evacuations, especially of blood; but it may happen also from violent passions of the mind, from surfeits, excessive pain, &c. People of delicate constitutions are very subject to it from flight causes; and sometimes it will arise from affections of the heart and large vessels not easy to be understood. Fainting is also a symptom of many disorders, especially of that fatal one called a polypus of the heart, of the plague, and many putrid diseases.\n\nPrognosis. When fainting happens in the beginning of any acute distemper, it is by no means a good omen; but when it takes place in the increase or at the height of the disease, the danger is somewhat less; but in general, when fainting comes on without any evident cause, it is to be dreaded. In violent hemorrhages it is favourable; as the bleeding vessels thus have time to contract and recover themselves, and by this means the patient may escape.\n\nCure. When persons of a full habit faint through excess of passion, they ought to be bled without delay, and should drink vinegar or lemon juice diluted with water; and, after the bowels are emptied by a clyster, take a paregoric draught, and go to bed.\n\nThe passion of anger, in a peculiar manner, affects the biliary secretion, causes an oppression at the stomach, with nausea and retching to vomit, and a bitter taste in the mouth, with giddiness; these symptoms seem to indicate an emetic; which, however, in these cases must be carefully avoided, as it might endanger the patient, by bringing on an inflammation of the stomach.\n\nThe general effects of a sudden fright have been mentioned on a former occasion. When these are so violent as to require medical aid, our first endeavours must be to take off the spasmodic constriction, and restore freedom to the circulation; by bleeding, if the habit be at all inclined to fulness; and by giving a mixture, with equal parts of the vinum antimoniale and tinctura opii camphorata, in some agreeable vehicle, which will bring on sleep and encourage perspiration. It was formerly mentioned, that convulsions, or even an epilepsy, may be brought on by frights; which should make people cautious of playing foolish tricks in this way.\n\nWhen a surfeit, or any species of saburra, occasions a leipothymia, an emetic is the immediate remedy, as soon as the patient, by the help of acid stimulants, shall be so far roused as to be able to swallow one: in these cases, tickling the fauces with a feather dipped in spirit of hartshorn, will be proper, not only to rouse the patient, but also to bring on vomiting.\n\nA syncope is most commonly brought on by profuse discharges or evacuations, either of the blood or of the secreted humours.\n\nIn order to revive the patients, they ought to be laid along in a horizontal posture, in an airy place; the legs, thighs, and arms, are to be rubbed with hot flannel; very strong vinegar, aromatic vinegar, or salt of hartshorn, or volatile alkaline spirit, are to be held to the nostrils, and rubbed into them; or, being properly diluted, poured down the throat; cold water is to be sprinkled on the face and neck; and when by these means the patient shall be sufficiently revived, wine boiled up with some grateful aromatic, is to be given in the proper quantity.\n\nIn the fainting consequent upon profuse uterine hemorrhages, it will be a safer practice to abstain from all heating and stimulant things; as life, in these cases, is preserved by the coagulation of the blood in the extremities of the open vessels; which might be prevented by the pouring in hot wine or volatile alkaline spirits.\n\nWhen a syncope is the consequence of the too violent operation of either an emetic or cathartic, the tinctura thebaica, mixed with spiced wine, is the most efficacious remedy; but the opiate must be given gradually, and in very small doses.\n\nA syncope, or even asphyxia, wherein the patient shall lie for several hours, is frequent in hysterical constitutions; and during the fit requires fetid antispasmodics, together with acid stimulants: to prevent returns, nothing answers better than the cinchona joined with chalybeates.\n\nGENUS XLV.

It is by no means easy to define exactly the distemper called dyspepsia, when considered as an original disease, as there are very few maladies which some way or other do not show themselves by an affection of the stomach; and much more difficult still must it be to enumerate all its symptoms. The most remarkable, however, and the most common, are the following: Want of appetite; diffusion of the stomach when no food has been taken for some time before; flight dejection of spirits; a gradual decay of the muscular strength; languor, and aversion from motion; the food which is taken without appetite is not well digested; the stomach and intestines are much distended with flatus, whence the patients are tormented with spasms, gripes, and sickness; frequently a limpid water, having an acid or putrid taste, is brought up; sometimes the food itself is thrown up by mouthfuls; and sometimes, though rarely, the same is swallowed again, after the manner of ruminating animals. While matters are in this situation, the heart sometimes palpitates, and the breath is quick, and drawn with difficulty; the head aches and is giddy; and sometimes both these symptoms are continual, and very violent, insomuch that the patient is not only tormented with pain, but staggers as if he was drunk. From the too great ascendency or putrefaction of the aliment, a cardialgia or heartburn comes on; and in this situation a spontaneous diarrhoea sometimes carries off the disease; but in other cases there is an obstinate coliciveness, attended with colic-pains. Frequently the pulse is quick, sometimes slow, but always weak; the circulation is so languid, that the blood can scarce reach the extreme vessels, or at least stagnates in them, so that the face becomes livid, swelled, and has an unusual appearance; and at the same time that the circulation and nervous power are in this languid state, the perspiration becomes less copious; the skin becomes dry and corrugated; the natural heat, especially of the extremities, is much diminished; the tongue is white; and an universal laxity takes place, insomuch that the uvula and velum pendulum palati are sometimes enlarged to such a degree as to become extremely troublesome. The patient is either deprived of rest, or wakes suddenly out of his sleep, and is disturbed by frightful dreams; at the same time that the mind seems to be afflicted as well as the body, and he becomes peevish, fretful, and incapable of paying attention to anything as usual. At last hectic symptoms come on, and the whole frame becomes so irritable, that the slightest cause excites an universal tremor, and sometimes violent vomiting and diarrhoea. Sometimes the salivary glands are so relaxed, that a salivation comes on as if excited by mercury; the serum is poured out into the cavity of the abdomen and cellular substance of the whole body, and the patient becomes affected with anaeroma or afecies.\n\nCauses, &c. The causes of dyspepsia may be anything which debilitates the system in general, but in a particular manner affects the stomach. Such are, opium taken in immoderate quantities, which hurts by its sedative and relaxing powers; spirituous liquors drunk to excess; tobacco, tea, coffee, or any warm relaxing liquor, taken in too great quantity; acid, unripe fruits; vomits or purges too frequently taken; an indolent sedentary life, &c., &c. All these act chiefly upon people of a weak and delicate habit; for the robust and hardy seldom labour under a dyspepsia, or at most a very slight one.\n\nPrognosis. When a dyspepsia first occurs, it is frequently removed without great difficulty; when it is symptomatic, we must endeavour to cure the primary disease; and without this we cannot expect a complete removal of the affection; but when it frequently returns, with symptoms of great debility, hectic fever, or dropsy, we have great reason to dread the event.\n\nCure. A radical cure of dyspepsia is only to be expected by removing from the stomach and system that debility on which the disease depends. On this ground, the objects chiefly to be aimed at in the cure are, 1st, The avoiding whatever will tend to diminish the vigour of the stomach; 2d, The employing such remedies as have influence in increasing that vigour; and, in the third place, The obviating urgent symptoms, particularly those which tend to increase and support the affection. Of the avoiding causes, which tend to diminish the vigour of the stomach, after what has already been said of the causes inducing the disease, it is unnecessary to make any farther observations; and indeed every dyspeptic patient will be taught by experience what is to be done with this intention. The medicines chiefly employed with the view of increasing vigour are those of the tonic kind; but, previous to their use, it will be necessary to evacuate the contents of the alimentary canal by vomits or purgatives. If there be a tendency to putrefaction, antiseptics must then be exhibited; but more frequently there is a prevailing acidity, which creates an intolerable heart-burn. To palliate this symptom, magnesia alba may be given; which is much preferable to the common terebinthine powders, as being purgative while dissolved in an acid, when the others are rather astringent. In the third volume of the Medical Observations, we have an account of two cases of dyspepsia attended with a very uncommon degree of cardialgia, in which magnesia was so successful, that we can hardly doubt of its efficacy in slighter degrees of the disorder.\nBut although acidity may often be successfully obviated in this manner, yet the best way of counteracting this symptom, as well as of obviating coliciveness, flatulence, and a variety of others, is by retarding the tone of the stomach in particular, and indeed of the system in general. With this intention, recourse is had to a variety of tonics both from the mineral and vegetable kingdom; particularly chalybeates in different forms, gentian, colombo, and the like; but of all the tonics which can be employed in this affection, none are attended with greater benefit than exercise and cold bathing; and the proper and prudent employment of these is no less effectual in removing the disease, than in preventing the return of it after it is once removed.\n\nGENUS XLVI. HYPOCHONDRIASIS.\n\nHYPOCHONDRIAC Affection.\n\nHypochondriasis, Sauv. gen. 220. Lin. 76. Vog. 218. Sag. 332.\nMorbus hypochondriacus, Boerh. 1098.\nMalum hypochondriacum, Hoffm. III. 65. Junck. 36.\n\nAlthough some of the nomenclatural writers, particularly Sauvages, have considered this genus as consisting of different species, Dr Cullen is of opinion, that there is only one idiopathic species, the hypochondriasis melancholica. He considers not only the hypochondriasis hysterica, phthisica, and asthmatica, but also the biliosa, fanguinea, and pituitosa, as being only symptomatic; but he views the true melancholic hypochondriasis as being a proper idiopathic disease, perfectly distinct from hysteria, with which it has often been confounded.\n\nDescription. The symptoms of hypochondriasis are, stretching, prefling, griping, and tormenting pains, under the ribs, and chiefly in the left side; which sometimes are exasperated, and become pungent, burning, or lancinating. Frequently there is an inflation of the left hypochondrium, which sometimes becomes stationary, and by Hippocrates was taken for a symptom of an enlarged spleen. When these symptoms take place in the right hypochondrium, they are commonly attended with colic pains, uncertain flying heats, especially in the head, with a transient redness of the face, and very frequently an oedematous swelling of the feet succeeds. To these are superadded almost all the affections of the stomach occurring in dyspepsia, besides a variety of other symptoms, such as palpitations, sleepless nights, and the like. But besides these, there occurs also a particular depression of spirit and apprehension of danger, which may be considered as one of the great characterizing symptoms of the disease.\n\nCauses, &c. The general causes of the hypochondriac affection are said to be a plethora, and supernatural thickness of the blood; suppressions of customary evacuations; high and full diet, together with a sparing quantity of drink; an hereditary disposition; indolence; atony of the intestines; violent passions of the mind, &c.\n\nPrognosis. The hypochondriac affection, when left to itself, is more troublesome than dangerous; but, if improperly treated, it may bring on various diseases of a more fatal tendency, such as the melancholy, bloody urine and nephritis, jaundice, vertigo, palsy, apoplexy, &c.\n\nCure. This is to be attempted by such medicines as counteract occasional causes, and obviate urgent symptoms, which may be all comprehended under bleeding, gentle evacuants, chalybeates, the cinchona, and exercise, especially riding on horseback, which in this disease is greatly preferable to any other. When the circumstances of the patient can afford it, a voyage to Spain, Portugal, or some of the warmer countries in Europe, will be of great service.\n\nGENUS XLVII. CHLOROSIS.\n\nGREEN SICKNESS.\n\nChlorosis, Sauv. gen. 309. Lin. 222. Vog. 305.\nSag. gen. 135. Boerh. 1285. Hoffm. iii. 311.\nJunck. 86.\n\nOf this genus also Dr Cullen thinks there is but one idiopathic species: viz. what some distinguish by the title of chlorosis virginea, others of chlorosis amatoria.\n\nDescription. This disease usually attacks girls a little after the time of puberty, and first shows itself by symptoms of dyspepsia. But a distinguishing symptom is, that the appetite is entirely vitiated, and the patient will eat lime, chalk, ashes, salt, &c. very greedily; while at the same time there is not only a total inappetence to proper food, but it will even excite nausea and vomiting. In the beginning of the disease, the urine is pale, and afterwards turbid; the face becomes pale, and then assumes a greenish colour; sometimes it becomes livid or yellow; the eyes are sunk, and have a livid circle round them; the lips lose their fine red colour; the pulse is quick, weak, and low, though the heat is little short of a fever, but the veins are scarcely filled; the feet are frequently cold, swell at night, and the whole body seems covered with a soft swelling; the breathing is difficult; nor is the mind free from affection more than the body; it becomes irritated by the slightest causes; and sometimes the patients love solitude, become sad and thoughtful. There is a retention of the menses throughout the whole course of the disorder; and at last all the bad symptoms increasing, a leucoplegmasia, anaearca, atrophy, and death, succeed.\n\nCauses. The cause of chlorosis is thought to be an atony of the muscular fibres of the alimentary canal, especially of the stomach, joined with a similar atony of the perspiratory vessels over the whole surface of the body, and the whole depending on an atony of those small arteries which pour out the menstrual blood. This atony may be occasioned by the same causes which bring on dyspepsia and hypochondriasis, but very frequently arises from love and other passions of the mind.\n\nPrognosis. The chlorosis in all cases is tedious, though it does not generally prove fatal; but we can never promise a certain cure unless the menses make their appearance.\n\nCure. The remedies here in general are the same as in the dyspepsia and hypochondriasis; only in the chlorosis stronger purgatives may be made use of; those which stimulate the rectum are useful by stimulating...\nlating also the vessels of the uterus; and for this reason indulgence in venery has sometimes been said to produce a cure, particularly with love-sick maids. The cold bath is also extremely proper.\n\n**ORDER III. SPASMI.**\n\nSPASMI, Sauv. Clas IV. Vog. Clas V. Sag. Clas VIII.\nMotorii, Lin. Clas VII.\nMorbi spasmodici et convulsiivi, Hoffm.

Lin. 128. Vog. 183.\nSag. gen. 229.\nOpifhotonos, Vog. 181.\nEpilhotonos, Vog. 182.\n\nOn this distemper Dr Lionel Chalmers has published a dissertation in the first volume of the Medical Observations, which being superior to any thing that has appeared in other medical writers on the subject, we shall here lay before the reader.\n\n\"Of all the diseases to which man is subject, none deserves more to be considered than the opifhotonos and tetanus, either with regard to the variety of painful symptoms which almost without intermission afflict the sick, or the danger of the diseases themselves, from which few recover, in comparison of the number they attack. In both, the vital actions are very imperfectly performed, most of those which are called natural being as it were suspended at once; and so far is the patient from being able to execute any voluntary motion, that the whole machine undergoes the most excruciating distortions, from the violent and unnatural contractions of the muscles. Happy it is for the inhabitants of the more temperate climates, that such diseases appear rarely among them; but in those countries which lie in the more southern and warmer latitudes, they are endemic, especially to negro slaves. In South Carolina, they show themselves at all seasons, but not so often in winter, more frequently in spring and autumn; and are most common in the summer, when people work abroad and are alternately exposed to the scorching heat of the sun and heavy showers, which often happen suddenly, and greatly alter the temperature of the air. Others are seized with the opifhotonos after sleeping without doors, that they may enjoy the deceitful refreshment of the cool night-air, when the weather is warm: one youth chose to cut off his hair and shave his head on a warm day in March, and went to bed without a cap; but the weather changed, and became cold in the night, and he was found rigid with tetanus next morning.\n\n\"These diseases so rarely appear as originals in Europe, that a good history of them cannot be expected from the physicians who practise in that part of the world; nor has anything like a full description been given of them by any ancient or modern author which I have seen. Hippocrates indeed takes notice of them in many places, and seems to regard them only as consequences of other diseases, or of wounds or ulcers of the nervous or tendinous parts; of which symptomatic kind of opifhotonos he gives three remarkable cases in lib. v. § vii. de Morb. vulg., and repeats them in another place: but the few symptoms he recounts do not show themselves with us. Galen, Caelius Aurelianus, Aretaeus, &c. seem only to have copied Hippocrates, with the addition of some supposititious symptoms, which really do not appear; and the little that Bontius says of it is very faulty.\n\n\"Among the numerous clas of spasmodic diseases, there are three which distinguish themselves in a very particular manner, on which the names of emprophotonos, opifhotonos, and tetanus, have been justly enough bestowed, as being expressive of the posture into which they throw and confine the patient. When therefore those muscles which bend the head, neck, and body forwards, suffer such involuntary, violent, and continued contractions, as to fix the chin to the breast, incurvate the spine and body, and retain the sick in this painful and prone posture, the disease is called emprophotonos. When the posterior muscles are similarly affected, so that the head is drawn towards the spine, and the spine itself is recurvated, it has then the name of opifhotonos; although in fact, in this, all those muscles which act in deglutition, bend the head forwards, or turn it to either side, are equally contracted with those which raise the head and spine. The tetanus differs from, or rather is compounded of, both the others; for in this the patient is found rigid and inflexible, being as it were braced between the opposite contractions of the anterior and posterior muscles; yet even here the head is much retracted.\n\n\"I never saw the emprophotonos; and shall only speak of the opifhotonos and tetanus, the first being by far the most common, and in the last stage of which the tetanus frequently supervenes. Let it be observed, that the following description by no means respects such symptomatic contractions as often happen immediately before death, both in acute and chronic diseases; neither will it agree with that spurious opifhotonos or tetanus which appear sometimes in the first and second stages of quotidian intermittents in this country, however they may emulate the true diseases in some of their symptoms.\n\n\"STAD. I. The opifhotonos, contrary to what Bontius affirms, often comes on gradually and by flight approaches, the patient complaining rather of an uneasy stiffness in the back-part of the neck and about the shoulders, than of any acute pain, with some degree of a general latitude. These increase, and become so troublesome when he attempts to turn his head, or to bend it forward, as to oblige him to walk very erect; for he can by no means look downward, nor to either side, without turning his whole body. He cannot open his jaws without pain; and has some difficulty in swallowing, which discourages him from attempting to eat. At times he feels a sudden and painful traction under the cartilago ensiformis, which strikes through to the back, and instantly increases the rigidity about the neck and shoulders, draws the head backward a little, and shuts the jaws closer. The pain under the sternum returns more frequently and with greater violence;\"\nPractice.\n\nSpasms. lence; and the other contractions become so strong, that the head from this time continues much retracted, and he now refuses nourishment, as swallowing is attended with great pain, and occasions a return of the spasm; which extends along the spine quite to the lower extremities, so that they will no longer support him, and he is under the necessity of going to bed.\n\n\"In this manner passes over the first stage of the opilhotos, which sometimes takes up three or four days; the patient, as well as those about him, mistaking the first appearances of it for that rheumatic complaint, which is commonly called a crick in the neck; but it sometimes forms itself much quicker, and invades the unfortunate person with the whole train of its mischiefous symptoms in a few hours: in which case, the danger may truly be eliminated from the violence of the first attack; for such generally die in 24, 36, or 48 hours, and very rarely survive the third day. But when it is less acute, few are lost after the ninth or eleventh; which number of days it would not be possible for them to complete, unless the violence of the disease was in a good measure subdued; although I had one who recovered, after having been subject to its tyrannical attacks daily for six weeks. In this stage the pulse is slow, and very hard, and the belly is bound; blood taken away seems not to be altered from the natural state, so that no indication can be deduced therefrom, and it only varies with regard to laxity or compaction, according to the age of the person and season of the year.\n\n\"Stage II. The spasm under the sternum (which is the pathognomonic symptom of this disease) becomes more violent, returning every 10 or 15 minutes; and never fails to be instantly succeeded by a stronger retraction of the head, with great rigidity and pain all round the neck, and along the spine to the lower extremities, which are suddenly put to the stretch. The countenance is very pale and contracted; the jaws are at that moment snapped together, and cannot afterwards be opened so wide as to receive the end of one's little finger; an attempt to do which, by way of experiment, almost constantly hurries on the spasm. The mastoid, coraco-hyoid and sternohyoid muscles, as well as all the others concerned in deglutition, and the deltoid and pectorals, are most violently contracted, so that the shoulders are strongly raised forward, and the arms are stretched out or drawn across the body; but the wrists and fingers seem not to be affected.\n\n\"Such is the condition of the patient in the time of the spasm, which ceases in a few seconds: after which the shoulders and arms recline, and the inferior extremities relax; yet not so entirely, but that such a degree of rigidity for the most part remains as will not permit them to bend when this is attempted by another person; for as to the sick himself, he cannot at all move them. The muscles on the sides and forepart of the neck continue still contracted, although not so strongly; but their action is overcome by the number and strength of the posterior ones; so that the retraction of the head constantly remains. The patient breathes quick for some minutes, as if he had been excessively exercised; and the pulse is small, fluttering, and irregular, but both become more calm and slow. The face is sometimes pale in the intervals, but oftener flushed; and the whole countenance expresses strong appearances of the most melancholy distress, as well Tetanus, because of the dread he has of a return of the spasm, which he is sure will soon happen, as from the pain he suffers by the present contractions, and the more general and severe ones which he has lately sustained. The tongue is stiff and torpid; but so far as it can be seen, is not foul. The belly is always bound, and cannot easily be loosed. In drinking, the liquid passes with great difficulty to the stomach, even in the smallest quantity; and if the spasm should seize him at that time, which an attempt to swallow for the most part occasions, the liquor returns through the nose with force. The patients desire to lie still as much as possible; and avoid drinking, speaking, or being moved, either of which are apt to occasion a return of the spasm.\n\n\"Stage III. In this last stage, the patient is reduced to the most calamitous and distressful circumstances: for he is on a continual rack, according to the most literal meaning of that word; the spasm returning oftener than once in a minute, is much more violent, and holds him longer, so that he has scarcely any remission. The anterior muscles of the whole body now suffer equal contractions with the posterior; but the last overcome the force of the others, so that the spine is strongly recurvated, and forms a hollow arch with the bed, and he rests on the back part of the head and the heels. The belly is flat, and is drawn inward; and the muscles are so rigidly contracted, that they will not give way to pressure, and do not seem in the least to yield to the descent of the diaphragm in inspiration; the several muscles about the neck, sides, and abdomen, being plainly distinguishable from each other. Although the lower extremities are always rigid in this state, yet are they so suddenly and violently deflected in the time of the spasms, that were it not for the standers by, the patient would be projected feet foremost off the bed; while others again are as it were pushed upward with such a spring, that the head is struck with great force against whatever happens to be in the way, the thighs and legs being in this case no less rigid than the other parts. The tongue is spasmodically darted out, and is often miserably torn, as the teeth are that moment snapped together; so that it is necessary to prevent this by keeping the handle of a spoon, wrapped round with soft rags, between the teeth, when this can be done. At the time that the tongue is thus thrust out, the muscular flesh, which lies between the arch of the lower jaw and head of the trachea, seems to be drawn upwards within the throat. The countenance is very much contracted, and he is in a foam of sweat, the heat being very great; and the pulse between the spasms is exceedingly quick, small, and irregular, although the heart throbs so strongly, that its motions may be plainly seen, and a palpitating fulsibitory kind of undulation may not only be felt, but perceived all over the epigastric region. The eyes are watery and languid, and a pale or bloody froth bubbles out from between the lips. The jaws are for the most part locked fast, so that it is impossible to give drink or nourishment, nor could he swallow anything that was put into his mouth. In this state patients are commonly delirious: and as they cannot submit many hours under so great a fulsibition of the vital and natural functions, a mortal anxiety ensues and relieves.\"\nreleases them; oftener a continued and severe spasm finalizes the tragedy, when it was before almost at an end: but most frequently a general convulsion puts a period to their sufferings; and whichever way this happens, they for the most part relax just before death.\n\n\"In the tetanus, the general symptoms are nearly the same as in the opiphotonos, except that from the first attack, the lateral, abdominal, and other anterior muscles, are equally contracted with the posterior ones; and the arms become rigid as well as the lower extremities. The abdomen is always flat and rigid as in the last stage of the opiphotonos, and its contents seem to be thrust up into the thorax, which at the same time appears to be much dilated. There are here also some intervals between the spasms, in the time of which the cheeks are drawn towards the ears, so that all the teeth may be seen as in the spasmodus cynicus. Deglutition is more free in this than in the other disease; yet so far is the sick from being equally balanced between the contractions of the opposite muscles, that the head is retracted and the spine is recurvated, although not quite so much as in the opiphotonos. And the spasm, which commences under the sternum, is likewise common to the tetanus, which terminates as the other, and on the same fatal days. But whoever recovers from either, labours long under a general atonia; and they cannot for some months raise themselves from a supine or recumbent posture without pain, nor without help for some time.\"\n\nPrognosis and Cure. There has never been anything like a crisis observed in these frightful cases, or favourable termination from the mere efforts of nature; and therefore all the physician's dependence must be upon art. As in cases of tetanic affections, the disease often arises from some particular irritation, the removal of this must necessarily be an important object in the cure: But where it cannot be removed, benefit may often be obtained by the prevention of its influence being communicated to the brain. When, however, that influence is communicated to the brain, a cure is to be expected only by diminishing and obviating it. This is principally brought about by the use either of those means which have a general tendency to diminish action, or of those which induce a different state of action. On these grounds the operation of those remedies which are employed with greatest success in this affection, may, we apprehend, be explained. Fortunately it has been found, that opium is capable of giving some relief, if administered in proper time, and if the disease happens not to be in the most violent degree; the warm bath must also be brought in aid; and the patients should lie horizontally in the bath, and while in it have the whole body extremely well rubbed: when taken out, they are not to be dried, but immediately put to bed wrapped in the softest blankets; and while they remain there, the belly ought either to be stuffed, or two or three bladders filled with warm water kept constantly lying on it. The bowels at the same time must, if possible, be kept open, by solutions of manna and sal polyphren, or some other purging salt, mixed with oleum ricini; or if that should not be at hand, with oil of sweet almonds and a little tincture of senna. The opiates are to be given in large and frequently repeated doses; such as a grain of the extraction thebaicum, or 20 drops of the tincture, every second or third hour; and it will be safest not to Tetanus. trust to the thebaic tincture which is kept ready prepared in the shops, but to order the necessary dose of solid opium, and either give it in pills or dissolve it in some convenient liquid. If swallowing should be difficult, or the jaws closed up, the opium must be given in clysters; for during the whole course of the disease it will be of service to order emollient clysters to be injected from time to time, since these will answer not only as a relaxing fomentation, but also contribute to keep the intestinal canal perfectly free.\n\nWhen the patients recover, they continue for a long time very relaxed and weak: and no wonder, since it is the nature of all spasmodic affections to leave behind them extreme weakness and relaxation of the muscular fibres. In order to perfect the recovery, a course of the cinchona and the Peruvian balsam is to be tried; and the spine may be rubbed with spirituous liniments, or with a mixture of rum and Barbadoes tar: but these and all other stimulating things, either internally or externally, during the violence of the spasms, must, in the opinion of some practitioners, be omitted, since all of them as well as blisters have been alleged to exacerbate the disease.\n\nThis, in general, is the plan of treatment recommended by Dr Chalmers.\n\nThe same dreadful disorders frequently attack young children in the warm climates. Dr Hillary tells us, that they will there arise from the same causes which usually produce convulsions with children in Britain, viz. from a retention of the meconium or first excrement after birth; or from a glutinous matter which is too often found in the intestines of young children soon after the other is discharged; or from a cheesy matter from the coagulation of the milk by an acid in the stomach; or from hard excretions; or from something taken in by the mouth which is over acid, or too hard to digest, which irritates their tender bowels, and produces startings and convulsive spasms, with all the other symptoms which precede and accompany convulsions in young children in Britain. And this shows how much more readily and easily the nerves are affected and irritated in that warm climate, and the tetanus produced from a much less cause there, than it is in Britain, where it is but seldom seen. But these causes not being timely removed, their acrimony is increased, partly by the heat of the climate, and partly by the fever which they produce, which still renders them more acid, and to increase the irritation of their bowels, that it first brings on startings; then convulsive spasms, and regular convulsion fits; which, if not soon removed, usually end in a perfect tetanus, and the disease is but seldom cured in such young children when it arrives at that state: for when the child lies in this miserable, rigid, immovable condition, upon moving its hands or feet in the most gentle manner, or softly touching any part of its body, or giving it the least motion, even feeling its pulse in the most tender manner, or the least noise, or even touching its clothes, will bring on the convulsive spasms, and cause it to be strongly convulsed backwards, or drawn into a rigid straight line, strongly extended and immovable like a statue, and will so remain immovable out of either of those postures for a considerable time, a minute or two; and when the disease is arrived at this degree, Dr Hillary thinks\nPractise.\n\nMEDICINE.\n\nSpasms thinks it is never cured. But if the physician be called in time, before the tetanus has come on (which is too seldom the case there), though he finds strong convulsive spasms have seized the child, or that it has had a convulsive fit or two, it may most commonly be relieved, the coming of the tetanus be prevented, and the life of the babe saved, as Dr Hillary has more than once seen, by removing and carrying off the irritating cause which stimulates their tender bowels, by such gentle evacuations as are suitable to their age; and then quieting and composing the irritation of their nerves by proper antipyretics, and correcting the remaining acrimony of the nutritious juices in the prime of life.\n\nTo answer these intentions, the following method, with variations pro re nata et pro ratione etatis, as the cause is different, has been found to answer the desired effect the best: R. Seri lactis 3ij. Sipon. Venet. 3j. Mannz Calab. 3ij. vel iij. Ol. amygd. dul. 3ls. Ol. feniculi dul. gul. ij. Balf. Peruvi. gut. v. Mifce. Fi enema quam primum injiciendum.\n\nAnd if the symptoms of the approaching tetanus will permit, he gives something of the following nature to assist the operation of the clyster, and to carry off the acrimony the sooner: R. Ag. fem. feniculi 3ij. Magnes. albus 3ls. Ocul. cancer. prep. 3j. Syr. e eichor. cum rheo. Rofar. foliat. ana 3ij. Mifce. Or. R. Ag. fem. feniculi 3ij. Sapon. amygdal. 3ls. Magnes. albus 3ls.

Mifce: Exhibe cochl. parvo. vel duo pro ratione etatis, omni semihora, vel omni hora, donec responda. alvus.\n\nTwo or three stools being obtained by these, the following is exhibited in order to abate the convulsive twitchings, and prevent the tetanus from coming on: R. Ag. fem. feniculi 3ij. Magnes. albus 3ls. Ocul. cancer. prep. 3j. Moschi orient. gr. ij. Spir. C. C. gut. xv. Syr. e mecon. 3ls. Mifce: Exhibe cochl. parvo. (a child's spoonful) ter quaterve de die, vel si pusius, urgent, convuls. vel spasms.\n\nBut if the symptoms show that the tetanus is more immediately coming on, so that we have no time to wait till the operation of the clyster and opening laxative be over, something of the following nature must be immediately given; or the tetanus will come on, and most probably prove fatal to such tender babies.

For neither the same method nor the same medicines will answer in all cases, though the disease be the same; but they must be changed as the causes differ, or the constitution of the sick, or the time of the disease, or as some other circumstances may require; which is a thing of great importance, not only in this, but in the cure of most other diseases.\n\nWhen proper medicines are thus timely and judiciously given in this case, they seldom fail to carry off the irritating cause, quiet and ease the nerves, remove the convulsions and spasms; and consequently prevent the tetanus from coming on, and the death of the patient. But if calling in the physician be deferred till the tetanus has already strongly seized the child, as is too often the case here, neither warm bathing, fomenting, nor any other methods or medicines whatever, will remove it or its causes, nor save the life of the little tender patient.\n\nDr Chalmers gives an account of his having cured one child feigned with a tetanus, by purging with an infusion of rhubarb; to which a few grains of musk, and a little ol. tartar. per deliq. were added, together with the warm bath, and the frequent injection of clysters made with an infusion of chamomile flowers, to each of which was added a small portion of Castile soap. It is much to be regretted, however, that in those cases where the affluence of the medical art is most wanted, it most generally fails. We have been assured by a gentleman who practised for some time in the warm parts of America, that out of 30 cases of the tetanus he had seen, not one of the patients recovered, though he had given opium to the quantity of 20 grains thrice a-day; and others, he was assured, had taken 30 grains thrice a-day. In the beginning of the disease, the medicine produced a violent headache; but towards the end, it had no manner of effect whatever. In two patients, the disease came on from the slightest causes imaginable. The one accidentally fell in attempting to avoid a loaded cart, and put the heel of his shoe upon one of his thumbs in rising; the other, in avoiding the same cart, slightly ruffled the skin of his nose. Both were feigned with the tetanus; and both died, notwithstanding all possible assistance was given. The former had his thumb amputated without effect.\n\nIn the Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays, vol. iii. Dr Donald Monro describes a new method of cure, communicated to him by a gentleman who was formerly a practitioner in Jamaica. While this gentleman practised in that island, he had under his care a great number of cases of tetanus attended with the locked jaw. At first, he used to give very freely of opium, musk, and other medicines of this class; to bleed, and make other evacuations; while he used baths, fomentations, embrocations, and other external applications, but all without the least success; and, as he had lost a great many patients without being so lucky as to make one cure, he began to believe that this disorder always proved fatal, and was not to be cured by medicine, notwithstanding what some practitioners\ntitioners had alleged. However, having received an unexpected hint concerning the good effects of the mercurial ointment in such cases, he resolved to try it; and ordered the first patient that offered to be put into a warm room, and to be rubbed two or three times a day with the ointment, till such time as a salivation was raised; when he, with pleasure observed, that, as soon as the mercury began to affect the mouth, the convulsions of the muscles of the jaws, as well as all the other spasms and convulsions, ceased, and the patient was freed of all his complaints. After this, he treated every case of this kind which came under his care in the same manner, and cured twelve, which were all who applied to him for advice so early in the disorder that there was time to bring the mercury to the mouth before the fatal period was expected. A few died, in whom the disease was so far advanced before he saw them that there was no time to raise a salivation. None of the cases which were under this gentleman's care in the West Indies were the consequences of wounds or capital operations; nor has he had any opportunity of trying it since in cases of the locked jaw, which sometimes follows capital operations, owing to his having given over practice; but he thinks, that from the similarity of the complaint, there is no doubt that the mercurial frictions would be equally efficacious in such cases, as when the disorder comes from catching cold or other such causes.\n\nIn the second volume of the Medical Transactions, we have an account of a cure performed by Dr William Carter of Canterbury, by means very different from any of those above related.—On the 17th of May 1767, the doctor was called to a strong, healthy man, in the 21st year of his age, and who had been confined to his bed for three weeks. What gave rise to his present disorder was an wound on the inner ankle of his right leg, which he had received five weeks before from a joiner's chisel. At that time his mouth was so far closed, as to admit only the most liquid nourishment, which he constantly sucked through his teeth: but his legs and jaw, and the whole length of the spine dorfi, were quite immovable, being as stiff and rigid as those of a person long dead; his head was drawn backward, and he was frequently strongly convulsed. The motion indeed of both his arms was but a little impaired. From the beginning to the end, his sight, hearing, and memory, continued perfect; his appetite was good; and his senses, in the daytime, entire, though sometimes wandering in the night. As to his pulse, it was regular; if it deviated at all from the pulse of a person in health, it was rather slow than quick, and somewhat fuller than natural. Such was the situation of his patient; a detail of which had been given before the doctor set out on his journey, which he undertook with a determined resolution to make use of the method recommended by Dr Silvester, in the first volume of Medical Observations and Inquiries, published in the year 1757, (and which has been related from Dr Chalmers and Dr Hillary.) But, on his arrival at the house, he found great quantities of the extractum thebaicum dissolved had been already given him; and that, for the five last days, he had taken no less than 28 grains of that medicine, with 50 grains of milk, in the space of 24 hours, without any sensible effect, except the bringing on a confused sleep, out of which he frequently awoke in great hurries, attended with a violent pain in the head, which almost deprived him of his senses. The doctor was afraid to extend the dose; and soon determined to take some other method, though at a loss what method to pursue, as, during a course of almost 30 years practice, nothing of the same kind had ever fallen under his cognizance before. Reflecting, however, that this disorder had always been deemed of the spasmodic kind, and that the good effects produced by the extractum thebaicum must probably be owing to the relaxing and resolving faculty of that medicine, he directed a blister to be applied between the shoulders, the whole length of the spine; the jaw to be anointed with the oleum latertium; and a purge, consisting of the tinctura facra, tinctura jalapae, and the syrupus de rhanno cathartic, to be given him. This was repeated three several times afterwards, at the distance of three or four days between each dose. On the intermediate days, he was ordered the oleum fuscini, the fetid gum, and the oleum amygdalimum. Of the first he took 30 drops, of the gum 20 grains, and of the last four ounces, in 24 hours. By these means, and these only, the convulsions soon ceased; and he grew daily better and better, till at the end of a fortnight he was able to walk about his room, and in less than three weeks became in all respects well, some small weaknesses in the parts only excepted. The jaw was relieved first, after that the spine, and last of all the legs. A pain and uneasiness in the places affected, neither of which he had felt before, were the forerunners of his approaching amendment.\n\nFor all this it seems reasonable to conclude, either that there is no certain remedy for tetanus in all cases, or that the medicines which prove effectual in one constitution will fail in another. Thus, it is possible, that in cases where opium proves ineffectual, mercury may be a remedy; and, on the contrary, where mercury fails, opium may be effectual; and even where both are ineffectual, the antispasmodics recommended by Dr Carter may be of use. It is therefore necessary for physicians to be extremely careful to observe the effects of the first doses of their remedies: for if the symptoms show not the least appearance of remission after a large dose of opium, it is improbable that it can be cured by a repetition of the medicine; and as no time can be lost with safety, it will then be proper to apply mercurial ointment, or whatever else may be judged proper.—In the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries we have an account of the cold bath being used as a remedy, by Dr Thomas Cochrane, at that time physician at Nevis. The patient was an East Indian boy, who had been gored by a cow, and afterwards exposed to a rainy damp air for some hours. Dr Cochrane attributes his cure to the cold bath, which was applied by dashing the water upon his body. But as the patient at the same time got laudanum, at first in the quantity of 200 drops a-day, and afterwards in still larger doses; and had besides his throat and shoulders anointed with warm oil of turpentine, was bled, and had lenient clysters and laxatives; it is by no means easy to say what share the cold bath had in his cure. Dr Cochrane, however, says he has heard of some cases being treated successfully by cold water and cinchona.\nSpasm. cinchona in St Eustatia and St Kitt's, and in another letter mentions his having used the cold bath in other cases of tetanus with success. But since Dr Cochrane's publication, a more full and satisfactory account of the benefit of this practice has been communicated in a paper published by Dr Wright, in the fifth volume of the London Medical Observations. Dr Wright gives a particular account of five cases, in which the best effects were obtained from dashing cold water upon the patient; and he observes, that since he first used this method of cure he never failed in one instance to effect a recovery, and that in a shorter time than by any other method hitherto proposed. This practice has on some occasions been adopted by practitioners in Britain, although here the disease is a much less frequent occurrence. It has particularly been employed with success by Dr Currie of Liverpool; and we hope that still more extensive practice will confirm the benefit to be derived from it, although not in every instance, yet in many cases of this affection. We are, however, sorry to say that we have of late heard of several cases in which it has been tried in Britain, and which, notwithstanding the use of it, had a fatal termination.\n\nVery lately a different mode of cure in this affection has been recommended by Dr Ruth, professor of medicine in Philadelphia, in a paper entitled Observations on the Cause and Cure of Tetanus, published in the second volume of the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society. Dr Ruth, viewing tetanus as being a disease occasioned by relaxation, thinks the medicines indicated to cure it are such only as are calculated to remove this relaxation, and to restore tone to the system. On this ground he recommends the liberal use of wine and cinchona; and tells us, that he has employed them with success in actual practice. When the disease arises from an wound of any particular place, he recommends stimulants to the part affected; such as dilatation of the wound, and filling it with oil of turpentine. How far this practice will be confirmed by more extensive experience, we cannot take upon us to determine. We may only observe, that a very contrary practice has been recommended as highly successful by some practitioners in Spain, where tetanic affections are a very frequent occurrence in consequence of slight accidents. There gentle emollients are strongly recommended, particularly immersing the wounded part in tepid oil for the space of an hour or so at a time, and repeating this application at short intervals. By this mode many cases, after very alarming appearances had taken place, are said to have been completely and speedily removed. While the practice is very simple, it appears at the same time in many respects very rational, and may perhaps be considered as well deserving a trial in the first instance.\n\nAmong other remedies employed in tetanus it has been said that the spasms have sometimes been allayed by a strong electric shock. And in obstinate cases electricity or galvanism certainly well deserve a trial.\n\nGENUS XLIX. TRISMUS.\n\nThe Locked Jaw.\n\nTrismus, Sauv. gen. 117, Lin. 124. Sag. gen. 223.

When convulsions attack only particular parts of the body, they are generally attended with some kind of paralysis at the same time, by which means the affected parts are alternately convulsed and relaxed; a permanent convulsion, or unnatural contraction of particular muscles, is called a spasms or cramp. These partial convulsions may attack almost any part of the body; and are not unfrequently symptomatic, in fevers, the cholera morbus, &c. The involuntary flutters of the tendons, the picking of the bedclothes, &c., in acute diseases, are all of them convulsive disorders. Convulsions, even when most generally extended, differ from epilepsy in not being attended with any mental affection or abolition of sense, and not followed by the same torpid state.\n\nCauses. Convulsions, not only of particular parts, but also over the whole body, often take place from causes not very evident. Sometimes they seem to depend\npend on a certain delicacy or irritability of the nervous system, which is framed with such exquisite sensibility as to be strongly affected by the slightest causes. Delicate women are often subject to hysterical convulsions, and also hypochondriac people. Convulsions, however, often take their rise from wounds, irritations of the stomach and intestines by worms, poisons, violent cathartics and emetics, &c.; and very often they are symptomatic, as in dentition, the smallpox, and many kinds of fevers.\n\nPrognosis. Except in some few cases, convulsive disorders are always to be dreaded; but less in young people than in such as are advanced in life. Those which attack girls under the age of puberty, will generally cease on the appearance of the menes; and boys have likewise a chance of being relieved as they advance in life; but in grown-up people, unless the cause be very evident, a cure is hardly to be expected, especially after the disease has been of long continuance.\n\nCure. The treatment is very much the same with that of epilepsy, afterwards to be considered; but a recovery is most frequently obtained by the removal of the existing cause.\n\nGENUS LI. CHOREA.\n\nSt Vitus's Dance.\n\nScelotyrbe, Sauv. gen. 136. Sag. 243.\nChorea, Lin. 139.\nScelotyrbe chorea Viti, Sauv. sp. 1.\nChorea St Viti, Sydenh. Sched. Monit.\n\nDescription. This disease shows itself first by a kind or lameness or instability of one of the legs, which the patients draw after them in a ridiculous manner; nor can they hold the arm of the same side still for a moment; for if they lay it on their breast, or any other part of their body, it is immediately forced away by a convulsive motion. If they be desirous of drinking, they use a number of odd gesticulations before they can bring the cup to their mouths, because their arms are drawn this way and that by the convulsions which affect them.\n\nCauses, &c. The general cause of St Vitus's dance is a debility of the system; and hence, we find it attacks only weakly boys, and more especially girls, when under the age of puberty. But the particular causes determining the muscles to be affected in such and such a manner are entirely unknown.\n\nPrognosis. As this disorder scarce ever attacks any persons but such as are under the age of puberty, there is almost a certain prospect of its being then cured, though generally the disorder is easily removed before that time.\n\nChorea, however, in some instances, proves an obstinate affection; but is hardly in any instance attended with danger.\n\nCure. It has hitherto been almost universally the common practice to treat this disease with antispasmodics and tonics, particularly opium, hyoscyamus, valerian, cinchona, preparations of iron, zinc, and copper, and cold bathing; and under the use of these the disease has, in general, been removed. But Dr James Hamilton, senior physician to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, in a treatise which he has lately published on the use of purgative medicines, has recommended a very different practice in this disease, the use, viz. of brisk cathartics; these he advises to be repeated daily for some time. The great object, however, which he has in view, is not to evacuate from the system, but to produce a thorough and complete evacuation of the intestinal canal. He finds, that by the first doses, large quantities of black-colored matter are discharged; and he recommends that the use of the purgatives should be persisted in till the stools assume a natural appearance. In confirmation of the utility of this practice, he has related several cases in which it produced a speedy and complete cure; and equal success has attended this practice when directed by several others. There can therefore be no hesitation in recommending it at least in every obdurate instance of chorea.\n\nGENUS LII. RAPHANIA.\n\nRaphania, Lin. 155. Vog. 143. Lin. Amoen.

According to Sauvages, this distemper begins with a laxitude of the limbs, transient colds and shiverings, pain of the head, and anxieties of the precordia. Then come on palpable throbings of the fingers and feet; also of the tendons and muscles, conspicuous below the skin. The disease is attended with heat, fever, delirium, stupor, constriction of the breast, suffocating dyspnea, loss of voice, horrid convulsions of the limbs, preceded by a formication, or sensation as of ants or other small insects creeping on the parts. In this state of the disease, the convulsive paroxysms are attended with most violent pains in the limbs, vomiting, or diarrhoea, with the passing of worms, thirst, and in young people an unnatural hunger. It continues from ten days to three months. About the eleventh or twentieth day, some are relieved by copious sweats, or purple exanthema; while others fall into a tabes, with stupor, or stiffness of the joints.\n\nCauses, &c. This disease is frequently epidemic in Swabia and other parts of Germany; where it is said to be produced by seeds of radishes, which are often mixed with rye in that country; and from this supposed cause the disease takes its name. It is also, however, a very common opinion, that this disease depends on the rye used in diet being of a bad quality, and particularly containing a large proportion of what is called spurred rye.\n\nCure. In this affection, the cure, as far as it has yet been discovered, is very much the same with that of epilepsy, the disease next to be considered. But from what has been laid of the advantages derived from the use of purgatives in chorea, analogy would lead us to make a trial of them also in cases of raphania.\nGENUS LIII.

The epilepsy often attacks suddenly, and without giving any warning; but more frequently is preceded by a pain in the head, lassitude, some disturbance of the senses, unquiet sleep, unusual dread, dimness of sight, a noise in the ears, palpitation of the heart, coldness of the joints; and in some there is a sensation of formication, or a cold air, &c., ascending from the lower extremities towards the head. In the fit, the persons fall suddenly to the ground (whence the name of the falling-sickness), frequently with a violent cry. The thumbs are shut up close in the palms of the hands, and are with difficulty taken out; the eyes are distorted, so that nothing but the whites are to be seen; all sensation is suspended, inasmuch that by no smell, noise, or otherwise, nor even by pinching the body, can they be brought to themselves; they foam at the mouth, with a hissing kind of noise; the tongue is frequently lacerated by the teeth, and there is a violent convulsive motion of the arms and legs. Sometimes, however, the limbs, instead of being agitated by epilepsy convulsive motions, are all stiff, and the patients are as immovable as a statue. In children, the penis is erected; and in young men there is an emission of the semen, and the urine is often thrown out to a considerable distance. At length there is a remission of the symptoms, and the patients recover after a longer or shorter interval; when they complain of a pain, torpor, or heaviness of the head, with a laxitude of all the joints.\n\nCauses, &c. The disease of epileptic subjects has shown a variety of morbid appearances, which may be supposed to have contributed to the disease; such as, indurations in the brain or meninges, caries of the internal surface of the cranium; projections of the bony substance of the same, pressing upon the brain; collections of serum or purulent matter, and earthy concretions within the skull; besides many others which are recorded by Bonetus, Morgagni, and Lieutaud. But often the causes are impossible to be discovered; for even in those who have died of the disease, the brain and all other parts of the nervous system have been apparently found. The disease will attack strong as well as weak people; and in those who are subject to it, any considerable excess in drinking, a surfeit, violent passion, or venery, &c. will certainly bring on a fit. Some have epileptic paroxysms returning periodically after considerable intervals; and the disease has been thought to have some dependence on the phases of the moon.\n\nPrognosis. If the epilepsy comes on before the time of puberty, there are some hopes of its going off at that time. But it is a bad sign when it attacks about the 21st year, and still worse if the fits grow more frequent; for then the animal functions are often destroyed, as well as those of the mind, and the patient becomes stupid and foolish. Sometimes it will terminate in melancholy or madness, and sometimes in a mortal apoplexy or palsy. It has sometimes, however, been observed, that epilepsies have been removed by the appearance of cutaneous diseases, as the itch, smallpox, measles, &c. While the disease is recent, therefore, we are not to despair of a cure; but if it be of long standing, or hereditary, there is very little reason to expect that it can be removed.\n\nCure. From the symptoms occurring in epilepsy, which consists of involuntary convulsive motions, and an affection of the mental powers, there is reason to conclude that the fit immediately depends on the induction of some peculiar action of the brain; but that convulsions may ensue from this cause, it would seem necessary that there should also occur a peculiar disposition to action in the moving fibres. On this ground, then, we may suppose the cure to be chiefly expected on one of two principles; either by our being able to prevent the peculiar action of the brain, or to remove the disposition to action in the moving fibres. The first is chiefly to be accomplished by the removal of irritating causes, by preventing their influence from being propagated to the brain, when they are applied to remote parts; or by counteracting their influence, from inducing in the brain a state of action different from that to which they give rise. The second end is chiefly to be obtained by diminishing the mobility of the nervous energy, and by strengthening...\nenging the tone of the moving fibres. It must, however be allowed, that in all convulsive disorders, excepting those which are cured by nature about the time of puberty, the cure by artificial means is very difficult. Numberless specifics have been recommended, but all of them have failed of answering the expectation. When the cause can be discovered, that must be removed. In other cases, the cold bath, valerian root, caltor, musk, opium, the febrile gums, cinchona, with the whole tribe of nervous and antispasmodic medicines, have been recommended; but none of these, or indeed any combination of them, have been found generally useful; though the slighter, or symptomatic cases, may often be removed by them.\n\nOf late the calx or oxide, improperly called the flowers, of zinc, have obtained such reputation in convulsive disorders as to be received into the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia under the title of oxidum zinci. They were proposed by Dr Gaubius as an antispasmodic, in his Adversaria; and their efficacy has since been confirmed by various observations. In an inaugural dissertation published by Dr Hart at Leyden, the medical virtues of the flowers of zinc are considered. He observes, that they have long been used externally, chiefly for inflammations of the eyes from acid lymph. Glauber first proposed the internal use of them; and Gaubius discovered them to be the remedy of a celebrated empiric Luddemannus, which he styled his luna fixata. After this he exhibited them with success in convulsive and spasmodic diseases. Dr Hart supposes, that they act either as absorbents, or as possessing a specific virtue: but is a strong advocate for their efficacy, on whatever principles they may operate; and, in favour of his opinion, relates seven cases in which they proved successful. A girl of 17 years of age was seized with a slight chorea from a fright; and when the disease had continued six days, she began to take the flowers of zinc, by which her disorder was removed in less than three weeks. Her cure required only 16 grains of the zinc. In a few months the complaints returned, from the same cause; and were removed by four grains of the medicine divided into ten doses. A boy of about four years old, labouring under a real epilepsy, suspected to be hereditary, was cured by a grain of the flowers of zinc taken every day for some time.—A man 50 years old, thrown into convulsions from a violent passion, was cured by a grain of the calx taken every two hours. The disease had gone off upon venesection and the use of some other remedies; but returned again in two weeks, when it was finally removed by the zinc. The two last cases are related from Dr Gaubius, who affirms that he has used the flowers of zinc in cases of the chincough, hysterical hiccup, and spasms cynicus; that they frequently did more than other medicines, but were by no means successful in every case. The other cures mentioned by Dr Hart are similar to those above mentioned. But it does not appear that he ever saw a confirmed epilepsy cured by this medicine.\n\nIn the first volume of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, we have an account by Mr Benjamin Bell, of a man afflicted with a confirmed epilepsy, who was considerably relieved by the flowers of zinc.\n\nIn a young man labouring under the epilepsy, in whom the fits were preceded by an aura epileptica, or sensation like air arising from the inside of the knee-joint, the disease was also relieved, but not cured.\n\nDr Percival relates some cases of epilepsy which seem to have been cured by the flowers of zinc; and in other cases, where the disease was not entirely removed by it, the spasms were nevertheless much mitigated. He did not observe that it promoted any evacuation; excepting that in some, upon being first taken, it occasioned a little sickness, which went off with a stool. He adds, that those apothecaries who do not prepare this medicine themselves, are in great danger of being imposed upon, as it is sometimes a mere corrosion of the zinc by an acid, and even imperfectly washed.\n\nThe good effects of the oxide of zinc as an antispasmodic are also attested by Dr Haygarth of Chester and Dr White of York. The former gives a test of their goodness which may be of use to those who do not prepare them, namely, that the true flowers of zinc, when strongly heated, become yellow, but reassume their white colour on being allowed to cool. The latter gives a cate of hieranofoos, or strange convulsions of almost all the muscles of the body, cured by zinc, after a number of other remedies had failed. But, although from these and other respectable authorities, there can be no doubt that zinc has often been successful in epilepsy; yet it is equally certain, that in many others it has had a fair trial, without producing any benefit.\n\nIn Dr Home's clinical experiments and histories, also, oxide of zinc is mentioned as having been found serviceable upon trial in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Of the other principal remedies which have been recommended for the epilepsy and other convulsive disorders allied to it, we have the following account by the same author.\n\n1. The cold-bath was tried in one who had a convulsive disorder of one side, but the symptoms were rendered much worse by it.\n\n2. Venesection. Not to be depended on in convulsions.\n\n3. Electricity. In two convulsive cases was of no service.\n\n4. Epiphaetis. Do not seem to be powerful antispasmodics.\n\n5. Valerian. In nine convulsive cases, for which this remedy has been reckoned almost a specific, it not only made no cure, but could scarcely be reckoned to do any good. Dr Home supposes that it acts as a bitter tonic, something like the Serpentaria Virginia. Though much used at present, he tells us it has always appeared to him a weak, often a hurtful, medicine.\n\n6. Musk. Six convulsive patients treated with large doses of this remedy, were neither cured nor in the least relieved.\n\n7. Caltor seems to be unworthy of the confidence formerly put in it. It is indeed possessed of a sedative power, and therefore may be useful in spasmodic feverish cases.\n\n8. Mafastida has considerable antispasmodic powers, but is not always successful. It heats and quickens the pulse; and is therefore improper in cases attended with inflammation. It disagrees with some from a peculiarity of constitution; exciting pain in the stomach, and...\nand vomiting: but this can be known only after the exhibition of the medicine.\n\n9. Cinchona. Of seven spasmodic cases, six were either cured or mitigated. An epilepsy of eight years standing was very much relieved by taking the bark for a month, and one of two years standing by taking it for ten days. But the medicine is of a heating nature, and therefore is not to be employed in cases attended with inflammatory symptoms.\n\n10. Peony root was given to two epileptic patients without the least success.\n\n11. Viscum guercinum, or mistletoe, was given in the quantity of two scruples five times a day to an epileptic patient, without success.\n\n12. Extractum hyoscyami was given to an epileptic patient, to one afflicted with the hemitonus, and to one who laboured under the hysteric affection, without the least good effect.\n\n13. Folia aurantiacum were exhibited with the like bad success. Five drams of the powdered leaves were taken at once without any sensible effect.\n\n14. Cardamine pratensis, in three epileptic cases, was not attended with any success.\n\n15. Opium did no good.\n\n16. Ammoniacetum cupri made no cure in four cases of epilepsy in which it was tried.\n\nThat in many cases all these remedies have been employed without success, is not to be denied; and indeed it may with confidence be asserted, that a great majority of cases of epilepsy are incurable by any remedy that has yet been discovered. At the same time, as there is incontrovertible evidence that some of them have succeeded at least in certain cases, the more powerful may always be considered as deserving a fair trial. The ammoniacetum cupri, in particular, seems well entitled to the attention of practitioners; for though it be a medicine of great activity, yet under prudent administration it may be employed even with very young subjects without any hazard; and in several inveterate cases, which had obstinately resisted other medicines, it has brought about a complete recovery.\n\nGENUS LIV. PALPITATIO.\n\nPALPITATION OF THE HEART.\n\nPalpitatio, Sauv. gen. 130. Lin. 132. Vog. 213. Sag. 237. Hoffm. III. 83. Junck. 33.\n\nThe palpitation of the heart is sometimes so violent, that it may be heard at a considerable distance. It may proceed from a bad conformation of the heart itself, or some of the large vessels. It may also be occasioned by wounds or abscesses in the heart; or it may proceed from polypous concretions or obstructions of that viscus, or from plethora, fear, or spasmodic affections of the nervous system. When it proceeds from diseases of the heart or large vessels, it is absolutely incurable. In spasmodic cases, the remedies above related may be used. If the patient be plethoric, bleeding will probably remove the disorder, at least for the present.\n\nGENUS LV. ASTHMA.\n\nAsthma, Sauv. gen. 145. Lin. 161. Vog. 268.

The Plethoric Asthma.\n\nAsthma plethoricum, Sauv. sp. 15.\n\nThe asthma is a chronic disease, which may continue to give very great distress, at intervals, for a considerable number of years. Sir John Floyer, when he wrote his celebrated treatise, had laboured under repeated paroxysms for thirty years.\n\nThe common distinction is into humid and dry; the former is accompanied with an expectoration of mucus or purulent matter, but the latter is not. In the genuine humoral asthma, the patients are obliged to lean forward; the inspiration is short and spasmodic; and the expiration very slow.\n\nAsthmatic persons have generally some warning of the attack, from a languor, loss of appetite, oppression, and swelling of the stomach from flatusulence, which precede the fit; but it is usually in the middle of the night that the violent difficulty of breathing comes on.\n\nThe duration of the paroxysm is uncertain, as it will sometimes terminate in three or four hours, while at other times it will continue for as many days; nay, it has been known to last three weeks without intermission. While it subsists, the patient is in very great distress, not being able to lie in bed, nor feebly to speak or expectorate, so great is the difficulty of breathing; and yet, notwithstanding all this apparent interruption to the free passage of the blood through the lungs, an inflammation here seldom or never supervenes a fit of the asthma. As the paroxysm wears off, and the breathing becomes free, there is more or less of an expectoration of mucus; and the urine, from being pale and limpid, becomes high coloured, and lets fall a copious sediment.\n\nIn order to obtain relief in the fit, we must sometimes bleed, unless extreme weakness or old age should forbid, and repeat it according to the degrees of strength and fulness: a purging clyster, with a solution of atrafetida, must be immediately injected; and if the violence of the symptoms should not speedily abate, it will be proper to apply a blistering plaster to the neck or breast.\n\nIn the height of the paroxysm, an emetic might be followed\nfollowed by dangerous symptoms, as it would increase the accumulation of blood in the vessels of the head; but vomiting will often prevent a fit of the asthma, especially if the stomach should chance to be loaded with any sort of saburra. A very strong infusion of roasted coffee has been found to give ease in an asthmatic paroxysm.\n\nSir John Pringle says it is the best abater of the paroxysms of the periodic asthma that he has seen. The coffee ought to be of the best Mocco, newly burnt, and made very strong immediately after grinding it. He commonly ordered an ounce for one dish; which is to be repeated fresh after the interval of a quarter or half an hour; and which is to be taken without milk or sugar. The medicine in general is mentioned by Muffgrave in his treatise de Arthritide anomala; but he first heard of it from a physician in Litchfield, who had been informed by the old people of that place, that Sir John Floyer, during the latter part of his life, kept free from, or at least lived easy under, his asthma, from the use of very strong coffee. This discovery, it seems, he made after the publication of his book upon that disease. Dr Percival says he has frequently directed coffee in the asthma with great success.\n\nIn the intervals of the fit, persons subject to the asthma, especially the humid species, should take emetics from time to time. An infusion of tobacco is an emetic that has been said to be very serviceable in some asthmatic cases; but its operation is both too distressing and too dangerous, that it will never probably be introduced into common use as an emetic. Smoking or chewing the same has been known to prevent the frequency and severity of the paroxysms. Asthmatic patients may also use the lac ammoniaci, with a due proportion of oxymel scillitum and vinum antimoniale, with a view to promote expectoration; or the gum ammoniac, and others of similar virtues, may be formed into pills, and combined with soap, as mentioned for the dyspnea pituitosa; or a mafs may be composed of asafoetida and balsam of Tolu, with syrup of garlic; and these pills may be washed down by a medicated wine, impregnated with squills, horseradish root, and mustard seed; or a strong bitter infusion, with a little antimonial wine.\n\nIn some cases crude mercury will be found serviceable; in others flowers of sulphur, made into an electuary with honey or syrup of garlic; and if, notwithstanding the use of these things, a coptive habit should prevail, it will be necessary, from time to time, to give a few grains of pills of aloes and myrrh, soap and aloes, or a mass of equal parts of rhubarb, scammony, and soap.\n\nThe dry or spasmodic asthma, during the extreme violence of the fit, is best relieved by opiates; and sometimes very large doses are required. But in order to obtain permanent relief, nothing is found to answer better than ipecacuanha in small doses. Three, five, eight, or ten grains, according to the strength and constitution of the patient, given every other day, have been productive of the happiest effects; acting sometimes as an evacuant, pumping up the viscid phlegm; at others, as an antispasmodic or sedative. Iliums are generally recommended in both species, and will often be found useful.\n\nChanges of weather are usually felt very sensibly by asthmatic people, who in general cannot live with tolerable ease in the atmosphere of large cities; though we shall sometimes meet with patients who agree better with this air, which is so replete with gross effluvia of various kinds, than with the purest that can be found in country situations. And some are found who breathe with the most ease in a crowded room, with a fire and candles.\n\nA light diet of meats that are easy of digestion, and not flatulent, is requisite for asthmatic people; and the exercise of riding is often highly serviceable.\n\nWhen the asthma is found to depend on some other disease, whether it be the gout or an intermittent fever, or when it proceeds from the striking in of some cutaneous eruption, regard must always be had to the primary disease: thus, in the asthma arthriticum, liniments to the feet, or blistering, will be absolutely necessary, in order, if possible, to bring on a fit of the gout. And when the dregs of an ague give rise to an asthma, which is termed febriculorum, and invades at regular intervals, we must have recourse to the Peruvian bark. The asthma exanthematicum will require blisters or iliums, to give vent to the acrid matters which were repelled from the surface of the body; and courses of sulphureous waters, goats whey, and sweetening diet drinks, or perhaps mercurial alternatives, in order to correct the sharpness of the juices.\n\n**GENUS LVI.

Sauv. sp. 2, 4, 5, 20.*\n\n*Orthopnea a lipomate, Sauv. sp. 18.*\n\nThis is generally accompanied with a phthisis pulmonalis; but Sauvages mentions one species of phthisis to which the dry dyspnea seems more particularly to belong. The patients fall away by degrees, and have a great difficulty of breathing, continual thirst, and little or no spitting. When opened after death, their lungs are found not to be ulcerated, but shrivelled and contracted as if they had been smoke-dried. Goldsmiths and chemists are said to be subject to this disease by reason of the vapours they draw in with their breath. Sauvages doth not mention any particular remedy. Shortness of breath arising from tubercles, as they are termed, or a scirrhus enlargement of the lymphatic glands which are dispersed through the lungs, is com-\nSpasm. monly found in scrophulous habits, and may be distin-\nguished by the concomitancy of those external swellings\nand appearances which particularly mark the scrophula.\nThis species of dyspnoea generally ends in a phthisis.\nCourses of goats' whey, and of sea water, have been\nknown to do service; but it must be confessed, that a\nperfect cure is seldom obtained. Iffues are of use in\nthese cases, as they appear to prevent the ill effects of\nover fulness, if it should happen at any time to super-\nvene.\n\nSp. III. Dyspnoea from Changes in the Weather.\n(Sauv. p. 12.)\n\nThis seems to be a disease entirely spasmodic, and\nthe antispasmodics already related are accordingly indi-\ncated.\n\nSp. IV. The Dyspnoea from Earthy Substances formed\nin the Lungs.\n\nSauvages mentions this disease as much more com-\nmon in brutes than in the human race; but Dr Cullen\nmentions his having seen some instances of it; and we\nhave several accounts by different authors of calculous\nmatters being coughed up by people labouring under a\ndyspnoea, and threatened with consumption. In three\ncases of this kind which fell under Dr Cullen's inspec-\ntion, there was no appearance of earthy or flinty con-\ncretions in any other part of the body. The calcareous\nmatter was coughed up frequently with a little blood,\nsometimes with mucus only, and sometimes with pus.\nIn one of these cases, an exquisite phthisis came on, and\nproved mortal; in the other two the symptoms of phthisis\nwere never fully formed; and after some time, merely\nby a milk diet and avoiding irritation, the patients\nentirely recovered.\n\nSauvages also greatly recommends milk in these\ncases, and soap for dissolving the concretions. The\nreason why brutes are more subject to these pulmo-\nnary calculi than mankind, is that they very seldom\ncough, and thus the stagnating mucus or lymph con-\ncretes into a kind of gypseous matter.\n\nSp. V. The Watery Dyspnoea.\n\nDyspnea pituitosa, Sauv. p. 1.\n\nOrthopnoea ab hydropneumonia, Sauv. p. 12.\n\nThis may arise from too great a defluxion of mucus\non the lungs, or from an effusion of serum, as is men-\ntioned under the pneumonia. The treatment of the\ndisease may be gathered from what has been already\nsaid under the heads of Pneumonia, Catarrh, Empye-\nma, &c.\n\nSp. VI. The Dyspnoea from Corpulency.\n\nOrthopnoea a pinguedine, Sauv. p. 6.\n\nThere have been many instances of suffocation and\ndeath occasioned by too great corpulency. These fa-\ntal effects, however, may be almost always avoided, if\nthe persons have resolution to persist in an active and\nvery temperate course of life; avoiding animal food,\nmuch sleep, and using a great deal of exercise. In the\nthird volume of the Medical Observations, however,\nthere is an extraordinary instance of internal obesity\nwhich neither showed itself externally, nor could be\nremoved by any medicines.\n\nOther species of dyspnea have been considered un-\nder Phthisis. It is frequently symptomatic of diseases\nof the heart and large vessels, or swellings of the abdo-\nmen, &c.\n\nGENUS LVII. PERTUSSIS.\n\nCrincough.\n\nPertussis, Sydenham, Ed.

Sag. sp. 11.\nAmphitherina tussiculosa, Sauv. sp. 13.\n\nDescription. This disease comes on at first like a\ncommon cold; but is from the beginning attended with\na greater degree of dyspnoea than is common in cat-\narrh, and there is a remarkable affection of the eyes,\nas if they were swollen, and a little pulled out of their\nsockets. By degrees the fits of coughing become\nlonger and more violent, till at last they are plainly\nconvulsive, so that for a considerable time the patient\ncannot respire, and when at last he recovers his breath,\ninspiration is performed with a thrill kind of noise like\nthe crowing of a cock. This kind of inspiration\nserves only as an introduction to another convulsive fit\nof coughing, which is in like manner followed by an-\nother inspiration of the same kind; and thus it conti-\nnues for some time, very often till the patient vomit,\nwhich puts an end to the paroxysm at that time.\nThese paroxysms are attended with a violent determin-\nation of the blood towards the head, so that the ves-\nsels become extremely turgid, and blood not unfre-\nquently flows from the mouth and nose. The disease\nis tedious, and often continues for many months. It is\nnot commonly attended with fever, unless at the com-\nmencement.\n\nCauses, &c. The chincough is an infectious disor-\nder, and very often epidemic; but the nature of the\ncontagion is not understood; at least it is no farther un-\nderstood than that of smallpox, measles, or similar epi-\ndemics. We well know that it is from a peculiar and\nspecific contagion alone that this disease, as well as the\nothers above-mentioned, can arise. But with regard to\nthe nature of any of them, we are totally in the dark.\nIt generally attacks children, or adults of a lax habit,\nmaking its attack frequently in the spring or autumn;\nat the same time, when this contagion is introduced in-\nto any town, village, or neighbourhood, it will rage epi-\ndemically at any season. Those alone are affected with\nthis disease who had never before been subjected to it.\nFor in this affection, as well as in smallpox, having had\nthe disease once, gives defense against future contagion.\nEvery individual, however, does not seem to be equally\nreadily affected with this contagion; like other con-\ntagious diseases occurring only once in a lifetime, it\nmay naturally be expected to be more frequent among\nchildren than at any other period of life. But many,\nthough frequently exposed to contagion, are yet not\naffected with the disease; and those children who live\nupon unwholesome watery food, or breathe unwhole-\nsome air, are most liable to its attacks, or at least suffer\nmedicinE.\n\nmofl from them. In general it has been concluded, that whatever weakens the foids, or tends to bring on a dissolution of the fluids, predisposes to this disease, and increases its severity.\n\nPrognosis. The cincough is not very often fatal. During one epidemic, however, it is often observed to be much more dangerous and more severe than during another. This is also remarked with regard even to particular periods of the same epidemic; and it is also observed, that on certain families this disease is much more severe than on others. Its danger, however, is still more connected with the period of life at which it occurs. In children under two years of age it is most dangerous; and kills them by producing convulsions, suffocation, inflammation, and suppuration of the brain or in the lungs, ruptures, and incarceration of the spine. In pregnant women it will produce abortion; and in adults inflammations of the lungs, and all the consequences of pneumonia, more frequently than in children. From a long continuance of the disease patients will become asthmatic, ricketty, and scrofulous. It is generally reckoned a good sign when a fit terminates by vomiting; for in this disease there seems to be a great increase of the secretion of mucus, and the vomiting affords great relief.\n\nCure. Pertussis is one of those diseases which, after the contagion has exerted its influence, can be terminated only by running a certain course; but it is much less limited in its course than smallpox and measles, and often it runs on to a very great length, or at least it is very difficult to distinguish certain sequelae of this disease from the disease itself. And when it exists in the former of these states, it admits of an artificial termination. In the treatment of this affection, therefore, the objects at which a practitioner chiefly aims, are, in the first place, the obviating urgent symptoms, and forwarding the natural termination of the disease; and secondly, the inducing an artificial termination. With these intentions various practices are employed on different occasions. The most approved remedies are vomits, purges, bleeding, and the attenuating pectorals; for the other kinds generally do hurt; but large evacuations of any kind are pernicious. In the Medical Observations, vol. iii. Dr Morris recommends calomel and cinchona; but in cases attended with any degree of inflammation, the latter must certainly do hurt, and the former will generally be insignificant. Dr Butter, in a dissertation expressly on the subject, relates 20 cases of it cured by the extract of hemlock. He directs half a grain daily for a child under six months old; one grain for a child from six months to two years; afterwards allowing half a grain for every year of the patient's age till he be 20: beyond that period, he directs ten grains to be given for the first day's consumption, gradually increasing the dose according to the effect. If the patient have not two stools daily, he advises magnesia or the sulphur potash cum sulphure, to be added to the hemlock mixture. By this method he says the peculiar symptoms of the disease are removed in the space of a week; nothing but a slight cough remaining. The use of hemlock, however, has by no means become universal in consequence of this publication, nor indeed has this remedy been found equally successful with others who have given it a fair trial.\n\nThe remedy most to be depended upon in this disease is change of air. The patient, as soon as the disease is fully formed, ought to be removed to some other part of the country: but there is no occasion for going to a distant place; a mile or two, or frequently a smaller distance, will be sufficient; and in this new habitation, the frequency of the cough is almost instantly diminished to a most surprising degree. After remaining there for some time, however, the cough will often be observed to become again more frequent, and the other symptoms increased. In this case, another change of air, or even a return to the former habitation, becomes necessary. Manifest benefit has even been derived by changing a patient from one room of a house to another. But although change of air has thus been advantageous, it must also be remarked, that when it has been had recourse to at very early periods it has often done mischief, particularly by aggravating the febrile and inflammatory symptoms. If the disease be attended with fever, bleeding and other antiphlogistic remedies are proper. Dr Buchan recommends an ointment made of equal parts of garlic and hog's lard applied to the soles of the feet; but if it have any effect, it is probably merely as an emplastrum calidum. It ought to be put on a rag and applied like a plaster. Opiates may sometimes be useful, but in general are to be avoided. They are chiefly serviceable where the cough is very frequent, with little expectoration. In these cases benefit has sometimes also been derived from sulphuric ether, and sometimes from the tincture of cantharides. An almost instantaneous termination has on some occasions been put to this disease by exciting a high degree of fear, or by inducing another febrile contagion: But the effects of both are too uncertain and too dangerous to be employed in practice.\n\nGENUS LVIII.

The Spasmodic Colic.\n\nColica flatulenta, pituitosa, &c. Sauv. sp. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7.\nIleus\nDescription. The colic is chiefly known by a violent pain in the abdomen, commonly about the umbilical region. The pain resembles various kinds of sensations, as of burning, twisting, boring, a ligature drawn very tight, &c. The belly is generally colitive, though sometimes there is a violent evacuation of bilious matters upwards and downwards. In these cases the disease is sometimes accompanied from the beginning with a weak and intermittent pulse, cold sweats, and fainting. In some the disease comes on gradually, beginning with an habitual coughiness; and if purgatives be taken, they do not operate. The pain comes on generally after a meal, and soon occasions nausea and vomiting. Sometimes the disease is attended with pyrexia, violent thirst, and a full pulse; the vomiting becomes more violent, and excrementitious matters are thrown up with the most exquisite pain and tension of the abdomen; and hiccup comes on, which continues obstinately; till at last a cessation of pain and fetid breath indicate a mortification of the intestines and approaching death. Sometimes the peristaltic motion of the intestines is so totally inverted, that all their contents are evacuated by the mouth, and even clutters will be vomited; which constitutes that disease commonly called the iliac passion.\n\nCauses, &c. Colics may arise from any sudden check given to perspiration, as by violent cold applied to any part of the body, especially to the lower extremities and abdomen. Very frequently they are occasioned by austere, acid, or indigestible aliments taken into the stomach. By any of these, a violent colic, or indeed an iliac passion, may be occasioned; for Dr Cullen justly observes, that this last, though commonly accounted a different species of disease, differs from colic in no other way than in being in every respect in a much higher degree. In those who have died of this disease and been dissected, the intestines have sometimes been found twisted; but more commonly there hath been an introflection of the intestine, that is, one part of the gut seems to have entered within the other. In the Edinburgh Medical Essays, vol. iii. we have a dissertation on the use of the warm bath in the bilious colic, in which the author derives the disorder from a spasmodic constrictive of the intestine occasioned by the acrimony of the bile. By this, he says, the intestine is not only contracted into an unusual narrowness, but the sides of it have been found, upon dissection, so closely joined, that no passage could be made downwards more than if they had been strongly tied by a ligature. The formation of the introflection he explains by quoting a passage from Peyerus, who made the following experiment on a frog. Having irritated the intestine of the animal in several different places, he observed it to contract at those places most violently, and to protrude its contents upwards and downwards wherever the relaxed state of the part would permit; by which means the contents were heaped together in different parts. Hence some parts of the intestine being dilated much more than enough, by reason of the great quantity of matter thrown into them, formed a kind of sack which readily received the constricted part into it. If this happen in the human body, there is the greatest danger of a mortification; because the part which is constricted, and at any rate disposed to inflammation, has that disposition very much increased by its confinement within the other, and by the pressure of the contents of the alimentary canal from the stomach downwards upon it. An iliac passion may also arise from the strangulation of part of the intestine in a hernia; and even a very small portion of it thus strangulated may occasion a fatal disease. In the Medical Observations, vol. iv. however, we have an account of an iliac passion arising from a very different cause, which could neither have been suspected nor cured by any other way than the operation of gastrotomy, or opening the abdomen of the patient, in order to remove the cause of the disorder. The patient, a woman of about 28 years of age, died after suffering extreme torture for six days. The body being opened, some quantity of a dirty coloured fluid was found in the cavity of the abdomen. The jejunum and ileum were greatly distended with air. A portion of the omentum adhered to the mesentery, near that part where the ileum terminates in the cæcum. From this adhesion, which was close to the spine, there ran a ligamentous cord or process about two inches and a half long, unequally thick, in some places not thicker than a packthread; which by its other extremity adhered to the coats of the ileum, about two inches above the cæcum. This cord formed a circle with the mesentery, large enough to admit a hen's egg to pass through it. The cord had formed a noose (in a manner difficult to be explained), which included a doubling of about two inches of the lower end of the ileum; and was drawn so tight, that it not only put a stop to the passage of everything through the bowels, and brought on a gangrene of the strangulated part, but it had even cut through all the coats of the intestine on the opposite side to the mesentery, and made an aperture about an inch long. In the Memoirs of the Academy of Surgery are mentioned several similar cases.\n\nPrognosis. The colic is never to be reckoned void of danger, as it may unexpectedly terminate in an inflammation and gangrene of the intestines. Those species of it which are attended with purging must be considered as much less dangerous than those in which the vomiting is very violent. The iliac passion, or that attended with the vomiting of feces, is always to be accounted highly dangerous; but if the passage through the intestines be free, even though their peristaltic motion should be inverted, and clutters evacuated by the mouth, there is much more hope of a cure, than when the belly is obstinately colitive, and there is some fixed obstruction which seems to bid defiance to all remedies.\n\nCure. In the cure of the spasmodic colic, the recovery must ultimately depend on producing a resolution of the spasmodic affection. In order to accomplish this, it is in general necessary to evacuate the contents of the intestines, and to remove morbid irritability existing in that part of the system. But in order to preserve the life of the patient from the most imminent hazard, it is still more necessary to prevent and remove those inflammatory affections which often occur in this disease. As the chief danger in colics arises from an inflammation and consequent mortification of\nthe intestines, it is essentially necessary, in the first place, to diminish the tendency to a pyrexia, if there should happen to be any. This is accomplished by bleeding, emollient injections, warm bathing, and cooling medicines taken inwardly. Dr Porter strongly recommends the warm bath in those colics attended with violent evacuations of bile. He supposes it to do service by relaxing the contraction of the intestines, and thus preventing or removing the introfusception. In the mean time opiates may be given to ease the pain, while every method is tried, by cathartics and glysters of various kinds, to procure a stool. In obstinate cases, where stimulating cathartics have proved ineffectual, the milder kinds, such as manna, senna, oleum ricini, &c., will sometimes succeed; but when everything of this kind fails, recourse must be had to some of the more extraordinary methods. Some have recommended the swallowing of leaden bullets, on a supposition that by their weight they would force through the obstruction; but these seem much more likely to create than to remove an obstruction. It is impossible they can act by their gravity, because the intestines do not lie in a straight line from the pylorus to the anus; and though this were actually the case, we cannot suppose that the weight of a leaden bullet could prove very efficacious in removing either a spasmodic contraction or an obstruction from any other cause. But when we consider, not only that the intestines consist of a great multitude of folds, but that their peristaltic motion (by which only the contents are forced through them) is inverted, the futility of this remedy must be evident. It might rather be supposed to aggravate the disease; as the lead, by its pressure, would tend to fix the introfusception more firmly, or perhaps push it still farther on. The same thing may be said of quicksilver: not to mention the pernicious consequences to be apprehended from swallowing large quantities of this mineral, even if it should prove efficacious in relieving the patient for the present. There are, however, some late cases on record, particularly one by Mr William Perry, published in the sixteenth volume of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, in which the hydrargyrum, swallowed in great quantities, was attended with the happiest effects, after every other remedy had been tried in vain.\n\nAnother method has been proposed, in the Medical Essays, for relieving the miserable patients in this disorder, which in many cases has been known to do service. The patient is to be taken out of bed, and made to walk about on the cold floor of a damp apartment. At the same time, baths of cold water are to be doused on his feet, legs, and thighs; and this must be continued for an hour or longer, if a stool be not procured before that time, though this will generally be the case much sooner. The exercise does not at all impair the patient's strength, but rather adds to it; and some very remarkable instances are adduced in the 6th volume of the Medical Essays, where this proved effectual after all other medicines had failed. In one person—the disease had come on with a habitual coliciveness, and he had been for a week tormented with the most violent pain and vomiting, which could be stopped neither by anodynes nor any other medicines, the sharpest glysters being returned unaltered, and all kinds of purgatives thrown up soon after they were swallowed; but by the above mentioned method, a stool was procured in 35 minutes, and the patient recovered. In some others the coliciveness had continued for a much longer time. Other remedies are, the blowing air into the intestines by means of a bellows, and the injecting glysters of the smoke of tobacco. But neither of these seem very capable of removing the disease. They can affect only the parts below the obstruction; while, to cure the disease, it is necessary that the obstructed parts themselves should be reached by the medicine, and therefore we have not many well attested instances of their success. In some obstinate cases, however, benefit has certainly been derived from tobacco-smoke injections, and likewise from injections of tepid water to the extent of several pounds. For putting in practice these modes of cure, a particular apparatus has been contrived; and in cases even apparently desperate, neither should be neglected. The cold water gives a general and very considerable shock to the system, checks the peripatetic, and thus drives the humours inward upon the intestines, by which they receive a much more effectual stimulus than can be supposed to arise from any kind of glyster. But when all methods have failed, the only chance the patient can have for life is by a manual operation.\n\nIn those colics which are attended with faintings, &c., from the beginning, and which generally attack hysterical women and other debilitated persons, all kinds of evacuations are pernicious; and the cure is to be attempted by anodynes and cordials, which will seldom fail of success. Even there also, however, it is necessary that the belly should be moved; and for this purpose injections, containing a solution of salaciata, which operate powerfully as antispasmodics, are preferable to most other modes of cure.\n\nSp. II. Colica Pictonum. The Colic of Poitou.\n\nRachialgia Pictonum, Sauv. sp. 1.\nRachialgia metallica, Sauv. sp. 3.\nColica Pictonum Citefi.\n\nAnother cause to which violent colics are frequently to be ascribed, and which often gives occasion to them where it is very little suspected, is lead, or some solution or fume of it, received into the body. To this cause is evidently owing the colics to which plumbers, lead-miners, and smelters of lead, are subject. To the same cause, though not so apparent at first sight, are we to ascribe the Devonshire colic, where lead is received into the body dissolved in cider, the common drink of the inhabitants of that country. This has been proved by experiment; for lead has been extracted from cider in quantity sufficient to produce pernicious effects on the human body. The colic of Poitou, and what is called the dry belly-ach in the West Indies, are of the same nature; for which reason we give the following general description of the symptoms of all these diseases.\n\nThe patient is generally first seized with an acute pain at the pit of the stomach, which extends itself down with gripping pains to the bowels. Soon after there is a distension, as with wind; and frequent retchings to vomit, without bringing up any thing but small quantities of bile and phlegm. An obstinate coliciveness follows, yet sometimes attended with a tenesmus, and\nSpasms, and the bowels seem to the patient as if they were drawn up towards the back; at other times they are drawn into hard lumps, or hard rolls, which are plainly perceptible to the hand on the belly. Sometimes the coats of the intestines seem to be drawn up from the anus and down from the pylorus towards the navel. When a stool is procured by artificial means, as clysters, &c., the feces appear in little hard knots like sheep's dung, called *scybala*, and are in small quantity. There is, however, usually an obstinate coliciveness; the urine is discharged in small quantity, frequently with pain and much difficulty. The pulse is generally low, though sometimes a little quickened by the violence of the pain; but inflammatory symptoms very seldom occur. The extremities are often cold, and sometimes the violence of the pain causes cold clammy sweats and fainting. The mind is generally much affected, and the spirits are sunk. The disease is often tedious, especially if improperly treated, inasmuch that the patients will continue in this miserable state for twenty or thirty days successively; nay, instances have been known of its continuing for six months. In this case the pains at last become almost intolerable: the patient's breath acquires a strong fetid smell like excrements, from a retention of the feces, and an absorption of the putrid effluvia from them by the lacteals. At last, when the pain in the bowels begins to abate, a pain comes on in the shoulder-joints and adjoining muscles, with an unusual sensation and tingling along the spinal marrow. This soon extends itself from thence to the nerves of the arms and legs, which become weak; and that weakness increases till the extreme parts become paralytic, with a total loss of motion, though a benumbed sensation often remains. Sometimes, by a sudden metastasis, the brain becomes affected, a stupor and delirium come on, and the nervous system is irritated to such a degree as to produce general convulsions, which are frequently followed by death. At other times, the peritallatic motion of the intestines is inverted, and a true iliac passion is produced, which also proves fatal in a short time. Sometimes the paralytic affection of the extremities goes off, and the pain of the bowels returns with its former violence; and on the cessation of the pain in the intestines, the extremities again become paralytic; and thus the pain and palsy will alternate for a very long time.\n\n**Cure.** Various methods have been attempted for removing this terrible disease. The obstinate coliciveness which attends it, made physicians at first exhibit very strong purgatives and stimulating clysters. But these medicines, by increasing the convulsive spasms of the intestines, were found to be pernicious. Balsam of Peru, by its warm aromatic power, was found to succeed much better; and Dr Sydenham accordingly prescribed it in the quantity of 40 drops twice or thrice a day taken on sugar. This, with gentle purgatives, opiates, and some drops of the hotter essential oils, continued to be the medicine commonly employed in this disease, till a specific was published by Dr Lionel Chalmers of South Carolina. This receipt was purchased by Dr Chalmers from a family where it had long been kept a secret. The only unusual medicine in this receipt, and on which the efficacy of it chiefly if not wholly depends, is sulphate of copper. This must be dissolved in water, in the quantity of one grain to an ounce, and the dose of the solution is a wine-glassful given fasting for nine successive mornings. For the first four or five days this medicine discharges much serous bile both ways; but the excretions of this humour lessen by degrees; and before the course be ended, it has little other effect than to cause some degree of squeamishness, or promote a few bilious stools, or perhaps may not move the patient at all. At the time of using this medicine the patients should live upon broth made of lean meat, gruel, or panada; but about the seventh or eighth day, they may be allowed bread and boiled chicken. Here the copper seems to do service by its tonic power; and for the same reason, alum, recommended by Dr Percival, most probably cures the disease. He says he has found this very efficacious in obstinate affections of the bowels, and that it generally proves a cure in the lighter cases of the colica pictonum. It was given to the quantity of fifteen grains every fourth, fifth, or sixth hour; and the third dose seldom failed to mitigate the pain, and sometimes entirely removed it. Among purgative medicines the *oleum ricini* is found to be the most efficacious. Mercury also, particularly under the form of calomel, has often been employed with success. And much benefit has been derived from combining the calomel with opium. From this combination there is often obtained, in the first instance, an alleviation of the pain, and afterwards a free discharge by the belly.\n\n**Sp. III. The Colic from Coffiveness.**\n\n*Colica stercorea*, Sauv. fp. 3.\n\n*Ileus a faecibus induratis*, Sauv. fp. 2.\n\nFor the treatment of this species, see above.\n\n**Sp. IV. The Accidental Colic.**\n\n*Colica Japonica*,—accidentalis,—laetentium,—à veneno, Sauv. fp. 10. 14. 18. 20.\n\n*Cholera ficca auriginosa*, à fungis venenatis, ejusfl. fp. 2.\n\nWhen colics arise from acid poisonous matter taken into the stomach, the only cure is either to evacuate the poison itself by vomiting, or to swallow some other substance which may decompose it, and thus render it inactive. The most common and dangerous substances of this kind are corrosive mercury and arsenic. The former is easily decomposed by alkaline salts; and therefore a solution of lixivial salt, if swallowed before the poison has time to induce a mortification of the bowels, will prove a certain cure. Much more uncertain, however, is the case when arsenic is swallowed, because there is no certain and speedy solvent of that substance yet known. Milk has been recommended as efficacious; and lately a solution of *hepar sulphuris*. The latter may possibly do service; as arsenic unites readily with sulphur, and has its pernicious qualities more obviated by that than by any other known substance; but indeed, even the solvent powers of this medicine are so weak, that its effects as well as those of others must be very uncertain.\n\nSome kinds of fungi, when swallowed, are apt to produce colics attended with stupor, delirium, and convulsions; and the same sometimes happens from eating a large\nlarge quantity of the shell-fish known by the name of mussels (the Mytilus). Some of the fungi, doubtless, may have an inherent poisonous quality; but generally they as well as the mussels act on a different principle. Their pernicious effects happen most commonly when they are taken on an empty stomach; and are then supposed to be occasioned by their adhering so close to its coats, that it cannot exert its powers, and the whole system is thrown into the utmost disorder. The malady may therefore be very easily prevented; but when once it has taken place, it cannot be removed till either vomiting be excited, or the stomach has recovered itself in such a manner as to throw off the adhering matter.\n\nSp. V. Colic of New-born Infants from a Retention of the Meconium. (Sauv. sp. 19.)\n\nThis disorder would be prevented were children allowed immediately to suck their mothers, whose milk at first is purgative. But as this is not commonly done, the child is frequently troubled with colics. These, however, may be removed by a few grains of ipecacuanha, or a drop or two of antimonial wine. By these means the stomach is cleaned by vomiting, and the belly is generally loosed; but if this last effect does not happen, some gentle purge will be necessary.\n\nSp. VI. Colic from a Callosity of the Colon.\n\nIt is often impossible to discover this distemper before the patient's death; and though it should, it does not admit of a cure.\n\nSp. VII. The Colic from Intestinal Calculi. (Sauv. sp. 10. 15.)\n\nWhen certain indigestible bodies, such as cherry-stones, plum-stones, small pieces of bones, &c. are swallowed, they frequently prove the basis of calculi, formed by an accretion of some kind of earthy matter; and being detained in some of the flexures of the intestines, often occasion very violent colics. These calculi do not discover themselves by any peculiar symptoms, nor do they admit of any particular method of cure. In the Medical Essays we have an instance of colics for five years, occasioned by calculi of this kind. The concretions were at last passed by stool; and their passage was procured by causing the patient drink a large quantity of warm water, with a view to promote the evacuation of bile, a redundancy of which was supposed to be the cause of her disorder.\n\nGenus LX. CHOLERA, the Cholera Morbus.\n\nCholera, Sauv. 253. Lin. 186. Vog. 110. Sag. 188. Hoffm. II. 165.\nDiarrhoea cholérica, Junck. 112.\n\nSp. I. The Spontaneous Cholera, coming on without any manifest cause.\n\nCholera spontanea, Sauv. sp. 1. Sydenh. lect. iv. cap. 2.\nCholera Indica, Sauv. sp. 7.\n\nSp. II. The Accidental Cholera, from acrid matter taken inwardly.\n\nCholera crapulosa, Sauv. sp. 11.\nCholera à venenis, Sauv. sp. 4. 5.\n\nThe cholera shows itself by excessive vomiting and purging of bilious matters, with violent pain, irritation and diffusion of the belly. Sometimes the patients fall into universal convulsions; and sometimes they are affected with violent spasms in particular parts of the body. There is a great thirst, a small and unequal pulse, cold sweats, fainting, coldness of the extremities, and hiccup; and death frequently ensues in 24 hours.\n\nIn this disease, as a great quantity of bile is deposited in the alimentary canal, particularly in the stomach, the first object is to counteract its influence, and to promote an easy discharge of it. It is next necessary to restrain that increased secretion of bile, by which a fresh deposition in the alimentary canal would otherwise be soon produced. And, in the last place, measures must often be employed to restore a sound condition to the alimentary canal, which is frequently much weakened by the violence of the disease.\n\nOn these grounds, the cure of this distemper is effected by giving the patient a large quantity of warm water, or very weak broth, in order to cleanse the stomach of the irritating matter which occasions the disease, and injecting the same by way of clyster, till the pains begin to abate a little. After this, a large dose of laudanum is to be given in some convenient vehicle, and repeated as there is occasion. But if the vomiting and purging have continued for a long time before the physician be called, immediate recourse must be had to the laudanum, because the patient will be too much exhausted to bear any further evacuations. Sometimes the propensity to vomit is so strong, that nothing will be retained, and the laudanum itself thrown up as soon as swallowed. To settle the stomach in these cases, Dr Douglas, in the Medical Essays, recommends a decoction of oat-bread toasted as brown as coffee; and the decoction itself ought to be of the colour of weak coffee. He says he does not remember that this decoction was ever vomited by any of his patients. An infusion of mint-leaves or good simple mint-water is also said to be very efficacious in the same case.\n\nThe tincture of opium is sometimes retained when given in conjunction with a portion of the sulphuric acid properly diluted. But when it cannot be retained in a fluid form by the aid of any addition, it will sometimes sit upon the stomach when taken in a solid state.\n\nAfter the violence of the disease is overcome, the alimentary canal, and the stomach in particular, requires to be braced and strengthened. With this view recourse is often had with advantage to different vegetable bitters, particularly to the use of the colombo root; which, while it strengthens the stomach, is also observed to have a remarkable tendency in allaying a disposition to vomiting, which often remains for a considerable time after the cholera may be said to be overcome.\nGENUS LXI.

The Feculent Diarrhoea.\n\nDiarrhoea stercorosa et vulgaris, Sauv. sp. 1. 2.\n\nThis is occasioned by too great a quantity of matter thrown into the alimentary canal; and what is discharged has not the appearance of excrements, but is much whiter, and of a thinner consistence. Voracious people who do not sufficiently chew their food, gormandizers, and even those who stammer in their speech, are said to be liable to this disease. In slighter cases it is removed without any medicine, or by a dose of rhubarb; but where the matters have acquired a putrid taint, the disorder may be much protracted and become dangerous. In this case lenient and antifeptic purgatives are to be made use of, after which the cure is to be completed by astringents.\n\nSp. II. The Bilious Diarrhoea.\n\n(Sauv. sp. 8.)\n\nThis distemper shows itself by copious stools of a very yellow colour, attended with gripes and heat of the bowels, thirst, bitterness, and dryness of the mouth, yellowness of the tongue, and frequently follows an intermitting or bilious fever. When the fever is gone, the diarrhoea is to be removed by acidulated and cooling drinks, with small doses of nitre.\n\nSp. III. The Mucous Diarrhoea.\n\nDiarrhoea lactentium, Sauv. sp. 19.\nDysenteria Pariflava, Sauv. sp. 3.\nDiarrhoea ab hypercatharisi, Sauv. sp. 16.\nDysenteria a catharticis, Sauv. sp. 12.\nPituitaria, Vog. 111.\nLeucorrhoeis, Vog. 117.\nDiarrhoea pituitola, Sauv. sp. 4.\nCeliaca mucosa, Sauv. sp. 3.\nDiarrhoea feroa, Sauv. sp. 10.\na. Diarrhoea urinosa.\n\nThis kind of diarrhoea, besides the matters usually excreted, is attended with a copious dejection of the mucus of the intestines with great pain; while the patient daily pines away, but without any fever.—Persons of all ages are liable to it, and it comes on usually in the winter-time; but is so obstinate, that it will sometimes continue for years. In obstinate loosenesses of this kind, vomits frequently repeated are of the greatest service. It is also very beneficial to keep the body warm, and rub the belly with stimulating ointments; at the same time that astringent clysters, rhubarb, and stomachic medicines, are to be exhibited. Starch clysters are very often efficacious.—Some kinds of loosenesses are contagious; and Sir John Pringle mentions a solder who laboured under an obstinate diarrhoea, who infected all those that used the same privy with himself. In the loosenesses which frequently followed a dysentery, the same author tells us that he began the cure with giving a vomit of ipé-cacuana, after which he put the patients on a course of astringents. He used a mixture of three drachms of extract of logwood, dissolved in an ounce and a half of spirit of cinnamon, to which was added seven ounces of common water, and two drachms of tincture of catechu. Of this the patient took two spoonfuls once in four or five hours, and sometimes also an opiate at bedtime. He recommends the same medicine in obstinate diarrhoeas of all kinds. A decoction of simaruba bark was also found effectual, when the dysenteric symptoms had gone off. Dr Huck, who used this article in North-America, also recommends it in diarrhoeas. Two or three ounces of the simaruba are to be boiled in a pound and a half of water to a pound, and the whole quantity taken throughout the day. He began with the weakest decoction; and, when the stomach of the patient could easily bear it, he then ordered the strongest; but at the same time he acknowledges, that, unless the sick found themselves sensibly better within three days from the time they began the medicine, they seldom afterwards received any benefit from it. But when all astringents have failed, Sir John Pringle informs us, he hath known a cure effected by a milk and farinaceous diet; and he thinks in all cases the disorder would be much more easily removed, if the patients could be prevailed on to abstain entirely from spirituous liquors and animal-food. If the milk by itself should turn sour on the stomach, a third part of lime-water may be added. In one case he found a patient receive more benefit from good butter-milk than from sweet-milk. The chief drinks are decoctions of barley, rice, calcined hartshorn, toast and water, or milk and water.\n\nSp. IV. The Coeliac Passion.\n\nCoelica chylota, Sauv. sp. 1.\nCoelica lactea, Sauv. sp. 4.\n\nThere are very great differences among physicians concerning the nature of this disease. Sauvages says, from Arretus, it is a chronic flux, in which the aliment is discharged half digested. It is attended with great pains of the stomach, resembling the pricking of pins; rumbling and flatus in the intestines; white stools, because deprived of bile, while the patient becomes weak and lean. The disease is tedious, periodical, and difficult to be cured. Sauvages adds, that none of the moderns seem to have observed the disease properly; that the excrements indeed are white, on account of a deficiency of the bile, but the belly is bound as in the jaundice. Dr Cullen says there is a dejection of a milky liquid of the nature of chyle; but this is treated by Vogel as a vulgar error. He accuses the moderns of copying from Arretus, who mentions white faeces as a symptom of the distemper; from whence authors have readily fallen into the notion that they never appeared of any other colour in persons.\nSp. II. DIABETES with insipid Urine.\n\nM. Lister Exerc. Medicin. II. de Diabete.\nDiabetes legitimus, Sauv. sp. 1. Aretaeus de Morb. diurnum lib. ii. cap. 2.\nDiabetes ex vino, Sauv. sp. 5. Ephem. Germ. D. I.\nA. II. Observ. 122.\n\nDescription. The diabetes first shows itself by a dryness of the mouth and thirst, white frothy spittle, and the urine in somewhat larger quantity than usual. A heat begins to be perceived in the bowels, which at first is a little pungent, and gradually increases. The thirst continues to augment by degrees, and the patient gradually loses the power of retaining his urine for any length of time. It is remarkable, that though the patients drink much, the quantity of urine always exceeds what is drank. In Dr Home's Clinical Experiments we have an account of two patients labouring under this disease: one of them drank between 10 and 12 English pints a-day without being satisfied. The quantity was greater in the forenoon than in the afternoon. In the other the case was reversed. He drank about four pints a-day, and more in the afternoon than the forenoon. The former discharged from 12 to 15 pints of urine in the day; the latter, 11 or 12; so that his urine always exceeded his drink by eight or at least seven pints. When the urine is retained a little while, there is a swelling of the loins, feet, and scrotum; in this disease the strength gradually decays; the skin is dry and shrivelled; oedematous swellings arise in various parts of the body, but afterwards subside without relieving the disease in the least; and the patient is frequently carried off by convulsions.\n\nThe most singular phenomenon in this disease is, that the urine seems to be entirely or very much deprived of an animal nature, and to be largely impregnated with a saccharine matter scarcely distinguishable from that obtained from the sugar-cane. This discovery was first made by Dr Dobson of Liverpool, who made some experiments on the urine of a person labouring under a diabetes, who discharged 28 pints of urine every day, taking during the same time from 12 to 14 pounds of solid and liquid food. Some of this urine being set aside, fell into a spontaneous effervescence, changed first into a vinous liquor, and afterwards into an acetous one, before it became putrid and offensive. Eight ounces of blood taken from the same patient, separated into albumen and serum; the latter being sweet to the taste, but less so than the urine. Two quarts of the urine, evaporated to dryness, left a white cake weighing four ounces two drams and two scruples. This cake was granulated, and broke easily between the fingers: it smelled sweet like brown sugar; neither could it by the taste be distinguished from sugar, except that it left a slight sense of coolness on the tongue. The experiment was repeated after the patient was recovered to such a degree as to pass only 14 pints of urine a-day. There was now a strong winous smell during the evaporation; and the residuum could not be procured in a solid form, but was blackish, and much resembled very thick treacle. In Dr Home's patients, the serum of the blood had no supernatural sweetness; in one of them the albumen was\n"}
