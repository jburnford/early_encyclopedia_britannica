It is very unequal both in length and breadth; the former being in some places above 90 miles, in others not half so much; and the latter in some places 45, in others hardly 25. The air here is very temperate; and the soil fruitful in corn, wine, wood, and pasture. Here also are mines of lead and iron, pits of coal, quarries of marble and stone, and some celebrated mineral waters, as those of Spa and Chau-fontaine. The principal rivers are, the Maes and Sambre. The manufactures and commodities of the country are chiefly beer, arms, nails, ferge, leather, with the products we have just mentioned. The states of the bishopric are composed of three bodies: the first is the chapter of Liege; the second, the nobility of the country; and the third, the deputies of the capital and the other towns. The three estates are seldom called together, except to raise taxes for the service of the province, or upon some particular emergency; but there is a committee of the estates, who meet thrice a week, and in time of war daily. They are always about the prince-bishop, to make remonstrances, and demand the redress of grievances. The bishop is spiritual and temporal lord of the whole country; but, as bishop, is suffragan to the archbishop of Cologne. He styles himself, by the grace of God, bishop and prince of Liege, duke of Bouillon, marquis of Franchimont, count of Loos, Hoorn, &c. His arms for Liege are, a pillar argent, on a pedeal of the same, with a crown or, in a field ruby. In the municipal he was formerly rated at 50 horse and 170 foot; or 1280 florins monthly, in lieu of them, but now only at 826. An abatement of one-third has also been granted of the ancient assentment to the chamber-court, which was 360 rix-dollars 6½ kruiters for each term. Here are several colleges which fit at Liege, for the government of the country, and the decision of causes, civil, criminal, spiritual, and feudal, and of such also as relate to the finances. The chapter consists of 62 persons, who must either prove their nobility for four generations, both by father and mother, before they can be admitted; or if they cannot do that, must at least have been doctors or licentiates of divinity for seven years, or, of law, for five years, in some famous university. The bishopric is very populous and extensive, containing 1500 parishes, in which are 24 walled towns, besides others, 52 baronies, besides counties and seigniories, 17 abbeys for men, who must be all gentlemen, and 11 for ladies, exclusive of others.\n\nLiege, the capital of the bishopric of the same name, stands upon the Maes, in a fine valley, surrounded with woods and hills, being a free imperial city, and one of the largest and most eminent in Europe. Though it is 100 miles from the sea by water, the Maes is navigable up to it. The city has 16 gates; 17 bridges, some of them very handsome; 154 streets, many of them straight and broad; a fine episcopal palace; a very large flatly cathedral, in which, besides five great silver coffers full of relics, are several silver statues of saints, and a St George on horseback of maffy gold, presented to the cathedral by Charles the Bold, by way of atonement for using the inhabitants cruelly in the year 1468. Of the other churches, that of St Paul is the most remarkable, both for its structure and fine ornaments in painting and marble. The city is well fortified, and there are also two castles on the mountain of the Holy Walburg for its defence. Besides a great number of other convents of both sexes, here is a college of English Jesuits, founded in the year 1616, and a fine nunnery of English ladies. Indeed, churches, convents, and other religious foundations, take up the greater part of it. The reader, therefore, no doubt, will take it for granted, that it is a most blest, holy, and happy city. But however it may fare with the profane, unhallowed laity, it is certainly the paradise of priests, as it is expressly called, by way of eminence. It is divided into the old and new, or the upper and lower; and the latter again into the island, and the quarter beyond the Maes. The houses are high, and built of bluish marble. In the town and suburbs are 12 public places or squares, 10 hospitals, a beguin-houfe, and two fine quays, planted with several rows of trees, for the burghers to take the air; but a great part of that within the walls is taken up with orchards and vineyards. The manufactures of this city are arms, nails, leather, ferge, and beer. In St William's convent, without the city, is the tomb of the famous English traveller Sir John Mandeville, with an inscription in barbarous French, requesting those who read it to pray for his soul. Near it are kept the saddle, spurs, and knife, that he made use of in his travels.\nAfter having seen most of the cities of any note in the world, he made choice of this to spend the eve of his life in. A little way from the city, on the other side of the Maas, stands the episcopal palace of Seraing, in which the bishops generally reside during the summer. The latitude of this city is 50° 36' N. and the longitude 5° 40' E.\n\nSome disturbances took place here in the year 1789, in consequence of certain disputes that had arisen between the prince-bishop and the inhabitants. The latter having demanded certain privileges, which he did not think proper to grant, they took up arms, and compelled him and his chapter to comply with their request. The prince, together with many of the clergy, nobility, and citizens, alarmed by this commotion, and dreading the consequences of popular fury, which when once roused seldom knows any bounds, sought safety by voluntary exile. They then appealed to the imperial chamber; and this tribunal, instead of acting the part of arbiter, decided as a sovereign, and ordered the circles of the Lower Rhine and Westphalia to execute the sentence.\n\nThe king of Prussia, at whose court one of the chiefs of the insurrection had resided, and who wished to gain a party at Liege, became mediator; and seemed to favour the Liegois, many of whose claims were just, though they attempted to enforce them by violence and the most illegal steps. Intoxicated with this protection, the people of Liege treated the remonstrances of their bishop, the decrees of the imperial chamber, and the resolutions of the directory of the two circles, with the utmost contempt; and proceeded so far as even to dethrone their prince, by appointing a regent in the person of a French prelate. The electoral college having deliberated on the best means of putting an end to these disturbances, its propositions, though modified by M. Dohm the Prussian plenipotentiary, made the insurgents break out into open sedition. Deceived by their leaders, they gave themselves up every day to new excesses; the effects of the citizens were exposed to pillage, and their persons to insult. The king of Prussia, who was desirous to bring matters to an accommodation, and not to instigate the Liegois to become independent, finding that the efforts of his minister were not attended with the desired success, seemed unwilling to interfere any farther in an affair which might have led him into a quarrel with the empire. The executive troops, at the same time, remained almost in a state of inactivity; and seemed rather to guard the frontiers of this petty state, than to make any attempt to reduce it to obedience. Neither this conduct, however, nor the exhortations of Prussia, added to the moral certainty of their being soon compelled to lay down their arms, made any change in the conduct of the malecontents. They declared openly, in the face of all Europe, that they would either conquer or die; and they persisted in this resolution, while commerce, manufactures, and the public revenues, were going daily to decay.\n\nHaving at length openly attacked the executive forces without the territories of their city, the emperor could no longer remain an indifferent spectator. It was now full time to put a period to that madness to which the people had abandoned themselves; and to accomplish this in an effectual manner, the imperial chamber at Wetzlar requested the emperor, as a member of the ancient circle of Burgundy, to execute its orders respecting this object. In consequence of this measure, Baron Alvinzi, who commanded a body of Austrians cantoned in Limburg and the confines of Brabant, notified, by order of Marshal Bender, to the states and municipality of Liege, that the emperor intended to send troops into their city and territories, for the purpose of restoring tranquillity and good order. The states had already been informed of this resolution by their agent at Wetzlar. They therefore wrote to Marshal Bender, to assure him of the respectful confidence which they placed in the justice and magnanimity of the emperor, and to request that the Austrian troops might enter alone, without those of the electors; and that they might be confined to occupy the gates and the suburbs only. To this letter, which was carried to Brussels by a deputation of the states, Marshal Bender returned a very satisfactory answer, relating to the disposition of the electoral troops; but Baron Alvinzi, in a note which he wrote to the states, insisted among other articles, that all the citizens should throw down their arms; that proper accommodations should be prepared for the officers and men; that the warlike stores, collected for making resistance, should be removed; and that cockades, and every other distinctive mark of the like kind, should be laid aside before the arrival of the imperial troops. However humiliating these preliminaries might be, especially that of a general disarming, the states and municipalities acquiesced without the least reserve; and their submission, as sudden as complete, was communicated to the people, with an exhortation to follow their example.\n\nNotwithstanding this pacific appearance, two days before the entrance of the imperial troops, the municipal council of Liege, flattering themselves, perhaps, with the hopes of assistance from Prussia, assured the inhabitants that they would remain unshaken in their post, and that they had sworn never to desert the cause in which they were engaged. This, however, did not prevent the Austrian troops, to the number of 6000, from penetrating, without opposition, into the heart of the city; where they occupied every post; made the citizens lay aside their arms, uniforms, and cockades; and in a single hour, dethroned so many sovereigns of a year. The greater part of the municipal officers, who two days before had solemnly promised such great things, betook themselves to flight, and retired either to France or Wefel; while the ancient magistracy, which had been expelled in the month of August 1789, was provisionally reinstated by the electoral commissioners.—The decrees of the imperial chamber at Wetzlar have since been executed in their utmost extent. The ancient magistracy and the privy council of the prince-bishop have been restored; and the prince himself having returned, peace and good order have been re-established. The French took this city in 1792, and effected another revolution; but being driven from it in 1793, the citizens were once more obliged to submit.\n\nLIENTERY, a flux of the belly, in which the alimentary discharges as they are swallowed, or very little altered either in colour or substance. See MEDICINE Index.\n\nLIEVENS.\nLIEVENS, JOHN or JAN, a celebrated painter, was born at Leyden in 1607. He discovered an early inclination for the arts, and was the disciple first of Joris van Schooten, and afterwards of Peter Laffman. He excelled principally in painting portraits; but he also executed several historical subjects with great success. He came over to England, where he resided three years, and painted the portraits of Charles I., the queen, the prince of Wales, and several of the nobility; after which he returned to Antwerp, where he met with full employment for his pencil. We have several etchings by this master, which are performed in a flight, but masterly manner. The chiaro scuro is very skillfully managed in them, so as to produce a most powerful effect. His style of etching bears some resemblance to that of Rembrandt; but it is coarser in general, and less finished.\n\nLIEOU-KIEOU, the name of certain islands of Asia, subject to China; but hitherto little known to geographers, who have been satisfied with marking their existence and latitude in their charts. They, however, form a powerful and extensive empire, the inhabitants of which are civilized, and ought not to be confounded with other savage nations dispersed throughout the islands of Asia. Father Gabil, a Jesuit, has furnished us with some interesting details respecting these islanders, which he extracted from a Chinese relation, published in 1721, at the end of a voyage that was undertaken on the following account. The emperor Kang-hi having resolved in 1719, to send an ambassador to the king of Lieou-kieou, chose for this purpose one of the great doctors of the empire, named Supao-Koang. This learned man departed from China in 1719, and returned to Peking in 1720, where, in the year following, he caused a relation of his voyage to be published in two volumes. It is in the first of these that he gives an accurate and particular description of the islands of Lieou-kieou; and what he relates appears to be worthy of the greatest credit, because, being on the spot, he examined, as he himself says, according to the orders of the emperor, whatever he found curious or interesting, respecting the number, situation, and productions of these islands; as also the history, religion, manners, and customs of the people who inhabit them.\n\nThese islands, situated between Corea, Formosa, and Japan, are in number 36. The principal and largest is called Lieou-kieou; the rest have each a particular denomination. The largest island extends from north to south almost 440 leagues, and 120 or 130 from east to west; but on the south side, the extent from east to west is not 100 leagues. The south-east part of the island, where the court resides, is called Cheou-li; and it is there that Kint-ching, the capital city, is situated. The king's palace, which is reckoned to be four leagues in circumference, is built on a neighbouring mountain. It has four gates, which correspond to the four cardinal points; and that which fronts the west forms the grand entry. The view which this palace commands is most extensive and delightful; it reaches as far as the port of Napa-kiang, at the distance of ten leagues, to the city of Kint-ching, and to a great number of other cities, towns, villages, palaces, temples, monasteries, gardens, pleasure houses. It stands in longitude 146° 26' east, and in latitude 26° 2' north.\n\nIf we believe these islanders, the origin of their empire is lost in the remotest antiquity. They reckon up 25 successive dynasties, the duration of which forms a period of more than 18,000 years. It would be useless to employ a single moment in pointing out the absurdity of these pretensions. It is, however, certain, that the existence of the country called Lieou-kieou was not known in China before the year 605 of the Christian era. It was in the course of that year, that one of the emperors of the dynasty of Soui, having heard of these isles, was desirous of knowing their situation. This prince at first sent some Chinese thither; but their expedition proved fruitless, as the want of interpreters prevented them from acquiring that knowledge which was the object of their voyage. They only brought some of the islanders with them to Sigan-fou, the capital of the province of Chen-fu, which was the usual residence of the emperors of the dynasty of S. It fortunately happened, that an ambassador of the king of Japan was then at court. This ambassador and his attendants immediately knew the strangers to be natives of Lieou-kieou; but they spoke of these isles as of a miserable and wretched country, the inhabitants of which had never been civilized. The emperor of China afterwards learned, that the principal island lay to the east of a city called at present Fou-tehou-fou, which is the capital of the province of Fo-kien; and that, in a passage of five days, one might reach the large island where the king kept his court.\n\nOn this information, the emperor Yang-ti sent skilful men, accompanied by interpreters, to summon the prince to do homage to the emperor of China, and to pay him tribute. This proposal was very ill received. The king of Lieou-kieou sent back the Chinese, telling them sternly, that he acknowledged no prince to be his superior. This answer irritated the emperor, who, to obtain revenge, caused a fleet to be immediately equipped in Fo-kien, in which he embarked 10,000 men. This fleet set sail, and arrived in safety at the port of Napa-kiang. The army, in spite of every effort made by the natives, landed on the island; and the king, who had put himself at the head of his troops to oppose the enemy, having fallen in battle, the Chinese pillaged, sacked, and burnt the royal city, made more than 5000 slaves, and returned to China.\n\nThe emperors of the dynasty of Tang, those of the short dynasties that followed, and those of the dynasty of Song, although they were fully informed of every thing respecting the Lieou-kieou isles, made no attempts to render them tributary. In 1291, Chi-tiou, emperor of the dynasty of Yuen, was desirous of reviving the pretensions of his predecessors. He fitted out a fleet to subdue these islands; but schemes of conquest had become disagreeable to the Chinese, since the difficulties that befell their army in an expedition against Japan. The fleet of Chi-tiou went no farther than the isles of Pong-hou, and the western coast of Formosa, from whence, under divers pretences, they returned to the ports of Fo-kien.\n\nIt was only in 1372, under the reign of Hong-vou, founder of the dynasty of Ming, that these islands submitted voluntarily to the Chinese government. Hong-vou had sent one of the grandees of his court to Tai-tou, who was then reigning at Lieou-kieou, to inform him\nhim of his accession to the throne. The Chinese nobleman had received particular instructions respecting this commission, and he acquitted himself of it with all the prudence and address of an able minister. In a private audience which he had with T'ay-tou, he exhorted this prince to declare himself a tributary of the empire, and laid before him the advantages he would derive from this step. His reasoning, supported by the power of his natural eloquence, made so much impression on the mind of T'ay-tou, that he embraced the proposal made him, and sent immediately to the emperor to demand the investiture of his states.\n\nHong-vou received his envoys in a magnificent manner, and loaded them with presents. He solemnly declared T'ay-tou a vassal of the empire; and, after having received his first tribute (which consisted in valuable horses, aromatic wood, sulphur, copper, tin, &c., he sent to this prince a golden seal, and confirmed the choice he had made of one of his sons for successor. The emperor afterwards sent 36 families, almost all from the province of Fo-kien to Lieou-kieou. T'ay-tou received them, assigned them lands near the port of Napa-kiang, and appointed certain revenues for their use, at the same time that Hong-vou made them considerable remittances. These families first introduced into Lieou-kieou the learned language of the Chinese, the use of their characters, and the ceremonies practiced in China in honour of Confucius. On the other hand, the sons of several of the grandees of the court of T'ay-tou were sent to Nan-king, to study Chinese in the imperial college, where they were treated with distinction, and maintained at the emperor's expenses.\n\nThe islands of Lieou-kieou had neither iron nor porcelain. Hong-vou supplied this want; he caused a great number of utensils of iron and instruments to be made, which he sent thither, together with a quantity of porcelain vessels. Commerce, navigation, and the arts soon began to flourish. These islanders learned to cast bells for their temples, to manufacture paper and the finest silks, and to make porcelain, with which they had been supplied before from Japan.\n\nThe celebrated revolution which placed the Tartars on the imperial throne of China, produced no change in the conduct of the kings of Lieou-kieou. Chang-teh, who was then reigning, sent ambassadors to acknowledge Chun-tchi, and received a seal from him, on which were engraven some Tartar characters. It was then settled, that the king of Lieou-kieou should pay his tribute only every two years, and that the number of persons in the train of his envoys should not exceed 150.\n\nThe emperor Kang-hi seemed to pay more attention to these isles than any of his predecessors. He caused a superb palace to be erected in honour of Confucius, and a college where he maintained masters to teach the sciences and the Chinese characters. He also instituted examinations for the different degrees of the literati. He ordained, that the king of Lieou-kieou should never send in tribute rose-wood, cloves, or any other production which was not really of the growth of the country; but that he should send a fixed quantity of sulphur, copper, tin, shells, and mother of pearl, which is remarkably pretty in these islands. He permitted, that, besides the usual tribute, he might present him horse-furniture, pistol-cases, and other things of the same kind, which these islanders are said to manufacture with great taste and neatness.\n\nIt is more than 900 years since the bronze of China introduced at Lieou-kieou the worship of Fo, and the principal books belonging to their feet. This worship is at present the established religion both of the grandees and of the people. There is still to be seen in the royal city a magnificent temple, erected in honour of another idol borrowed from the Chinese, named Tein-sye, which signifies celestial queen or lady.\n\nThese islanders do not make promises or swear before their idols. When they have occasion to do this, they burn perfumes, present fruits, and stand respectfully before some stone, which they call to witness the solemnity of their engagements. Numbers of stones are to be seen in the courts of their temples, in most public places, and upon their mountains, which are entirely appropriated to this purpose. They have also among them women consecrated for the worship of spirits, who are supposed to have great influence over these beings. They visit the sick, distribute medicines, and recite prayers for their recovery.\n\nThey respect the dead as much as the Chinese, and they are no less ceremonious in wearing mourning; but their funerals are neither so pompous, nor attended with so much expense. Their coffins, which are of an hexagonal or octagonal figure, are three or four feet high. They burn the flesh of the bodies of their dead, and preserve only the bones. They never offer provisions to them; they are contented with placing lamps round them, and burning perfumes.\n\nDifferent families are distinguished in Lieou-kieou by surnames, as in China; but a man and a woman of the same surname cannot be united in marriage. The king is not permitted to marry but in the three grand families, which always enjoy the highest offices. There is a fourth, of equal distinction to the three former; but neither the king nor the princes contract any alliances with this family; for it is doubtful whether it be not sprung from the same stem as the royal line.\n\nA plurality of wives is allowed in these isles. Young men and young women enjoy the liberty of seeing one another, and of conversing together; and their union is always in consequence of their own choice. The women are very reserved; they never use paint, and wear no pendants in their ears; they collect their hair on the top of their heads in the form of a curl, and fix it in that manner by means of long pins made of gold or silver.\n\nBesides the vast domains which the king possesses, he receives the produce of all the sulphur, copper, and tin mines, and of the salt pits, together with what arises from taxes. From these revenues he pays the salaries of the mandarins and officers of his court. These salaries are estimated at a certain number of sacks of rice; but under this name is comprehended whatever the king gives in grain, rice, silk, cloth, &c. The whole is valued according to the price of the sacks of rice.\n\nThere are here, as in China, nine orders of mandarins, who are distinguished by the colour of their caps, or by their girdles and cushions. The greater part of the titles of these mandarins are hereditary in their families; but there are some which are only bestowed upon merit. In the royal city there are tribunals estab-\nLieutenant, blithed for managing the revenue and affairs of the principal island, and of all the others which are dependent on it. The latter have agents, who reside at court. There are also particular tribunals for civil and criminal matters; for whatever concerns the families of the grandees and princes; for the affairs of religion; for inspecting the public granaries, king's revenues, duties; for commerce, manufactures, civil ceremonies, and for navigation, public edifices, literature, and war.\n\nThe vessels that are built in this country are greatly valued by the people of China and Japan. In these the natives go not only from one island to another, but also to China, Tong-king, Cochin-China, Korea, Nangaza-ki, Satsuma, the neighbouring isles, and to Formola, where they dispose of their different commodities. Besides those articles of commerce which their manufactures of silk, cotton, paper, arms, copper utensils, &c., furnish them, they also export mother-of-pearl, tortoise and other shells, coral and whetstones, which are in great request both in China and Japan.\n\nLIEUTAUD, Dr Joseph, counsellor of state and first physician at the court of France, was born at Aix in Provence, and resided principally there till he took the degree of doctor of medicine. After this he prosecuted his studies for some years at Montpelier. He returned to Aix, where he soon acquired extensive practice, and became eminent for literary abilities. He resided there till the year 1750, when he was invited to act as physician to the royal infirmary at Versailles. There he practised with such reputation and success, that he soon arrived at the head of his profession; and in the year 1774, upon the death of M. Senac, he was appointed archiater. His extensive engagements in practice did not prevent him from cultivating the science of medicine in all its branches, and from freely communicating to others the result of his own studies. He published many valuable works; among which the following may be considered the most remarkable. 1. Elementa Physiologica. 2. Precis de la Medicine. 3. Pratique Precis de la Matiere Medicale. 4. Effais Anatomiques. 5. Synopsis Universae Praeexae Medicine. 6. Historia Anatomico-Medica. He died at Versailles in 1780, aged 78 years.\n\nLIEUTENANT, an officer who supplies the place and discharges the office of a superior in his absence. Of these, some are civil, as the lords-lieutenants of kingdoms, and the lords-lieutenants of counties; and others are military, as the lieutenant-general, lieutenant-colonel, &c.\n\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland, is properly a viceroy; and has all the state and grandeur of a king of England, except being served upon the knee. He has the power of making war and peace, of bestowing all the offices under the government, of dubbing knights, and of pardoning all crimes except high treason; he also calls and prorogues the parliament, but no bill can pass without the royal assent. He is assisted in his government by a privy council; and, on his leaving the kingdom, he appoints the Lords of the regency, who govern in his absence.\n\nLords-Lieutenants of Counties, are officers, who upon any invasion or rebellion, have power to raise the militia, and to give commissions to colonels and other officers, to arm and form them into regiments, troops, and companies. Under the lords-lieutenants, are deputy-lieutenants, who have the same power; Lieutenant-these are chosen by the lords-lieutenants, out of the principal gentlemen of each county, and presented to the king for his approbation.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel. See Colonel.\n\nLieutenant-General. See General.\n\nLieutenant, in the land service, is the second commissioned officer in every company of both foot and horse, and next to the captain, and who takes the command upon the death or absence of the captain.\n\nLieutenant of Artillery. Each company of artillery hath four; 1 first and 3 second lieutenants. The first lieutenant hath the same detail of duty with the captain, because in his absence he commands the company: he is to see that the soldiers are clean and neat; that their clothes, arms, and accoutrements, are in good and serviceable order; and to watch over every thing else which may contribute to their health. He must give attention to their being taught the exercise, see them punctually paid, their messes regularly kept, and to visit them in the hospitals when sick. He must assist at all parades, &c. He ought to understand the doctrine of projectiles and the science of artillery, with the various effects of gunpowder, however managed or directed; to enable him to construct and dispose his batteries to the best advantage; to plant his cannon, mortars, and howitzers, so as to produce the greatest annoyance to an enemy. He is to be well skilled in the attack and defence of fortified places; and to be conversant in arithmetic, mathematics, mechanics, &c.\n\nSecond Lieutenant in the Artillery, is the same as an ensign in an infantry regiment, being the youngest commissioned officer in the company, and must assist the first lieutenant in the detail of the company's duty. His other qualifications should be equal with those of the first lieutenant.\n\nLieutenant of a Ship of War, the officer next in rank and power to the captain, in whose absence he is accordingly charged with the command of the ship, as also the execution of whatever orders he may have received from the commander relating to the king's service.\n\nThe lieutenant who commands the watch at sea, keeps a list of all the officers and men thereto belonging, in order to muster them when he judges it expedient, and report to the captain the names of those who are absent from their duty. During the night watch, he occasionally visits the lower decks, or sends thither a careful officer, to see that the proper sentinels are at their duty, and that there is no disorder amongst the men; no tobacco smoked between decks, nor any fire or candles burning there, except the lights which are in lanthorns, under the care of a proper watch, on particular occasions. He is expected to be always upon deck in his watch, as well to give the necessary orders with regard to trimming the sails and superintending the navigation, as to prevent any noise or confusion; but he is never to change the ship's course without the captain's directions, unless to avoid an immediate danger.\n\nThe lieutenant, in time of battle, is particularly to see that all the men are present at their quarters where they have been previously stationed according to the regulations made by the captain. He orders\nLieutenant, and exhorts them everywhere to perform their duty, Life, and acquaints the captain at all other times of the misbehaviour of any person in the ship, and of whatever else concerns the service or discipline.\n\nThe youngest lieutenant in the ship, who is also styled lieutenant at arms, besides his common duty, is particularly ordered, by his instructions, to train the seamen to the use of small arms, and frequently to exercise and discipline them therein. Accordingly his office, in time of battle, is chiefly to direct and attend them; and at all other times to have a due regard to the preservation of the small arms, that they be not lost or embezzled, and that they are kept clean and in good condition for service.\n\nLieutenant-Reformed, he whose company or troop is broke or disbanded, but continued in whole or half pay, and still preserves his right of seniority and rank in the army.\n\nLife, is peculiarly used to denote the animated state of living creatures, or the time that the union of their soul and body lasts.\n\nThe Prolongation of Life is made by Lord Bacon one of the three branches of medicine; the other two relating to the preservation of health, and the cure of diseases. See Medicine.\n\nThe theory of prolonging life he numbers among the defiderata. Some means or indications that seem to lead to it, he lays down as follow:\n\nThings are preserved in two manners; either in their identity, or by reparation. In their identity; as a fly or ant in amber; a flower, or fruit, or wood, in a conservatory of snow; a dead carcass in balsams. By reparation; as a flame, or a mechanical engine, &c. To attain to the prolongation of life, both these methods must be used. And hence, according to him, arise three intentions for the prolongation of life; Retardation of consumption, proper reparation, and renovation of what begins to grow old.\n\nConsumption is occasioned by two kinds of depredation; a depredation of the innate spirit, and a depredation of the ambient air. These may be each prevented two ways; either by rendering those agents less predatory, or by rendering the passive parts (viz. the juices of the body), less liable to be preyed on. The spirit will be rendered less predatory, if either its substance be condensed, as by the use of opiates, grief, &c.; or its quantity diminished, as in spare and monastic diets; or its motion calmed, as in idleness and tranquillity. The ambient air becomes less predatory, if it be either less heated by the rays of the sun, as in cold climates, in caves, mountains, and anchorets cells; or be kept off from the body, as by a dense skin, the feathers of birds, and the use of oils and unguents without aromatics. The juices of the body are rendered less liable to be preyed on, either by making them harder or more moist and oily; harder, as by a coarse sharp diet, living in the cold, robust exercises, and some mineral baths; moister, as by the use of sweet foods, &c. abstaining from salts and acids; and especially by such a mixture of drink as consists wholly of fine subtile particles, without any acrimony or acidity.\n\nReparation is performed by means of aliment; and alimentation is promoted four ways: By the concoction of the viscera, so as to extrude the aliment: By exciting the exterior parts to the attraction of the aliment; as in proper exercises and frictions, and some unctions Life-Boat, and baths; By the preparation of the food itself, so as it may more easily infuse itself, and in some measure anticipate the digestion; as in various ways of dressing meats, mixing druits, fermenting breads, and reducing the virtues of these three into one: By promoting the act of assimilation itself, as in reasonable sleep, some external application, &c.\n\nThe renovation of what begins to grow old, is performed two ways: By the intemperance of the habit of the body; as in the use of emollients, emplasters, unctious, &c. of such a nature, as do not extract but impreg: Or by purging off the old juices, and substituting fresh ones; as in reasonable evacuations, attenuating diets, &c.\n\nThe same author adds these three axioms: That the prolongation of life is to be expected, rather from some stated diets, than either from any ordinary regimen or any extraordinary medicines; more from operating on the spirits, and mollifying the parts, than from the manner of feeding; and this mollifying of the parts without is to be performed by substances, impriments, and occultants. See Longevity.\n\nLife-Boat, a most important invention, consisting in an improvement of the ordinary construction of a boat, by which it cannot be sunk in the roughest sea; so that it is peculiarly fitted for bringing off mariners from wrecks during a storm, and thus saving many valuable lives. The life-boat was first conceived at South Shields, in the county of Durham. A committee of the inhabitants of that town, who had often been the sad witnesses of many melancholy shipwrecks in which by the ordinary means no relief could be given, in a public advertisement requested information on this subject, with models of boats which would be most proper for the purpose of saving persons from shipwreck. The committee it would appear, employed Mr Greathead, a boat-builder in South Shields, who had with others presented the model of a boat for this purpose, to build the first boat, which upon trial was found fully to answer the purpose. Two claims have since appeared for the honour of the invention, which according to Mr Farles, the chairman of the committee, in his letter to Mr Hails the supporter of one claim, belongs to two of the members themselves, namely Mr Farles himself and Mr Rockwood. The claimants above alluded to are Mr Greathead, and a Mr Wouldhave a painter in South Shields, and a very ingenious man, who also presented a model to the committee. The claim of the latter is keenly supported by Mr Hails, in a pamphlet published in 1806, two years after Mr Greathead's pamphlet containing the history and progress of the invention, and of the boats which he had built for the purpose, his application to parliament, and the premium of £200, which he received for the invention, &c. and four years after this application to parliament. It is true that in 1802, Mr Wouldhave and his friends asserted his claim in the Monthly Magazine and in some provincial newspapers; but still this was one year after Mr Greathead's application for reward was made to parliament. But, without being at all understood to decide to whom the merit of the invention is due, we shall leave it to our readers to examine the evidence for themselves, and shall now proceed to give an account of the construction of the life-boat, of which 31 have been built by Mr\nLife-Boat. Mr Greathead, and sent to different parts of Britain, and the north of Europe. The following construction is according to Mr Greathead's plan:\n\n\"The length thirty feet; the breadth ten feet; the depth, from the top of the gunwale to the lower part of the keel in midships, three feet four inches; from the gunwale to the platform (within) two feet four inches; from the top of the stems (both ends being similar) to the bottom of the keel, five feet nine inches. The keel is a plank of three inches thick, of a proportionate breadth in midships, narrowing gradually toward the ends, to the breadth of the stems at the bottom, and forming a great convexity downward; the stems are segments of a circle with considerable rakes; the bottom section, to the floor heads, is a curve fore and aft with the sweep of the keel; the floor timber has a small rise curving from the keel to the floor heads; a bilge plank is wrought in on each side next the floor heads, with a double rabbit or groove of a similar thickness with the keel, and on the outside of this are fixed two bilge-trees corresponding nearly with the level of the keel; the ends of the bottom section form that fine kind of entrance observable in the lower part of the bow of the fishing boat called a coble, much used in the north; from this part to the top of the stem, it is more elliptical, forming a considerable projection; the sides from the floor heads to the top of the gunwale, launch off on each side, in proportion to about half the breadth of the floor; the breadth is continued far forward toward the ends, leaving a sufficient length of straight tide at the top; the sheer is regular along the straight tide, and more elevated toward the ends; the gunwale fixed on the outside is three inches thick; the sides, from the under part of the gunwale along the whole length of the regular sheer, extending twenty-one feet six inches, are cased with layers of cork, to the depth of 16 inches downward; and the thickness of this casing of cork being four inches, it projects at the top a little without the gunwale; the cork on the outside is secured with thin plates or slips of copper, and the boat is fastened with copper nails; the thwarts (or seats) are five in number, double banked, consequently the boat may be rowed with ten oars; the thwarts are firmly flanged; the side oars are short (a), with iron tholes, and rope grommets, so that the rower can pull either way. The boat is steered with an oar at each end; and the steering oar is one-third longer than the rowing oar; the platform placed at the bottom within the boat, is horizontal the length of the midships, and elevated at the ends, for the convenience of the steerman, to give him a greater power with the oar. The internal part of the boat next the sides, from the under part of the thwarts down to the platform, is cased with cork; the whole quantity of which, affixed to the life-boat, is nearly seven hundred weight; the cork indubitably contributes much to the buoyancy of the boat when full of water, is a good defence when going alongside a vessel, and is of principal use in keeping the boat in an erect position in the sea, or rather of giving her a very lively and quick ditposition to recover from any sudden cant or lurch which she may receive from the stroke of a heavy wave; but, exclusive of the cork, the admirable construction of this boat gives it a decided preeminence. The ends being similar, the boat can be rowed either way, and this peculiarity of form alleviates her in rising over the waves; the curvature of the keel and bottom facilitates her movement in turning, and contributes to the ease of the steerage, as a single stroke of the steering oar has an immediate effect, the boat moving as it were upon a centre; the fine entrance below is of use in dividing the waves, when rowing against them; and combined with the convexity of the bottom and the elliptical form of the stem, admits her to rise with wonderful buoyancy in a high sea, and to launch forward with rapidity, without tipping any water, when a common boat would be in danger of being filled. The launching or spreading form of the boat, from the floor heads to the gunwale, gives her a considerable bearing; and the continuation of the breadth well forward, is a great support to her in the sea; and it has been found by experience that boats of this construction are the best sea boats for rowing against the turbulent waves. The internal shallowness of the boat from the gunwale down to the platform, the convexity of the form, and the bulk of cork within, leave a very diminished space for the water to occupy; so that the life boat, when filled with water, contains a considerably less quantity than the common boat, and is in no danger either of sinking or overturning.\n\nIt may be presumed by some, that in cases of high wind, agitated sea, and broken waves, a boat of such a bulk could not prevail against them by the force of the oars; but the life-boat, from her peculiar form, may be rowed ahead, when the attempt in other boats would fail (b). Boats of the coromou form, adapted for speed, are of course put in motion with a small power; but for want of buoyancy and bearing, are overrun by the waves and sunk, when impelled against them; and boats constructed for burthen, meet with too much resistance from the wind and sea, when opposed to them, and cannot in such cases be rowed from the shore to a ship in distress. An idea has been entertained that the superior advantages of the life-boat are to be ascribed solely to the quantity of cork affixed; but this is a very erroneous opinion, and I trust has been amply refuted by the preceding observations on the construction of this boat. It must be admitted that the application of cork to common boats would add to their buoyancy and security; and it might be a useful expedient, if there was a quantity of cork on board of ships, to prepare the boats with, in cases of shipwreck, as it might be expeditiously done in a temporary way, by means of clamps, or some other contrivance. The application of cork to some of the boats of his majesty's ships (the launches) might be worthy of consideration, more particularly, as an experiment might be made at a little expense, and without injury to the boats.\n\n\"The life-boat is kept in a boat-house, and placed upon\n\n(a) The short oar is more manageable, in a high sea, than the long oar, and its stroke is more certain.\n\n(b) An extraordinary case might certainly happen, when a forcible combination of the wind, the waves, and the tide, might render it impracticable to row the life-boat from the shore.\nLife-Boat upon four low wheels, ready to be moved at a moment's notice. These wheels are convenient in conveying the boat along the shore to the sea; but if she had to travel upon them, on a rough road, her frame would be exceedingly shaken; besides, it has been found difficult and troublesome to replace her upon these wheels, on her return from sea.\n\nAnother plan has therefore been adopted: two wheels of 12 feet diameter, with a moveable arched axis, and a pole fixed thereto, for a lever, have been constructed. The boat is suspended, near her centre, between the wheels, under the axis; toward each extremity of which is an iron pin. When the pole is elevated perpendicularly, the upper part of the axis becomes depressed, and a pair of rope slings, which go round the boat, being fixed to the iron pins, is raised with the greatest facility, by means of the pole, which is then fastened down to the stem of the boat.\"\n\nTemporary Life-Boat,—an invention by the reverend Mr Bremner minister of Walls and Flota in Orkney, by which any ordinary ship's boat may be converted into a life-boat, so that in cases of shipwreck, the crew may be saved by means of their own boats. Mr Bremner states, in describing his plan to the Highland Society of Scotland, that it had received the approbation of the Trinity houses of London and Leith, of the Royal Humane Society of London, and of many captains of merchantmen. An experiment was made in the port of Leith under the superintendence of Mr Bremner himself, and in presence of a committee of the directors of the society. This experiment proved satisfactory to the committee, whose favourable report to the directors induced them to present Mr Bremner with a piece of plate in testimony of their approbation of his scheme. The following is a general description of the method of preparing a boat for this purpose.\n\nThe dimensions of the sloop's boat, with which the experiment was tried, were 14 feet in length, 5 feet 4 inches in width, and 2 feet 2 inches in depth. The only addition or previous preparation of the boat, was four ring bolts in the inside, and two auger bores or holes in the outside of the keel, as points of security for fixing the necessary seizing ropes (c). The ring bolts, within side the keel, were placed, the one forward, one-third from the stem, the other aft, one-third from the stern; the other two, the one directly at the stem, the other at the stern. The auger bores, outside the keel, being half way betwixt the rings, viz. the one betwixt the two rings forward, the other betwixt the two rings aft.\n\nTwo empty hogheads were then placed in the fore part of the boat, parallel and close to each other, and laid lengthways, fore and aft. These were secured in their places by palling the seizing ropes round all, that is, over the gunwales and through the auger bore in the keel, as also from the ring bolt in the stem to that next it in the keel, taking care in doing this, to pass the rope also through eyes on the slings of the casks, which had been previously prepared. The same process was observed in the after part of the boat. And lastly, a bar of iron about three hundred weight, was fixed to the keel, on the inside. A small quantity of cork was also placed in the stern, intended chiefly to raise to a proper height the casks placed above it, but without which the result of the experiment would have been the same.\n\nThe quantity of cork necessary, which will depend on the size of the boat, is to be made up into several parcels, but none larger than one person can easily manage. Each parcel to be properly secured and numbered, so as that the whole may fit and fill up the boat completely, in the spaces betwixt the ring bolts, fore and aft, as above described; and to answer the end, it is material that there should be cork enough to rise nearly three feet above the gunwales, so as to form an arch from gunwale to gunwale. The cork being thus laid in the boat, it is to be properly secured, first by palling a strong rope round all, over the gunwales, and through the auger bore, outside the keel; as also by palling seizing ropes from the ring bolt in the stem, to that next it in the keel, taking care to make as many turns and seizings betwixt these ring bolts, as completely to secure the cork from slipping out. The very same thing to be done as to the rope round the gunwales, and through the hole outside the keel, with seizing ropes from the ring bolts, to be made aft, or in the stern of the boat.\n\nWhere cork cannot be had, or may not be kept in readiness on account of its expense, which, however, is not very great, casks will answer the purpose, though it may be doubtful whether there would not be a greater chance that the fury of the waves might unloose them, unless particular care was taken to have them properly fixed. In the case of casks, two empty ones are to be placed in the fore part of the boat, parallel to one another, close together, and to be laid lengthwise fore and aft. Two other empty casks to be placed in the same way in the stern, or aft part of the boat, and the whole to be secured as firmly and compactly as possible, by strong ropes round the boat and casks, and also by seizing ropes in the same way as described in the case of cork; then two other empty casks, of the same dimensions, one fore, and another aft, to be placed over and in the middle between the two already fixed, and to be firmly secured, as above-mentioned.\n\nAs the boat is to be thus prepared on the deck of the ship, when danger appears, a piece of sail should be thrown in below, betwixt, and about the casks, for the more effectually securing them, and to prevent the seizing ropes from so readily slipping; it would be proper also to have slings on the casks, with eyes in them, through which to pass the seizing ropes.\n\nLastly, both in the case of cork and casks, an iron bar, of about three hundred weight, for such a boat as above described, should be secured to the keel on the inside, in the middle or empty space. This middle, or empty space of the boat, is for the sailors, and in a ship's boat of the common size may hold eight people, with room to work a pair of oars. Everything being previously\n\n(c) It is probable, that ring bolts fixed in the gunwales, might answer as well as palling the ropes round the bottom of the boat and through the auger bores in the keel.\npreviously ready, it is certain that the necessary fixing of the casks will not take up above ten or twelve minutes, and it is obvious the cork can be fixed in a much shorter period. It is also completely ascertained, that a boat so prepared, though full of water, will not sink, but on the contrary be extremely buoyant, and will easily go a-head: That it would be next to impossible the boat should overturn; but, in case of this at any time happening, she would instantly return to her proper position on her keel. Though the experiment was tried only with casks, with but a small quantity of cork, as before stated, yet it is generally believed, and Mr Bremner himself is of the same opinion, that it might answer equally well, and perhaps better, to have the cork or casks flowed in midships, leaving an empty space in each end, by which means the management of the boat by the helm or rudder would be preserved, though the other plan seems better, in the view of using oars.\n\nVegetable Life.

See Anatomy, No 7.\n\nLigarius, Quintus, a Roman proconsul in Africa, 49 B.C. Taking part with Pompey, he was forbidden by Julius Caesar to return to Rome: to obtain his pardon, Cicero made that admired oration in his defence, which has immortalized the memory of the client with that of his celebrated advocate.\n\nLigature, in Surgery, is a cord, band, or string; or the binding any part of the body with a cord, band, fillet, &c., whether of leather, linen, or any other matter.\n\nLigatures are used to extend or replace bones that are broken or dislocated; to tie the patients down in lithotomy and amputations; to tie upon the veins in phlebotomy, on the arteries in amputations, or in large wounds; to secure the splints that are applied to fractures; to tie up the processes of the peritoneum with the spermatic vessels in castration; and, lastly, in taking off warts or other excrescences by ligature.\n\nLigature, is also used to signify a kind of bandage or fillet, tied round the neck, arm, leg, or other part of the bodies of men or beasts, to divert or drive off some disease, accident, &c.\n\nLigature, is also used for a state of impotency, in respect to venery, pretended to be caused by some charm or witchcraft.\n\nKämpfer tells of an uncommon kind of ligature or knotting, in use among the people of Macaffir, Java, Malacca, Siam, &c. By this charm or spell, a man binds up a woman, and a woman a man, so as to put it out of their power to have to do with any other person; the man being thereby rendered impotent to any other woman, and all other men impotent with respect to the woman.\n\nSome of their philosophers pretend, that this ligature may be effected by the shutting of a lock, the drawing of a knot, or the sticking of a knife in the wall, at the point of time wherein the priest is joining a couple together; and that a ligature, thus effected, may be dissolved, by the spouse's urining through a ring. This piece of superstition is said to obtain also among the Christians of the East.\n\nThe same author tells us, that during the ceremony of marriage in Russia, he observed an old fellow lurking behind the church-door, and mumbling over a string of words; and, at the same time, cutting a long rod, which he held under his arm into pieces; which, it seems, is a common practice at the marriages of great persons, and done with design to elude and counterwork any other person that might possibly be inducing the ligature.\n\nThe secret of inducing a ligature is delivered by the same author, as he was taught it on the spot by one of their adepts: but it is too absurd and obscene to deserve being transcribed here.\n\nM. Martial mentions a ridiculous form of ligature, which he received from a brahmin of Indostan: \"If (says he) the little worm in the wood lukerrara kara be cut into two, and the one part stirs and the other not, if the stirring part be bruised, and given with half a beetle to a man, and the other half to a woman, the charm will keep each from ever having to do with any other person.\" Phil. Trans. No 268.\n\nLigature, in the Italian music, signifies a tying or binding together of notes. Hence syncopes are often called ligatures, because they are made by the ligature of many notes. There is another sort of ligatures for breves, when there are many of these on different lines, or on different spaces, to be sung to one syllable.\n\nLigatures, among printers, are types consisting of two letters or characters joined together; as Θ, ψ, Φ, β, f. The old editions of Greek authors are extremely full of ligatures; the ligatures of Stephens are by much the most beautiful. Some editions have been lately printed without any ligatures at all; and there was a design to explode them quite out of printing. Had this succeeded, the finest ancient editions would in time have grown useless: and the reading of old manuscripts would have been rendered almost impracticable to the learned themselves.\n\nLight, in the most common acceptation of the word, signifies that invisible etherial matter which makes objects perceptible to our senses of seeing. Figuratively, it is also used for whatever conveys instruction to our minds, and likewise for that instruction itself.\n\nFor an account of the chemical properties of light, see Chemistry Index; and for its physical properties, see Optics.\n\nLight independent of Heat. In general, a very considerable degree of heat is requisite to the emission of light from any body; but there are several exceptions to this, especially in light proceeding from putrefied substances and phosphorus, together with that of luminous animals, and other similar appearances. Light proceeding from putrefied animal and vegetable substances, as well as from glow-worms, is mentioned by Aristotle. Thomas Bartholin mentions four kinds of luminous insects, two with wings, and two without; but in hot climates travellers say they are found in much greater numbers, and of different species.\nColumna, an industrious naturalist, observes, that their light is not extinguished immediately upon the death of the animal.\n\nThe first distinct account that we meet with of light proceeding from putrefied animal flesh is that which De Visonne, given by Fabricius ab Aquapendente; who says, that when three Roman youths, residing at Padua, had bought a lamb, and had eaten part of it on Easter day 1562, several pieces of the remainder, which they kept till the day following, shone like so many candles when they were casually viewed in the dark. Part of this luminous flesh was immediately sent to Aquapendente, who was professor of anatomy in that city. He observed, that both the lean and the fat of this meat shone with a whitish kind of light; and also took notice, that some pieces of kid's flesh, which had happened to have lain in contact with it, were luminous, as well as the fingers and other parts of the bodies of those persons who touched it. Those parts, he observed, shone the most which were soft to the touch, and seemed to be transparent in candlelight; but where the flesh was thick and solid, or where a bone was near the outside, it did not shine.\n\nAfter this appearance, we find no account of any other similar to it, before that which was observed by Bartholin, and of which he gives a very pompous description in his ingenious treatise already quoted. This happened at Montpelier in 1641, when a poor old woman had bought a piece of flesh in the market, intending to make use of it the day following. But happening not to be able to sleep well that night, and her bed and pantry being in the same room, she observed so much light come from the flesh, as to illuminate all the place where it hung. A part of this luminous flesh was carried as a curiosity to Henry Bourbon, duke of Condé, the governor of the place, who viewed it for several hours with the greatest astonishment.\n\nThis light was observed to be whitish; and not to cover the whole surface of the flesh, but certain parts only, as if gems of unequal splendour had been scattered over it. This flesh was kept till it began to putrefy, when the light vanished; which, as some religious people fancied, it did in the form of a cross.\n\nIt is natural to expect, that the almost universal experimental philosopher Mr Boyle should try the effect of his air-pump upon these luminous substances. Accordingly, we find that he did not fail to do it; when he presently found that the light of rotten wood was extinguished in vacuo, and revived again on the admission of the air, even after a long continuance in vacuo; but the extinguishing of this light was not so complete immediately upon exhausting the receiver, as some little time afterwards. He could not perceive, however, that the light of rotten wood was increased in condensed air; but this, he imagined, might arise from his not being able to judge very well of the degree of light, through so thick and cloudy a glass vessel as he then made use of; but we find that the light of a shining fish, which was put into a condensing engine before the Royal Society, in 1668, was rendered more vivid by that means. The principal of Mr Boyle's experiments were made in October 1667.\n\nThis philosopher attended to a great variety of circumstances relating to this curious phenomenon. Among other things he observed, that change of air was not necessary to the maintenance of this light; for it continued a long time when a piece of the wood was put into a very small glass hermetically sealed, and it made no difference when this tube which contained the wood was put into an exhausted receiver. This he also observed with respect to a luminous fish, which he put into water, and placed in the same circumstances. He also found, that the light of shining fishes had other properties in common with that of shining wood; but the latter, he says, was presently quenched with water, spirit of wine, a greater variety of saline mixtures, and other fluids. Water, however, did not quench all the light of some shining veal on which he tried it, though spirit of wine destroyed its virtue presently.\n\nMr Boyle's observation of light proceeding from flesh meat was quite casual. On the 13th of February 1662, one of his servants was greatly alarmed with the shining of some veal, which had been kept a few days, but had no bad smell, and was in a state very proper for use. The servant immediately made his master acquainted with this extraordinary appearance; and though he was then in bed, he ordered it to be immediately brought to him, and he examined it with the greatest attention. Suspecting that the state of the atmosphere had some share in the production of this phenomenon, he takes notice, after describing the appearance, that the wind was south-west and blustering, the air hot for the season, the moon was past its last quarter, and the mercury in the barometer was at 29½ inches.\n\nMr Boyle was often disappointed in his experiments on shining fishes; finding that they did not always shine, shine in the very same circumstances, as far as he could judge, with others which had shined before. At one time that they failed to shine, according to his expectations, he observed that the weather was variable, and not without some days of frost and snow. In general he made use of whitings, finding them the fittest for his purpose. In a discourse, however, upon this subject at the Royal Society in 1681, it was asserted, that, of all fishy substances, the eggs of lobsters, after they had been boiled, shone the brightest. Olig. Jacobus observes, that, upon opening a sea-polypus, it was so luminous as to startle several persons who saw it; and he says, that the more putrid the fish was, the more luminous it grew. The nails also, and the fingers of the persons who touched it, became luminous; and the black liquor which issued from the animal, and which is its bile, shone also, but with a very faint light.\n\nMr Boyle draws a minute comparison between the light of burning coals and that of shining wood or fish, showing in what particulars they agree, and in what they differ. Among other things he observes, that extreme cold extinguishes the light of shining wood, as appeared when a piece of it was put into a glass tube, and held in a frigorific mixture. He also found that rotten wood did not waste itself by shining, and that the application of a thermometer to it did not discover the least degree of heat.\n\nThere is a remarkable shell-fish called Pholas, which forms for itself holes in various kinds of stone, &c., las, a remarkably That this fish is luminous, was noticed by Pliny; who luminous observes, &c.\nLight. observes, that it shines in the mouth of the person who eats it, and, if it touch his hands or clothes, makes them luminous. He also says that the light depends upon its moisture. The light of this fish has furnished matter for various observations and experiments to M. Reaumur, and the Bolognian academicians, especially Beccarius, who took so much pains with the subject of phosphorescent light.\n\nM. Reaumur observes, that, whereas other fishes give light when they tend to putrefaction, this is more luminous in proportion to its being fresh; and that when they are dried, their light will revive if they be moistened either with fresh or salt water, but that brandy immediately extinguishes it. He endeavoured to make this light permanent, but none of his schemes succeeded.\n\nThe attention of the Bolognian academicians was engaged to this subject by M. F. Marfilius, in 1724, who brought a number of these fishes, and the stones in which they were enclosed, to Bologna, on purpose for their examination.\n\nBeccarius observed, that though this fish ceased to shine when it became putrid; yet that in its most putrid state, it would shine, and make the water in which it was immersed luminous, when it was agitated. Galeatus and Montius found, that wine or vinegar extinguished this light; that in common oil it continued some days; but in rectified spirit of wine or urine, hardly a minute.\n\nIn order to observe in what manner this light was affected by different degrees of heat, they made use of a Reaumur's thermometer, and found that water rendered luminous by these fishes increased in light till the heat arrived to 45 degrees; but that it then became suddenly extinct, and could not be revived.\n\nIn the experiments of Beccarius, a solution of sea salt increased the light of the luminous water; a solution of nitre did not increase it quite so much. Sal ammoniac diminished it a little, oil of tartar per deliquium nearly extinguished it, and the acids entirely. This water poured upon fresh calcined gypsum, rock crystal, cerule, or sugar, became more luminous. He also tried the effects of it when poured upon various other substances, but there was nothing very remarkable in them. Afterwards, using luminous milk, he found that oil of vitriol extinguished the light, but that oil of tartar increased it.\n\nThis gentleman had the curiosity to try how differently coloured substances were affected by this kind of light; and having, for this purpose, dipped several ribbons in it, the white came out the brightest, next to this was the yellow, and then the green; the other colours could hardly be perceived. It was not, however, any particular colour, but only light that was perceived in this case. He then dipped boards painted with the different colours, and also glass tubes, filled with substances of different colours, in water rendered luminous by the fishes. In both these cases the red was hardly visible, the yellow was the brightest, and the violet the dullest. But on the boards the blue was nearly equal to the yellow, and the green more languid; whereas in the glasses, the blue was inferior to the green.\n\nOf all the liquors into which he put the pholas, milk was rendered the most luminous. A single pholas made seven ounces of milk so luminous, that the faces of persons might be distinguished by it, and it looked as if it was transparent.\n\nAir appeared to be necessary to this light; for when Beccarius put the luminous milk into glass tubes, no agitation would make it shine, unless bubbles of air were mixed with it. Also Montius and Galeatus found, that, in an exhausted receiver, the pholas lost its light, but the water was sometimes made more luminous; which they ascribed to the rising of bubbles of air through it.\n\nBeccarius, as well as Reaumur, had many schemes to render the light of these pholases permanent. For this purpose he kneaded the juice into a kind of paste, with flour, and found that it would give light when it was immersed in warm water; but it answered best to preserve the fish in honey. In any other method of preservation, the property of becoming luminous would not continue longer than six months, but in honey it had lasted above a year; and then it would, when plunged in warm water, give as much light as ever it had done.\n\nSimilar, in some respects, to those observations on Asla Cerfa the light of the pholas, was that which was observed renfa, to proceed from wood which was moist, but not in a p. 485 putrid state, which was very conspicuous in the dark.\n\nThat the sea is sometimes luminous, especially when light from it is put in motion by the dashing of oars or the sea water-beating of it against a ship, has been observed with admiration by a great number of persons. Mr Boyle, after reciting all the circumstances of this appearance, as far as he could collect them from the accounts of navigators; as its being extended as far as the eye could reach, and at other times being visible only when the water was dashed against some other body; that, in some seas, this phenomenon is accompanied by some particular winds, but not in others; and that sometimes one part of the sea will be luminous, when another part, not far from it, will not be so; concludes with saying, that he could not help suspecting that these odd phenomena, belonging to great masses of water, were in some measure owing to some cosmical law or custom of the terrestrial globe, or at least of the planetary vortex.\n\nSome curious observations on the shining of some Dr Beale's fishes, and the pickle in which they were immersed, were made by Dr Beale, in May 1665; and had they fishes been properly attended to and purified, might have led to the discovery of the cause of this appearance. Having put some boiled mackerel into water, together with salt and sweet herbs; when the cook was, some time after, stirring it, in order to take out some of the fillies, the observer, that, at the first motion, the water was very luminous; and that the fish shining through the water added much to the light which the water yielded. The water was of itself thick and blackish, rather than of any other colour; and yet it shone on being stirred, and at the same time the fishes appeared more luminous than the water. Wherever the drops of this water, after it had been stirred, fell to the ground, they shined; and the children in the family diverted themselves with taking the drops, which were as broad as a penny, and running with them about the house. The cook observed, that, when she turned up that side of the fish that was lowest, no light came from it;\nLight; and that, when the water had settled for some time, it did not shine at all. The day following, the water gave but little light, and only after a brisk agitation, though the fishes continued to shine as well from the inside as the outside, and especially about the throat, and such places as seemed to have been a little broken in the boiling.\n\nWhen in the light of the sun, he examined, with a microscope, a small piece of a fish which had shined very much the night before, he found nothing remarkable on its surface, except that he thought he perceived what he calls a steam, rather dark than luminous, arising like a very small and almost imperceptible sparkle. Of the sparkles he had no doubt; but he thought it possible that the steam might be a deception of the sight, or some dust in the air.\n\nFinding the fish to be quite dry, he moistened it with his spittle; and then observed that it gave a little light, though but for a short time. The fish at that time was not fetid, nor yet insipid to the best discerning palate. Two of the fishes he kept two or three days longer for farther trial; but, the weather being very hot, they became fetid; and, contrary to his expectations, there was no more light produced either by the agitation of the water or in the fish.\n\nFather Bourzes, in his voyage to the Indies in 1704, took particular notice of the luminous appearance of the sea. The light was sometimes so great, that he could easily read the title of a book by it, though he was nine or ten feet from the surface of the water. Sometimes he could easily distinguish, in the wake of a ship, the particles that were luminous from those that were not; and they appeared not to be all of the same figure. Some of them were like points of light, and others such as stars appear to the naked eye. Some of them were like globes, of a line or two in diameter; and others as big as one's head. Sometimes they formed themselves into squares of three or four inches long, and one or two broad. Sometimes all these different figures were visible at the same time; and sometimes they were what he calls varices of light, which at one particular time appeared and disappeared immediately like flashes of lightning.\n\nNor did only the wake of the ship produce this light, but fishes also, in swimming, left so luminous a track behind them, that both their size and species might be distinguished by it. When he took some of the water out of the sea, and stirred it ever so little with his hand, in the dark, he always saw in it an infinite number of bright particles; and he had the same appearance whenever he dipped a piece of linen in the sea, and wrung it in a dark place, even though it was half dry; and he observed, that when the sparkles fell upon any thing that was solid, it would continue shining for some hours together.\n\nAfter mentioning several circumstances which did not contribute to this appearance, this father observes, that it depends very much upon the quality of the water; and he was pretty sure that this light is the greatest when the water is fattest, and fullest of foam. For in the main sea, he says, the water is not everywhere equally pure; and that sometimes, if linen be dipped in the sea, it is clammy when it is drawn up again; and he often observed, that when the wake of the ship was the brightest, the water was the most fat and glutinous, and that linen moistened with it produced a great deal of light, if it was stirred or moved briskly. Besides, in some parts of the sea, he saw a substance like saw dust, sometimes red and sometimes yellow; and when he drew up the water in those places, it was always viscous and glutinous. The sailors told him, that it was the spawn of whales; that there are great quantities of it in the north; and that sometimes, in the night, they appeared all over of a bright light, without being put in motion by any vessel or fish passing by them.\n\nAs a confirmation of this conjecture, that the more glutinous the sea water is, the more it is disposed to become luminous, he observes, that one day they took a fish which was called a bonite, the inside of the mouth of which was so luminous, that, without any other light, he could read the same characters which he had before read by the light in the wake of the ship; and the mouth of this fish was full of a viscous matter, which, when it was rubbed upon a piece of wood, made it immediately all over luminous; though, when the moisture was dried up, the light was extinguished.\n\nThe abbé Nollet was much struck with the luminousness of the sea when he was at Venice in 1749; let's theory, and, after taking a great deal of pains to ascertain the circumstances of it, concluded that it was occasioned by a shining insect; and having examined the water very often, he at length did find a small insect, which he particularly describes, and to which he attributes the light. The same hypothesis had also occurred to M. Vianelli, professor of medicine in Chioggia near Venice; and both he and M. Grizzellini, a physician in Venice, have given drawings of the insects from which they imagined this light to proceed.\n\nThe abbé was the more confirmed in his hypothesis, by observing, some time after, the motion of some luminous particles in the sea. For, going into the water, and keeping his head just above the surface, he saw them dart from the bottom, which was covered with weeds, to the top, in a manner which he thought very much resembled the motions of insects; though, when he endeavoured to catch them, he only found some luminous spots upon his handkerchief, which were enlarged when he pressed them with his finger.\n\nM. le Roi, making a voyage on the Mediterranean, Observa- presently after the abbé Nollet made his observations of M. at Venice, took notice, that in the daytime, the prov le Roi, of the ship in motion threw up many small particles, which, falling upon the water, rolled upon the surface Memoires of the sea for a few seconds before they mixed with Prefectes, it; and in the night the same particles, as he con vol iii. 144, included, had the appearance of fire. Taking a quantity of the water, the same small sparks appeared whenever it was agitated; but, as was observed with respect to Dr Beale's experiments, every successive agitation produced a less effect than the preceding, except after being suffered to rest a while; for then a fresh agitation would make it almost as luminous as the first. This water, he observed, would retain its property of shining by agitation a day or two; but it disappeared immediately on being set on the fire, though it was not made to boil.\n\nThis gentleman, after giving much attention to this phenomenon, concludes, that it is not occasioned by any\nany thinning insects, as the abbé Nollet imagined; especially as, after carefully examining some of the luminous points, which he caught upon an handkerchief, he found them to be round like large pins heads, but with nothing of the appearance of any animal, though he viewed them with a microscope. He also found, that the mixture of a little spirit of wine with water just drawn from the sea, would give the appearance of a great number of little sparks, which would continue visible longer than those in the ocean. All the acids, and various other liquors, produced the same effect, though not quite so conspicuously; but no fresh agitation would make them luminous again. M. le Roy is far from asserting that there are no luminous insects in the sea. He even supposes that the abbé Nollet and M. Vianelli had found them. But he was satisfied that the sea is luminous chiefly on some other account, though he does not so much as advance a conjecture about what it is.\n\nM. Ant. Martin made many experiments on the light of fishes, with a view to discover the cause of the light of the sea. He thought that he had reason to conclude, from a great variety of experiments, that all sea fishes have this property; but that it is not to be found in any that are produced in fresh water. Nothing depended upon the colour of the fishes, except that he thought that the white ones, and especially those that had white scales, were a little more luminous than others. This light, he found, was increased by a small quantity of salt; and also by a small degree of warmth, though a greater degree extinguished it. This agrees with another observation of his, that it depends entirely upon a kind of moisture which they had about them, and which a small degree of heat would expel, when an oiliness remained which did not give this light, but would burn in the fire. Light from the shells of birds or beasts is not so bright, he says, as that which proceeds from fish. Human bodies, he says, have sometimes emitted light about the time that they began to putrefy, and the walls and roof of a place in which dead bodies had often been exposed, had a kind of dew or clamminess upon it, which was sometimes luminous; and he imagined that the lights which are said to be seen in burying-grounds may be owing to this cause.\n\nFrom some experiments made by Mr Canton, he concludes, that the luminousness of sea water is owing to the slimy and other putrefactive substances it contains. On the evening of the 14th of June 1768, he put a small fresh whiting into a gallon of sea water, in a pan which was about 14 inches in diameter, and took notice that neither the whiting nor the water, when agitated, gave any light. A Fahrenheit's thermometer, in the cellar where the pan was placed, stood at 54°. The 15th, at night, that part of the fish which was even with the surface of the water was luminous, but the water itself was dark. He drew the end of a stick through it, from one side of the pan to the other; and the water appeared luminous behind the stick all the way, but gave light only where it was disturbed. When all the water was stirred, the whole became luminous, and appeared like milk, giving a considerable degree of light to the sides of the pan; and it continued to do so for some time after it was at rest. The water was most luminous when the fish had been in it about 28 hours; but would not give any light by being stirred, after it had been in it three days.\n\nHe then put a gallon of fresh water into one pan, and an equal quantity of sea water into another; and into each pan he put a fresh herring of about three ounces. The next night the whole surface of the sea water was luminous without being stirred; but it was much more so when it was put in motion; and the upper part of the herring, which was considerably below the surface of the water, was also very bright; while at the same time the fresh water, and the fish that was in it, were quite dark. There were several very bright luminous spots on different parts of the surface of the sea water; and the whole, when viewed by the light of a candle, seemed covered with a greasy scum. The third night, the light of the sea water while at rest, was very little, if at all less than before; but when stirred, its light was so great as to discover the time by a watch, and the fish in it appeared as a dark substance. After this, its light was evidently decreasing, but was not quite gone before the 7th night. The fresh water and the fish in it were perfectly dark during the whole time. The thermometer was generally above 60°.\n\nThe preceding experiments were made with sea water; but he now made use of other water, into which he put common or sea salt, till he found, by an hydrometer, that it was of the same specific gravity with the sea water; and, at the same time, in another gallon of water, he dissolved two pounds of salt; and into each of these waters he put a small fresh herring. The next evening the whole surface of the artificial sea water was luminous without being stirred; but gave much more light when it was disturbed. It appeared exactly like the real sea water in the preceding experiment; its light lasted about the same time, and went off in the same manner; while the other water, which was almost as salt as it could be made, never gave any light. The herring which was taken out of it the seventh night, and washed from its salt, was found firm and sweet; but the other herring was very soft and putrid, much more so than that which had been kept as long in fresh water. If a herring, in warm weather, be put into 10 gallons of artificial sea water, instead of one, the water, he says, will still become luminous, but its light will not be so strong.\n\nIt appeared by some of the first observations on this subject, that heat extinguishes the light of putrefactive substances. Mr Canton also attended to this circumstance; and observes, that though the greatest summer heat is well known to promote putrefaction, yet 20 degrees more than that of the human blood seems to hinder it. For putting a small piece of a luminous fish into a thin glass ball, he found, that water of the heat of 118 degrees would extinguish its light in less than half a minute; but that, on taking it out of the water, it would begin to recover its light in about 10 seconds; but it was never afterwards so bright as before.\n\nMr Canton made the same observation that Mr Ant. Martin had done, viz. that several kinds of river fish could not be made to give light, in the same circumstances in which any sea fish became luminous. He says, however, that a piece of carp made the water very luminous,\nLIG\n\nLuminous, though the outside, or scaly part of it, did not shine at all.\n\nFor the sake of those persons who may choose to repeat his experiments, he observes, that artificial sea water may be made without the use of an hydrometer, by the proportion of four ounces avoidupois of salt to seven pints of water, wine measure.\n\nA very elaborate paper on the subject by Dr Hulme appeared in the Philosophical Transactions for 1800, to which we refer our readers, and to Chemistry, p. 451.\n\nFrom undoubted observations, however, it appears, that in many places of the ocean it is covered with luminous insects to a very considerable extent. M. Dagelet, a French astronomer who returned from the Terra Australis in the year 1774, brought with him several kinds of worms which shine in water when it is set in motion; and M. Rigaud, in a paper inserted (if we are not mistaken) in the Journal des Scavans for the month of March 1770, affirms, that the luminous surface of the sea, from the port of Brest to the Antilles, contains an immense quantity of little, round, shining polypuses of about a quarter of a line in diameter. Other learned men, who acknowledge the existence of these luminous animals, cannot, however, be persuaded to consider them as the cause of all that light and scintillation that appear on the surface of the ocean; they think that some substance of the phosphorus kind, arising from putrefaction, must be admitted as one of the causes of this phenomenon. M. Godehouse has published curious observations on a kind of fish called in French bonite, already mentioned; and though he has observed, and accurately described, several of the luminous insects that are found in sea water, he is, nevertheless, of opinion, that the scintillation and flaming light of the sea proceed from the oily and greasy substances with which it is impregnated.\n\nThe abbe Nollet was long of opinion, that the light of the sea proceeded from electricity (A); though he afterwards seemed inclined to think, that this phenomenon was caused by small animals, either by their luminous aspect, or at least by some liquor or effluvia which they emitted. He did not, however, exclude other causes; among these, the spawn or fry of fish deserves to be noticed. M. Dagelet, falling into the bay of Antongil, in the island of Madagascar, observed a prodigious quantity of fry which covered the surface of the sea above a mile in length, and which he at first took for banks of sand on account of their colour; they exhaled a disagreeable odour, and the sea had appeared with uncommon splendor some days before. The same accurate observer, perceiving the sea remarkably luminous in the road of the Cape of Good Hope during a perfect calm, remarked, that the oars of the canoes produced a whitish and pearly kind of lustre; when he took in his hand the water which contained this phosphorus, he discerned in it, for some minutes, globules of light as large as the heads of pins. When he pressed these globules, they appeared to his touch like a soft and thin pulp; and some days after the sea was covered near the coasts with whole banks of these little fish in innumerable multitudes.\n\nTo putrefaction, also, some are willing to attribute that luminous appearance which goes by the name of ignis fatuus, to which the credulous vulgar ascribe very extraordinary and especially mischievous powers. It is most frequently observed in boggy places and near rivers, though sometimes also in dry places. By its appearance benighted travellers are said to have been sometimes misled into marshy places, taking the light which they saw before them for a candle at a distance; from which seemingly mischievous property it has been thought by the vulgar to be a spirit of a malignant nature, and been named accordingly Will with a wolf, or Jack with a lantern; for the same reason also it probably had its Latin name ignis fatuus.\n\nThis kind of light is said to be frequent about burying places and dunghills. Some countries are also remarkable for it, as about Bologna in Italy, and some parts of Spain and Ethiopia. Its forms are so uncertain and variable that they can scarce be described, especially as few philosophical observers ever had the good fortune to meet with it. Dr Derham, however, happened one night to perceive one of them, and got so near that he could have a very advantageous view of it. This is by no means easy to be obtained; for, among other singularities of the ignis fatuus, it is observed to avoid the approach of any person, and fly from place to place as if it was animated. That which Dr Derham observed was in some boggy ground betwixt two rocky hills; and the night was dark and calm; by which means, probably, he was enabled to advance within two or three yards of it. It appeared like a complete body of light without any division, so that he was sure it could not be occasioned by insects as some have supposed; the separate lights of which he could not have failed to distinguish, had it been occasioned by them. The light kept dancing about a dead thistle, till a very slight motion of the air, occasioned, as he supposed, by his near approach to it, made it jump to another place; after which it kept flying before him as he advanced. M. Beccaria endeavoured to procure all the intelligence he could concerning this phenomenon, by inquiring of all his acquaintance who might have had an opportunity of observing it. Thus he obtained information that two of these lights appeared in the plains about Bologna, the one to the north, and the other to the south, of that city, and were to be seen almost every dark night, especially that to the eastward, giving a light equal to an ordinary faggot. The latter appeared to a gentleman of his acquaintance as he was travelling; moved constantly before him for about a mile; and gave a better light than a torch which was carried before him. Both these appearances gave a very strong light, and were constantly in motion, though this various and uncertain. Sometimes they would rise, sometimes sink; but commonly they would hover about six feet from the ground; they would also frequently disappear on a sudden,\n\n(A) This hypothesis was also maintained in a treatise published at Venice in 1746, by an officer in the Austrian service, under the title, Dell' Elettricismo.\nden, and appear again in some other place. They differed also in size and figure, sometimes spreading prettily wide, and then contracting themselves; sometimes breaking into two, and then joining again. Sometimes they would appear like waves, at others they would seem to drop sparks of fire: they were but little affected by the wind; and in wet and rainy weather were frequently observed to cast a stronger light than in dry weather: they were also observed more frequently when snow lay upon the ground, than in the hottest summer; but he was assured that there was not a dark night throughout the whole year in which they were not to be seen. The ground to the eastward of Bologna, where the largest of these appearances was observed, is a hard chalky soil mixed with clay, which will retain the moisture for a long time, but breaks and cracks in hot weather. On the mountains, where the soil is of a looser texture, and less capable of retaining moisture, the ignis fatuus were less.\n\nFrom the best information which M. Beccaria was able to procure, he found that these lights were very frequent about rivers and brooks. He concludes his narrative with the following singular account:\n\n\"An intelligent gentleman travelling in the evening, between eight and nine, in a mountainous road about ten miles south of Bologna, perceived a light which shone very strangely upon some stones which lay on the banks of the river Riverde. It seemed to be about two feet above the stones, and not far from the water. In size and figure it had the appearance of a parallelepiped, somewhat more than a foot in length, and half a foot high, the longest side being parallel to the horizon. Its light was so strong, that he could plainly discern by it part of a neighbouring hedge and the water of the river; only in the east corner of it the light was rather faint, and the square figure less perfect, as if it was cut off or darkened by the segment of a circle. On examining it a little nearer, he was surprised to find that it changed gradually from a bright red, first to a yellowish, and then to a pale colour, in proportion as he drew nearer; and when he came to the place itself, it quite vanished. Upon this he stepped back, and not only saw it again, but found that the farther he went from it, the stronger and brighter it grew. When he examined the place of this luminous appearance, he could perceive no smell nor any other mark of fire.\"\n\nThis account was confirmed by another gentleman, who informed M. Beccaria, that he had seen the same light five or six different times in spring and in autumn; and that it always appeared of the same shape, and in the very same place. One night in particular, he observed it come out of a neighbouring field to settle in the usual place.\n\nA very remarkable account of an ignis fatuus is given by Dr Shaw in his Travels to the Holy Land. It appeared in the valleys of Mount Ephraim, and attended him and his company for more than an hour. Sometimes it would appear globular, or in the shape of the flame of a candle; at others it would spread to such a degree as to involve the whole company in a pale inoffensive light, then contract itself, and suddenly disappear; but in less than a minute would appear again; sometimes running swiftly along, it would expand itself at certain intervals over more than two or three acres of the adjacent mountains. The atmosphere from the beginning of the evening had been remarkably thick and hazy; and the dew, as they felt it on the bridles of their horses, was very clammy and unctuous.\n\nLights resembling the ignis fatuus are sometimes observed at sea, skipping about the masts and rigging of ships; and Dr Shaw informs us, that he has seen them in such weather as that just mentioned when he saw the ignis fatuus in Palestine. Similar appearances have been observed in various other situations; and we are told of one which appeared about the bed of a woman in Milan, surrounding it as well as her body entirely. This light fled from the hand which approached it; but was at length entirely dispersed by the motion of the air. Of the same kind also, most probably, are those small luminous appearances which sometimes appear in houses or near them, called in Scotland Elf candles, and which are supposed to portend the death of some person about the house. In general these lights are harmless, though not always; for we have accounts of some luminous vapours which would encompass stacks of hay and corn, and set them on fire; so that they became objects of great terror and concern to the country people. Of these it was observed, that they would avoid a drawn sword, or sharp-pointed iron instrument, and that they would be driven away by a great noise; both which methods were made use of to dissipate them: and it was likewise observed, that they came from some distance, as it were on purpose to do mischief.\n\nSeveral philosophers have endeavoured to account for these appearances, but hitherto with no great success; nor indeed does there seem to be sufficient data for solving all their phenomena. Willoughby, Ray, and others, have imagined that the light was occasioned by a number of shining insects; but this opinion was never supported in such a manner as to gain much ground. The ignis fatuus seen by Dr Derham above mentioned, as well as all the other instances we have related seem to demonstrate the contrary. Sir Isaac Newton calls it a vapour shining without heat; and supposes that there is the same difference between the vapour of ignis fatuus and flame, that there is between the shining or rotten wood and burning coals. But though this seems generally to be the case, there are still some exceptions, as has been instance in the vapours which set fire to the stacks of corn. Dr Priestley supposes that the light is of the same nature with that produced by putrefactive substances; and others are of opinion, that the electrical fluid is principally concerned; but none have attempted to give any particular solution of the phenomena.\n\nFrom the frequent appearance of the ignis fatuus in marshes, moist ground, burying places, and dung-hills, we are naturally led to conclude, that putrefaction is concerned in the production of it. This process, we know, is attended with the emission of an aqueous steam, together with a quantity of fixed, inflammable, and azotic airs, all blended together in the form of vapour. It is likewise attended with some degree of heat; and we know that there are some vapours, that of sulphur particularly, which become luminous, with a degree of heat much less than that sufficient to set fire to combustible bodies. There is no inconsistency, therefore, in supposing that the putrid vapour...\nvapour may be capable of shining with a still smaller degree of heat than that of sulphur, and consequently become luminous by that which putrefaction alone affords. This would account for the ignis fatuus, were it only a steady luminous vapour arising from places where putrid matters are contained; but its extreme mobility, and flying from one place to another on the approach of any person, cannot be accounted for on this principle. If one quantity of the putrid vapour becomes luminous by means of heat, all the rest ought to do so likewise; so that, though we may allow heat and putrefaction to be concerned, yet of necessity we must have recourse to some other agent, which cannot be any other than electricity. Without this, it is impossible to conceive how any body of moveable vapour should not be carried away by the wind; but so far is this from being the case, that the ignis fatui, described by M. Beccaria, were but little affected by the wind. It is besides proved by undoubted experiment, that electricity always is attended with some degree of heat; and this, however small, may be sufficient to give a luminous property to any vapour on which it acts strongly; not to mention, that the electric fluid itself is no other than that of light, and may therefore by its action easily produce a luminous appearance independent of any vapour.\n\nWe have a strong proof that electricity is concerned, or indeed the principal agent, in producing the ignis fatuus, from an experiment related by Dr Priestley of a flame of this kind being artificially produced. A gentleman, who had been making many electrical experiments for a whole afternoon in a small room, on going out of it, observed a flame following him at some little distance. This, we have no reason to doubt, was a true ignis fatuus, and the circumstances necessary to produce it were then present, viz. an atmosphere impregnated with animal vapour, and likewise strongly electrified. Both these circumstances undoubtedly must have taken place in the present case; for the quantity of perspiration emitted by a human body is by no means inconsiderable; and it, as well as the electricity, would be collected by reason of the smallness of the room. In this case, however, there seems to have been a considerable difference between the artificial ignis fatuus and those commonly met with; for this flame followed the gentleman as he went out of the room; but the natural ones commonly fly from those who approach them. This may be accounted for, from a difference between the electricity of the atmosphere in the one room and the other; in which case the flame would naturally be attracted towards that place where the electricity was either different in quality or in quantity; but in the natural way, where all bodies may be supposed equally electrified for a great way round, a repulsion will naturally take place. Still, however, this does not seem to be always the case. In those instances where travellers have been attended by an ignis fatuus, we cannot suppose it to have been influenced by any other power than what we call attraction, and which electricity is very capable of producing. Its keeping at some distance is likewise easily accounted for; as we know that bodies possessed of different quantities of electricity may be made to attract one another for a certain space, and then repel without having ever come into contact.\n\nOn this principle we may account for the light which surrounded the woman at Milan, but fled from the hand of any other person. On the same principle may we account for these mischievous vapours which set fire to the hay and corn stacks, but were driven away by presenting to them a pointed iron instrument, or by making a noise. Both these are known to have a great effect upon the electric matter; and by means of either, even lightning may occasionally be made to fall upon or to avoid particular places, according to the circumstances by which the general mass happens to be affected at that time.\n\nOn the whole, therefore, it seems most probable, that the ignis fatuus is a collection of vapour of the putrefied kind, very much affected by electricity; according to the degree of which, it will either give a weak or strong light, or even set fire to certain substances disposed to receive its operation. This opinion seems greatly to be confirmed from some luminous appearances observed in privies, where the putrid vapours have even collected themselves into balls, and exploded violently on the approach of a candle. This last effect, however, we cannot so well ascribe to the electricity, as to the accension of the inflammable air which frequently abounds in such places.\n\nIn the appendix to Dr Priestley's third volume of Experiments and Observations on Air, Mr Warltire gives an account of some very remarkable ignis fatuus, which he observed on the road to Bromsgrove, about five miles from Birmingham. The time of observation was the 12th of December 1776, before day-light. A great many of these lights were playing in an adjacent field, in different directions; from some of which there suddenly sprung up bright branches of light, something resembling the explosion of a rocket that contained many brilliant stars, if the discharge was upwards, instead of the usual direction; and the hedge and trees on each side of the hedge were illuminated. This appearance continued but a few seconds, and then the jack-a-lanterns played as before. Mr Warltire was not near enough to observe if the apparent explosions were attended with any report.\n\nCronstedt gives it as his opinion, that ignis fatuus, as well as the meteors called falling stars, are owing to collections of inflammable air raised to a great height in the atmosphere. But, with regard to the latter, the vast height at which they move evidently shows that they cannot be the effect of any gravitating vapour whatever; for the lightest inflammable air is one-twelfth of that of the common atmosphere; and we have no reason to believe, that at the distance of 40 or 50 miles from the earth, the latter has near one-twelfth of its weight at the surface. From the account given by Mr Warltire, we should be apt to conclude, that there is a strong affinity betwixt the ignis fatuus and fire balls, inasmuch that the one might be very easily converted into the other. From this then we must ascribe an electrical origin to the one as well as the other. Electricity, we know, can assume both these appearances, as is evident in the case of points: or even when the atmosphere is violently electrified, as around the string of an electrical kite, which always will appear to be surrounded with a blue flame in the night, if the electricity be very strong.\n\nOn the whole, it appears, that electricity acting up-\non a small quantity of atmospheric air, with a certain degree of vigour, will produce an appearance resembling an ignis fatuus; with a superior force it will produce a fire ball; and a sudden increase of electrical power might produce those sparks and apparent explosions observed by Mr Warlire. The only difficulty therefore is, Why does electricity exert its power upon one portion of the atmosphere rather than another, seeing it has an opportunity of diffusing itself equally through the whole? To this it seems impossible to give any other reason than that we see the fact is so; and that in all cases where there is a quantity of electrified air or vapour, there will be an accumulation in one part rather than another. Thus, in the experiment already related, where the gentleman perceived a blue flame following him, the whole air of the room was electrified, but the greatest power of the fluid was exerted on that which gave the luminous appearance.\n\nWith regard to the uses of the ignis fatuus in the system of nature, we can only say, that they seem to be accidental appearances resulting from the motion of the electric fluid, and, no doubt, like other meteors subservient to the preservation of its equilibrium, and thus are useful in preventing those dreadful commotions which ensue when a proper medium for so doing is deficient.\n\nA light in some respects similar to those above mentioned has been found to proceed from that celebrated chemical production called phosphorus, which always tends to decompose itself, so as to take fire by the access of air only. Phosphorus, therefore, when it emits light, is properly a body ignited; though when a very small quantity of it is used, as what is left after drawing it over paper, or what may be dissolved in essential oil, the heat is not sensible. But perhaps the matter which emits the light in what we call putrefactive substances may be similar to it, though it be generated by a different process, and burn with a less degree of heat. Putrefaction does not seem to be necessary to the light of glow-worms or of the phalopes; and yet their light is sufficiently similar to that of shining wood or flesh. Electric light is unquestionably similar to that of phosphorus, though the source of it is apparently very different.\n\nKunckel formed his phosphorus into a kind of pills about the size of peas, which being moistened a little, and scraped in the dark, yielded a very considerable light, but not without smoke. The light was much more pleasing when eight or ten of these pills were put into a glass of water; for being shaken in the dark, the whole glass seemed to be filled with light. Kunckel also reduced his phosphorus into the form of larger stones; which being warmed by a person's hand, and rubbed upon paper, would describe letters that were very legible in the dark.\n\nThe greatest variety of experiments with the light of phosphorus was made by Dr Slare; who says, that the liquid phosphorus (which is nothing more than the solid phosphorus dissolved in any of the essential oils) would not hurt even a lady's hand; or that, when the hands or face were washed with it, it would not only make them visible to other persons in the dark, but that the light was so considerable as to make other neighbouring objects visible.\n\nWhen the solid phosphorus is quite immersed in water, he observes that it ceases to thine; but that if any part of it chance to emerge, or get into the air, it will thine though the glass be hermetically sealed. In a large glass he kept it without water for several days; and yet it continued shining, with very little diminution of its light or weight. If the letters that were written with this phosphorus were warmed by the fire, they presently became dark lines, which continued upon the paper, like ink. To try how much light was given by a small quantity of this phosphorus, he observed that it continued to flame in the open air for seven or eight days; the light being visible whenever he shut his window.\n\nAs air was generally thought to contain the pabulum of flame, Dr Slare was determined to try this with respect to phosphorus; and for this purpose he placed a large piece of it in a receiver; but upon exhausting it, he perceived that it became more luminous, and that, upon admitting the air, it returned to its former state. This property of the light of phosphorus, which is the very reverse of that of shining wood and fishes, was also ascertained by several very accurate experiments of Mr Haukbee's.\n\nEndeavouring to blow the phosphorus into a flame with a pair of bellows, Dr Slare found that it was presently blown out, and that it was a considerable time before the light revived again. All liquors would extinguish this light when the phosphorus was put into them; nor would it thine or burn, though it was even boiled in the most inflammable liquors, as oil of olives, spirit of turpentine, or even spirit of wine.\n\nIn order to keep his phosphorus from conflagration, he used to put it in a glass of water; and sometimes he has seen it, when thus immersed in water, make such bright and vigorous coruscations in the air, as, he says, would surprise and frighten those who are not used to the phenomenon. This fiery meteor, he says, is contracted in its passage through the water, but expands as soon as it gets above it. If any person would make this experiment to advantage, he informs them that the glass must be deep and cylindrical, and not above three quarters filled with water. This effect he perceived in warm weather only, and never in cold.\n\nThe phosphorus of which we have been treating is prepared from urine; but in some cases the sweat, which is similar to urine, has been observed to be phosphoraceous, without any preparation. This once happened to a person who used to eat great quantities of salt, and who was a little subject to the gout, after sweating with violent exercise. Stripping himself in the dark, his shirt seemed to be all on fire, which surprised him very much. Upon examination, red spots were found upon his shirt; and the physician who was present perceived an urinous smell, though it had nothing in it of volatile alkali, but of the muriatic acid; the same, he says, that issues from cabbage much salted, and strongly fermented.\n\nThe easiest method of accounting for all these kinds of lights, perhaps, is from electricity. If light consists counted for in a certain vibration of the electric fluid *, then it follows, that in whatever substances such a vibration takes place, there light must appear, whether in putrefactive animal substances, tea water, phosphorus, or anything else. We know that the electric matter pervades all terrestrial\nterrestrial substances, and is very liable to be set in motion from causes of which we are ignorant. The action of the air by which putrefaction is produced may be one of these causes; and it can by no means appear surprising that the electric matter should act in the bodies of living animals in such a manner as to produce a permanent light, when we certainly know it acts in some of them so powerfully as to produce a shock similar to that of a charged phial.—On this subject we shall only observe farther, that when this vibration becomes so powerful as to penetrate the solid substance of the body itself, the luminous body then becomes transparent, as in the milk mentioned in the former part of this article; but when it is only superficial, the body, though it emits light, is itself opaque.\n\nLight from Diamonds. Among luminous bodies the diamond is to be reckoned; as some diamonds are known to shine in the dark. But on account of the feebleness of their splendour, it is necessary for the person who is to observe them, previously to stay in the dark at least a quarter of an hour; that the pupil of the eye may be dilated and enlarged, and to rendered capable of receiving a large quantity of the rays of light. M. du Fay has also observed, that the eyes ought to be shut for this time, or at least one of them; and that, in that case, the light of the diamond is afterwards only seen by that eye which has been shut. Before the diamond is brought into the dark room, it must be exposed to the sunshine, or at least to the open daylight, to imbibe a sufficient quantity of rays; and this is done in one minute, or even less; eight or ten seconds having been found to furnish as much light as a stone is capable of receiving: and when brought into the dark, its light continues about twelve or thirteen minutes, weakening all the while, by insensible degrees. It is very remarkable, that in bodies so extremely similar to each other as diamonds are, some should have this property of imbuing the sun's rays, and shining in the dark, and that others should not; yet if it is found to be by experiment, and the most nearly resembling stones shall be found one to have this property, and another to be destitute of it; while many of the most dissimilar have the property in common. There seems to be no rule, nor even the least traces of any imperfect rule of judging, which diamonds have, and which have not this property; their natural brightnesses, their purity, their size, or their shape, contribute nothing to it; and all that has been yet discovered of the least regularity among them, is, that all yellow diamonds have this property. This is supposed to arise from their having more sulphur in their composition, and therefore illuminating more readily, or emitting a more visible flame.\n\nThe burning of diamonds is a term used among the jewellers, for putting them into a fierce fire, as they frequently do, when they are fouled with brown, or yellow, or the like; this always divests them of their colour, without doing them the least sensible injury. M. du Fay, having been informed of this common practice, formed a conjecture, that the difference of diamonds in their shining or not shining in the dark, was owing to it; and that either all those which had been burnt, or all those which had not, were those which alone shone in the dark. But this was found an erroneous conjecture; for two diamonds, one lucid in the dark, the other not, were both burnt, and afterwards both were found to retain the same properties they had before. It is not only the open sunshine, or open daylight, which gives to these diamonds the power of shining in the dark; they receive it in the same manner even if laid under a glass, or plunged in water or in milk.\n\nM. du Fay tried whether it was possible to make the diamond retain, for any longer time, the light it naturally parts with so soon; and found, that if the diamond, after being exposed to the light, be covered with black wax, it will shine in the dark, as well fix hours afterwards as at the time it was first impregnated with the light.\n\nThe imbibing light, in this manner, being so nice a property as not to be found in several diamonds, it was not to be supposed that it would be found in any other stones; accordingly, on trial, the ruby, the sapphire, and the topaz, were found wholly destitute of it; and among a large number of rough emeralds, one only was found to possess it. Such is the strange uncertainty of these accidents.\n\nAll the other less precious stones were tried, and found not to possess this property of imbibing light from the daylight or sunshine, but they all became luminous by the different means of heating or friction; with this difference, that some acquired it by one of these methods, and others by the other; each being unaffected by that which gave the property to the other. The diamond becomes luminous by all these ways.\n\nBeccarius also discovered, that diamonds have the property of the Bolognian phosphorus, about the same time that it occurred to M. du Fay. Com. Bonon. vol. ii. p. 276. M. du Fay likewise observed, that the common topaz, when calcined, had all the properties of this phosphorus; and pursuing the discovery, he found the same property, in a great degree, in the beryllites, gypsum, limestone, and marble: though he was obliged to dissolve some very hard substances of this kind in acids, before calcination could produce this change in them; and with some substances he could not succeed even thus; especially with flint stones, river sand, jaspers, agates, and rock crystal.\n\nLight from Plants. In Sweden a very curious phenomenon has been observed on certain flowers by M. Haggert, lecturer in natural history. One evening he perceived a faint flash of light repeatedly dart from a marigold. Surprised at such an uncommon appearance, he resolved to examine it with attention; and, to be assured it was no deception of the eye, he placed a man near him, with orders to make a signal at the moment when he observed the light. They both saw it constantly at the same moment.\n\nThe light was most brilliant on marigolds of an orange or flame colour; but scarcely visible on pale ones.\n\nThe flash was frequently seen on the same flower two or three times in quick succession, but more commonly at intervals of several minutes; and when several flowers in the same place emitted their light together, it could be observed at a considerable distance.\n\nThis phenomenon was remarked in the months of July and August at sunset, and for half an hour, when the atmosphere was clear; but after a rainy day, or\nwhen the air was loaded with vapours, nothing of it was seen.\n\nThe following flowers emitted flashes, more or less vivid, in this order:\n1. The marigold, *calendula officinalis*.\n2. Monk's-hood, *tropaeolum majus*.\n3. The orange lily, *lilium bulbiferum*.\n4. The Indian pink, *tagetes patula et erecta*.\n\nTo discover whether some little insects or phosphoric worms might not be the cause of it, the flowers were carefully examined, even with a microscope, without any such thing being found.\n\nFrom the rapidity of the flash, and other circumstances, it may be conjectured that there is something of electricity in this phenomenon. It is well known, that when the pitil of a flower is impregnated, the pollen bursts away by its elasticity, with which electricity may be combined. But M. Haggern, after having observed the flash from the orange lily, the antherae of which are a considerable space distant from the petals, found that the light proceeded from the petals only; whence he concludes, that this electric light is caused by the pollen, which, in flying off, is scattered on the petals. Whatever be the cause, the effect is singular and highly curious.\n\n**Lights**, in Painting, are those parts of a piece which are illuminated, or that lie open to the luminary by which the piece is supposed to be enlightened; and which, for this reason, are painted in bright vivid colours.\n\nIn this sense, light is opposed to shadow.\n\nDifferent lights have very different effects on a picture, and occasion a difference in the management of every part. A great deal therefore depends on the painter's choosing a proper light for his piece to be illuminated by; and a great deal more, in the conduct of the lights and shadows, when the luminary is pitched upon.\n\nThe strength and relievo of a figure, as well as its gracefulness, depend entirely on the management of the lights, and the joining of those to the shadows.\n\nThe light a figure receives is either direct or reflected; to each of which special regard must be had. The doctrine of lights and shadows makes that part of painting called **clair-obscur**.\n\n**Light-Horse**, an ancient term in our English customs, signifying an ordinary cavalier or horseman lightly armed, and so as to enter a corps or regiment; in opposition to the men at arms, who were heavily accoutred, and armed at all points. See Light-Horse.\n\n**Light-House**, a building erected upon a cape or promontory on the sea coast, or upon some rock in the sea, and having on its top in the night-time a great fire, or light formed by candles, which is constantly attended by some careful person, so as to be seen at a great distance from the land. It is used to direct the shipping on the coast, that might otherwise run ashore, or steer an improper course, when the darkness of the night and the uncertainty of currents, &c., might render their situation with regard to the shore extremely doubtful. Lamp-lights are, on many accounts, preferable to coal fires or candles; and the effect of these may be increased by placing them either behind glass hemispheres, or before properly disposed glass or metal reflectors, which last method is now very generally adopted. See Beacons.\n\n**Light-Room**, a small apartment, enclosed with glass windows, near the magazine of a ship of war. It is used to contain the lights by which the gunner and his assistants are enabled to fill cartridges with powder to be ready for action.\n\n**Lighter**, a large, open, flat-bottomed vessel, generally managed with oars, and employed to carry goods to or from a ship when she is to be laden or delivered.—There are also some lighters furnished with a deck throughout their whole length, in order to contain those merchandises which would be damaged by rainy weather: these are usually called close lighters.\n\n**Lightfoot**, John, a most learned English divine, was the son of a divine, and born in March 1602, at Stoke upon Trent in Staffordshire. After having finished his studies at a school on Morton-green near Congleton in Cheshire, he was removed in 1617 to Cambridge, where he applied himself to eloquence, and succeeded so well in it as to be thought the best orator of the undergraduates in the university. He also made an extraordinary proficiency in the Latin and Greek; but neglected the Hebrew, and even lost that knowledge he brought of it from school. His taste for the oriental languages was not yet excited; and as for logic, the study of it as managed at that time among the academics, was too quarrelsome and fierce for his quiet and meek disposition. As soon as he had taken the degree of B.A. he left the university, and became assistant to a school at Repton in Derbyshire. After he had supplied this place a year or two, he entered into orders, and became curate of Norton under Hales in Shropshire. This curacy gave an occasion of awakening his genius for the Hebrew tongue. Norton lies near Bellaport, then the seat of Sir Rowland Cotton; who was his constant hearer, made him his chaplain, and took him into his house. This gentleman being a perfect master of the Hebrew language, engaged Lightfoot in that study; who, by conversing with his patron, soon became sensible that without that knowledge it was impossible to attain an accurate understanding of the scriptures. He therefore applied himself to it with extraordinary vigour, and in a little time made a great progress in it; and his patron removing with his family to reside in London, at the request of Sir Alland Cotton his uncle, who was lord-mayor of that city, he followed his preceptor thither. But he did not stay long there: for, having a mind to improve himself by travelling abroad, he went down into Staffordshire to take leave of his father and mother. Palling through Stone in that county, he found the place destitute of a minister: and the prevailing infirmities of the parishioners prevailed upon him to undertake that cure. Hereupon, laying aside his design of travelling abroad, he began to turn his thoughts upon settling at home. During his residence at Bellaport, he had fallen into the acquaintance of a gentlewoman who was daughter of William Crompton of Stonepark, Esq. and now, being in possession of that living, he married her in 1628. But notwithstanding this settlement, his unquenchable thirst after rabbinical learning would not suffer him to continue there. Sion-college library at London, he knew,\nwas well stocked with books of that kind. He therefore quitted his charge at Stone, and removed with his family to Hornsey, near the city; where he gave the public a notable specimen of his advancement in those studies, by his \"Erubhini,\" or Miscellanies Christian and Judaical,\" in 1629. He was at this time only 27 years of age; and appears to have been well acquainted with the Latin and the Greek fathers, as well as the ancient heathen writers. These first fruits of his studies were dedicated to Sir Rowland Cotton; who, in 1631, presented him to the rectory of Ashley in Staffordshire.\n\nHe seemed now to be fixed for life: Accordingly, he built a study in the garden, to be out of the noise of the house; and applied himself with indefatigable diligence in searching the scriptures. Thus employed, the days passed very agreeably; and he continued quiet and unmolested, till the great change which happened in the public affairs brought him into a share of the administration relating to the church; for he was nominated a member of the memorable assembly of divines for settling a new form of ecclesiastical polity. This appointment was purely the effect of his distinguished merit; and he accepted it purely with a view to serve his country, as far as lay in his power. The non-residence, which this would necessarily occasion, apparently induced him to resign his rectory; and having obtained the presentation for a younger brother, he set out for London in 1642. He had now satisfied himself in clearing up many of the arbitrary passages in the Bible, and therein had provided the chief materials, as well as formed the plan, of his \"Harmony;\" and an opportunity of inspecting it at the press was, no doubt, an additional motive for his going to the capital; where he had not been long before he was chosen minister of St Bartholomew's, behind the Royal Exchange. The assembly of divines meeting in 1643, our author gave his attendance diligently there, and made a distinguished figure in their debates; where he used great freedom, and gave signal proofs of his courage as well as learning, in opposing many of those tenets which the divines were endeavouring to establish. His learning recommended him to the parliament, whose visitors, having ejected Dr William Spurrow from the mastership of Catharine-hall in Cambridge, put Lightfoot in his room, this year 1653; and he was also presented to the living of Much-Munden in Hertfordshire, void by the death of Dr Samuel Ward, Margaret-professor of divinity in that university, before the expiration of this year. Meanwhile he had his turn with other favourites in preaching before the house of commons, most of which sermons were printed; and in them we see him warmly pressing the speedy settlement of the church in the Presbyterian form, which he cordially believed to be according to the pattern in the Mount. He was all the while employed in preparing and publishing the several branches of his Harmony; all which were so many excellent specimens of the usefulness of human learning to true religion: and he met with great difficulties and discouragements in that work, chiefly from that antiruditional spirit which prevailed, and even threatened the destruction of the universities. In 1655 he entered upon the office of vice-chancellor of Cambridge, to which he was chosen that year, having taken the degree of doctor of divinity in 1652.\n\nHe performed all the regular exercises for his degree with great applause, and executed the vice-chancellor's office with exemplary diligence and fidelity; and, particularly at the commencement, supplied the place of professor of divinity, then undisposed of, as an act which was kept for a doctor's degree in that profession. At the same time he was engaged with others in perfecting the Polyglott Bible, then in the press. At the Restoration he offered to resign the mastership of Catharine-hall: But, as what he had done had been rather in compliance with the necessity of the times than from any zeal or spirit of opposition to the king and government, a confirmation was granted him from the crown, both of the place and of his living. Soon after this he was appointed one of the assistants at the conference upon the liturgy, which was held in the beginning of 1661, but attended only once or twice; probably disgusted at the heat with which that conference was managed. However, he stuck close to his design of perfecting his Harmony: and being of a strong and healthy constitution, which was assisted by an exact temperance, he prosecuted his studies with unabated vigour to the last, and continued to publish, notwithstanding the many difficulties he met with from the expense of it. However, not long before he died, some bookellers got a promise from him to collect and methodise his works, in order to print them; but the execution was prevented by his death, which happened Dec. 6, 1675. The doctor was twice married: his first wife, already mentioned, brought him four sons and two daughters. His second wife was likewise a widow, and relish of Mr Austin Brograve, uncle of Sir Thomas Brograve, Bart of Hertfordshire, a gentleman well versed in rabbinical learning, and a particular acquaintance of our author. He had no issue by her. She also died before him, and was buried in Munden church; where the doctor was himself likewise interred near both his wives. Dr Lightfoot's works were collected and published first in 1684, in two volumes folio. The second edition was printed at Amsterdam, 1686, in two volumes folio, containing all his Latin writings, with a Latin translation of those which he wrote in English. At the end of both these editions there is a list of such pieces as he left unfinished. It is the chief of these, in Latin, which make up the third volume, added to the former two, in a third edition of his works, by John Leiden, at Utrecht, in 1699, folio. They were communicated by Mr Strype, who, in 1700, published another collection of these papers, under the title of \"Some genuine remains of the late pious and learned Dr John Lightfoot.\"\n\nLIGHTING OF STREETS. This invention, which is generally considered as of modern date, contributes greatly to the convenience and safety of the inhabitants of large cities, as well as to the ornament of their streets. It is not probable that the streets of ancient Rome were lighted, since the Romans considered the use of flambeaux and lanterns to be so necessary in returning home from their nocturnal visits. It appears that such as walked the streets without these went home in darkness; and the return of Gito in the night-time, of which Petronius makes mention, clearly proves that the streets of Naples were not lighted. Such as have ascribed a remote antiquity to the lighting of streets, seem\nLighting seem to have mistaken it for what are called illuminations, which indeed are of great antiquity. Egyptians, Jews, Greeks, and Romans, during the celebration of memorable festivals, were in the habit of illuminating their houses; but this is entirely different from the practice which we are now conferring.\n\nParis was probably the first city in modern times, the streets of which were lighted, about the beginning of the 16th century, as they were very much infested by robbers and incendiaries. This occasioned an edict, issued in 1524, commanding the inhabitants, whose windows fronted the street, to keep lights burning after nine o'clock at night. In 1558, falots were placed at the corners of the streets; but when these were too long to receive benefit from the light of one, three were erected in different parts of it. The city of Paris had then 912 streets, and the number of lights rather under 2736; but in the same year these were charged for lanterns, of a similar construction with those used at present.\n\nIn 1671, the lanterns were ordered to be lighted every year from the 23rd October to the end of March the ensuing year. Some time after this a premium was offered for a dissertation on the best means of improving the lighting of the streets, when a journeyman glazier obtained a premium of 200 livres, and Messrs Baillie, le Roy, and Bourgeois de Chateaublanc, 2000 livres. The lamps of Paris amounted to 5772 in the year 1721, and in 1771, to 6232. The city of Nantes was lighted in 1777, and had no fewer than 500 lamps in the year 1780.\n\nThe inhabitants of the city of London were ordered, in 1688, to hang out lanterns duly at the accustomed time, which was renewed in 1690; and in 1716 it was enacted, that all those whose houses fronted any street, lane, or public passage, should hang out one or more lights, which were to burn from 6 o'clock to 11. But as the time of lighting them was restricted to 117 nights in the year, on which account many depredations were easily committed by thieves and robbers, the lord mayor and council applied for, and obtained an act of parliament, empowering them to light the streets in a better manner. In consequence of this act, the lamps were increased from 1000 to 4769, and afterwards to 5000. But as these were confined to the city and liberties, about one-fifth of the whole of London, the number of lamps could not be less than 15,000. The continuance of their burning was also increased from 750 to 5000 hours. In 1744, another act was obtained to regulate still farther the lighting of the city, and it was placed on the footing on which it stands at present. There are now so numerous, that Oxford street alone is said to contain more lamps than the whole city of Paris. Birmingham was lighted for the first time in 1733, with 700 lamps.\n\nIn 1669, Amsterdam was lighted by lanterns; the Hague in 1553 was lighted in a particular manner, but lamps were not fixed up in all the streets till the year 1678. The streets of Copenhagen were lighted in 1681, the plan of which was much improved in 1683. Berlin at present has 2354 lamps, kept lighted from September to May at the expense of the sovereign. Vienna began to be lighted in 1687, and lamps were introduced in 1704. In 1776 their number amounted to 2000, which was increased to 3000, to be lighted at the annual expense of 30,000 florins. Leipzig was lighted in 1702, Dresden in 1705, Cassel in 1721, and Gottingen in 1735. A practice so beneficial to the safety and convenience of mankind, has been very laudably imitated by almost every city and town in Europe.\n\nBeckman Hist. of Invent.\n\nLIGHTNING, a bright and vivid flash of fire, suddenly appearing in the atmosphere, and commonly disappearing in an instant, sometimes attended with clouds and thunder, and sometimes not. For an account of the phenomena of lightning, and of the opinions concerning it, see Electricity Index.\n\nArtificial Lightning. Before the discoveries of Dr Franklin concerning the identity of electricity and lightning, many contrivances were invented in order to represent this terrifying phenomenon in miniature: the conflagrations of phosphorus in warm weather, the accension of the vapour of spirit of wine evaporated in a close place, &c., were used in order to support the hypothesis which at that time prevailed; namely, that lightning was formed of some fulphurous, nitrous, or other combustible vapours, floating in long trains in the atmosphere, which by some unaccountable means took fire, and produced all the destructive effects of that phenomenon. These representations, however, are now no more exhibited; and the only true artificial lightning is universally acknowledged to be the discharge of electric matter from bodies in which it is artificially set in motion by machines.\n\nLightning was looked upon as sacred both by the Greeks and Romans, and was supposed to be sent to execute vengeance on the earth: Hence persons killed with lightning, being thought hateful to the gods, were buried apart by themselves, lest the ashes of other men should receive pollution from them. Some say they were interred upon the very spot where they died; others will have it that they had no interment, but were suffered to rot where they fell, because it was unlawful for any man to approach the place. For this reason the ground was hedged in, lest any person unawares should contract pollution from it. All places struck with lightning were carefully avoided and fenced round, out of an opinion that Jupiter had either taken offence at them, and fixed upon them the marks of his displeasure, or that he had, by this means, pitched upon them as sacred to himself. The ground thus fenced about was called by the Romans bidentul. Lightning was much observed in augury, and was a good or bad omen, according to the circumstances attending it.\n\nLIGNICENCIS TERRA, in the Materia Medica, the name of a fine yellow bote found in many parts of Germany, particularly about Emeric in the circle of Westphalia, and used as an astringent.\n\nLIGNUM VITAE.

There is a great disagreement among authors concerning the origin of the Ligurians, though most probably they were descended from the Gauls. Some carry up their origin as far as the fabulous heroes of antiquity; while others trace them from the Ligyes, a people mentioned by Herodotus as attending Xerxes in his expeditions against Greece. These Ligyes are by some ancient geographers placed in Colchis; by others, in Albania.—According to Diodorus Siculus, the Ligurians led a very wretched life; their country being entirely overgrown with woods, which they were obliged to pull up by the root, in order to cultivate their land, which was also encumbered with great stones, and, being naturally barren, made but very poor returns for all their labour. They were much addicted to hunting; and, by a life of continual exercise and labour, became so strong, that the weakest Ligurian was generally an overmatch for the strongest and most robust among the Gauls. The women are said to have been almost as strong as the men, and to have borne an equal share in all laborious enterprises. With all their bravery, however, they were not able to resist the Roman power; but were subdued by that warlike nation, about 211 B.C.\n\n**Ligusticum, lovage,** a genus of plants belonging to the pentandria clasf; and in the natural method ranking under the 45th order, Umbellatae.

In 1641, he was released by the long parliament: and from this time he had the address to make himself formidable to all parties, by his bold, aspiring genius. He signalized himself in the parliament army; and was at one time the secret friend and confidant of Cromwell, and at another his avowed enemy and accuser; so that, in 1659, Cromwell found it to be his interest to silence him, by a grant of some forfeited estates. But after this, he Lillaceous grew outrageous against the protector's government; became chief of the levellers; and was twice tried for high treason, but acquitted by the juries. The last was for returning from exile (having been banished by the parliament) without a pass. He died in 1657, aged 88.\n\n**Liliaceous,** in Botany, an appellation given to such flowers as resemble those of the lily.\n\n**Lilium,** the lily; a genus of plants belonging to the hexandria clasf, and in the natural method ranking under the 10th order, Coronariae. See Botany Index.\n\n**Lillo, George,** an excellent dramatic writer, was born at London in 1603. He was a jeweller by profession, and followed his business for many years in that neighbourhood with the fairest reputation. He was at the same time strongly attached to the muses, yet seemed to have laid it down as a maxim, that the devotion paid to them ought always to tend to the promotion of virtue, morality, and religion. In pursuance of this aim, Lilly was happy in the choice of his subjects, and showed great power of affecting the heart, by working up the passions to such a height as to render the distresses of common and domestic life equally interesting to the audiences as that of kings and heroes, and the ruin brought on private families by an indulgence of avarice, lust, &c., as the havoc made in states and empires by ambition, cruelty, or tyranny. His \"George Barnwell,\" \"Fatal Curiosity,\" and \"Arden of Feverham,\" are all planned on common and well known stories; yet they have perhaps more frequently drawn tears from an audience than the more pompous tragedies of Alexander the Great, All for Love, &c. In the prologue to \"Elmeric,\" which was not acted till after the author's death, it is said, that when he wrote that play, he \"was deprived by want,\" and afflicted by disease; but in the former particular there appears to be evidently a mistake, as he died possessed of an estate of 60l. a-year, besides other effects to a considerable value. His death happened in 1739, in the 47th year of his age. His works have been collected, and published, with an account of his life, in 2 vols. 12mo.\n\n**Lilly, John,** a dramatic poet, was born in the Wealds of Kent, about the year 1553, and educated in Magdalen-college, Oxford, where he took the degree of bachelor of arts in 1573, and that of master in 1575. From Oxford he removed to Cambridge; but how long he continued there, is uncertain. On his arrival in London, he became acquainted with some of Queen Elizabeth's courtiers, by whom he was caressed, and admired as a poet and a wit; and her majesty, on particular festivals, honoured his dramatic pieces with her presence. His plays are nine in number. His first publication, however, printed in 1580, was a romance called *Euphues*, which was universally read and admired. This romance, which Blount, the editor of five of his plays, lays introduced a new language, especially among the ladies, is, according to Beikenhoult, in fact a most contemptible piece of affectation and nonsense; nevertheless it seems very certain, that it was in high estimation by the women of fashion of those times, who, we are told by Whalley, the editor of Ben Jonson's works, had all the phrases by heart;\nand those who did not speak Euphysin were as little regarded at court as if they could not speak French.\n\n\"He was (says Oldys) a man of great reading, good memory, ready faculty of application, and uncommon eloquence; but he ran into a vast excess of allusion.\" When or where he died is not known. Anthony Wood says he was living in 1597, when his last comedy was published. After attending the court of Queen Elizabeth 13 years, notwithstanding his reputation as an author, he was under a necessity of petitioning the queen for some small stipend to support him in his old age. His two letters or petitions to her majesty on this subject are preserved in manuscript.\n\nLILLY, William, a noted English astrologer, born in Leicestershire in 1602; where his father not being able to give him more learning than common writing and arithmetic, he resolved to seek his fortune in London. He arrived in 1620, and lived four years as a servant to a mantua-maker in the parish of St Clements Danes; but then moved a step higher to the service of Mr Wright, master of the Salters company in the Strand, who not being able to write, Lilly among other offices kept his books. In 1627, when his master died, he paid his addresses to the widow, whom he married with a fortune of 1000l. Being now his own master, he followed the puritanical preachers; and, turning his mind to judicial astrology, became pupil to one Evans, a profligate Welsh parson, in that pretended art. Getting a MS. of the Ars Notitia of Corn. Agrrippa, with alterations, he drank in the doctrine of the magic circle, and the invocation of spirits, with great eagerness. He was the author of the Merlinus Anglicus junior; The Supernatural Sight; and The White King's Prophecy. In him we have an instance of the general superstition and ignorance that prevailed in the time of the civil war between Cha. I. and his parliament: for the king consulted this astrologer to know in what quarter he should conceal himself, if he could escape from Hampton court; and General Fairfax, on the other side, sent him to his army, to ask him if he could tell by his art, whether God was with them and their cause? Lilly, who made his fortune by favourable predictions to both parties, assured the general that God would be with him and his army. In 1648, he published his Treatise of the Three Suns seen the preceding winter; and also an astrological judgement upon a conjunction of Saturn and Mars. This year the council of state gave him in money 50l. and a pension of 100l. per annum, which he received for two years, and then resigned on some difficulty. In June 1663, he was taken into custody by order of the parliament, by whom he was examined concerning the person who cut off the head of King Charles I. The famine year he sued out his pardon under the great seal of England. The plague raging in London, he removed with his family to his estate at Hertham; and in October 1666 was examined before a committee of the house of commons concerning the fire of London, which happened in September that year. After his retirement to Hertham, he applied himself to the study of physic, and, by means of his friend Mr Ashmole, obtained from Archbishop Sheldon a license for the practice of it. A little before his death he adopted for his son, by the name of Merlin junior, one Henry Coley, a taylor by trade; and at the same time gave him the impression of his almanack; after it had been printed for 36 years. He died in 1681 of a dead palsy. Mr Ashmole set a monument over his grave in the church of Walton upon Thames. His \"Observations on the Life and Death of Charles late King of England,\" if we overlook the astrological nonsense, may be read with as much satisfaction as more celebrated histories; Lilly being not only very well informed, but strictly impartial. This work, with the Lives of Lilly and Ashmole, written by themselves, were published in one vol. 8vo, in 1774, by Mr Burman.\n\nLILY. See LILIUM, BOTANY Index.\n\nLILLY of the Valley. See CONVALLARIA, BOTANY Index.\n\nLILYBÆUM, in Ancient Geography, a city of Sicily, situated on the most westerly promontory of the island of Sicily, and said to have been founded by the Carthaginians on their expulsion from Motya by Dionysius tyrant of Syracuse. It is remarkable for three sieges it sustained; one against Dionysius the tyrant, another against Pyrrhus king of Epirus, and the third against the Romans. The two first failed in their attempts, but the Romans with great difficulty made themselves masters of it. No remains of this once stately city are now to be seen, except some aqueducts and temples; though it was standing in Strabo's time.\n\nLILYE, WILLIAM, the grammarian, was born in the year 1466 at Oldham in Hampshire; and in 1486 was admitted a semi-commoner of Magdalen college in Oxford. Having taken the degree of bachelor of arts, he left the university, and travelled to Jerusalem. Returning from thence, he continued five years in the island of Rhodes, where he studied the Greek language, several learned men having retired thither after the taking of Constantinople. From Rhodes he travelled to Rome; where he improved himself in the Greek and Latin languages, under Sulpitius and P. Sabinus. He then returned to London, where for some time he taught a private grammar-school, being the first person who taught Greek in the metropolis. In 1510, when Dr Colet founded St Paul's school, Lilye was appointed the first master; at which time, it seems, he was married and had many children. In this employment he had laboured 12 years, when, being seized by the plague, which then raged in London, he died in February 1523, and was buried in the north yard of St Paul's. He had the character of an excellent grammarian, and a successful teacher of the learned languages. His principal work is Brevissima infinitio, seu ratio grammaticae cognoscendi; Lond. 1513. Reprinted times without number, and commonly called Lilye's grammar. The English rudiments were written by Dr Colet, dean of St Paul's; and the preface to the first edition, by Cardinal Wolsey. The English syntax was written by Lilye; also the rules for the genders of nouns, beginning with propria quae maribus; and those for the preterperfect tenses and supines, beginning with As in presenti. The Latin syntax was chiefly the work of Erasmus. See Ward's preface to his edition of Lilye's Grammar, 1732.\n\nLIMA, the metropolis of Peru, contains 209 squares of buildings, which comprise 8222 doors of dwelling houses and shops, and these are branched out into 335 streets. In order to maintain peace and tranquillity among the\nLima, the inhabitants, and for the accommodation of the police, the city is divided into four quarters, containing 35 districts, over each of which there presides an alcald, who is always elected from among the people of the most distinguished rank. The population, according to estimates made at different periods, is as follows:\n\n| Year | Population |\n|------|------------|\n| 1600 | 14,262     |\n| 1614 | 25,455     |\n| 1700 | 37,259     |\n| 1746 | 60,000     |\n| 1755 | 54,000     |\n| 1781 | 60,000     |\n| 1790 | 52,627     |\n\nBy this table it appears, that from 1746 to 1755, the population suffered a diminution of 6000, which was owing to an earthquake that happened at the former period;—a calamity with which that city is often visited. Were it not for this circumstance, Lima would be a perfect paradise, as the adjacent country abounds with corn, wine, oil, sugar, fruits and flax. Such abundance of wealth do the inhabitants enjoy, that when the duke of Palata was sent from Spain as viceroy to Peru, they paved the streets through which he was to pass with ingots of silver. libertinism and debauchery are the distinguishing characteristics of the people of Lima, for which even the nuns are as notorious as the rest of the females, seldom being free from venereal complaints.\n\nIn the month of March 1543, the emperor Charles V. established an audience at Lima, in consequence of which the inhabitants were freed from the painful necessity of seeking a redress of their grievances at so great a distance as Panama. Among the excellent institutions by which the Peruvian capital is distinguished we may rank the provincial councils, which shew the constant zeal of the sovereigns of Spain for the defence of religion and preservation of discipline. The prelates, by their pastoral vigilance, spare neither pains nor labour to promote their views, to accomplish their sacred and interesting purposes.\n\nBy a decree of the Spanish emperor, which reached Lima in 1553, a university was begun in a central spot of the capital, called the university of St Mark, which is now in a most flourishing condition. Don Francisco Toledo assigned 29,312 piastras as a fund for the maintenance of the professors, arising from the tributes paid by the Indians. Two lectures are given daily on grammar, one on the Indian language, three on philosophy, three on theology, three on law, two on canons, and two on medicine. In the year 1790 an amphitheatre was erected for the use of the anatomical students.\n\nThe college for female orphans was founded by Mateo Pastor De Velasco, not at the hour of death, which often gives to charitable endowments an air of suspicion, but when he was in the full possession of perfect health. In 1597 a pious philosopher founded a charitable institution for the support of such helpless children as were laid down in the streets by their unfeeling parts. This building was destroyed by the earthquake of 1687, which laid in ruins the greater part of the city. It was afterwards rebuilt and is at present in a flourishing condition. In 1559 an hospital was erected for the relief of the unfortunate sick, who might otherwise have perished for want of medical aid, and obtained the name of the Fellowship of Charity and Compassion. A general hospital for the poor was begun about 1758, but not completed till 1770, which in 1790 afforded a comfortable asylum to 290 poor people. The asylum for penitent females was founded in 1669. It has been said that there is not a city in the world in which so many alms are distributed as in Lima.\n\nIn the centre of the great square there is a fountain of bronze, the ornaments of which are conformable to the rules of the composite order. It has an elevation of 15½ yards to the helmet of Fame, from which deducting 1½ yards for the height of that figure, the remainder gives the part to which the water rises in order to diffuse itself. This production of art, combining magnificence in every part of it with fine architectural taste, is surrounded by 24 pieces of artillery, and 16 iron chains, a narrow space being left for access to the inhabitants.\n\nCoffee-houses were not known in Lima till the year 1771, when one was opened in the street of Santo Domingo, and another the year following. A third was established in 1775, a fourth in 1782, and a fifth in 1788, in each of which there is a billiard table for the amusement of the inhabitants. We are sorry to say that the barbarous practice of cock-fighting obtains in Lima, for which purpose a building was erected in the year 1762. The tennis court is open to the public, and affords the spectator an agreeable hour of relaxation from more serious pursuits. Lima is situated in W. Long. 76° 44' S. Lat. 12° 1'.\n\nLimassol, or Limissos, a town of Cyprus, in Mariti's the south of the island. Of the ancient city nothing but ruins now remains; though it was a celebrated place, even under the government of the dukes. King Richard, the conqueror of the last of these vassals of the empire, razed it in 1191, and it was never afterwards rebuilt. This city originally was the same as Amathus, or Amathonte; so famous, as Paulanias tells us, for its temple erected in honour of Venus and Adonis. Amathus was the residence of the nine first kings of the island; and, amongst others of Onelitus, who was subjected afterwards by the arms of Artabanes, the Persian general. This city, erected into an archbishopric in the time of the Christians, has produced a number of personages celebrated for their knowledge and the sanctity of their lives. In the neighbourhood there are several copper mines, which the Turks have been forced to abandon. The following lines, in the tenth book of Ovid's Metamorphoses, prove that they were known in the time of that poet:\n\n*Capta viri forma, non jam Cytherea curat*\n*Littora, non alto repetit Paphon æquore cinetam,*\n*Pifcojamque Gnidon, gravidamque Amathunta metallis.*\n\nThe place where the new Limassol now stands formerly had the name of Nemosia, from the multitude of woods by which it was surrounded. Richard king of England having destroyed Amathonte, Guy de Lusignan, in the 12th century, laid the foundation of that new city which the Greeks called Neopolis. The family of Lusignan, who continued to embellish and fortify it, built there palaces, and Greek and Latin churches; and made it the seat of a bishop. When\nthe island was taken by the Turks in 1570, the Ottoman army entered this city on the 2d of July, and ravaged it without mercy. It was then destroyed by the flames; and at present it is only a wretched place, in which one can scarcely distinguish any remains of its ancient edifices. It is governed by a commissary and a cadi: the latter judges cases only provisionally, before they are carried to the superior tribunal of Nicosia.\n\nThe harbour is very commodious; and being sheltered from inopportun winds, it affords a safe and calm asylum to vessels when overtaken by a storm. The carob tree is here more abundant than anywhere else; and it is from the port of Limassol that the greatest quantity of its fruit is exported. The inhabitants export also salt, procured from a lake near Salines. Cotton, wheat, barley, and mulberry trees, are both plentiful and well cultivated in this part of the island: the ground also produces all kinds of garden stuff. The best Cyprus wine is made from the vines that grow on the hills of Limassol. All the wines of the country are collected in this city to be transported to Larnac, where there are the largest cellars, and which on that account becomes the natural centre of commerce.\n\n**LIMAX**, the Slug, or Naked Snail; a genus of animals belonging to the class vermes. See Helminthology Index.\n\n**LIMB**, in general, denotes the border or edge of a thing; thus we say, the limb of a quadrant, of the sun, of a leaf, &c.\n\n**Limb**, in Anatomy, an appellation given to the extremities of the body, as to the arms and legs.\n\n**Limbs**, Limbus, in the church of Rome, is used in two different senses. 1. The limb of the patriarchs is said to be the place where the patriarchs waited the redemption of mankind: in this place they suppose our Savior's soul continued from the time of his death to his resurrection. 2. The limb of infants dying without baptism, is a place supposed to be distinct both from heaven and hell; since, say they, children dying innocent of any actual sin, do not deserve hell; and, by reason of their original sin, cannot be admitted into heaven.\n\n**LIMBAT**, the name of a periodical wind common in the island of Cyprus, and of great service in moderating the heats of the climate, which would otherwise be intolerable.\n\nAccording to the abbé Mariti, it begins to blow at eight in the morning the first day; increases as the sun advances till noon; then gradually weakens, and at three falls entirely. On the second day it arises at the same hour; but it does not attain its greatest strength till about one in the afternoon, and ceases at four precisely. On the third day it begins as before; but it falls an hour later. On the five succeeding days, it follows the same progression as on the third; but it is remarked, that a little before it ceases, it becomes extremely violent. At the expiration of five days it commences a new period like the former. By narrowly observing the sea on that side from which it is about to blow, a little before it arises, one may determine what degree of strength it will have during the day. If the horizon is clear, and entirely free from clouds, the wind will be weak, and even almost inefﬁcient; but if it is dark and cloudy, the wind will be strong and violent. This limbat wind, notwithstanding its utility in moderating the excessive heat, often becomes the cause of fevers, especially to Europeans, from their being less habituated to the climate, and more apt than the natives to suffer themselves to be surprised by the cool air when in a state of perspiration. This wind, the falling of which happens an hour sooner or later, is succeeded by a calm, accompanied by a certain moisture that renders the air somewhat heavy. This moisture disappears in the evening, being diffused by a wind which arises every day at that period. This wind is considered as a land breeze by the inhabitants of the southern and eastern parts of the island; but it is called a sea breeze by those in the northern and western, who indeed receive it immediately from the sea. In summer it blows till four o'clock in the morning, and when it ceases, it leaves a profound calm, which continues till the hour when the limbat commences. In autumn and winter it never falls till daybreak, when it is succeeded by other winds, which proceed from the irregularity of the season. In spring it does not continue longer than midnight; and is then succeeded by that happy calm, during which those refreshing dews are formed that moisten the earth at sunrise. The limbat winds, which arise in the beginning of summer, cease about the middle of September; and this is the period when the most insupportable heats commence, because their violence is not moderated by the mildest breeze. They are however, luckily not of long duration; and about the latter end of October they decrease sensibly, as the atmosphere begins to be loaded with watery clouds.\n\n**LIMBORCH, PHILIP**, a learned writer among the remonstrants, born at Amsterdam in 1633. After having made great proficiency in his studies, he was, in 1655, admitted to preach in public, which he did ﬁrst at Haerlem. His sermons had in them no affected eloquence; but were solid, methodical, and edifying. He was chosen minister of Gouda; from whence he was called to Amsterdam, where he had the proﬁciency of divinity, in which he acquitted himself with great reputation till his death, which happened in 1712. He had an admirable genius, and a tenacious memory. He had many friends of distinction in foreign parts as well as in his own country. Some of his letters to Mr Locke are printed with those of that celebrated author. He had all the qualifications suitable to the character of a sincere divine, lived an example of every virtue, and preserved the vigour of his body and mind to a considerable age. He wrote many works, which are esteemed; the principal of which are, 1. *Amica colloquio de veritate religionis Christianae cum erudito judaeo*, in 12mo. 2. A Complete Body of Divinity, according to the opinions and doctrines of the Remonstrants. 3. A History of the Inquisition; which has been translated into English by Dr Samuel Chandler. Limborch also published the works of the famous Episcopius, who was his great-uncle by the mother’s side.\n\n**LIMBURGH DUCHY**, a province of the Austrian Netherlands, bounded by the duchy of Juliers on the north and east, by Luxemburg on the south, and by the bishopric of Liege on the west. It is about 30 miles in length, and 25 in breadth; and consists of good arable and pasture land, with plenty of wood, and some iron mines.\n\n**LIMBURGH**, the capital city of the duchy of Limburgh,\nLimeburgh, in the Austrian Netherlands, is seated on a steep rock near the river Velle. This town is small, but pleasantly seated on a hill, with shady woods; and consists chiefly of one broad street, not very well built. It is strong by situation, and almost inaccessible; however, it was taken by the French in 1675, and by the confederates under the duke of Marlborough in 1723, for the house of Austria, to whom it remains by the treaties of Rastadt and Baden, after having been dismantled. It is famous for its cheese, which is exceeding good.\n\nE. Long. 6. 8. N. Lat. 50. 40.\n\nLIME, a peculiar earth. See Chemistry Index.\n\nLime-Tree. See Citrus, Botany Index.\n\nLime or Linden-Tree. See Tilia, Botany Index.\n\nLime-Water. See Pharmacy Index.\n\nLime, or Lyme. See Lyme.\n\nLIMERICK, a county of Ireland, in the province of Munster, is bounded on the east by Tipperary, on the west by Kerry, on the north by the river Shannon, and on the south by Cork. It is a fruitful and populous tract, the soil requiring little or no manure in most places; besides rich pasture for sheep and cows, it produces rich crops of all kinds of corn and rape, with some hemp. It gave title of earl to the family of Donegal. It contains 375,320 Irish plantation acres, about 56 church livings, though a much greater number of parishes, 10 baronies, three boroughs; and formerly sent eight members to parliament. It has some clays, furze, fern, and mountain lands, and is famous for good cider; it has been much benefited by the Palatines, who settled there and increased tillage; they are a laborious independent people, mostly employed in their own farms. This county is well watered by large and small rivers; the Shannon runs at the north side of the county, and fertilizes its banks. The firing of the inhabitants is chiefly turf, and the bogs are conveniently situated. At Loghill in the west of the county, there is a mine of coal or culm, but it is more used in kilns than in houses. There are few lakes except Lough Gur; and the principal hills are Knockgryny, Knockanny, Knockfiring and Tory-hill. The mountains lie westward, the highest being Knockpatrick or St Patrick's hill. This county is about 45 miles long and 42 broad.\n\nLimerick, or Long-Meath, a market town, a borough, and a bishop's see, now the metropolis of the province of Munster. It is situated on the river Shannon, 94 miles from Dublin; and was the strongest fortres in the kingdom. Its ancient name was Lunneach; and during the first ages it was much frequented by foreign merchants, and after the arrival of the Danes was a place of considerable commerce until the 12th century. It was plundered by Mahon, brother of Brien Boromh, after the battle of Sulchoid, in 970; and Brien, in a future period, exacted from the Danes of this city 365 tons of wine as a tribute, which shows the extensive traffic carried on by those people in that article. About the middle of the 6th century, St Munchin erected a church and founded a bishopric here; which, however, was destroyed by the Danes on their taking possession of this port in 853, and remained in ruins until their conversion to the Christian faith in the 10th century; at which period the church of St Munchin was rebuilt, and the bishopric established.\n\nDonald O'Brien, about the time of the arrival of the Limerick English, founded and endowed the cathedral; and Donat O'Brien, bishop of Limerick, in the 13th century, contributed much to the opulence of the see. About the close of the 12th century, the bishopric of Innis-Ca-thay was united to that of Limerick. It was besieged by King William III. in the year 1692, and though there was no army to assist it, the king was obliged to raise the siege. In the year 1691, it was again besieged by the English and Dutch on the 21st of September; and it was obliged to surrender on the 13th of October following, not without the loss of abundance of men; however, the garrison had very honourable and advantageous conditions, being permitted to retire where they thought fit, and the Roman catholics by these articles were to be tolerated in the free exercise of their religion. Within a century this place was reckoned the second city in Ireland; at present it has lost its rank; not because it thrives less, but because Cork thrives more. It is composed of the Irish and English town; the latter stands on the King's island, formed by the river Shannon. The town is three miles in circumference, having weekly markets on Wednesday and Saturday, and fairs on Easter Tuesday, 1st July, 4th August, and 12th December. There is a privilege annexed to the fair held on 4th August, that during 15 days, no person can be arrested in the city or liberties, on any process issuing out of the tholfe court of Limerick. Ardferd and Achadoe, in the county of Kerry, are united to the bishopric of Limeric. This city formerly returned two members to parliament; and gives title of viscount to the family of Hamilton. It is governed by a mayor, sheriffs, recorder, aldermen, and burgesses; there is also a barrack and a military governor and town major; it had some time the privilege of coinage; and different parliaments have been held there. The town was formerly entirely walled in; and in 1760, there were 17 of the city gates standing; but to the great improvement of the place they are now all demolished, except the water-gate of King John's castle. The linen, woollen, and paper manufactures, are carried on here to great extent, and the export of provisions is very considerable. Here are many charitable hospitals, and handsome public buildings, besides the cathedral and other churches. A charter was granted to this city by King John, and confirmed in succeeding reigns. Dr Campbell observes, that as you approach Limerick, the grounds grow rich and exquisitely beautiful; the only disagreeable matter is, that the situation renders the air moist, and consequently rather unwholesome to strangers. About six miles from this is the famous Cattle-connel spa. Limerick is 50 miles from Cork, 50 from Galway, and 73 from Waterford. It appears that Limerick obtained the privilege of having mayors 10 years before that right was allowed to the citizens of London. It was before governed by provosts, of which the first was John Spafford in 1195 and 1197; during the provostship of Henry Troy a charter was granted, 9 Richard I. whereby the citizens were allowed to choose mayors and bailiffs. Adam Servant, in 1198, being the first mayor. It continued to be governed by mayors and bailiffs, until the office of bailiff was changed into that of sheriff in 1629.\n\nLimerick\nLIMBERICK is also the name of a fair-town in the county of Wexford and province of Leinster; the fairs are four in the year.\n\nLIMITINGTON, a town of Hampshire in England. See Lymington.\n\nLIMIT, in a restrained sense, is used by mathematicians for a determined quantity to which a variable one continually approaches; in which sense, the circle may be said to be the limit of its circumscribed and inscribed polygons. In Algebra, the term limit is applied to two quantities, one of which is greater and the other less than another quantity; and in this sense it is used in speaking of the limits of equations, whereby their solution is much facilitated.\n\nLIMITED PROBLEM, denotes a problem that has but one solution, or some determinate number of solutions; as to describe a circle through three given points that do not lie in a right line, which is limited to one solution only; to divide a parallelogram into two equal parts by a line parallel to one side, which admits of two solutions, according as the line is parallel to the length or breadth of the parallelogram; or to divide a triangle in any ratio by a line parallel to one side, which is limited to three solutions, as the line may be parallel to any of the three sides.\n\nLIMME, a town of Kent, in England, near Hethe, and four miles from Romney, was formerly a port, till choked up by the sands; and though it is thereby become a poor town, yet it has the horn and mace and other tokens left of its ancient grandeur, and used to be the place where the lord warden of the cinque ports was sworn at his entrance upon his office. The Roman road from Canterbury, called Stone Street, ended here; and from the brow of its hill may be seen the ruinous Roman walls almost at the bottom of the marthes. Here formerly was a castle, now converted into a farm-house. When or by whom this edifice was erected is not known. It has, however, great marks of antiquity; as has also the adjoining church, on which are several old tombstones with crosses on them.\n\nLINING, the art of painting in water colours, in contradiction to painting which is done in oil-colours.\n\nLimning is much the more ancient kind of painting. Till a Flemish painter, one John van Eyck, better known by the name of John of Bruges, found out the art of painting in oil, the painters all painted in water and in fresco, both on their walls, on wooden boards, and elsewhere. When they made use of boards, they usually glued a fine linen cloth over them, to prevent their opening; then laid on a ground of white; lastly, they mixed up their colours with water and size, or with water and yolks of eggs, well beaten with the branches of a fig tree, the juice whereof thus mixed with the eggs; and with this mixture they painted their pieces.\n\nIn limning, all colours are proper enough, except the white made of lime, which is only used in fresco. The azure and ultramarine must always be mixed with size or gum; but there are always applied two layers of hot size before the size colours are laid on: the colours are all ground in water each by itself; and, as they are required in working, are diluted with size water. When the piece is finished, they go over it with the white of an egg well beaten; and then with varnish, if required.\n\nTo limn, or draw a face in colours: Having all the materials in readiness, lay the prepared colour on the card even and thin, free from hairs and spots, over the place where the picture is to be. The ground being laid, and the party placed in a due position, begin the work, which is to be done at three sittings. At the first you are only to dead-colour the face, which will require about two hours. At the second sitting, go over the work more curiously, adding its particular graces or deformities. At the third sitting, finish the whole; carefully remarking whatever may conduce to render the piece perfect, as the cast of the eyes, moles, scars, gashes, and the like.\n\nLIMOGES, an ancient town of France, in the late province of Guienne, and capital of the department of Upper Vienne, with a bishop's see. It is a trading place, and its horses are in great esteem. It is seated on the river Vienne, in E. Long. 1° 20' N. Lat. 45° 50'.\n\nLIMOSIN, a late province of France, now the department of Upper Vienne, bounded on the north by La Marche, on the east by Auvergne, on the south by Quercy, and on the west by Perigord and Angoumois. One part is very cold, but the other more temperate. It is covered with forests of chestnut trees; and contains mines of lead, copper, tin, and iron; but the principal trade consists in cattle and horses.\n\nLIMPET, a genus of shell-fish. See Patella, Conchology Index.\n\nLIMPURG, a barony of Germany, in the circle of Franconia, included almost entirely within Swabia, and seated to the south of Hall in Swabia. It is about 15 miles long, and eight broad. Gaildorf and Schonburg, near which is the castle of Limpurg, are the principal places.\n\nLIMPURG, a town of Germany, in the electorate of Triers or Treves, and in Wetteravia, formerly free and imperial, but now subject to the electorate of Treves. It is seated on the river Lahn. E. Long. 8° 13' N. Lat. 50° 18'.\n\nLINARIA. See Fringilla, Ornithology Index.\n\nLINACRE, Thomas, physician, was born at Canterbury about the year 1460, and there educated under the learned William Selling: thence he removed to Oxford, and in 1484 was chosen fellow of All-Soul's college. Tilly, alias Selling, his former instructor, being at this time appointed ambassador from King Henry VII. to the court of Rome, Mr Linacre accompanied him to Italy, where he attained the highest degree of perfection in the Greek and Latin languages. At Rome, he applied himself particularly to the study of Aristotle and Galen, in the original. On his return to Oxford, he was incorporated doctor of physic, and chosen public professor in that faculty. But he had not been long in England, before he was commanded to court by King Henry VII. to attend the young prince Arthur as his tutor and physician. He was afterwards appointed physician to the king, and after his death, to his successor Henry VIII. Dr Linacre founded two medical lectures at Oxford, and one at Cambridge; but that which most effectually immortalized his name among the faculty, is his being the first founder of the college of physicians in London. He beheld with vexation\nLincoln, in which are the entrails of Queen Eleanor, wife to Edward I. It is said there were anciently 52 churches, which are now reduced to 14. Such is the magnificence and elevation of the cathedral, that the monks thought the sight of it must be very mortifying to the devil; whence it came to be said of one who was displeased, that he looked like the devil over Lincoln. The declivity on which the city is built being steep, the communication betwixt the upper and lower town is very troublesome, and coaches and horses are obliged to make a compass.\n\nKing Edward III. made this city a staple for wool, leather, lead, &c. It was once burnt; once besieged by King Stephen, who was here defeated and taken prisoner; and once taken by Henry III. from his rebellious barons. It abounded heretofore with monasteries and other religious houses. There is a great pool here, formed by the river on the west side of it, called Swan Pool, because of the multitude of swans on it. The Roman north gate still remains entire, by the name of Newport Gate. It is one of the noblest of this sort in Britain. It is a vast semicircle of stones of very large dimensions laid without mortar, connected only by their uniform shape. This magnificent arch is 16 feet in diameter, the stones are four feet thick at the bottom. It seems to have a joint in the middle not a keystone; and on both sides, towards the upper part, are laid horizontal stones of great dimensions, some 10 or 12 feet long. This arch rises from an impost of large mouldings, which are not perceivable now; there are also divers fragments of the old Roman wall. Over against the castle is an entrenchment cast up by King Stephen; and here are carved the arms of John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster, who lived here like a king, and had a mint. The city has a communication with the Trent, by a canal called the Fosdyke. In the centre of the old ruined castle there is a handsome modern structure for holding the affizes. Its walls are almost entire, and very substantial; the keep or principal tower is situated on a high and very steep mount, which yet continues in its original state, but the remains of the tower on it are only five or six yards high. The outer walls of the castle are of very considerable height, which appear still higher than they really are from their lofty situation and the moat below them. The great gateway is still entire. This city is a county of itself, and has a vicountial jurisdiction, for 20 miles round, which is a privilege that no other city in England can equal. It now consists principally of one street above two miles long, well paved, besides several crofts and parallel streets well peopled. Here are some very handsome modern buildings, but more antique ones; upon the whole, it has an air of ancient greatness, arising in a great measure from the number of monastic remains, most of which are now converted into stables, out-houses, &c. Upon the hill, in the castle, are the ruins of the bishop's palace, and other ruins of ancient grandeur and magnificence. The city is supplied with water by several conduits, among which is a modern one, somewhat in the pyramidal style, enriched with sculpture. It is governed by a mayor, twelve aldermen, two sheriffs, a recorder, four chamberlains, a swordbearer, four coroners, and above forty common-council men. Here are four charity schools, where 120 poor children are taught by\nthe widows of clergymen. The neighbouring course is noted for its frequent horse-races. On the down of Lincoln, towards Boston, that rare fowl the bustard is sometimes seen, as well as on Salisbury Plain. Lincoln-Heath extends above 50 miles, viz. from Sleaford and Ancaster south to the Humber north, though it is but three or four miles over where broadest. Five miles from Bolsover on this extensive heath, Lord le Despenzer built a tower for the direction of strangers. It is a lofty square building with a staircase, terminating in a flat roof, and round the base is a square court-yard. Great part of this extensive heath has been enclosed. We read that David king of Scots met King John here, on the 22d of November, in the third year of his reign, and performed homage to him on a hill without the city, for his English territories, in presence of the archbishops of Canterbury, York, and Regulus, 13 bishops, and a vast number of temporal lords and knights. King Henry VII kept his court here at Easter in 1486. The Jews were once its chief inhabitants, till they were forced to remove, after having impiously crucified the child of one Grantham, and thrown it into a well, to this day called Grantham's Well. Lincoln has given the title of earl to the family of Clinton ever since the reign of Queen Elizabeth. W. Long. 27. i. N. Lat. 53° 16'.\n\nLincolnshire, a maritime county of England, 77 miles in length and 48 in breadth, is bounded on the east by the German ocean, on the west by Nottinghamshire, on the north by Yorkshire, on the south by Rutlandshire, Northamptonshire, and Cambridgeshire. It contains 63 parishes, and 31 market towns, and returns 12 members to parliament. The principal rivers are the Humber, the Trent, the Witham, the Nene, the Welland, the Ancham, and the Dun. It is divided into three parts, Lindsey, Ketton, and Holland; the air of which last is unwholesome and foggy, on account of the fens and large marshes. The soil of the north and west parts is very fertile, and abounds in corn and pastures. The east and south parts are not so proper for corn; but then they supply them with fish and fowl in great plenty, particularly ducks and geese. Lincoln is the principal town. By inland navigation, this county has communication with the rivers Mersey, Dee, Ribble, Ouse, Darwent, Severn, Thames, Avon, &c. which navigation, including its windings, extends above 500 miles through different counties.\n\nThis county in 1801, contained 41,395 houses, inhabited by 42,629 families; and the total number of inhabitants amounted to 208,557.\n\nLindesfarn, or Landisfarn. See Holy Island.\n\nLindsay, Sir David, a celebrated Scots poet, was descended of an ancient family, and born in the reign of King James IV. at his father's seat, called the Mount, near Cupar, in Fifeshire. He was educated at the university of St Andrew's; and, after making the tour of Europe, returned to Scotland in the year 1514. Soon after his arrival, he was appointed gentleman of the bedchamber to the king, and tutor to the young prince, afterwards James V. From the verses prefixed to his dream, we learn that he enjoyed several other honourable employments at court: but, in 1533, he was deprived of all his places, except that of Lion king at arms, which he held to the time of his death. His disgrace was most probably owing to his invectives against the clergy, which are frequent in all his writings. After the decease of King James V. Sir David became a favourite of the earl of Arran, regent of Scotland; but the abbot of Paisley did not suffer him to continue long in favour with the earl. He then retired to his paternal estate, and spent the remainder of his days in rural tranquillity. He died in the year 1553. His poetical talents, considering the age in which he wrote, were not contemptible; but he treats the Roman clergy with great severity, and writes with some humour: but, whatever merit might be formerly attributed to him, he takes such licentious liberties with words, stretching or carving them for measure or rhyme, that the Scots have a proverb, when they hear an unusual expression, that, There is nae sic a word in a' Davie Lindsay. Mackenzie tells us, that his comedies were so facetious, that they afforded abundance of mirth. Some fragments of these comedies are still preserved in manuscript. He is said to have also written several tragedies, and to have first introduced dramatic poetry into Scotland. One of his comedies was played in 1515. Mackenzie says, he understood nothing of the rules of the theatre. He was contemporary with John Heywood, the first English dramatic poet. His poems are printed in one small volume; and fragments of his plays, in manuscript, are in Mr William Carmichael's collection.\n\nLindsey, the third and largest division of the county of Lincolnshire in England. On the east and north it is washed by the sea, into which it runs out with a large front; on the west it has Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, from which it is parted by the rivers Trent and Dun; on the south it has Kesteven, from which it is separated by the river Witham and the Foss-dyke, which is seven miles long, and was cut by Henry I. between the Witham and the Trent, for the convenience of carriage in those parts. It had its name from Lincoln, the capital of the county, which stands in it, and by the Romans called Lindum, by the Britons Lindoceite, by the Saxons Lindo-colynpe, probably from its situation on a hill, and the lakes or woods that were anciently thereabouts; but the Normans called it Nichol. It gives title of earl and marquis to the duke of Ancaster.\n\nLindus, in Ancient Geography, a town of Rhodes, situated on a hill on the west side of the island. It was built by Telepomus the son of Hercules, according to Diodorus Siculus; by one of the Heliades, grandsons of the Sun, named Lindus, according to Strabo. It was the native place of Cleobulus, one of the wise men. Here we see the famous temple of the Lindian Minerva, which was built by the daughters of Danaus. Cadmus enriched this temple with many splendid offerings. The citizens dedicated and hung up here the seventh of Pindar's Olympic odes, written in letters of gold. The ruins of that superb edifice are still to be seen on the top of a high hill which overlooks the sea. Some remains of the walls, consisting of stones of an enormous size, still show it to have been built in the Egyptian style. The pillars and other ornaments have been carried off. On the most elevated peak of the rock are the ruins of a castle, which may have served as a fortress to the city. Its circumference is very extensive, and is filled with rubbish.\nLindo, the modern city, stands at the foot of the hill. A bay of considerable wideness and depth serves as a harbour to the city. Ships find good anchorage there in twenty fathoms water. They are safely sheltered from the south-west winds, which constantly prevail through the severest season of the year. In the beginning of winter, they cast anchor off a small village named Maffary. Before the building of Rhodes, Lindus was the harbour which received the fleets of Egypt and Tyre. It was enriched by commerce. Mr Savary observes, that a judicious government, by taking advantage of its harbour and happy situation, might yet restore it to a flourishing state.\n\n**Line**, in Geometry, a quantity extended in length only, without any breadth or thickness. It is formed by the flux or motion of a point. See Fluxions, and Geometry.\n\n**Line**, in the art of war, is understood of the disposition of an army ranged in order of battle, with the front extended as far as may be, that it may not be flanked.\n\n**Line of Battle**, is also understood of a disposition of the fleet in the day of engagement; on which occasion the vessels are usually drawn up as much as possible in a straight line, as well to gain and keep the advantage of the wind as to run the same board. See Naval Tactics.\n\n**Horizontal Line**, in Geography and Astronomy, a line drawn parallel to the horizon of any part of the earth.\n\n**Equinoctial Line**, in Geography, is a great circle on the earth's surface, exactly at the distance of 90° from each of the poles, and of consequence bisecting the earth in that part. From this imaginary line, the degrees of longitude and latitude are counted.—In astronomy, the equinoctial line is that circle which the sun seems to describe round the earth on the days of the equinox in March and September. See Astronomy and Geography.\n\n**Meridian Line**, is an imaginary circle drawn through the two poles of the earth and any part of its surface. See Geography Index.\n\n**Ship of the Line**, a vessel large enough to be drawn up in the line, and to have a place in a sea-fight.\n\n**Line**, in Genealogy, a series or succession of relations in various degrees, all descending from the same common father. See Descent.\n\n**Line**, also denotes a French measure containing the 12th part of an inch, or the 144th part of a foot. Geometers conceive the line subdivided into six points. The French line answers to the English barley-corn.\n\n**Fishing Line**. See Fishing Line.\n\n**Lines**, in Heraldry, the figures used in armories to divide the shield into different parts, and to compose different figures. These lines, according to their different forms and names, give denomination to the pieces or figures which they form, except the straight or plain lines. See Heraldry.\n\n**Linea alba**, in Anatomy, the concourse of the tendons of the oblique and transverse muscles of the abdomen; dividing the abdomen in two, in the middle. It is called linea, line, as being straight; and alba, from its colour, which is white.—The linea alba receives a twig of a nerve from the intercostals in each of its dilineaments or indentings, which are visible to the eye, in lean persons especially.\n\n**Lineament**, among painters, is used for the outlines of a face.\n\n**Linear numbers**, in Mathematics, such as have relation to length only; such is a number which represents one side of a plain figure. If the plain figure be a square, the linear figure is called a root.\n\n**Linear Problem**, that which may be solved geometrically by the intersection of two right lines. This is called a simple problem, and is capable but of one solution.\n\n**Linens**, in commerce, a well known kind of cloth, chiefly made of flax.—Linens was not worn by the Jews, Greeks, or Romans, as any part of their ordinary dress. Under-wraps of a finer texture supplied the place of shirts: Hence the occasion for frequent bathing. Alexander Severus was the first emperor who wore a shirt: but the use of so necessary a garment did not become common till long after him.\n\nThe linen manufacture was probably introduced into Britain with the first settlements of the Romans. The flax was certainly first planted by that nation in the British soil. The plant itself indeed appears to have been originally a native of the east. The woollen-draper would naturally be prior in its origin to the linen; and the fibrous plants from which the threads of the latter are produced, seem to have been first noticed and worked by the inhabitants of Egypt. In Egypt, indeed, the linen manufacture appears to have been very early: for even in Joseph's time it had risen to a considerable height. From the Egyptians the knowledge of it proceeded probably to the Greeks, and from them to the Romans. Even at this day the flax is imported among us from the eastern nations; the western kind being merely a degenerate species of it.\n\nIn order to succeed in the linen manufacture, one set of people should be confined to the ploughing and preparing the soil, sowing and covering the seed, to the weeding, pulling, rippling, and taking care of the new seed, and watering and dressing the flax till it is lodged at home: others should be concerned in the drying, breaking, scutching, and heckling the flax, to fit it for the spinners; and others in spinning and reeling it, to fit it for the weaver; others should be concerned in taking due care of the weaving, bleaching, beating, and finishing the cloth for the market. It is reasonable to believe, that if these several branches of the manufacture were carried on by distinct dealers in Scotland and Ireland, where our home-made linens are manufactured, the several parts would be better executed, and the whole would be afforded cheaper, and with greater profit.\n\n**Staining of Linen**. Linen receives a black colour with much more difficulty than woollen or cotton. The black struck on linen with common vitriol and galls, or logwood, is very perishable, and soon washes out.—Instead of the vitriol, a solution of iron in four strong beer is to be made use of. This is well known to all the calico-printers; and by the use of this, which they call their iron-liquor, and madder root, are the blacks and purples made which we see on the common printed linens.\nThe method of making this iron-liquor is as follows: A quantity of iron is put into the four strong beer; and, to promote the diffusion of the metal, the whole is occasionally well stirred, the liquor occasionally drawn off, and the rust beat from the iron, after which the liquor is poured on again. A length of time is required to make the impregnation perfect; the solution being reckoned unfit for use till it has stood at least a twelve month. This solution stains the linen of a yellow, and different shades of buff-colour; and is the only known substance by which these colours can be fixed on linen. The cloth stained deep with the iron-liquor, and afterwards boiled with madder, without any other addition, becomes of the dark colour which we see on printed linens and cottons; which, if not a perfect black, has a very near resemblance to it. Others are stained paler with the same liquor diluted with water, and come out purple.\n\nLinen may also be stained of a durable purple by means of solution of gold in aqua regia. The solution for this purpose should be as fully saturated as possible; it should be diluted with three times its quantity of water; and if the colour is required deep, the piece, when dry, must be repeatedly moistened with it. The colour does not take place till a considerable time, sometimes several days, after the liquor has been applied: to hasten its appearance, the subject should be exposed to the sun and free air, and occasionally removed to a moist place, or moistened with water.—When solution of gold in aqua regia is soaked up in linen clothes, the metal may be recovered by drying and burning them.\n\nLinens flowered with Gold-leaf. Dr Lewis mentions a manufacture established in London for embellishing linen with flowers and ornaments of gold-leaf. The linen, he says, looks whiter than most of the printed linens; the gold is extremely beautiful, and bears washing well. The doctor informs us, that he had seen a piece which he was credibly informed had been washed three or four times, with only the same precautions which are used for the finer printed linens; and on which the gold continued entire, and of great beauty. Concerning the process used in this manufacture, he gives us no particulars.\n\nFossil Linen, is a kind of amiantus, which consists of flexible, parallel, soft fibres, and which has been celebrated for the uses to which it has been applied, of being woven, and forming an incriminable cloth. Paper also, and wicks for lamps, have been made of it. See Amiantus, Asbestos, and Mineralogy Index.\n\nLING, a species of fish belonging to the genus Gadus, which see in Ichthyology Index.\n\nLINGEN, a strong town of Germany, in the circle of Westphalia, and capital of a county of the same name. It belongs to the king of Prussia; and is situated on the river Embs, in E. Long. 7° 30' N. Lat. 52° 32'.\n\nLINIMENT, in Pharmacy, a composition of a consistence somewhat thinner than an unguent, and thicker than an oil. See Materia Medica Index.\n\nLINLITHGOW, the chief town of West Lothian in Scotland. It is supposed to be the Lindum of Ptolemy; and to take its name from its situation on a lake, which the word Lin or Llyn signifies.—It is distant 16 miles from Edinburgh, and is a royal borough and seat of a presbytery. Here is carried on a considerable trade Linlithgow, in dressing of white leather, which is sent abroad to be manufactured; and many hands are employed in dressing of flax; also in wool-combing, the wool for which is brought from the borders. Its port was formerly Blackness; but since the decline of that place, Borrowstounness, about two miles distant from Linlithgow. The town consists of one open street, from whence lanes are detached on both sides; the houses are built of stone, tolerably neat and commodious; and the place is adorned with some stately public edifices. The palace, built as Sibbald supposed, on the seat of a Roman station, forms a square with towers at the corners, and stands on a gentle eminence, with the beautiful loch behind it to the west. It was one of the noblest of the royal residences; and was greatly ornamented by James V. and VI. Within the palace is a handsome square; one side of which is more modern than the others, having been built by James VI. and kept in good repair till 1746, when it was accidentally damaged by the king's forces making fires on the hearths, by which means the joists were burnt. A stone ornamented fountain in the middle of the court was destroyed at the same time. The other sides of the square are more ancient. In one is a room ninety-five feet long, thirty feet six inches wide, and thirty-three high. At one end is a gallery with three arches, perhaps for music. Narrow galleries run quite round the old part, to preserve communication with the rooms; in one of which the unfortunate Mary Stuart first saw light. On the north side of the high street, on an eminence east of the palace, stands St Michael's church; a handsome structure, where James V. intended to have erected a throne and twelve stalls for the sovereign and knights of the order of St Andrew. In the market-place is another fountain of two stories with eight spouts, and surmounted like the former with an imperial crown. In one of the streets is shown the gallery where the regent Murray was shot. Here was a house of Carmelites, founded by the townpeople in 1292, destroyed by the Reformers 1559. The family of Livingston, who took the title of earl from this place, were hereditary keepers of this palace, as also bailiffs of the king's bailiwick, and constables of Blackness castle; but by their concern in the rebellion of 1715 all these honours with their estate were forfeited to the crown. Sir James Livingston, son of the first earl by marriage with a daughter of Caledon, was created earl of Caledon by Charles I., 1641, which title sunk into the other.\n\nLINLITHGOWSHIRE, or WEST LOTHIAN, nearly approaches in form to a parallelogram, about 20 miles long from east to west, and from 10 to 13 broad, from north to south. It is bounded by the river Forth on the north; by the river Almond on the south-east; by Lanarkshire on the south-west; and by the river Avon on the west. It is allowed to be one of the richest counties in Scotland, the soil in general being a rich loam, in a high state of cultivation and improvement. Its surface is diversified by gentle swells and fertile plains; and the number of elegant seats almost everywhere to be met with, gives it both a rich and delightful appearance. The whole is a composition of all that is great and beautiful; towns, villages, seats, and ancient towers, decorate each bank of that fine expanse of water, the frith of Forth. The lofty mountains...\nLinlithgow-tains of the Highlands form a distant, but august boundary towards the north-west; and the eastern view is enlivened with ships perpetually appearing or vanishing, amidst the numerous islands. Hopetoun-house, Bambougle-castle, Calder-house, Craigie-hall, and the seat of General Dundas, are some of the principal ornaments of this county. It contains two royal boroughs, Linlithgow and Queensferry, besides the towns of Borrowstounness, Bathgate, and Kirkliston. It is poorly supplied with running water, the Avon and Amond being the only streams which are deserving of notice. There are many valuable minerals found in it in abundance, such as coal, limestone, and some lead ore. In the reign of James VI., a vein of lead was discovered, so rich in silver, that it was thought worthy of being wrought for the sake of that metal alone. Almost every parish abounds with ironstone, which is extensively wrought in the parish of Bathgate. In many places there are appearances of whinstone or basalt, particularly at Dundas-hill, in the parish of Dalmeny, where there is a solid front of basaltic rock, exhibiting in some places regular columns. The population of this county in 1801 amounted to 17,844. The following is the population of the parishes according to the Statistical History.\n\n| Parish          | Population in 1755 | Population in 1792-1798 |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Abercorn        | 1937               | 870                    |\n| Bathgate        | 1594               | 3309                   |\n| Borrowstounness | 2668               | 3178                   |\n| Carriden        | 1164               | 1450                   |\n| Dalmeny         | 1103               | 907                    |\n| Ecclefechan     | 351                | 215                    |\n| Kirkliston      | 1461               | 1504                   |\n| Linlithgow      | 3296               | 3221                   |\n| Livingstone     | 598                | 420                    |\n| Queensferry     | 451                | 505                    |\n| Torphichen      | 1295               | 1069                   |\n| Uphall          | 690                | 600                    |\n| Whitburn        | 1121               | 1322                   |\n\nIncrease, 741\n\nLINNAEUS, Sir Charles, a celebrated botanist and natural historian, was born on May 23, 1707, in a village called Roefshult in Smaland, where his father, Nicholas Linnæus, was then vicar, but afterwards preferred to the curacy of Stenbrohult. We are told, that on the farm where Linnæus was born, there yet stands a large lime tree, from which his ancestors took the surnames of Tillander, Lindelius, and Linnæus; and that this origin of surnames, taken from natural objects, is not uncommon in Sweden.\n\nThis eminent man, whose talents enabled him to reform the whole science of natural history, accumulated, very early in life, some of the highest honours that await the most successful proficient in medical science; since we find that he was made professor of physic and botany, in the university of Upsal, at the age of 34; and six years afterwards, physician to Adolphus king of Sweden; who in the year 1753 honoured him still farther, by creating him knight of the order of the Polar Star. His honours did not terminate here: for Linnæus, in 1757 he was ennobled; and in 1776 the king of Sweden accepted the resignation of his office, and re-warded his declining years by doubling his pension, and by a liberal donation of landed property settled on him and his family.\n\nIt seems probable, that Linnæus's taste for the study of nature was caught from the example of his father; who, as he has himself informed us, cultivated, as his first amusement, a garden plentifully stored with plants. Young Linnæus soon became acquainted with these, as well as with the indigenous ones of his neighbourhood. Yet, from the strictness of his father's income, our young naturalist was on the point of being destined to a mechanical employment; fortunately, however, this design was overruled. In 1717 he was sent to school at Wexio; where, as his opportunities were enlarged, his progress in all his favourite pursuits was proportionally extended. At this early period he paid attention to other branches of natural history, particularly to the knowledge of insects.\n\nThe first part of his academical education Linnæus received under Professor Stobaeus, at Lund, in Scania, who favoured his inclinations to the study of natural history. After a residence of about a year, he removed in 1728 to Upsal. Here he soon contracted a close friendship with Arctei, a native of the province of Angermania, who had already been four years a student in that university, and, like himself, had a strong bent to the study of natural history in general, but particularly to ichthyology. Soon after his residence at Upsal, our author was also happy enough to obtain the favour of several gentlemen of established character in literature. He was in a particular manner encouraged in the pursuit of his studies by the patronage of Dr Olaus Celsius, at that time professor of divinity, and the restorer of natural history in Sweden; who, being struck with the diligence of Linnæus in describing the plants of the Upsal garden, and his extensive knowledge of their names, not only patronized him in a general way, but admitted him to his house, his table, and his library. Under such encouragement it is not strange that our author made a rapid progress, both in his studies and the esteem of the professors: in fact, we have a very striking proof of his merit and attainments; since we find, that, after only two years residence, he was thought sufficiently qualified to give lectures occasionally from the botanic chair, in the room of Professor Rudbeck.\n\nIn the year 1731, the Royal Academy of Sciences at Upsal having for some time meditated the design of improving the natural history of Sweden, at the instance particularly of Professors Celsius and Rudbeck, deputed Linnæus to make the tour of Lapland, with the sole view of exploring the natural history of that arctic region; to which undertaking, his reputation, already high as a naturalist, and the strength of his constitution, equally recommended him. He left Upsal the 13th of May, and took his route to Gevalia or Gevels, the principal town of Gefritcia, 45 miles distant from Upsal. Hence he travelled through Helsingland into Medelpadia, where he made an excursion, and ascended a remarkable mountain before he reached Hudwickwald, the chief town of Helsingland. From hence he went through Angermanland to Hermonland,\nLinnaeus, Hofland, a sea-port on the Bothnic gulf, 76 miles distant from Hudwickswald. When he had proceeded thus far, he found it proper to retard his journey, as the spring was not sufficiently advanced; and took this opportunity of visiting those remarkable caverns on the summit of Mount Skula, though at the hazard of his life.\n\nWhen Linnaeus arrived at Uma, in West Bothnia, about 66 miles from Hernosand, he quitted the public road, and took his course through the woods westward, in order first to traverse the most southern parts of Lapland. Being now come to the country that was more particularly the object of his inquiries, equally a stranger to the language and to the manners of the people, and without any associate, he committed himself to the hospitality of the inhabitants, and never failed to experience it fully. He speaks in several places, with peculiar satisfaction, of the innocence and simplicity of their lives, and their freedom from diseases. In this excursion he reached the mountains towards Norway; and, after encountering great hardships, returned into West Bothnia, quite exhausted with fatigue. Our traveller next visited Pitha and Lula, upon the gulf of Bothnia; from which latter place he took again a western route, by proceeding up the river of that name, and visited the ruins of the temple of Jockmock in Lula Lapland or Lap Mark: thence he traversed what is called the Lapland Desert, destitute of all villages, cultivation, roads, or any conveniences; inhabited only by a few straggling people, originally descended from the Finns, who settled in this country in remote ages, being entirely a distinct people from the Laplanders. In this district he ascended a noted mountain called Wallevart; in speaking of which he has given us a pleasant relation of his finding a singular and beautiful new plant (Andromeda tetragon) when travelling within the arctic circle, with the sun in his view at midnight, in search of a Lapland hut. From hence he crossed the Lapland Alps into Finnmark, and traversed the shores of the North Sea as far as Sallero.\n\nThese journeys from Lula and Pitha on the Bothnian gulf, to the north shore, were made on foot; and our traveller was attended by two Laplanders, one his interpreter, and the other his guide. He tells us, that the vigour and strength of these two men, both old, and sufficiently loaded with his baggage, excited his admiration; since they appeared quite unhurt by their labour, while he himself, although young and robust, was frequently quite exhausted. In this journey he was wont to sleep under the boat with which he forded the rivers, as a defence against rain, and the gnats, which in the Lapland summer are not less teasing than in the torrid zones. In descending one of these rivers, he narrowly escaped perishing by the overfelling of the boat, and lost many of the natural productions which he had collected.\n\nLinnaeus thus spent the greater part of the summer in examining this arctic region, and those mountains on which, four years afterwards, the French philosophers secured immortal fame to Sir Isaac Newton. At length, after having suffered incredible fatigues and hardships, in climbing precipices, puffing rivers in miserable boats, suffering repeated vicissitudes of extreme heat and cold, and not unfrequently hunger and thirst, he returned to Tornia in September. He did not take the same route from Tornia as when he came into Lapland, having determined to visit and examine the country on the eastern side of the Bothnian gulf; his first stage, therefore, was to Ula in East Bothnia; from thence to Old and New Carlebay, 84 miles south from Ula. He continued his route through Wafa, Christianstad, and Borneburgh, to Abo, a small university in Finland. Winter was now setting in apace; he therefore crossed the gulf by the island of Aland, and arrived at Upsal in November, after having performed, and that mostly on foot, a journey of ten degrees of latitude in extent, exclusively of those deviations which such a design rendered necessary.\n\nIn 1733 he visited and examined the several mines in Sweden; and made himself so well acquainted with mineralogy and the docimastic art, that we find he was sufficiently qualified to give lectures on those subjects upon his return to the university. The outlines of his system on mineralogy appeared in the early editions of the Systema Naturae; but he did not exemplify the whole until the year 1768.\n\nIn the year 1734 Linnaeus was sent by Baron Reuterholm, governor of Dalecarlia, with several other naturalists in that province, to investigate the natural productions of that part of the Swedish dominions; and it was in this journey that our author first laid the plan of an excellent institution, which was afterwards executed, in a certain degree at least, by himself, with the affiance of many of his pupils, and the result published under the title of Pan Suecicus, in the second volume of the Amoenitates Academicae.\n\nAfter the completion of this expedition, it appears that Linnaeus resided for a time at Fahlun, the principal town in Dalecarlia; where he tells us, that he taught mineralogy and the docimastic art, and practised physic; and where he was very hospitably treated by Dr More, the physician of the place. It also appears, that he contracted at this time an intimacy with one of that gentleman's daughters, whom he married about five years afterwards upon his settling as a physician at Stockholm.—In this journey he extended his travels quite across the Dalecarlian Alps into Norway; but we have no particular account of his discoveries in that kingdom. In 1735 Linnaeus travelled over many other parts of Sweden, some parts of Denmark and Germany, and fixed in Holland, where he chiefly resided until his return to Stockholm, about the year 1739. In 1735, the year in which he took the degree of M.D., he published the first sketch of his Systema Naturae, in a very compendious way, and in the form of tables only, in 12 pages in folio. By this it appears that he had at a very early period of his life (certainly before he was 24 years old), laid the basis of that great structure which he afterwards raised, not only to the increase of his own fame, but to that of natural science.\n\nIn 1736, Linnaeus came into England, and visited Dr Dillenius, the late learned professor at Oxford, whom he justly considered as one of the first botanists in Europe. He mentions with particular respect the civilities he received from him, and the privileges he gave him of inspecting his own and the Sherardian collections of plants. It is needless to say, that he visited Dr Martyn, Mr Rand, and Mr Miller, and\nLinnaeus, that he was in a more singular manner indebted to the friendship of Dr Isaac Lawton. He also contracted an intimate friendship with Mr Peter Collinson, which was reciprocally increased by a multitude of good offices, and continued to the last without any diminution. Dr Boerhaave had furnished him with letters to our great naturalist Sir Hans Sloane; but, it is with regret that we must observe, they did not procure him the reception which the warmth of his recommendation seemed to claim.\n\nOne of the most agreeable circumstances that happened to Linnaeus during his residence in Holland, arose from the patronage of Mr Clifford, in whose house he lived a considerable part of his time, being now as it were the child of fortune:—Exivii patria triginta sex nummis aureis divers—are his own words. With Mr Clifford, however, he enjoyed pleasures and privileges scarcely at that time to be met with elsewhere in the world; that of a garden excellently flored with the finest exotics, and a library furnished with almost every botanic author of note. How happy he found himself in this situation, those only who have felt the same kind of ardour can conceive. Whilst in Holland, our author was recommended by Boerhaave to fill the place then vacant, of physician to the Dutch settlement at Surinam; but he declined it on account of his having been educated in so opposite a climate.\n\nBesides being favoured with the particular patronage and friendship of Boerhaave and Mr Clifford, as is above mentioned, our author had also the pleasure of being contemporary with, and of reckoning among the number of his friends, many other learned persons who have since proved ornaments to their profession, and whose merit has most deservedly raised them to fame and honour. Among these we may properly mention Dr John Burman, professor of botany at Amsterdam, whose name and family are well known in the republic of letters, and to whom our author dedicated his Bibliotheca Botanica, having been greatly assisted in compiling that work by the free access he had to that gentleman's excellent library; John Frederick Gronovius of Leyden, editor of Clayton's Flora Virginica, and who very early adopted Linnaeus's system; Baron Van Swieten, physician to the empress's queen; Isaac Lawton, before mentioned, afterwards one of the physicians to the British army, who died much regretted at Oosterhout in the year 1747, and from whom Linnaeus received singular and very important civilities; Kramer, since well known for an excellent treatise on the diplomatic art; Van Royen, botanic professor at Leyden; Lieberkun of Berlin, famous for his skill in microscopic instruments and experiments. To these may be added also the names of Albinius and Gaubius, and of others, were it requisite to show that our author's talents had very early rendered him conspicuous, and gained him the regard of all those who cultivated and patronized any branch of medical science; and to which, doubtless, the singular notice with which Boerhaave honoured him did not a little contribute.\n\nEarly in the year 1738, after Linnaeus had left Mr Clifford, and, as it should seem, when he resided with Van Royen, he had a long and dangerous fit of sickness; and upon his recovery went to Paris, where he was properly entertained by the Jussieus, at that time the first botanists in France. The opportunity this gave him of inspecting the Herbaria of Royen and Tournefort, and those of the above-named gentlemen, afforded him great satisfaction. He had intended to have gone thence into Germany, to visit Ludwig and the celebrated Haller, with whom he was in close correspondence; but he was not able to complete this part of his intended route, and was obliged to return without this gratification.\n\nOur author did not fail to avail himself of every advantage that access to the several museums of this country afforded him, in every branch of natural history; and the number and importance of his publications, during his absence from his native country, sufficiently demonstrate that fund of knowledge which he must have imbibed before, and no less testify his extraordinary application. These were Sylva Naturae, Fundamenta Botanica, Bibliotheca Botanica, and Genera Plantarum; the last of which is justly considered as the most valuable of all the works of this celebrated author. What immense application had been bestowed upon it, the reader may easily conceive, on being informed, that before the publication of the first edition the author had examined the characters of 8000 flowers. The last book of Linnaeus's composition, published during his stay in Holland, was the Claves Plantarum, which is a copious illustration of the second part of the Fundamenta.\n\nAbout the latter end of the year 1738, or the beginning of the next, our author settled as a physician at Stockholm; where he seems to have met with considerable opposition, and was oppressed with many difficulties; but all of these at length he overcame, and got into extensive practice; and soon after his settlement married the lady before spoken of. By the interest of Count Tessin, who was afterwards his great patron, and even procured medals to be struck in honour of him, he obtained the rank of physician to the fleet, and a stipend from the citizens for giving lectures in botany. And what at this time especially was highly favourable to the advancement of his character and fame, by giving him an opportunity of displaying his abilities, was the establishment of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm; of which Linnaeus was constituted the first president, and to which establishment the king granted several privileges, particularly that of free postage to all papers directed to the secretariat. By the rules of the academy, the president held his place but three months. At the expiration of that term, Linnaeus made his Oratio de memorabilibus in Infectis, Oct. 3, 1759; in which he endeavours to excite an attention and inquiry into the knowledge of insects, by displaying the many singular phenomena that occur in contemplating the nature of those animals; and by pointing out, in a variety of instances, their usefulness to mankind in particular, and to the economy of nature in general.\n\nDuring all this time, however, Linnaeus appears to have had his eye upon the botanic and medical chair, at Upsal, at this time occupied by Rudbeck, who was far advanced in life. We learn indeed that he was so intent on pursuing and perfecting his great designs in the advancement of his favourite study of nature, that he had determined, if he failed in procuring\nLinnaeus, the professorship at Upsal, to accept the offer that had been made to him by Haller of filling the botanic chair at Gottingen. However, in course of time, he obtained his wish. In the year 1741, upon the resignation of Roberg, he was constituted joint professor of physic, and physician to the king, with Rosen, who had been appointed in the preceding year on the death of Rudbeck. These two colleagues agreed to divide the medical departments between them; and their choice was confirmed by the university. Rosen took anatomy, physiology, pathology, and the therapeutic part; Linnaeus, natural history, botany, materia medica, the dietetic part, and the diagnosis morborum.\n\nDuring the interval of his removal from Stockholm to Upsal in consequence of this appointment, our professor was deputed by the states of the kingdom to make a tour to the islands of Öland and Gothland in the Baltic, attended by six of the pupils, commissioned to make such inquiries as might tend to improve agriculture and arts in the kingdom, to which the Swedish nation had for some time paid a particular attention. The result of this journey was very successful, and proved fully satisfactory to the states, and was afterwards communicated to the public. On his return he entered upon the professorship, and pronounced before the university his oration de Peregrinationum intra Patriam necessitate, October 17, 1741; in which he forcibly displays the usefulness of such excursions, by pointing out to the students that vast field of objects which their country held out to their cultivation, whether in geography, physics, mineralogy, botany, zoology, or economics, and by showing the benefit that must accrue to themselves and their country as rewards to their diligence. That animated spirit which runs through the whole of this composition, renders it one of the most pleasing and instructive of all our author's productions.\n\nLinnaeus was now fixed in the situation that was the best adapted to his character, his taste, and abilities; and which seems to have been the object of his ambition and centre of his hopes. Soon after his establishment, he laboured to get the academical garden, which had been founded in 1657, put on a better footing and very soon effected it; procuring also a house to be built for the residence of the professor. The whole had been in ruins ever since the fire in 1702; and at the time Linnaeus was appointed professor of botany, the garden did not contain above fifty plants that were exotic. His correspondence with the first botanists in Europe soon supplied him with great variety. He received Indian plants from Jussieu of Paris, and from Van Royen of Leyden; European plants from Haller and Ludwig; American plants from the late Mr Collinson, Mr Catesby, and others; and variety of annuals from Dillenius: in short, how much the garden owed to his diligence and care in a few years, may be seen by the catalogue published under the title of Hortus Upsaliensis, exhibens Plantas exoticas horto Upsaliensi Academiae a se (Linneae) illatas ab anno 1742, in annum 1748, additis differentiis synonymis, habitationibus, habitu, rariorique descriptionibus, in gratiam studiosae juvenitatis; Holm., 1748, 8vo. pp. 366 tab. 3. By this catalogue it appears, that the professor had introduced 1100 species, exclusively of all the Swedish plants and of varieties: which latter, in ordinary gardens, amount not unfrequently to one-third of the whole number. The preface contains a curious history of the climate at Upsal, and the progress of the seasons throughout the whole year.\n\nFrom the time that Linnaeus and Rosen were appointed professors at Upsal, it should seem that the credit of that university, as a school of physic, had been increasing; numbers of students resorted thither from Germany, attracted by the character of these two able men; and in Sweden itself many young men were invited to the study of physic by the excellent manner in which it was taught, who otherwise would have engaged in different pursuits.\n\nWhilst Linnaeus was meditating one of his capital performances, which had long been expected and greatly wished for, he was interrupted by a tedious and painful fit of the gout, which left him in a very weak and dispirited state; and, according to the intelligence that his friends gave of him, nothing was thought to have contributed more to the restoration of his spirits than the felonious acquisition, at this juncture, of a collection of rare and undescribed plants.\n\nThe fame which our author had now acquired by his Systema Naturae, of which a fifth edition, much enlarged, had been published at Stockholm in 1748 in 8vo, pp. 232, with eight tables explanatory of the classes and orders (and which was also republished by Gronovius at Leyden), had brought, as it were, a conflux of every thing rare and valuable in every branch of nature, from all parts of the globe, into Sweden. The king and queen of Sweden had their separate collections of rarities; the former at Ulriksdahl; the latter, very rich in exotic insects and shells, procured at a great expense, at the palace of Drottningholm: both of which our author was employed in arranging and describing. Besides these, the museum of the Royal Academy of Upsal had been augmented by a considerable donation from the king, whilst hereditary prince, in 1746; by another from Count Gyllenborg the year before; by a third from M. Grill, an opulent citizen of Stockholm.\n\nFrom this time we see the professor in a more elevated rank and situation in life. His reputation had already procured him honours from almost all the royal societies in Europe; and his own sovereign, truly sensible of his merit, and greatly esteeming his character and abilities, favoured him with a mark of his distinction and regard, by creating him a knight of the Polar Star. It was no longer laudator et alget. His emoluments kept pace with his fame and honours: his practice in his profession became lucrative; and we find him soon after possessed of his country house and gardens at Hammarby, about five miles from Upsal. He had moreover received one of the most flattering testimonies of the extent and magnitude of his fame that perhaps was ever shown to any literary character, the state of the nation which conferred it, with all its circumstances, duly considered. This was an invitation to Madrid from the king of Spain, there to preside as a naturalist, with the offer of an annual pension for life of 2000 pistoles, letters of nobility, and the perfect free exercise of his own religion: But, after the most perfect acknowledgements of the singular honour done him, he returned for answer,\nLinnaeus, that if he had any merits, they were due to his own country.\n\nIn the year 1755, the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm honoured our professor with one of the first premiums, agreeably to the will of Count Sparre, who had decreed two gold medals, of ten ducats value each, to be annually given by the academy to the authors of such papers, in the preceding year's Stockholm Acts, as should be adjudged most useful in promoting agriculture particularly, and all branches of rural economy. This medal bore on one side the arms of the count, with this motto, *Superflues in scientiis amor Frederici Sparree.* Linnaeus obtained it in consequence of a paper *De Plantis quae Alpium Suecicarum indigenae, magno rei oeconomicae et medicinae emolumento fieri possint,* and the ultimate intention was to recommend these plants as adapted to culture in Lapland. This paper was inserted in the Stockholm Acts for 1754, vol. xv. Linnaeus also obtained the *praemium centum aureorum,* proposed by the Imperial Academy of Sciences at Peterburgh, for the best paper written to establish or disprove, by new arguments, the doctrine of the sexes of plants. It was, if possible, an additional glory to Linnaeus to have merited this premium from the Peterburgh academy; inasmuch as a professor of that society, a few years before, had with more than common zeal, although with a futility like that of the other antagonists of our author, endeavoured to overturn the whole Linnaean system of botany, by attempting to show that the doctrine of the sexes of plants had no foundation in nature, and was unsupported by facts and experiments.\n\nIt appears that Linnaeus upon the whole, enjoyed a good constitution; but that he was sometimes severely afflicted with a hemorrhaia, and was not exempted from the gout. About the close of 1776, he was seized with an apoplexy, which left him paralytic; and at the beginning of the year 1777, he suffered another stroke, which very much impaired his mental powers. But the disease supposed to have been the more immediate cause of his death, was an ulceration of the urinary bladder; of which, after a tedious indisposition, he died, January 11, 1778, in the 71st year of his age.\n\nHis principal other works, beside those already mentioned, are, *The Iter Oelandicum et Gotlandicum, Iter Scanicum, Flora Suecica, Fauna Suecica, Materia Medica, Philosophia Botanica, Genera Morborum,* different papers in the *Acta Upsaliensia,* and the *Amanitae Academicae.* The last of this great man's treaties was the *Mentifera Altera,* published in 1771; but before his death he had finished the greatest part of the *Mentifera Tertia,* afterwards completed and published by his son.\n\nTo the lovers of science it will not appear strange, nor will it be unpleasant to hear, that uncommon respect was shown to the memory of this great man. We are told, \"that on his death a general mourning took place at Upsal, and that his funeral procession was attended by the whole university, as well professors as students, and the pall supported by fifteen doctors of physic, all of whom had been his pupils.\" The king of Sweden, after the death of Linnaeus, ordered a medal to be struck, of which one side exhibits Linnaeus's bust and name, and the other Cybele, in a dejected attitude, holding in her left hand a key, and surrounded with animals and growing plants; with this legend, *Dæm lucibus angit amylis,* and beneath, *Post Oblitum Upsalici, die x. Jan. M.DCC.LXXVIII. Rege jubente.* The same generous monarch not only honoured the Royal Academy of Sciences with his presence when Linnaeus's commemoration was held at Stockholm, but, as a still higher tribute, in his speech from the throne to the assembly of the states, he lamented Sweden's loss by his death. Nor was Linnaeus honoured only in his own country. The late worthy professor of botany at Edinburgh, Dr Hope, not only pronounced an eulogium in honour of him before his students at the opening of his lectures in the spring 1778, but also laid the foundation stone of a monument (which he afterwards erected) to his memory, in the botanic garden there; which, while it perpetuates the name and merits of Linnaeus, will do honour to the founder, and, it may be hoped, prove the means of raising an emulation favourable to that science which this illustrious Swede so highly dignified and improved.\n\nAs to the private and personal character of this illustrious philosopher: His stature was diminutive and puny; his head large, and its hinder part very high; his look was ardent, piercing, and apt to daunt the beholder; his ear not sensible to music; his temper quick, but easily appeased.\n\nNature had, in an eminent manner, been liberal in the endowments of his mind. He seems to have been possessed of a lively imagination, corrected however by a strong judgement, and guided by the laws of system. Add to these, the most retentive memory, an unremitting industry, and the greatest perseverance in all his pursuits; as is evident from that continued vigour with which he prosecuted the design, that he appears to have formed so early in life, of totally reforming and fabricating anew the whole science of natural history; and this fabric he raised, and gave to it a degree of perfection unknown before; and had moreover the uncommon felicity of living to see his own structure rise above all others, notwithstanding every discouragement its author at first laboured under, and the opposition it afterwards met with. Neither has any writer more cautiously avoided that common error of building his own fame on the ruin of another man's. He everywhere acknowledged the several merits of each author's system; and no man appears to have been more sensible of the partial defects of his own. Those anomalies which had principally been the objects of criticism, he well knew every artificial arrangement must abound with; and having laid it down as a firm maxim, that every system must finally rest on its intrinsic merit, he willingly commits his own to the judgement of posterity. Perhaps there is no circumstance of Linnaeus's life which shows him in a more dignified light than his conduct towards his opponents. Disavowing controversy, and justly considering it as an unimportant and fruitless sacrifice of time, he never replied to any, numerous as they were at one season.\n\nTo all who see the aid this extraordinary man has brought to natural science, his talents must appear in a very illustrious point of view; but more especially to those who, from familiarity of tastes, are qualified to see more distinctly the vast extent of his original design, the greatness of his labour, and the elaborate execution he has given to the whole. He had a happy command\nmand of the Latin tongue, which is alone the language of science; and no man ever applied it more successfully to his purposes, or gave to description such copiousness, united with that precision and conciseness which so eminently characterize his writings.\n\nThe ardour of Linnaeus's inclinations to the study of nature, from his earliest years, and that uncommon application which he bestowed upon it, gave him a most comprehensive view both of its pleasures and usefulness, at the same time that it opened to him a wide field hitherto but little cultivated, especially in his own country. Hence he was early led to regret, that the study of natural history, as a public institution, had not made its way into the universities; in many of which, logical disputations and metaphysical theories had too long prevailed, to the exclusion of more useful science. Availing himself therefore of the advantages which he derived from a large share of eloquence, and an animated style, he never failed to display, in a lively and convincing manner, the relation this study hath to the public good; to incite the great to countenance and protect it; to encourage and allure youth into its pursuits, by opening its manifold sources of pleasure to their view, and showing them how greatly this agreeable employment would add, in a variety of instances, both to their comfort and emolument. His extensive view of natural history, as connected with almost all the arts of life, did not allow him to confine these motives and incitements to those only who were designed for the practice of physic. He also laboured to inspire the great and opulent with a taste for this study; and wished particularly that such as were devoted to an ecclesiastic life should share a portion of natural science; not only as a means of sweetening their rural situation, confined, as many are, perpetually to a country residence, but as what would almost inevitably lead, in a variety of instances, to discoveries which only such situations could give rise to, and which the learned in great cities could have no opportunities to make. Not to add, that the mutual communication and enlargement of this kind of knowledge among people of equal rank in a country situation, must prove one of the strongest bonds of union and friendship, and contribute, in a much higher degree than the usual perilous amusements of the age, to the pleasures and advantage of society.\n\nLinnaeus lived to enjoy the fruit of his own labour in an uncommon degree. Natural history raised itself in Sweden, under his culture to a state of perfection unknown elsewhere; and was from thence disseminated through all Europe. His pupils dispersed themselves all over the globe; and, with their master's fame, extended both science and their own. More than this he lived to see the sovereigns of Europe establish several public institutions in favour of this study; and even professorships established in divers universities for the same purpose, which do honour to their founders and patrons, and which have excited a curiosity for the science, and a sense of its worth, that cannot fail to further its progress, and in time raise it to that rank which it is entitled to hold among the pursuits of mankind.\n\nLINNET. See Fringilla, Ornithology Index.\n\nLINSEED, the seed of the plant linum.—Linseed steeped and bruised in water gives it very soon a thick mucilaginous nature, and communicates much of its emollient virtue to it. See LINUM.\n\nLINT. See FLAX; LINEN; and LINUM, Botany Index.\n\nLint, in Surgery, is the scrapings of fine linen, used by surgeons in dressing wounds. It is made into various forms, which acquire different names according to the difference of the figures.—Lint made up in an oval or orbicular form is called a pledgie; if in a cylindrical form, or in shape of a date, or olive-stone, it is called a daffil.\n\nThese different forms of lint are required for many purposes; as, 1. To stop blood in fresh wounds, by filling them up with dry lint before the application of a bandage; though, if scraped lint be not at hand, a piece of fine linen may be torn into small rags, and applied in the same manner. In very large hemorrhages the lint or rags should be first dipped in some styptic liquor, as alcohol, or oil of turpentine; or sprinkled with some styptic powder. 2. To agglutinate or heal wounds; to which end lint is very serviceable, if spread with some digestive ointment, balsam, or vulnerary liquor. 3. In drying up wounds and ulcers, and forwarding the formation of a cicatrix. 4. In keeping the lips of wounds at a proper distance, that they may not hastily unite before the bottom is well digested and healed. 5. They are highly necessary to preserve wounds from the injuries of the air.—Surgeons of former ages formed compresses of sponge, wool, feathers, or cotton; linen being scarce; but lint is far preferable to all these, and is at present universally used.\n\nLINTERNUM, or Litterum, in Ancient Geography, a city of Campania, situated at the mouth of the Clanus, which is also called Liturnus, between Cumae and Vulturum. It received a Roman colony at the same time with Puteoli and Vulturum; was improved and enlarged by Augustus; afterwards forfeited its right of colonyship, and became a prefecture. Hither Scipio Africanus the Elder retired from the mean envy of his ungrateful countrymen; and here he died, and was buried: though this last is uncertain, he having a monument both here and at Rome. No vestige of the place now remains.\n\nLINTSTOCK, in military affairs, a wooden staff about three feet long, having a sharp point in one end and a sort of fork or catch on the other; the latter of which serves to contain a lighted match, and by the former the lintstock is occasionally stuck in the ground, or in the deck of a ship during an engagement. It is very frequently used in small vessels, where there is commonly one fixed between every two guns, by which the match is always kept dry, and ready for firing.\n\nLINTZ, a very handsome town of Germany, and capital of Upper Austria, with two fortified castles; the one upon a hill, the other below it. Here is a hall in which the states assemble, a bridge over the Danube, a manufacture of gunpowder, and several other articles. It was taken by the French in 1741, but the Austrians retook it in the following year. L. Long. 14. 33. N. Lat. 48. 16.\n\nLINTZ, a town of Germany, in the circle of the Lower Rhine, and electorate of Cologne, subject to\nthat elector. It is seated on the river Rhine, in E. Long. 7. 1. N. Lat. 50. 31.\n\n**LINUM**, flax; a genus of plants belonging to the pentandria clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 14th order, Gruinales. See Botany Index.\n\n**LINUS**, in classical history, a native of Colchis, contemporary with Orpheus, and one of the most ancient poets and musicians of Greece. It is impossible, at this distance of time, to discover whether Linus was the disciple of Orpheus, or Orpheus of Linus. The majority, however, seem to decide this question in favour of Linus. According to Archbishop Ulster, he flourished about 1280 B.C., and he is mentioned by Eusebius among the poets who wrote before the time of Moses. Diodorus Siculus tells us, from Dionysius of Mitylene the historian, who was contemporary with Cicero, that Linus was the first among the Greeks who invented verses and music, as Cadmus first taught them the use of letters. The same writer likewise attributes to him an account of the exploits of the first Bacchus, and a treatise upon Greek mythology, written in Pelasgian characters, which were also those used by Orpheus, and by Pronapides the preceptor of Homer. Diodorus says that he added the string *lichanos* to the Mercurian lyre; and attributes to him the invention of rhyme and melody; which Suidas, who regards him as the most ancient of lyric poets, confirms. Mr Marpurg tells us, that Linus invented cat-gut strings for the use of the lyre, which, before his time, was only strung with thongs of leather, or with different threads of flax strung together. He is said by many writers to have had several disciples of great renown; among whom were Hercules, Thamyris, and, according to some, Orpheus.—Hercules, says Diodorus, in learning from Linus to play upon the lyre, being extremely dull and obstinate, provoked his master to strike him; which so enraged the young hero, that, instantly seizing the lyre of the musician, he beat out his brains with his own instrument.\n\n**LION**, in Zoology. See Felis, Mammalia Index.\n\n**LIONCELLES**, in Heraldry, a term used for several lions borne in the same coat of arms.\n\n**LIOTARD**, called the Turk, an eminent painter, was born at Geneva in 1702, and by his father was destined for a merchant; but, by the persuasion of his friends, who observed the genius of the young man, he was permitted to give himself up to the art of painting. He went to Paris in 1725, and in 1738 accompanied the marquis de Puifieux to Rome, who was going ambassador to Naples. At Rome he was taken notice of by the earls of Sandwich and Belborough, then Lord Duncan, who engaged Liotard to go with them on a voyage to Constantinople. There he became acquainted with the late Lord Edgcumbe, and Sir Everard Fawkener, our ambassador, who persuaded him to come to England, where he staid two years. In his journey to the Levant he had adopted the eastern habit, and wore it here with a very long beard. It contributed much to the portraits of himself, and some thought to draw customers; but he was really a painter of uncommon merit. After his return to the continent, he married a young wife, and sacrificed his beard to Hymen. He came again to England in 1772, and brought a collection of pictures of different masters, which he sold by auction, and some pieces of glass painted by himself, with surprising effect of light and shade, but a mere curiosity, as it was necessary to darken the room before they could be seen to advantage; he asked, too, as usual, extravagant prices for them. He staid here about two years, as in his former journey. He has engraved some Turkish portraits, one of the empress queen and the eldest archduchess in Turkish habits, and the heads of the emperor and empress. He painted admirably well in miniature; and finely in enamel, though he seldom practised it. But he is best known by his works in crayons. His likenesses were as exact as possible, and too like to please those who sat to him; thus he had great success the first year, and very little the second. Devoid of imagination, and one would think of memory, he could render nothing but what he saw before his eyes. Freckles, marks of the smallpox, every thing found its place; not so much from fidelity, as because he could not conceive the absence of any thing that appeared to him. Truth prevailed in all his works, grace in very few or none. Nor was there any care in his outline; but the stiffness of a bull in all his portraits. Walpole.\n\n**LIP**, in Anatomy.

See Surgery.\n\n**LIPARA**, in Ancient Geography, the principal of the islands called Æolia, situated between Sicily and Italy, with a cognominal town, so powerful as to have a fleet, and the other islands in subjection to it. According to Diodorus Siculus, it was famous for excellent harbours and medicinal waters. He informs us also, that it suddenly emerged from the sea about the time of Hannibal's death. The name is Punic, according to Bochart: and given it, because, being a volcano, it shone in the night. It is now called Lipari, and gives name to nine others in its neighbourhood; viz. Stromboli, Pare, Rotto, Panaria, Saline, Volcano, Feniciola, Alicor, and Ustica. These are called, in general, the Lipari Islands. Some of these are active volcanoes at present, though Lipari is not. It is about 15 miles in circumference; and abounds in corn, figs and grapes, bitumen, sulphur, alum, and mineral waters.\n\n**LIPARI**, an ancient and very strong town, and capital of an island of the same name in the Mediterranean, with a bishop's see. It was ruined by Barbarossa in 1544, who carried away all the inhabitants into slavery, and demolished the place; but it was rebuilt by Charles V. E. Long. 15. 30. N. Lat. 38. 35.\n\nLipari, properly, is the general name of a cluster of islands. These, according to Mr Houel, are principally ten in number, the rest being only uninhabitable rocks of narrow extent. The largest and the most populous of them, that above mentioned, communicates its name to the rest. Volcano is a desert but habitable island, lying south from the large island of Lipari. Salinet, which lies west-north-west from the same island; Felicudi, nearly in the same direction, but 20 miles farther distant; and Alicudi, 10 miles west-south-west of Felicudi; are inhabited. Pannari is east of Lipari, the famous Stromboli north-east, and both of them are inhabited.\nThe rest are in a desert state; such as Baziluzzo, which was formerly inhabited; Attalo, which might be inhabited; and L'Exambianca, on which some remains of ancient dwellings are still to be found. L'Escanera is nothing but a bare rock.\n\nThe Fermicoli, a word signifying ants, are a chain of small black cliffs which run to the north-east of Lipari, till within a little way of Exambianca and Escanera, rising more or less above the water, according as the sea is more or less agitated.\n\nAncient authors are not agreed with respect to the number of the Lipari islands. Few of those by whom they are mentioned appear to have seen them; and in places such as these, where subterraneous fires burst open the earth and raise the ocean from its bed, terrible changes must sometimes take place. Volcanello and Vulcano were once separated by a strait so as to form two islands. The lava and ashes have filled up the intervening strait; and they are now united into one island, and have by this change become much more habitable.\n\nThe castle of Lipari stands upon a rock on the east quarter of the island. The way to it from the city leads up a gentle declivity. There are several roads to it. This castle makes a part of the city; and on the summit of the rock is the citadel, in which the governor and the garrison reside. The cathedral stands in the same situation. Here the ancients, in conformity to their usual practice, had built the temple of a tutelary god. This citadel commands the whole city; and it is accessible only at one place. Were an hostile force to make a descent on the island, the inhabitants might retreat hither, and be secure against all but the attacks of famine.\n\nThe ancient inhabitants had also fortified this place. Considerable portions of the ancient walls are still standing in different places, particularly towards the south. Their structure is Grecian; and the stones are exceedingly large, and very well cut. The layers are three feet high, which shows them to have been raised in some very remote period. These remains are surrounded with modern buildings. The remains of walls, which are still to be seen here, have belonged not only to temples, but to all the different sorts of buildings which the ancients used to erect. The vaults, which are in a better state of preservation than any of the other parts of these monuments, are now converted to the purposes of a prison.\n\nIn the city of Lipari there are convents of monks of two different orders; but there are no convents for women, that is to say, no cloisters in which women are confined; those, however, whose heads and hearts move them to embrace a state of pious celibacy, are at liberty to engage in a monastic life, with the concurrence of their confessors. They put on the sacred habit, and vow perpetual virginity, but continue to live with their father and mother, and mix in society like other women. The vow and the habit even enlarge their liberty. This custom will, no doubt, M. Houel observes, appear very strange to a French woman; but this was the way in which the virgins of the primitive church lived. The idea of shutting them up together did not occur till the fifth century. The life of these religious ladies is less gloomy than that which those under the same vows lead in other countries. They wear clothes of particular colours, according as they belong to this or that order. Their dress gives them a right to frequent the churches at any hours; and the voice of censure, which takes particular pleasure in directing her attacks against pious ladies, goes so far as to affirm, that some young women assume the habit with no other views but that they may enjoy greater freedom.\n\nIn this island oxen of a remarkably beautiful species are employed in ploughing the ground. The ancient plough is still in use here. The mode of agriculture practised here is very expeditious. One man traces a furrow, and another follows to sow in it grain and pulse. The ploughman, in cutting the next furrow, covers up that in which the seed has been sown; and thus the field is both ploughed and sown at once. Nature seems to be here uncommonly vigorous and fertile. Vegetation is here more luxuriant, and animals gayer and more healthful, than almost anywhere else.\n\nNear the city of Lipari, the traveller enters deep narrow roads, of a very singular appearance. The whole island is nothing but an assemblage of mountains, all of them consisting of ashes or lava discharged from the depths of the volcano by which it was at first produced. The particles of this pumicestone, or ashes, are not very hard; the action of the rain water has accordingly cut out trenches among the mountains; and these trenches being perhaps less uneven than the rest of the surface, have of consequence been used as roads by the inhabitants, and have been rendered much deeper by being worn for so many ages by the feet of men and other animals. These roads are more than five or six fathoms deep, and not more than seven or eight feet wide. They are very crooked, and have echoes in several places. You would think that you were walking through narrow streets without doors or windows. Their depth and windings shelter the traveller from the sun while he is passing through them; and he finds them deliciously cool.\n\nThe first volcanic eruption in the Lipari islands mentioned in history, is that of which Callias takes notice in his history of the wars in Sicily. Callias was contemporary with Agathocles. That eruption continued without interval for several days and nights; and threw out great stones, which fell at more than a mile's distance. The sea boiled all around the island. The works of Callias are lost, and we know not whether he descended to a detail of particulars concerning the ravages produced by this eruption. Under the consulship of Æmilius Lepidus and L. Aurelius Orestes, 125 years before the Christian era, these islands were affected with a dreadful earthquake. The burning of Æina was the first cause of that. Around Lipari and the adjacent islands, the air was all on fire. Vegetation was withered; animals died; and fusible bodies, such as wax and resin, became liquid. If the inhabitants of Lipari, from whom our author received these facts, and the writers who have handed down an account of them, have not exaggerated the truth, we must believe that the sea then boiled around the island; the earth became so hot as to burn the cables by which vessels were fixed to the shore, and consumed the planks, the oars, and even the small boats.\n\nPliny, the naturalist*, speaks of another similar* Lib. ii. event which happened 30 or 40 years afterwards, in cap. 106.\nthe time of the war of the allied states of Italy against Rome. One of the Æolian islands, says he, was all on fire as well as the sea; and that prodigy continued to appear, till the senate appeased, by a deputation, the wrath of the gods. From the time of that war, which happened 86 years before the birth of our Saviour, till the year 144 of our era, we have no account of any eruption of these volcanoes: and from that period again, till the year 1444, we hear of no explosion from them, that is, for the space of 1300 years. But, at that time, both Sicily and the Æolian isles were agitated by dreadful shocks of earthquakes: the volcano of these isles poured forth streams of lava with an awful violence, and emitted a volume of flame and smoke which rose to an amazing height. After that it discharged enormous stones which fell at the distance of more than six miles.\n\nA century later, in the year 1550, the fury of this volcano was again renewed. The ashes and stones discharged from the crater filled up the strait between Volcano and Vulcanello.\n\nAbout two centuries after that, in the year 1739, there was a fifth eruption. The burblings of the volcanic fire were attended with a noise so dreadful, that it was heard as far as Melazzo in Sicily.\n\nFather Leandro Alberti says, that on one of those dreadful occasions, the women of Lipari, after imploring in vain all the saints, vowed to drink no more wine if the volcano should spare them. Their giving up this small gratification was doubtless of great service; yet the eruptions still continue, and have even become more frequent since that time. Only 36 years intervened between this eruption and that which happened in the year 1775. The whole island was then shaken; subterranean thunder was heard; and considerable streams of flame, with smoke, stones, and vitreous lava, issued from the crater. Lipari was covered over with ashes; and part of these was conveyed by the winds all the way into Sicily. Five years after, however, in the month of April 1780, there issued a new explosion from Volcano; the smoke was thick, the shocks constant, and the subterraneous noise very frequent. So great was the consternation among the inhabitants of Lipari on this occasion, that the commander Deodati Dolomieu, who visited these islands not long after that event, informs us, that the inhabitants in general, but especially the women, devoted themselves as slaves to the service of the blest virgin; and wore on their arms, as tokens of their fervitude, small iron chains, which they still continue to wear.\n\nThis act of piety, however, was not so efficacious as the deputation of the senate had been. For after that deputation, more than 200 years passed before the Æolian isles were afflicted by any other eruption, at least by any considerable one: Whereas, in three years after the ladies devoted themselves in so submissive a manner to the service of the virgin, the isles of Lipari were agitated anew by that fatal earthquake which ravaged Calabria, and part of Sicily, on the 5th of February 1783.\n\nThe dry baths of St Calogero, in the island of Lipari, are stoves, where sulphureous exhalations, known to be of a salutary nature, ascend out of the earth by holes or spiracles. A range of apartments are built around the place where the exhalations arise. The heat is communicated through these apartments, in such a way, that when entering at one end, you advance towards the other, the heat still increases upon you till you gain the middle apartment, and again diminishes in the same manner as you proceed from the middle to the other end of the range of chambers. In consequence of this disposition of these apartments, the sick person can make choice of that temperature which best suits the nature of his disease. There are a few miserable huts and a small chapel for the accommodation of the people who repair to these baths. The people of the place are ready to attend them. Physicians likewise follow their patients thither, when the disease is of such a nature as to render their attendance requisite, and the patient rich enough to afford them handsome fees: but there is no physician settled in the place. Besides these dry baths, there are baths of hot water distinguished by the name of St Calogero's baths. There are around them buildings sufficient to lodge a considerable number of sick people with their necessary attendants. At present, however, these buildings are but in a bad condition.\n\nThe baths consist of two halls; one square, the other round. The former is antique; it has been built by the Romans; it is arched with a cupola, and 12 feet in diameter; it has been repaired. The other is likewise arched with a cupola both within and without. The water comes very hot into the first. It gushes up from among pieces of lava, which compose a part of the mountain at the foot of which these baths are built. These stones remain in their natural state. All that has been done is the raising of a square building enclosing them. Within that building the sick persons either sit down on the stones, or immerse themselves in the intervening cavities which are filled with water. They continue there for a certain time, and approach nearer to, or remain at a farther distance from the spring, according as their physician directs. The place serves also as a stove. The hot vapours arising from the water communicate to the surrounding atmosphere a considerable degree of heat. It is indeed not inferior to that of the hot baths of Termini, which owe their heat to a similar cause. In these baths, therefore, a person can have the benefit either of bathing in the hot water, or of exposing himself to the vapour, the heat of which is more moderate. The bath before mentioned, under the appellation of dry bath, is also a stove; but the hot vapour with which it is filled issues directly from the volcano. The place of the bath is, however, at such a distance from the volcanic focus, that the heat is not at all intolerable.\n\nThe mountain at the foot of which these baths are situated is round, and terminates at the summit in a rock of petrified ashes, which are very hard and of a very fine grain. This petrification consists of pretty regular strata, and appears to have been greatly prior in its origin to the adjacent rocks; which consist likewise of ashes, but ashes that have been deposited at a much later period. From this rock there proceeds likewise a stream of hot water, by which some mills in the neighbourhood are moved.\n\nIt cannot but appear surprising, that nature has placed nearly on the summit of a volcanic mountain springs\nLipari springs which supply so considerable a quantity of water. To account for such a phenomenon would be well worthy of some ingenious naturalist. Not are these hot springs all; proceeding around the same hill, at about a mile's distance, we find a spring of cold water rising from the summit of the same rock, which on the north-west produces three hot springs. The cold water is very pleasant to drink, and much used both by men and cattle.\n\nAmong these mountains there are many enormous loofe masses of lava, the appearance of which, M. Houel informs us, naturally leads the observer to take notice, that the lava of the volcano of Lipari is of a much greater diversity of colours, and those richer and more lively, than the lava of Vesuvius and Ætna. The lava of Lipari is in some places, for several miles, of a beautiful red colour. It contains likewise in great abundance small black crystallized scoriae, as well as the small white grains which are commonly found in lava.\n\nAmong the eminences which overlook the city of Lipari, there are some rocks of a species which is very rare in Europe. These are large masses of vitrified matter, which rise six or eight feet above the surface of the ground, and appear to extend to a great depth under it. They exist, through that range of mountains, in enormous masses, mixed with lavas of every different colour, and always standing detached and insulated. Were they cut and followed under ground, they would probably be found to exist in immense quarries in the bowels of the earth. The glaas of which they consist might be employed with great advantage in manufactures. It is ready made, and might be easily purified. It is green, compact, and transparent.\n\nThe cultivation of the ground is the chief employment of the inhabitants of Lipari. The possession of a few acres of land here gives a man great importance. Parents, when they settle their children, rather give them money than any part of their lands.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the island is planted with vines: three-fourths of the grapes which these produce are dried, and sent mostly to London under the name of passo. There are different sorts of passo: one of these, called the black passolina, is prepared from a particular kind of grape, of which the berries are uncommonly small; and sold to Mareilles, Holland, and Trieste. The vines are in small arbours, which rise only to the height of two feet and a half above the ground. Under these arbours there grow beans, gourds, and other leguminous vegetables. In so hot a climate, the shade of the vines does not injure but protect the vegetables growing under it: they would otherwise be withered by the heat of the sun.\n\nThe method of preparing passo and passolina is curious enough: they first make a lixivium of common ashes; after boiling this, they pass it through a cloth or a sieve; they then put it again on the fire; and when it is observed to boil hard, suddenly immerse the grapes, but instantly bring them out again, and expose them to the sun to dry on broad frames of cane. When sufficiently dry, the raisins are put into casks and barrels to be sold and exported. The number of casks of different sorts of raisins annually exported from Lipari are estimated at 10,000.\n\nThis island likewise produces figs. There is some Lipothymia white malmsey and a little red wine exported from it.\n\nAbout 60 or 80 years since, sulphur was one of the articles with which the inhabitants of this island supplied foreign merchants. But that trade has been given up; from an idea which the Liparese entertain, that sulphur infects the air so as to injure the fertility of the vines. The same prejudice prevails in Sicily, but it seems to be ill founded.\n\nThere are courts of justice in Lipari of the same powers and character with those in the cities of Sicily. Causes of more than ordinary importance are carried to Palermo.\n\nThe island is entirely free from every kind of imposition. The king receives nothing from it; because Count Roger anciently bestowed on its bishop all his rights of royalty over Lipari. The bishop there received annually from the inhabitants a tenth part of the products of their lands. They afterwards, to prevent fraud, estimated the value of that tithe for one year; and on the condition of their paying in future a sum of money equal to what that year's tithe was valued at, he not only gave up his right to the tithe, but also ceded to them a considerable extent of land which belonged to him.\n\nIn the archiepiscopal palace, and in the palace of the Baron de Monizzio, there are some noble pieces of painting by Sicilian painters.—A St Peter, a St Rofalia, Jesus disputing with the Jewish doctors, the adulterous woman, the incredulity of St Thomas.\n\nLIPOTHYMIAC, fainting, may arise from several causes; as too violent exercise, suppression of the menes or other accultured evacuations, &c.

He had an exquisite genius for music and poetry, as well as for painting, and in the latter his proficiency was so great, that some of his compositions in the historical style were taken for those of Roselli. However, growing at last dissatisfied with the manner of that matter, he chose the manner of Santi di Titi, who was excellent both in design and invention, and appeared to have more of simple nature and truth in his compositions than any other artist of that time. At Florence Lippi painted many grand designs for the chapels and convents, by which he enlarged his reputation; and at the court of Innsbruck, he painted a great number of portraits of the first nobility,\nLIPSIUS, Justus, a learned critic, was born at Iseh, a small village near Brufels, in 1547. After having distinguished himself in polite literature, he became secretary to Cardinal de Granvellan at Rome, where the best libraries were open to him; and he spent much labour in collating the MSS. of ancient authors. He lived 13 years at Leyden; during which he composed and published what he esteemeth his best works; but settled at Louvain, where he taught polite literature with great reputation. He was remarkable for unfeignedness in religion, fluctuating often between the Protestants and Papists; but he became finally a bigotted catholic. He died at Louvain in 1626; and his works are collected in six volumes folio.\n\nLIQUEFACTION, an operation by which a solid body is reduced into a liquid by the action of heat.

He adhered to the same style till he went to Italy; where, having visited Venice and Rome, he studied the works of Titian, Tintoretto, Paolo Veronese, and Domenico Fetti, so effectually, that he improved his taste and judgement, and altered his manner entirely. He soon received marks of public approbation; and his compositions became universally admired for their good expression, for their lively and natural colouring, and the sweetness and delicacy of his pencil: although it must be acknowledged, that he could never totally divest himself of the ideas and taste peculiar to the Flemings. His subjects usually were histories taken from the sacred writings, or the representations of rural sports, marriages, balls, and villagers dancing, dressed in Venetian habits; all which subjects he painted in a small as well as a large size, with a number of figures, well designed, and touched with a great deal of delicacy. He was likewise accounted to paint naked figures admirably, with natural and elegant attitudes, and a very agreeable turn of the limbs. A capital picture of this master is, Adam and Eve lamenting the death of Abel; which is extremely admired, not only for the expression, but also for the beauty of the landscape: and in the church of St Nicholas at Venice is another of his paintings, representing St Jerome in the desert, with a pen in his hand, and his head turned to look at an angel, who is supposed to be sounding the last trumpet. The colouring of this picture is rather too red; but it is designed in a fine style, and charmingly penciled. The paintings of this master are very rarely to be purchased. He died in 1629.\n\nLis, John Vander, of Breda, historical painter, was born at Breda about the year 1601, and became a disciple of Cornelius Polenburg, whose manner he imitated with extraordinary exactness, in the tint of his colouring, his neatness of penciling, and the choice of his subject. There are some paintings of this master's hand, which, though they appear to have somewhat less freedom and lightness of touch, are nearly equal to those of Polenburg, and are frequently taken to be his. At Rotterdam, in the possession of Mr Bishop, there is a delicate painting representing Diana in the bath, attended by her nymphs; and his most capital performance, in England, is said to be in the possession of the viscount Middleton. The portrait of Vander Lis, painted by himself, is in the possession of Horace Walpole, Esq., which is described by that ingenious gentleman, as being worked up equal to the smoothness of enamel.\n\nLISBON, the capital of the kingdom of Portugal, situated in the province of Extremadura, on the banks of the river Tagus, in W. Long. 9. 25. N. Lat. 38. 25. It was anciently called Olifia, Olifipa, and Ulifipa, which are supposed to be derived from the Phoenician Ulifabbo or Olifippo, signifying in that tongue a pleasant bay, such as that on which this city stands. It first became considerable in the reign of King Emmanuel; from that time it has been the capital of the kingdom, the residence of its monarchs, the seat of the chief tribunals, and offices of the metropolitans, a noble university, and the receptacle of the richest merchandise of the East and West Indies. Its air is excellent; being refreshed by the delightful sea breezes, and those of the Tagus. The city extends for about two miles along the Tagus; but its breadth is inconsiderable. Like old Rome, it stands on seven hills: but the streets in general are narrow and dirty, and some of them are very steep: neither are they lighted at night. The churches, in general, are very fine; but the magnificence of the chapel\nLISBON chapel royal is amazing. Here is one of the finest harbours in the world; and there were a great number not only of fine churches and convents here, but also of other public buildings, and particularly of royal palaces, and others belonging to the grandees; but the greatest part of them, and of the city, were destroyed by a most dreadful earthquake, on Nov. 1, 1755, from which it will require a long time to recover. The inhabitants, before the earthquake, did not at most exceed 150,000. The government of it is lodged in a council, consisting of a president, six counsellors, and other inferior officers. The harbour has water enough for the largest ships, and room enough for 10,000 sail without being crowded. For its security, there is a fort at the mouth of the river, on each side, and a bar that runs across it, and is very dangerous to pass without pilots. Higher up, at a place where the river is considerably contracted, there is a fort called Torre de Belem, or the Tower of Belem, under whose guns all ships must pass in their way to the city; and on the other side are several more forts. Before the earthquake, most of the private houses were old and unrightly, with lattice windows; and the number of convents and colleges amounted to 50, namely, 32 for monks, and 18 for nuns. The king's principal palace stands on the river, and is large and commodious. Of the hospitals, that called the Great is obliged to receive all persons, of what degree, nation, or religion soever, without exception. At the village of Belem, near Lisbon, is a noble hospital for decayed gentlemen who have served the king, and have not wherewithal to maintain themselves. That called the House of Mercy is also a noble charity. In the centre of the city, upon one of the highest hills, is the castle, which commands the whole, being large and ancient, and having always a garrison of four regiments of foot. The cathedral is a vast edifice of the Gothic kind, but heavy and clumsy; it contains, however, great riches; and is finely adorned within. The square called Rossio is large, and surrounded with magnificent buildings. The whole city is under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the patriarch, who was appointed in the year 1717. Here is also an archbishop, who has, or at least had, before the erection of the patriarchate, a revenue of 40,000 cruadoes, or 600l. The university, which was removed for some time to Coimbra, but afterwards restored to its ancient seat, makes a considerable figure, though much inferior to that of Coimbra.\n\nLISBURN, a town of Ireland, in the county of Antrim and province of Ulster, 73 miles from Dublin. It was burnt down about 50 years ago; but is now rebuilt in a neat and handsome manner, and has a large linen manufacture. It is seated on the river Lagan, in W. Long. 6. 20. N. Lat. 54. 31. It gives title of earl to the family of Vaughan, and formerly returned two members to parliament.\n\nLISIEUX, a considerable town of France, in Upper Normandy, with a bishop's see. The churches and religious houses, and the bishop's palace, are all very handsome structures. It is a trading place; and is seated at the confluence of the rivers Arbeck and Gaffi, in E. Long. 6. 20. N. Lat. 49. 11.\n\nLISLE, a large, rich, handsome, and strong town of French Flanders, of which it is the capital, with a strong castle, and a citadel built by Vauban, and said to be the finest in Europe, as well as the best fortified. The largest square, and the public buildings, are very handsome; and they have manufactures of silks, cloths, and cambrics, as well as other stuffs, which have been brought to great perfection. It was taken by the duke of Marlborough, after three months siege and the loss of many thousands of men, in 1708, but restored to the French by the treaty of Utrecht, in consideration of their demolishing the fortifications, of Dunkirk. It was besieged by the Austrians in 1792, who on the 29th of September began a heavy cannonading against it, which continued incessant till the 6th of October, when they were obliged to raise the siege, after having thrown into the city about 30,000 red-hot balls, besides 600 bombs. It is seated on the river Duche, 14 miles west of Tournay, 32 south-west of Ghent, 37 north-west of Mons, and 130 north of Paris. E. Long. 3. 9. N. Lat. 50. 83.\n\nLISLE, Joseph Nicholas de, an eminent astronomer and geographer, was born at Paris in the year 1668. His father having taught him the principles of grammar, he afterwards attended lectures in the Mazarine college, where he delivered his rhetorical exercises in 1706. A total eclipse of the sun having taken place on the 12th of March that year, his taste for mathematics was thus discovered, and he was accordingly placed under a proper tutor, who taught him the elements of geometry, fortification and mechanics; but his favourite study was the science of astronomy.\n\nIn 1707 he was offered the place of an engineer at Martinico, which made him acquainted with the art of drawing, an acquisition which proved highly useful to him in his geographical labours, and also in the study of astronomy. His father having got a copy of An Account of a Voyage to the South sea from his son's master, young de Lisle was excited by the perusal of it to the study of natural history, and he began to make collections of insects, and sketch their varieties; but being afterwards persuaded that so extensive a study, requiring such immense collections to be made as he found in Aldrovandus, was wholly incompatible with that unremitting attention which his favourite science required, he relinquished it accordingly. The attention he paid to astronomical researches was so great, that he was considered as meriting the correspondence of some of the ablest astronomers of Europe at the early age of 21. In 1709 he made a wooden quadrant, which he divided with the utmost accuracy, and which answered the intended purpose in his early observations. He likewise constructed a table for M. Cassini, of the right ascensions and declinations, adapted to all the degrees of latitude and longitude of the planets, and the obliquity of the ecliptic; this table was made use of by M. Cassini in foretelling the occultations of the stars by the moon.\n\nDe Lisle being informed by Cassini in 1710 of his method of representing an eclipse of the sun, by the projection of a terrestrial parallel on a plane; he instantly conceived the idea of applying it to every part of the earth, by means of a globe mounted and prepared for that purpose. Such astronomers as he made acquainted with his project, conceived it to be impracticable; but when the machine was completed, they bestowed the highest encomiums on the noble invention. The first memorable observation made by de Lisle was\nthat of the moon, on the 23d of January 1712, after which his labours experienced some interruption from bodily indisposition. About this time the situation of his father's numerous family rendered it necessary that he should provide for himself, so that he was obliged to make his astronomical knowledge subservient to the absurdities of astrology, receiving pecuniary presents from the regent for his services. He received also in 1715 the grant of a pension of 600 livres, on which occasion he calculated tables of the moon according to the Newtonian theory, prior to Halley's communications to him, which were printed in 1719. De Lisle was chosen a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1714, on which account his objections were redoubled.\n\nIn 1720 he delivered a proposal to the academy for ascertaining in France the figure of the earth, a design which was carried into execution some years afterwards. In 1723 he delivered to the same academy a memoir on the transits of Mercury, wherein a method of calculating them was proposed by him, the way in which they were to be observed, and the inferences to be deduced from these observations. He proposed the use of the quadrant in observing the transits of Venus and Mercury, which has been found superior to any other instrument for that important purpose, and is sanctioned since his day by the practice of the ablest astronomers.\n\nOur distinguished philosopher came over to England in the year 1724, where he became acquainted with Newton and Halley, and had the honour of obtaining their approbation. Newton made him a present of his own portrait, and Halley gave him a copy of the tables which he had published in 1719. He was also created a member of the Royal Society, and he enjoyed similar honours from every literary society in Europe before his death. In 1721 he received an invitation from Peter the Great to go to Peterburgh, to fill the chair of astronomer in the Imperial Academy of Sciences. On the death of that emperor, his successor Catharine renewed the invitation, offering him a considerable pension, of which he accepted, and, in 1726, set out for Peterburgh, accompanied by his brother Lewis and M. Vignon, who were to act as his assistants. He reached Peterburgh in the month of October, and was established in the observatory erected by Peter the Great, which he occupied for 21 years. It was in every respect commodious, but extremely deficient in astronomical apparatus, which his own ingenuity and indefatigable application in a great measure supplied.\n\nA transit of Mercury over the sun's disk was expected in the year 1740, which would not be visible in Europe, and therefore de Lisle undertook a journey to the distant regions of Asia; but after travelling through the inhospitable wilds of Siberia, the cloudiness of the atmosphere prevented him from observing the transit—a mortification which he endeavoured to support by his geographical and physical remarks, and in drawing up a description of the country. He constructed an interesting map of Russia, assisted by his brother Lewis, who was appointed to make observations in the most distant parts of that immense empire. He was occasionally employed for the long period of forty years, in making meteorological observations, which he executed with an accuracy almost incredible.\n\nAfter a number of discouragements and difficulties, and the irregular payment of his pension, had been long experienced by de Lisle at Peterburgh, he returned disgusted to his native place, and was chosen professor of mathematics at the college royal, where he did the most essential service to the sciences, by the important instructions which he gave to his numerous pupils, many of whom became afterwards the most distinguished characters, such as M. M. de la Lande and Melissier.\n\nWhen the transit of Mercury over the sun was eagerly expected in 1733 by the greatest astronomers, de Lisle published an interesting map of the world, representing the effect of Mercury's parallaxes in different countries, that such places might be known as were proper for making those observations on the transit as might determine the distance of the sun. As the apparent orbit of the planet traversed nearly the centre of the sun, de Lisle made use of this circumstance to determine the diameter of that luminary. The last work of our author which was inserted in the volumes of the French academy, was a memoir on the comet which appeared in the year 1758, discovered by a peasant in the vicinity of Dresden.\n\nIt may perhaps be asserted with justice, that the most important service which this great man rendered to astronomers was, his correction of the double error of Halley respecting the transit of Venus, looked for in the year 1761, as by this means he prevented many learned men from undertaking long voyages in order to observe it. About the year 1754, de Lisle was appointed by the king of France, astronomical geographer to the marine, in which capacity he was to collect plans and journals of naval captains, to arrange them methodically, and to make extracts from them of whatever might be beneficial to the service. About the year 1758 he withdrew into quiet retirement at the abbey of St Genevieve, where much of his time was spent in devotional exercises, and in acts of charity and beneficence. Still, however, he continued to prosecute those studies which had been so dear to him during the earlier part of his life; but in 1768 he was seized with a feverish complaint, of which he was cured by his medical friends; but in the month of September the same year he was seized with a species of apoplexy, which carried him off on the 11th day of that month, in the 81st year of his age.\n\nHis extraordinary merit as a man of science may in some measure be gathered from this concise account of his life; and as a citizen of the world his piety was unaffected, his morals pure, his integrity undeviating, his spirit generous and disinterested, and his whole manners highly amiable. The only publication of our author's, besides those already mentioned, consisted of \"Memoirs illustrative of the History of Astronomy,\" in two volumes 4to.\n\nLISLE, Sir John, a brave loyalist in the time of the civil wars, was the son of a bookseller in London, and received his education in the Netherlands. He signalized himself upon many occasions in the civil war, particularly in the last battle of Newbury; where, in the dusk of the evening, he led his men to the charge in his shirt, that his person might be more conspicuous. The king, who was an eye-witness of his bravery, knighted him on the field of battle. In 1648, he rode for his majesty in Essex; and was one of the royalists, who...\nLISMORE, one of the Western islands of Scotland, seated at the mouth of Loch Linne, an arm of the sea in Argyleshire, navigable for the largest ships to Fort William, which is in the country called Lochaber. This island is 10 miles in length by one in breadth; and contains above 1000 inhabitants. It abounds in limestone, which forms a fine loamy and very fertile soil, yielding rich crops of barley. This island was formerly the residence of the bishop of Argyll, from which he was frequently named Episcopus Lismorensis. Great part of the cathedral yet remains, and part of it is still employed as the parish church. The bishop's castle stands four miles from the cathedral; the walls are yet pretty entire. There are some vestiges of fortified camps, and an old castle with a ditch and drawbridge, which, it is said, were erected by the Danes.\n\nLISMORE, a borough town of Ireland, in the county of Waterford, and province of Munster, 100 miles from Dublin; N. Lat. 52° 5', W. Long. 7° 50'. It was anciently called Leffmore or Lass-more, i.e. the great enclosure, or habitation; it is now a bishopric, and formerly had an university. St Carthagh or Mochuda, in the beginning of the seventh century, founded an abbey and school in this place, which in a short time was much resorted to, not only by the natives, but also by the Britons and Saxons, during the middle ages. According to an ancient writer of the life of St Carthagh, Lismore was in general inhabited by monks, half of it being an asylum into which no woman dared enter; consisting entirely of cells and monasteries, the ruins of which, with seven churches, are yet visible. A castle was built here by King John. The site of Lismore was in early ages denominated magh skia, or the \"cholen shield,\" being the situation of a dun or fort of the ancient chieftains of the Decies, one of whom granted it to St Carthagh on his expulsion from the abbey of Ratheney in Westmeath. On becoming an university, Math Syliath obtained the name of Dunfinne, or the \"fort of the Saxons;\" from the number of Saxons who resorted thereto; but soon after, it was called Lisas-more or Leff-more, and now Lismore; the bishopric of which was united to that of Waterford in 1363, being 735 years after its foundation. The public road to Cork was formerly through this place, and at that time it had a better face of business. St Carthagh, who retired to this place with some of his religious in 636, to avoid the fury of the then Irish monarch, tied his disciples to a most strict rule of life; they never were allowed the use of flesh, fish, or fowl; only the vegetables that the ground produced at the expense of their own labour. Father Daniel, in his Histoire Monastique, mentions one on the same foundation in France. The castle here, which, as we have formerly mentioned, was built by King John, was erected in 1195 on the ruins of the abbey of St Carthagh: it belonged to the duke of Devonshire, and gave birth to the great philosopher Robert Boyle. In 1189 it was demolished by the Irish, who took it by surprise. Being afterwards re-edified, it was for many years an episcopal residence, till Myler Magrath, archbishop of Cashel, and bishop of this see, granted the manor of Lismore to that noted scholar and soldier Sir Walter Raleigh, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, at the yearly rent of £3l. 6s. 8d.; but that estate was lopped off with his head in the reign of King James I. After which it fell into the hands of Sir Richard Boyle, who purchased all Sir Walter's lands; he beautified the whole, and added many buildings to it, most of which were burned down in the Irish rebellion; at the breaking out of which, it was closely besieged by 3000 Irish commanded by Sir Richard Beling, and was well defended by the young Lord Broghill, third son of the earl of Cork, who obliged them to raise the siege. The castle is boldly seated on the verge of a rocky hill, rising almost perpendicularly to a considerable height over the river Blackwater. The entrance is by an ancient and venerable avenue of trees. Over the gate are the venerable arms of the first earl of Cork. Opposite to the entrance is a modern portico of Bath stone, of the Doric order, designed by Inigo Jones. Most of the buildings have remained in ruins since the era of the rebellion; but the several offices that make up two sides of the square are kept in repair. At each angle is a tower, the chief remains of its former magnificence. In October 1785, the late duke of Rutland, then lord lieutenant of Ireland, whilst on a tour in Munster, held a council in, and issued proclamations from this castle. The cathedral is still pretty well kept in repair. Here is a fine bridge over the river Blackwater, erected at a very great expense by the duke of Devonshire: this bridge is remarkable for the extent of the principal arch, the span of it being 102 feet. Below the town is a rich fishery for salmon, which is the greatest branch of trade here. Though this place is at present much reduced, yet Cambrensis informs us, that, not many years after the conquest, this was a very rich city, and held out some time against the English, who took it at last by storm, and gained rich plunder here, enough to load 16 sail of ships.\n\nLISSA, an island in the gulf of Venice, on the coast of Dalmatia, belonging to the Venetians, where they have a fishery of sardines and anchovies.

See Architecture.\n\nList, is also used, to signify the inclosed field or ground wherein the ancient knights held their jousts and combats. It was so called, as being hemmed round with pales, barriers, or stakes, as with a lift. Some of these were double, one for each cavalier; which kept them apart, so that they could not come nearer each other than a spear's length. See Just, Tournament, Duel, &c.\n\nCivil List, in the British polity. The expenses defrayed by the civil list are those that in any shape relate to civil government; as, the expenses of the household; all salaries to officers of state, to the judges, and every one of the king's servants, the appointments to foreign ambassadors; the maintenance of the queen and royal family; the king's private expenses, or privy-purse; and other very numerous outgoings, as secret-service money, pensions, and other bounties: which sometimes have so far exceeded the revenues appointed for that purpose, that application has been made to parliament to discharge the debts contracted on the civil list; as particularly in 1724, when one million was granted for that purpose by the statute 11 Geo. I. c. 17, and, in 1769, when half a million was appropriated to the like uses by the statute 9 Geo. III. c. 34.\n\nThe civil list is indeed properly the whole of the king's revenue in his own direct capacity; the rest being rather the revenue of the public, or its creditors, though collected and distributed again in the name and by the officers of the crown: it now standing in the same place, as the hereditary income did formerly; and as that has gradually diminished, the parliamentary appointments have increased. The whole revenue of Queen Elizabeth did not amount to more than 600,000l. a-year: that of King Charles I. was 800,000l., and the revenue voted for King Charles II. was 1,200,000l., though complaints were made (in the first years at least) that it did not amount to so much. But it must be observed, that under these sums were included all manner of public expenses; among which Lord Clarendon, in his speech to the parliament, computed that the charge of the navy and land forces amounted annually to 800,000l., which was ten times more than before the former troubles. The same revenue, subject to the same charges, was settled on King James II.; but by the increase of trade, and more frugal management, it amounted on an average to 1,500,000l. per annum, (besides other additional customs granted by parliament, which produced an annual revenue of 400,000l.), out of which his fleet and army were maintained at the yearly expense of 1,100,000l. After the Revolution, when the parliament took into its own hands the annual support of the forces both maritime and military, a civil list revenue was settled on the new king and queen, amounting, with the hereditary duties, to 700,000l. per annum; and the same was continued to Queen Anne and King George I. That of King George II. was nominally augmented to 800,000l.* and in fact was considerably more: but that of his present majesty is expressly limited to that sum; though 1,000,000l. hath been since added. And upon the whole, it is doubtless much better for the crown, and also for the people, to have the revenue settled upon the modern footing rather than the ancient. For the crown, because it is more certain, and collected with greater ease; for the people, because they are now delivered from the feudal hardships, and other odious branches of the prerogative. And though complaints have sometimes been made of the increase of the civil list, yet if we consider the sums that have been formerly granted, the limited extent under which it is now established, the revenues and prerogatives given up in lieu of it by the crown, the numerous branches of the present royal family, and (above all) the diminution of the value of money compared with what it was worth in the last century, we must acknowledge these complaints to be void of any rational foundation; and that it is impossible to support that dignity, which a king of Great Britain should maintain, with an income in any degree less than what is now established by parliament. See Revenue.\n\nTo List or Enlist Soldiers, to retain and enroll men as soldiers, either as volunteers, or by a kind of compulsion. Persons listed must be carried within four days, but not sooner than 24 hours after, before the next justice of peace of any county, riding, city, or place, or chief magistrate of any city or town corporate (not being an officer in the army); and if before such justice or magistrate they dissent from such enlisting, and return the enlisting money, and also 20 shillings in lieu of all charges expended on them, they are to be discharged. But persons refusing or neglecting to return and pay such money within 24 hours, shall be deemed as duly listed as if they had assented thereto before the proper magistrate; and they shall, in that case, be obliged to take the oath, or, upon refusal, they shall be confined by the officer who listed them till they do take it.\n\nLister, Dr Martin, an eminent English physician and naturalist, was born in 1638, and educated at Cambridge. He afterwards travelled into France; and at his return practised physic at York, and afterwards at London. In 1683 he was created doctor of physic, and became fellow of the College of Physicians in London. In 1698, he attended the earl of Portland in his embassy from King William III. to the court of France; of which journey he published an account at his return, and was afterwards physician to Queen Anne. He also published, 1. Historia animalium Angliae, quarto. 2. Conchyliorum Synopsis, folio. 3. Cochlearum et limacum exercitatio anatomica, 4 vols. 8vo. 4. Many pieces in the Philosophical Transactions; and other works.\n\nListowel, a parish, also a post and fair town, of Ireland, in the county of Kerry and province of Munster, 131 miles from Dublin, anciently Lir Tuatha, i.e. \"the fort of Tuatha,\" who was exiled in the 11th century, but returned; and his life forms a brilliant era in Irish history. Near this are the ruins of a castle, pleasantly situated on the river Feale; it was taken in November 1600, by Sir Charles Wilmot, being then held out for Lord Kerry against Queen Elizabeth. Five miles beyond Listowel are the ruins of a church. The fairs are three in the year.\n\nLitana Silva, in Ancient Geography, a wood of\nLITANY, of the Roi, in Galia Togata, or Cispadana, where the Romans, under L. Pothisnius Albinus (whose head the Boii cut off, and carried in triumph into their most sacred temple), had a great defeat; of twenty-five thousand scarcely ten escaping (Livy). Holstius conjectures, that this happened above the springs of the Scultenna, in a part of the Appenine, between Cerinianum and Mutina. Now Selva di Legno.\n\nLITANY, a solemn form of supplication to God, in which the priest utters some things fit to be prayed for, and the people join in their intercession, saying, \"we beseech thee to hear us, good Lord, &c.\" The word comes from the Greek ἀληθεία, \"supplication;\" of ἀληθεύω, \"I beseech.\"\n\nAt first the use of litanies was not fixed to any stated time, but were only employed as exigencies required. They were observed, in imitation of the Nivites, with ardent supplications and fasting, to avert the threatening judgments of fire, earthquakes, inundations, or hostile invasions. About the year 400, litanies began to be used in processions, the people walking barefoot, and repeating them with great devotion; and it is pretended, that by this means several countries were delivered from great calamities. The days on which these were used were called rogation days; these were appointed by the canons of different councils, till it was decreed by the council of Toledo, that they should be used every month throughout the year; and thus by degrees they came to be used weekly on Wednesdays and Fridays, the ancient stationary days for fasting. To these days the rubric of our church has added Sundays, as being the greatest days for assembling at divine service. Before the last review of the common prayer, the litany was a distinct service by itself, and used some time after the morning prayer was over; at present it is made one office with the morning service, being ordered to be read after the third collect for grace, instead of the intercessional prayers in the daily service.\n\nLITCHFIELD, a city of Staffordshire, in England, 117 miles from London. It stands low, about three miles from the Trent; and its ancient name is said to have been Liciidfield, signifying, \"a field of carcases,\" from a great number of Christians having, as it is pretended, suffered martyrdom here in the persecution under Diocletian. In the Saxons' time, it was a bishoprick for a short space; and is now, together with Coventry, a bishoprick. It is divided into two parts by a rivulet and a kind of shallow lake, over which are two causeways with sluices. It is a long straggling place; but has some very handsome houses, and well paved clean streets. That part on the south side of the rivulet is called the city, and the other the clove. The city is much the largest, and contains several public structures. It was incorporated by Edw. VI. with the name of bailiffs and burgesses; and is both a town and county, governed by 2 bailiffs chosen yearly out of 24 burgesses, a recorder, a sheriff, a steward, and other officers. The city has power of life and death within their jurisdiction, a court of record, and a pie-powder court. Here is a gaol both for debtors and felons, a free school, and a pretty large well endowed hospital, for a matter and 12 brethren. The county of the city is 10 or 12 miles in compass, which the Litchfield sheriff rides yearly on the 8th of September, and then feasts the corporation and neighbouring gentry. The clove is so called from its being enclosed with a wall and a deep dry ditch on all sides except towards the city, where it is defended by a great lake or marsh formed by its brook. The cathedral, which stands in the clove, was originally built by Offa king of Northumberland about 300. It was rebuilt and enlarged by Offa king of Mercia in 766. In 1148 was rebuilt, and greatly enlarged in 1296. At the reformation, Coventry was divided from it. In the civil wars its spire was destroyed, and it converted to a stable. In 1776 a beautiful painted window, by the benefaction of Dr Adenbrook, has been set up at the western end of the cathedral. In the civil wars it was several times taken and retaken, and thereby suffered much; but was so repaired after the restoration, at the expense of 20,000l. that it was one of the fairest and noblest structures of the kind in England. It is walled in like a castle, and stands so high as to be seen 10 miles round. It is 450 feet long, of which the choir is 110, and the breadth in the broadest place 80. Its portico is hardly to be paralleled in England. There were, till lately, 26 statues of the prophets, apostles, kings of Judah, and some kings of this land, in a row above it, as big as the life; and on the top, at each corner of the portico, is a fluted spire, besides a fine high steeple on the middle of the church. The choir is paved in great part with alabaster and cannel coal, in imitation of black and white marble. In 1789 it underwent a general repair, when the massive groined arch between the west end of the church and the transept, which had forced the side wall out of its perpendicular, was removed. The prebendaries stalls, which are thought to be the best in England, were most of them re-erected at the charge of the country gentlemen, whose names and arms are painted at the top of the stalls. The north door is extremely rich in sculpture, but much injured by time. The body which is supported by pillars formed of numbers of slender columns, has lately had its decayed leaden roof replaced by a neat slated covering. The choir merits attention on account of the elegant sculpture about the windows, and the embattled gallery that runs beneath them; to which the altarpiece of Grecian architecture but ill corresponds; behind which is Mary's chapel, divided from it by a most elegant stone screen of beautiful workmanship. Here stood St Chad's shrine, which cost 2000l. The charter house is an octagon room. In the same clove are the palaces of the bishop and dean, and the prebendaries houses in a court on the hill. Here are three other churches; one of which, St Michael's, has a churchyard of 6 or 7 acres. There was a castle here, long since destroyed: and ancient camps have been discovered in its environs. In the neighbourhood are frequent horse races. The markets there are on Tuesday and Friday, and six fairs in the year. By the late inland navigation, this place has communication with the rivers Mersey, Dee, Ribble, Ouse, Trent, Darwent, Severn, Humber, Thames, Avon, &c. which navigation, including its windings, extends above 500 miles in the counties of Lincoln, Nottingham, York, Lancaster, Westmoreland, Chester, Warwick,\nLITERARY, anything belonging to LITERATURE.\n\nLITERARY Property, or Copy Right.\n\nLITERATI (letterati, \"lettered\"), an epithet given to such persons among the Chinese as are able to read and write their language. The literati alone are capable of being made mandarins.\n\nLITERATI, is also the name of a particular sect, either in religion, philosophy, or politics, consisting principally of the learned men of that country; among whom it is called jiaokao, i.e., \"learned.\"\n\nIt had its rise in the year of Christ 1400, when the emperor, to awaken the native affection of the people for knowledge, which had been quite banished by the preceding civil wars among them, and to stir up emulation among the mandarins, chose out 42 of the ablest among their doctors, to whom he gave a commission to compose a body of doctrine agreeable to that of the ancients, which was then become the rule or standard of the learned. The delegates applied themselves to the business with very great attention; but some fancied them rather to have wrestled the doctrine of the ancients, to make it consist with theirs, than to have built up theirs on the model of the ancients.\n\nThey speak of the Deity, as if it were no more than mere nature or the natural power or virtue that produces, disposes, and preserves, the several parts of the universe. It is, say they, a pure, perfect principle, without beginning or end; it is the source of all things, the essence of every being, and that which determines it to be what it is. They make God the soul of the world; they say, he is diffused through all matter, and produces all the changes that happen there. In short, it is not easy to determine, whether they resolve God into nature, or lift up nature into God; for they ascribe to it many of those things which we attribute to God.\n\nThis doctrine, in lieu of the idolatry that prevailed before, introduced a refined kind of atheism. The work, being composed by so many persons of learning and parts, and approved by the emperor himself, was received with infinite applause by all the people. Many were pleased with it, because it seemed to subvert all religion; others approved it, because the little religion that it left them could not give them much trouble. And thus was formed the sect of the Literati: which consists of the maintainers and adherents to this doctrine.\n\nThe court, the mandarins, and the persons of fortune and quality, &c., are generally retainers to it; but a great part of the common people still hold to their worship of idols.\n\nThe literati freely tolerate the Mahometans, because they adore, with them, the King of heaven, and Author of nature; but they bear a perfect aversion to all sorts of idolaters among them: and it was once resolved to extirpate them. But the disorder this would have occasioned in the empire prevented it; they now content themselves with condemning them, in general, as heretics; which they do solemnly every year at Pekin.\n\nLITERATURE denotes learning or skill in letters.\n\nLITERNUM.

Greatest part of the litharge met with in the shops is produced in the purification of silver from lead, and the refining of gold and silver by means of this metal: according to the degree of fire and other circumstances, it proves of a pale or deep colour: the first has been commonly called litharge of silver, the other litharge of gold. See Lead, Chemistry Index.\n\nLITHGOW, WILLIAM, a Scotman, whose sufferings by imprisonment and torture at Malaga, and whose travels, on foot, over Europe, Asia, and Africa, seem to raise him almost to the rank of a martyr and a hero, published an account of his peregrinations and adventures. Though the author deals much in the marvellous, the horrid account of the strange cruelties of which, he tells us, he was the subject, have, however, an air of truth. Soon after his arrival in England from Malaga, he was carried to Theobald's on a feather-bed, that King James might be an eyewitness of his martyred anatomy, by which he means his wretched body, mangled and reduced to a skeleton. The whole court crowded to see him; and his majesty ordered him to be taken care of, and he was twice sent to Bath at his expense. By the king's command he applied to Gondamor, the Spanish ambassador, for the recovery of the money and other things of value which the governor of Malaga had taken from him, and for 100l. for his support. He was promised a full reparation for the damage he had sustained: but the perfidious minister never performed his promise. When he was upon the point of leaving England, Lithgow upbraided him with the breach of his word in the presence-chamber, before several gentlemen of the court. This occasioned their fighting upon the spot; and the ambassador, as the traveller oddly expresses it, had his fistula (with which disorder he was afflicted) contrabanded with his fist. The unfortunate Lithgow, who was generally condemned for his spirited behaviour, was sent to the Marshalsea, where he continued a prisoner nine months. At the conclusion of the octavo edition of his Travels he informs us, that, in his three voyages, \"his painful feet have tramped over (besides passages of seas and rivers) 36,000 and odd miles, which draweth near to twice the circumference of the whole earth.\" Here the marvellous seems to rise to the incredible; and to set him, in point of veracity, below Coryat, whom it is nevertheless certain that he far outwalked. His description of Ireland is whimsical and curious. This, together with the narrative of his sufferings, is reprinted in Morgan's Phoenix Britannicus.\n\nLITHIASIS, or STONE. See Medicine Index.\n\nLITHOMANTIA, in antiquity, a species of divination performed with stones. Sometimes the stone called fiderites was used; this they washed in spring-water in the night by candle-light; the person that consulted\nconsulted it was to be purified from all manner of pollution, and to have his face covered: this done, he repeated divine prayers, and placed certain characters in an appointed order; and then the stone moved of itself, and in a soft gentle murmur, or (as some say) in a voice like that of a child, returned an answer. By a stone of this nature, Helenus is reported to have foretold the destruction of Troy.\n\n**LITHONTRIPTICS** (from λίθος \"a stone,\" and ἀποκλείω \"to break\"); an epithet for medicines that are supposed to break the stone in the bladder. Though the different stones that are generated in the human bladder require different solvents when out of the body; and though art hath not yet afforded a medicine which, when injected into the bladder, will, without injury thereto, dissolve the stone therein lodged; it cannot thence be concluded, that there are no lithontriptic medicines. It may be here observed, that one solvent affects one subject, but hath no effect on another; so a solvent may yet be met with that will destroy the stone, and not hurt the human body. The water into which the boiled white of egg dissolves will liquefy myrrh, but may be put into the human eye without causing any uneasiness.\n\nSoap ley taken at first in small doses in broth that is freed from all its fat, succeeds in most cases which require an alkaline solvent. The patient may begin with 20 drops, and gradually increase the dose as he is able; and by repeating it three times a day for six, eight, or twelve months, the wished-for effects often follow.\n\n**LITHOPHYTA**, the name of Linnaeus's third order of vermes. See **Helminthology Index**.\n\n**LITHOSPERMUM, GROMWELL**, a genus of plants belonging to the pentandra clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 4th order, **Aperiflorae**. See **Botany Index**.\n\n**LITHOSTROTON**, among the Romans, was a pavement of mosaic work, consisting of small pieces of cut marble of different kinds and colours, first used in the time of Sylla, who made one at Preneste in the temple of Fortune, and afterwards in private houses; and were brought to such perfection, that they exhibited most lively representations of nature, with all the accuracy of the finest painting.\n\n**LITHOTOMY**, in Surgery, the operation of cutting for the stone. See **Surgery Index**.\n\n**LITHUANIA**, an extensive province of Poland. By the natives it is called **Letuva**, and has Great Poland and Russia on the west; part of Muscovy on the east; Livonia, the Baltic sea, and part of Muscovy, on the north; Red Russia, Volhynia, and Podolia, on the south; and the Ukraine on the south-east. Its length is said to be about 360, and its breadth 340 miles; but it is much indented both ways. Lithuania was anciently overrun with wood; and there are still many forests in it, which yield a great deal of honey, wax, pitch, tar, and timber; and abound with wild boars, buffaloes, elks, wild horses, wild asses, uri, and woodcocks. The lakes are also numerous, and well stored with fish; but the air, by reason of these forests and lakes, is said to be thick and foggy. The country produces a great deal of buck wheat and other corn; the pastures are luxuriant, and the flocks and herds numerous: so that, notwithstanding agriculture is much neglected, but provisions are exceeding cheap, and money so scarce, that 10 per cent. is the common interest. The principal nobility have large estates, and live in great pomp and splendour, generally retaining some hundreds of those that are poor, in quality of domestics. The established religion is Popery; but Lutherans, Calvinists, Jews, Turks, Greeks, and Socinians, are very numerous. Lithuania was governed by its own dukes till it was united to Poland, towards the end of the 14th century, when the great duke Jagello married Hedwig, the dowager of Louis king of Poland and Hungary. It had even dukes after that, but they were subordinate to the king; and at this day, though one diet serves for both countries, yet each has its peculiar laws, customs, dialect, and privileges. In a diet held at Lublin in 1569, it was more closely united to Poland than it had been before; and it was enacted, that both countries, for the future, should form but one state under the same prince. As to their courts of justice, the tenth part of what is adjudged in all real actions goes always to the judge's box, and is immediately paid in court; and in personal actions he claims half the damages given. A nobleman is only fined for murder, as in Poland. The dialect is a language of the Slavonic; and they speak here, as in Poland, a barbarous kind of Latin. Lithuania is divided into nine palatinates. Another division is into Lithuania properly so called, and Lithuanian Russia. Some also comprehend under it Samogitia and Courland, which is a fief of Poland.\n\n**LITMUS, or LACMUS**, in the arts, is a blue pigment, formed from archil. It is brought from Holland at a cheap rate; but may be prepared by adding quicklime and purified urine, or spirit of urine diluted from lime, to the archil previously bruised by grinding. The mixture having cooled, and the fluid suffered to evaporate, becomes a mass of the consistence of a paste, which is laid on boards to dry in square lumps. It is only used in miniature paintings, and cannot be well depended on, because the least approach of acid changes it instantly from blue to red. The best litmus is very apt to change and fly.\n\n**LITTER** (littera), a kind of vehicle borne upon shafts; anciently esteemed the most easy and genteel way of carriage. Du Cange derives the word from the barbarous Latin lectoria \"straw or bedding for beasts.\" Others will rather have it come from lectus \"bed;\" there being ordinarily a quilt and a pillow to a litter in the same manner as to a bed.\n\nPliny calls the litter the traveller's chamber; it was much in use among the Romans, among whom it was borne by slaves kept for that purpose; as it still continues to be in the east, where it is called a palanquin—The Roman lectica, made to be borne by four men, was called tetraphorum; that borne by six hexaphorum; and that borne by eight octaphorum.\n\nThe invention of litters, according to Cicero, was owing to the kings of Bithynia; in the time of Tiberius they were become very frequent at Rome, as appears from Seneca; and even slaves themselves were borne in them, though never by more than two persons, whereas men of quality had six or eight.\n\nLitter also denotes a parcel of dry old straw put on the floor of a horse's stall for him to lie down and rest upon. When a horse comes tired into a stable, fresh\nLitter has the virtue of making him stale immediately. This is known to be a very great advantage to a horse in a tired state; and when the litter is old and dirty, it never has any such effect upon him. If the owners knew how refreshing it is for a horse to discharge his urine on his return from labour, they would be more careful of giving them all means and occasions of it than they are. This stalling after fatigue prevents those obstructions in the neck of the bladder or urinary passages which horses are too subject to.\n\nLITTLETON, Sir Thomas, judge of the common pleas, was the eldest son of Thomas Wellicote, Esq., of the county of Devon, by Elizabeth, sole heiress of Thomas Littleton of Frankley in Worcestershire, at whose request he took the name and arms of that family. He was educated at one of our universities, probably at Cambridge. Thence he removed to the Inner Temple, where he became one of the readers; and was afterwards, by Henry VI., made steward or judge of the court of the palace, or marshal of the king's household. In 1455, the thirty-third of that reign, he was appointed king's serjeant, and rode the northern circuit as judge of assize. In 1462, the second of Edward IV., he obtained a pardon from the crown; and, in 1466, was appointed one of the judges of the common pleas, and rode the Northamptonshire circuit. In the year 1474 he was, with many of the first nobility, created knight of the Bath. He died in 1481; and was buried in the cathedral church of Worcester, where a marble tomb, with his statue upon it, was erected to his memory. As to his character as a lawyer, it is sufficient to inform the reader, that he was the author of the Treatise upon Tenures, on which Sir Edward Coke wrote a comment, well known by the title of Coke upon Littleton.\n\nLittleton, Adam, descended from an ancient family in Shropshire, was born in 1627, educated at Westminster school, and went to Oxford a student of Christ-church, whence he was ejected by the parliament visitors in 1648. Soon after, he became usher of Westminster school, and in 1658 was made second master of Westminster school. After the restoration he taught a school at Chelsea in Middlesex, of which church he was admitted rector in the year 1664. In 1670 he accumulated the degrees in divinity, being then chaplain in ordinary to his majesty. In 1674, he became prebendary of Westminster, of which church he was afterwards sub-dean. Beside the well-known Latin and English Dictionary, he published several other works. He died in 1694, and was interred at Chelsea. He was an universal scholar; and extremely charitable, humane, and easy of access.\n\nLITURGY denotes all the ceremonies in general belonging to divine service.\n\nThe word comes from the Greek λειτουργία \"service, public ministry;\" formed of λέιτος \"public,\" and γόνος \"work.\"\n\nIn a more restrained signification, liturgy is used among the Romanists to signify the mass; and among us the common prayer.\n\nAll who have written on Liturgies agree, that in the primitive days divine service was exceedingly simple, only clogged with a very few ceremonies, and consisting of but a small number of prayers; but, by degrees, they increased the number of external ceremonies, and added new prayers, to make the office look more awful and venerable to the people. At length things were carried to such a pitch, that a regulation became necessary; and it was found proper to put the service, and the manner of performing it, into writing; and this was what they called a Liturgy.\n\nLiturgies have been different at different times, and in different countries. We have the liturgy of St Chrysostom, that of St Peter, of St James, the liturgy of St Basil, the Armenian liturgy, the liturgy of the Maronites, of the Coptae, the Roman liturgy, the Gallican liturgy, the English liturgy, the Ambrosian liturgy, the Spanish and African liturgies, &c.\n\nIn the more early ages of the church, every bishop had a power to form a liturgy for his own diocese; and if he kept to the analogy of faith and doctrine, all circumstances were left to his own discretion. Afterwards the practice was for the whole province to follow the metropolitan church, which also became the general rule of the church; and this Lindwood acknowledges to be the common law of the church; intimating, that the use of several services in the same province, which was the case in England, was not to be warranted but by long custom. The liturgy of the church of England was composed in the year 1547, and established in the second year of King Edward VI., stat. 2, and 3, Ed. VI. cap. 1.\n\nIn the fifth year of this king it was reviewed; because some things were contained in that liturgy which showed a compliance with the superstition of those times, and some exceptions were taken against it by some learned men at home, and by Calvin abroad. Some alterations were made in it, which consisted in adding the general confession and abolition, and the communion to begin with the ten commandments. The use of oil in confirmation and extreme unction was left out, and all prayers for souls departed, and what tended to a belief of Christ's real presence in the eucharist. This liturgy, so reformed, was established by the act of 5 and 6 Ed. VI., cap. 1. However, it was abolished by Queen Mary, who enacted, that the service should stand as it was most commonly used in the last year of the reign of King Henry VIII. The liturgy of 5 and 6 Ed. VI. was re-established with some few alterations and additions, by 1 Eliz. cap. 2. Some farther alterations were introduced, in consequence of the review of the common-prayer book, by order of King James, in the first year of his reign; particularly in the office of private baptism, in several rubricks and other passages, with the addition of five or six new prayers and thanksgivings, and all that part of the catechism which contains the doctrine of the sacraments. The book of common-prayer, so altered, remained in force from the first year of King James to the fourteenth of Charles II. But the last review of the liturgy was in the year 1661, and the last act of uniformity enjoining the observance of it is 13 and 14 Car. II. cap. 4. See Common-Prayer. Many applications have been since made for a review, but hitherto without success.\n\nLITUUS, among the Romans, was the staff made use of by the augurs in quartering the heavens. It bore a great resemblance to the crozier of a bishop, but was shorter. It was crooked at one end, and thickest in\nLIVADIA, anciently Achaia and Hellas, or Greece properly so called; a province of Turkey in Europe, bounded on the north by Epirus and Thessaly, from which it is separated by Mount Oeta, now Banina, and by the Euripus, now the strait of Negropont; on the east, by the Archipelago; on the south, by the gulf of Egina or Egina, the isthmus of Corinth, and the gulf of Lepanto; and on the west, by the Ionian sea and part of Epirus. Its extent is about 130 miles from north-west to south-east; but its greatest breadth is not above 36 miles. It is in general a mountainous country; but neither unpleasing nor unfruitful. The principal mountains are, Mount Oeta in Boeotia, where is the famous pass of Thermopylae, not above 25 feet broad; and Parnassus, Helicon, and Cytharion in Phocis, which were sacred to Apollo and the muses, and consequently much celebrated by the poets. The rivers of most note are, the Sionapro, anciently the Achelous, the Cephissus, the Imenus, and the Alpheus. The province is at present divided into Livadia proper, Stramulippa, and the duchy of Athens. The principal places are, Lepanto, anciently Naupactus; Livadia, anciently Libadia or Lebadia; the celebrated city of Athens, now Setines; Thebes, now Stibes; Lepina, anciently Eleusis; Castris, formerly Delphi; and Megara.\n\nLIVERPOOL, a large, flourishing, and populous Liverpool town of England, in the county of Lancaster, situated at the influx of the river Mersey into the sea. This town has so much increased in trade since the commencement of the present century, that it is now the greatest sea-port in England except London, having exceeded Bristol considerably of late years, which will appear by the following account of the custom-duties, received in the several ports of London, Liverpool, and Bristol, in the year 1784, taken from the report of the commissioners for inspecting the state of public accounts.\n\n| Port     | Custom Duty |\n|----------|-------------|\n| London   | £5,187,052   |\n| Liverpool| £640,684     |\n| Bristol  | £334,909     |\n\nLiverpool exceeded Bristol, £305,774\n\nThe following shows how much the trade has increased since the above period:\n\nDuties received in the port of Liverpool from July 5th 1785, to October 10th 1787, £298,361\n\nThe merchants here trade to all parts of the world except Turkey and the East Indies; but the most beneficial trade is to Guinea and the West Indies, by which many of them have acquired very large fortunes.\n\nLiverpool, during the last war, carried on more foreign trade than any town in England; and such is the state of it at this time, that there are near three thousand vessels cleared from that port in one year to different parts of the world. Here are several manufactories for China-ware, and pot-houses which make very fine ware, some salt-works, glass-houses, and upwards of 50 breweries, from some of which large quantities of malt liquor are sent abroad. Many of the buildings are formed in the most elegant manner; but the old streets are narrow; which defect will soon be removed, as the corporation have lately obtained an act of parliament for the improvement of the town, which they have already begun to put in force with great spirit, having taken down the principal streets in the centre of the town, and rebuilt them in a spacious and most magnificent manner; so that in a few years it will be one of the handsomest towns in England. This town contains fifteen churches, namely, St Peter's, St Nicholas's, St George's, St Thomas's, St Paul's, St Ann's, St John's, Trinity, St James's, St Catharine's, St Mary's, St Stephen's, St Matthew's, St Mark's, Christ Church, and All Saints. There are also meetings for independents, anabaptists, quakers, methodists, and presbyterians. The exchange is a noble structure, built of white stone in the form of a square, and round it are piazzas where the merchants assemble to transact business. Above it are the mayor's offices, the fellows' hall, the council-chamber, and two elegant ball-rooms. The expense of erecting this building amounted to £30,000. The custom-house is situated at the head of the old dock, and is a handsome and convenient structure. Here are many charitable foundations, among which is an excellent grammar school well endowed, and many of the youth taught in it have exhibitions in the universities. The infirmary is a large edifice of brick.\nLiverpool, brick and stone, situated on a hill in a very pleasant airy situation, at one end of the town.\n\nIn the town is a charity-school supported by voluntary subscriptions and contributions for 50 boys and 12 girls, who are not only clothed and educated, but also provided with food and lodging; likewise several almshouses for the widows of seamen; and an excellent poor-house, superior to any in the kingdom, where upwards of 800 men, women, and children, are supported, many of whom are employed in spinning cotton and wool. There are five large wet docks, three dry docks, and several graving docks for the repairing of shipping; which renders it the most commodious sea-port in the world. The quays which bound these docks are covered with warehouses; which is a convenience that enables the merchant to discharge his ship at a very small expense. The new prison lately finished is a noble edifice, being built entirely on the plan of the great and benevolent Mr Howard, for solitary confinement; and is perhaps the most convenient, airy, magnificent building of the kind of Europe; being upon a very extensive scale.\n\nLiverpool received its charter from King John; but it was a borough by prescription long before his reign. It is under the government of a recorder, mayor, and an unlimited number of aldermen, two bailiffs, and a common council of forty of the principal inhabitants, with a town-clerk and other proper officers. The town has a weekly market on Saturday, and is distant from London 234 miles. The progressive rise of population in Liverpool, may be conceived by perusing the following table:\n\n| Year | Christened | Buried | Married |\n|------|------------|--------|---------|\n| 1660 | 3          | —      | —       |\n| 1680 | 106        | 51     | 5       |\n| 1700 | 132        | 124    | 35      |\n| 1720 | 410        | 293    | 38      |\n| 1740 | 495        | 608    | 137     |\n| 1760 | 986        | 599    | 408     |\n| 1780 | 1799       | 1544   | 606     |\n| 1787 | 2207       | 1773   | 804     |\n\nThe whole population of Liverpool in the year 1793 was computed to amount to 56,782.\n\nBy means of inland navigation, Liverpool has communication with the rivers Dee, Ribble, Ouse, Trent, Darwent, Severn, Humber, Thames, Avon, &c., which navigation, including its windings, extends above 500 miles, in the counties of Lincoln, Nottingham, York, Westmoreland, Chester, Stafford, Warwick, Leicestershire, Oxford, Worcestershire, &c. The Mersey, upon which the town is situated, abounds with salmon, cod, flounders, turbot, plaice, and smelts; and at full sea it is above two miles over. In the neighbourhood are frequent horse-races, on a five-mile course, the finest for the length in England. The soil in and near the town is dry and sandy, and particularly favourable to the growth of potatoes, on which the farmers often depend more than on wheat or any other grain. Fresh water is brought into the town by pipes, from some springs four miles off, pursuant to an act of parliament in the reign of Queen Anne. The dock duties of Liverpool in 1760 amounted to £2330l. but in 1805 to £33,564l., an astonishing proof of the rapid increase of its trade. The dispensary of this town does honour to human nature, and has been of the most singular advantage to the afflicted, since 172,273 persons were cured of every disorder incident to human nature, between the years 1778 and 1794, being on an average about 10,000 persons every year. The Union News Room was instituted on the 1st of January 1804; the Lyceum much about the same period, the erection of which cost the sum of £11,000l. and the Commercial News Room in 1803. The institution for restoring drowned persons is worthy of notice, as more than 400 people have become objects of it since it was founded, and more than one half of that number have been restored. The Athenaeum, which comprises a news room and library, was projected in 1798, and finished before the close of the year. There are four weekly papers published at Liverpool. From 1783 to 1793 inclusive the value of slaves imported into the West Indies in Liverpool vessels, amounted to £15,186,850l. sterling; and the advantages which it derives from its inland navigation are more than can be properly estimated. Liverpool sends two members to parliament.\n\nLIVERY, in matters of dress and equipage, a certain colour and form of dress, by which noblemen and gentlemen choose to distinguish their servants.\n\nLiveries are usually taken from fancy, or continued in families by succession. The ancient cavaliers, at their tournaments, distinguished themselves by wearing the liveries of their mistresses; thus people of quality make their domestics wear their livery.\n\nFather Menefrier, in his Treatise of Carouals, has given a very ample account of the mixtures of colours in liveries. Dion tells us, that Oenomaus was the first who invented green and blue colours, for the troops which, in the circus, were to represent land and sea fights.\n\nThe Roman church has also her several colours and liveries; white, for confessors and virgins, and in times of rejoicing; black, for the dead; red, for the apostles and martyrs; blue or violet, for penitents; and green, in times of hope.\n\nFormerly, great men gave liveries to several, who were not of their family or servants, to engage them in their quarrels for that year; but this was prohibited by the statutes 1 Rich. II. 1 Hen. IV. cap. 27. 2 and 7 Hen. IV. 8 Hen. VI. cap. 4. 8 Ed. IV. cap. 2; and no man, of whatever condition, was allowed to give any livery, but to his domestic officers, and counsel learned in the law. However, most of the above statutes are repealed by 3 Car. I. cap. 4.\n\nLIVERY of Seisin, in Law, signifies delivering the possession of lands, &c., to him who has a right to them.\n\nLIVERYMEN of London, are a number of men chosen from among the freemen of each company. Out of this body the common-council, sheriffs, and other superior officers for the government of the city, are elected; and they alone have the privilege of giving their votes for members of parliament, from which the rest of the citizens are excluded.\n\nLIVIUS, Titus, the best of the Roman historians, as he is called by Mr Bayle, was born at Patavium, or Padua. Few particulars of his life have been handed\nLivius handed down to us. Coming to Rome, he acquired the notice and favour of Augustus, and there he long resided. Some have supposed, (for there is not any proof of it,) that he was known to Augustus before, by certain Philosophical Dialogues which he had dedicated to him. Seneca says nothing of the dedication; but mentions the dialogues, which he calls historical and philosophical; and also some books, written purposely on the subject of philosophy. Be this as it will, it is probable that he began his history as soon as he was settled at Rome; and he seems to have devoted himself so entirely to the great work he had undertaken, as to be perfectly regardless of his own advancement. The tumults and distractions of Rome frequently obliged him to retire to Naples; not only that he might be less interrupted in the pursuit of his delineated talk, but also enjoy that retirement and tranquillity which he could not have at Rome, and which yet he seems to have much sought after: for he was greatly dissatisfied with the manners of his age, and tells us, that \"he should reap this reward of his labour, in composing the Roman history, that it would take his attention from the present numerous evils, at least while he was employed upon the first and earliest ages.\" He used to read parts of this history, while he was composing it, to Mecenas and Augustus; and the latter conceived to high an opinion of him, that he pitched upon him to superintend the education of his grandson Claudius, who was afterwards emperor. After the death of Augustus, Livy returned to the place of his birth, where he was received with all imaginable honour and respect: and there he died, in the fourth year of the reign of Tiberius, aged above seventy. Some say, he died on the same day with Ovid; it is certain that he died the same year.\n\nScarce any man was ever more honoured, alive as well as dead, than this historian. Pliny the younger relates, that a native gentleman travelled from Gades, in the extremest parts of Spain, to see Livy: and, though Rome abounded with more stupendous and curious spectacles than any city in the world, yet he immediately returned; as if, after having seen Livy, nothing further could be worthy of his notice. A monument was erected to this historian in the temple of Juno, where was afterwards founded the monastery of St Justina. There, in 1413, was discovered the following epitaph upon Livy: Offa Tit Livii Patavini, omnium mortalium judicio digni, cujus prope invito calamo invicti populi Romani res gestae conferrentur; that is, \"The bones of Titus Livius of Patavium, a man worthy to be approved by all mankind, by whose almost invincible pen the acts and exploits of the invincible Romans were written.\" These bones are said to be preserved with high reverence to this day, and are shown by the Paduans as the most precious remains. In 1451, Alphonso, king of Aragon, sent his ambassador, Anthony Panormita, to desire of the citizens of Padua the bone of that arm with which this their famous countryman had written his history; and, obtaining it, caused it to be conveyed to Naples with the greatest ceremony as a most invaluable relic. He is said to have recovered from an ill state of health by the pleasure he found in reading this history; and therefore, out of gratitude, put upon doing extraordinary honours to the memory of the writer. Panormita also, who was a native of Palermo in Sicily, and one of the ablest men of the 15th century, sold an estate to purchase this historian.\n\nThe history of Livy, like other great works of antiquity, is transmitted down to us exceedingly mutilated and imperfect. Its books were originally a hundred and forty-two, of which are extant only thirty-five. The epitomes of it, from which we learn their number, all remain, except those of the 136th and 137th books. Livy's books have been divided into decades, which some will have to have been done by Livy himself, because there is a preface to every decade; while others suppose it to be a modern contrivance, since nothing about it can be gathered from the ancients. The first decade, beginning with the foundation of Rome, is extant, and treats of the affairs of 462 years. The second decade is lost; the years of which are seventy-five. The third decade is extant, and contains the second Punic war, including eighteen years. It is reckoned the most excellent part of the history, as giving an account of a very long and sharp war, in which the Romans gained so many advantages, that no arms could afterwards withstand them. The fourth decade contains the Macedonian war against Philip, and the Asiatic war against Antiochus, which take up the space of about 23 years. The five first books of the fifth decade were found at Worms, by Simon Gryneus, in 1431, but are very defective; and the remainder of Livy's history, which reaches to the death of Drusus in Germany in 746, together with the second decade, are supplied by Freinshemius.\n\nNever man perhaps was furnished with greater advantages for writing a history than Livy. Besides his own great genius, which was in every respect admirably formed for the purpose, he was trained as it were in a city, at that time the empress of the world, and in the politest reign that ever was; having scarcely had any other school than the court of Augustus. He had access to the very best materials, such as the Memoirs of Sylla, Caesar, Labienus, Pollio, Augustus, and others, written by themselves. \"What writers of memorials (says Lord Bolinbroke), what compilers of the Materia Historica, were there! What genius was necessary to finish up the pictures that such matters had sketched! Rome afforded men that were equal to the task. Let the remains, the precious remains, of Salust, of Livy, and of Tacitus, witness this truth.—What a school of public and private virtue had been opened to us at the resurrection of learning, if the latter historians of the Roman commonwealth, and the first of the succeeding monarchy, had come down to us entire! The few that are come down, though broken and imperfect, compose the best body of history that we have; nay, the only body of ancient history that deserves to be an object of study. It fails us indeed most at that remarkable and fatal period, where our reasonable curiosity is raised the highest. Livy employed forty-five books to bring his history down to the end of the fifth century, and the breaking out of the third Punic war; but he employed ninety-five to bring it down from thence to the death of Drusus; that is, through the course of 120 or 130 years. Appian, Dion Cassius, and others, nay, even Plutarch included, make us but poor amends for what is lost of Livy.\"\n\nSpeaking then of Tully's orations and letters, as the best...\nLIV\n\nbe adventitious helps to supply this loss, he says, that \"the age in which Livy flourished, abounded with such materials as these: they were fresh, they were authentic; it was easy to procure them; it was safe to employ them. How did he employ them in executing the second part of his design, we may judge from his execution of the first: and, I own, I should be glad to exchange, if it were possible, what we have of this history for what we have not. Would you not be glad, my Lord, to see, in one stupendous draught, the whole progress of that government from liberty to servitude; the whole series of causes and effects, apparent and real, public and private?\" &c.\n\nThe encomiums bestowed upon Livy, by both ancients and moderns, are great and numerous. He not only entertains like Herodotus; he also instructs and interests in the deepest manner. But his great probity, candour, and impartiality, are what have distinguished Livy above all historians; for neither complaisance to the times, nor his particular connexions with the emperor, could restrain him from speaking well of Pompey; so well, as to make Augustus call him a Pompeian. This we learn from Cremutius Cordus, in Tacitus; who relates also, much to the emperor's honour, that this gave no interruption to their friendship. But whatever elogies Livy may have received as an historian, he has not escaped censure as a writer. In the age wherein he lived, Asinius Pollio charged him with Patavinity; which Patavinity has been variously explained by various writers, but is generally supposed to relate to his style. The most common is, that this noble Roman, accustomed to the delicacy of the language spoken in the court of Augustus, could not bear with certain provincial idioms, which Livy, as a Paduan, used in divers places of his history. Pignorius is of another opinion, and believes that this Patavinity regarded the orthography of certain words, wherein Livy used one letter for another, according to the custom of his country, writing file and quafe for fibi and quafi; which he attempts to prove by several ancient inscriptions. The expressions, however, or the orthography of words, are not loaded with obscurity, and the perfect classic is as familiarly acquainted with those supposed provincialisms as with the purest Latinity.—Livy has been censured too, and perhaps with justice, for being too credulous, and burdening his history with vulgar notions and superstitious tales. He may disgust when he mentions that milk and blood were rained from heaven, or that an ox spoke or a woman changed her sex; yet he candidly confesses that he recorded only what made an indelible impression upon the minds of a credulous age.\n\nIs it worth while to mention here the capricious and tyrannic humour of the emperor Caligula, who accused Livy of being a negligent and wordy writer, and resolved therefore to remove his works and statues out of all libraries, where he knew they were curiously preserved? Or the same humour in Domitian, another prodigy of nature, who put to death Metius Pomponianus, because he made a collection of some orations of kings and generals out of Livy's history? Pope Gregory the Great, also, would not suffer Livy in any Christian library, because of the Pagan superstition wherewith he abounded: but the same reason held good against all ancient authors; and indeed Gregory's zeal was far from being levelled at Livy in particular, the pontiff having declared war against all human learning.\n\nThough we know nothing of Livy's family, yet we learn from Quintilian, that he had a son, to whom he addressed some excellent precepts in rhetoric. An ancient inscription speaks also of one of his daughters, named Livia Quarta: the same, perhaps, that espoused the orator Lucius Magius, whom Seneca mentions; and observes, that the applause he usually received from the public in his harangues, were not so much on his own account, as for the sake of his father-in-law.\n\nOur author's history has been often published with and without the supplement of Freinichenius. The best editions are, that of Gronovius, cum notis variarum et suis, Lugd. Bat. 1679, 3 vols 8vo; that of Le Clerc at Amsterdam, 1709, 10 vols 12mo; and that of Crevier, at Paris, 1735, 6 vols 4to. These have the supplements.—Learning perhaps never sustained a greater loss, in any single author, than by the destruction of the latter and more interesting part of Livy. Several eminent moderns have indulged the pleasing expectation that the entire work of this noble historian might yet be recovered. It has been said to exist in an Arabic version: and even a complete copy of the original is supposed to have been extant as late as the year 1631, and to have perished at that time in the plunder of Magdeburg. The munificent patron of learning, Leo X, exerted the most generous zeal to rescue from oblivion the valuable treasure, which one of his most bigoted predecessors, above mentioned, had expelled from every Christian library. Bayle has preferred, under the article Leo, two curious original letters of that pontiff, concerning his hopes of recovering Livy; which afford most honourable proofs of his liberality in the cause of letters.—A lately discovered fragment of Livy's history was published in 1773 by Dr. Bruns.\n\nLivius Andronicus, a comic poet who flourished at Rome about 240 years before the Christian era. He was the first who turned the personal satires and fescennine verses, so long the admiration of the Romans, into the form of a proper dialogue and regular play. Though the character of a player, so valued and applauded in Greece, was reckoned vile and despicable among the Romans, Andronicus acted a part in his dramatical compositions, and engaged the attention of his audience, by repeating what he had laboured after the manner of the Greeks. Andronicus was the freedman of M. Livius Salinator, whose children he educated. His poetry was grown obsolete in the age of Cicero, whose nicety and judgement would not even recommend the reading of it.\n\nLivonia, a large province of the Russian empire, with the title of a duchy. It is bounded on the north by the gulf of Finland, on the west by that of Riga, on the south by Courland, and on the east, partly by Plescow, and partly by Novgorod. It is about 250 miles from north to south, and 150 from east to west. The land is so fertile in corn, that it is called the granary of the north: and would produce a great deal more, if it was not so full of lakes. The fish that abound here are salmon, carps, pikes, flat fish, and many others. In the forests there are wolves, bears, elks, rein-deer, stags, and hares. The domestic animals are very numerous; but the sheep bear very bad wool. Here are a great number\nnumber of forests, which consist of birch trees, pines, and oaks; and all the houses of the inhabitants are built with wood. The merchandises which they send abroad are flax, hemp, honey, wax, leather skins, and potashes. The Swedes were formerly possessed of this province, but were obliged to abandon it to the Russians after the battle of Pultowa; and it was ceded to them by the peace of the north, concluded in 1722, which was confirmed by another treaty in 1742. It is divided into two provinces, viz. Letonia and Estonia; and two islands called Oefel and Dagho, which are again subdivided into several districts.\n\nLIVONICA-TERRA, a kind of fine hole used in the shops of Germany and Italy.

See Landaff.\n\nLLOYD, WILLIAM, a most learned English writer and bishop, was born in Berkshire in England in 1627. He was educated under his father, rector of Sonning, and vicar of Tyehurst in Berkshire; then went to Oxford, and took orders. In 1662 he was made prebendary of Rippon; and in 1666 chaplain to the king. In 1667 he took the degree of doctor of divinity; in 1672 he was installed dean of Bangor; and in 1680 was consecrated bishop of St Asaph. He was one of the five bishops who, with Archbishop Sancroft, were committed prisoners to the Tower of London, for subfcribing a petition to the king against distributing and publishing his declaration for liberty of conscience. Soon after the revolution he was made almoner to King William and Queen Mary: in 1692 he was translated to the bishopric of Litchfield and Coventry; and in 1699, to the see of Worcester, where he sat till his death, which happened in 1717, the 91st year of his age. Dr Burnett gives him an exalted character, and his works are highly esteemed.\n\nLOACH. See Cobitis, Ichthyology Index.\n\nLOAD, or LODE, in mining, a word used especially in the tin-mines, for any regular vein or course, whether metallic or not; but most commonly load means a metallic vein. When the substances forming these loads are reducible to metal, the loads are by the English miners said to be alive; otherwise they are termed dead loads.\n\nIn Cornwall and Devonshire the loads chiefly hold their course from eastward to westward, though in other parts of England they frequently run from north to south. See Veins, Geology Index.\n\nLoad is also used for nine dishes of ore, each dish being about half a hundred weight.\n\nLOADSTONE.

It is an island about 15 miles in length, and three in breadth; remarkable chiefly for the capital of Angola situated upon it, in E. Long. 12° 25'. S. Lat. 8° 45'. This town was built by the Portuguese in 1578, under the direction of the first Portuguese governor in these parts. It is large, populous, and pleasantly seated on the declivity of a hill near the sea-coast, and facing the south-west. The island is supplied with fresh water from wells dug in it; and which are not sunk below the depth of three feet when they are filled with excellent water. It is remarkable, however, that the water of these wells continues good only during the time of high tide; for, as that sinks, the water becomes more and more brackish, till at last it is quite salt, almost as much as the sea itself. On the coast of this island are fitted the zimbis, or shells used in several parts of Africa instead of money; and with these shells, instead of coin, is carried on a great part of the traffic of this country.\n\nLOANGO, a kingdom of Africa, extending itself about 180 geographical miles in length from south to north; that is, from Cape St Catherine under the second degree of south latitude, to a small river called Louanda Louyia, on the 5th degree of the same. From west to east it extends from Cape Negro on the coast of Ethiopia towards the Bichumalean mountains, so called on account of their vast quantity of ivory and great droves of elephants, about 300 miles. It is divided into four principal provinces, viz. those of Lovangiri, Loango-mongo, Chilongo, and Piri.\n\nThe inhabitants are very black, well shaped, and of a mild temper. The men wear long petticoats, from the waist downwards, and have a piece of cloth round their waist. The women's petticoats are made of straw.\n\nThis country abounds with poultry, oxen, cows, sheep, goats, elephants, tigers, leopards, civet-cats, and other animals; so that here are great quantities of elephant's teeth, and fine furs, to be traded for.\n\nThe capital city, where the king resides, called Loango, and, in the language of the negroes, Boaric, is situated in South Lat. 4° degrees, a league and a half from...\nfrom the sea-coast, and is shaded and adorned with bananas, and other trees. The king, who resides in a large palace in the middle of it, has about 1500 concubines. If any of them is surprised in adultery, she and her paramour are instantly conveyed to the top of a very high hill, whence they are hurled down headlong from the steep cliff place.\n\nEvery man marries as many wives here as he pleases, who are obliged to get their husbands a livelihood, as is the practice all along the African coast inhabited by blacks. The women, therefore, cultivate the land, sow and reap, while the lazy husbands loiter away their time in idleness.\n\nThe king's revenue consists in elephants' teeth, copper, and a kind of petticoats made of palm-tree leaves, and called lavogus: he has whole storehouses full of these lavogus; but his greatest riches consist in slaves of both sexes.\n\n**LOBBY**, in Architecture, is a small hall or waiting-room: it is also an entrance into a principal apartment, where there is a considerable space between that and a portico or vestibule, and the length or dimensions will not allow it to be considered as a vestibule or an anteroom.

He became a member of the Jesuit society at 16 years of age, and in 1622 went out as a missionary to the East Indies. He sailed to the coast of Mozambique, after making some stay at Goa; and afterwards penetrated into Abyssinia, where his zeal and resolution brought him the hatred of the monks, from which he incurred much danger and suffering. As he returned to Portugal he was shipwrecked on the coast of Natal, where seven months were spent in constructing flotillas to bring them away. One of them foundered, but that in which Father Lobo sailed arrived safe at Angola. After a variety of adventures he arrived at Lisbon; and he employed himself in the cause of the Ethiopian mission both at Madrid and Rome. He took a second voyage to the Indies, where he was made rector of the house at Goa. He returned to Lisbon in 1678, and was chosen rector of the college of Coimbra, where he died in 1678, at the age of 84.\n\nLobo wrote an historical account of Abyssinia in the Portuguese language, which contains information both curious and valuable.

It carries on a great trade; and the country abounds in pastures, wine, and fruits. E. Long. 8. 41. N. Lat. 46. 6.\n\n**LOCHABER**, a district of the shire of Inverness in Scotland. It is bounded by Moydart on the west, Glengarry on the north, Badenoch on the east, and Lorn on the south. It derives its name from the lake or loch Aber; and extends about 20 miles from east to west, and 30 from north to south. The country is barren, bleak, mountainous, and rugged. Near the mouth of the river Aber, in the centre between the West and North Highlands, stands Fort William, with the town of Maryburgh, built upon a navigable arm of the sea, not far from the foot of Ben Nevis. The town, designed as a fortress for the garrison, was erected into a borough; and the fort itself was designed as a check upon some of the clans, who had been guilty of depredations and other irregularities. Lochaber is inhabited mostly by the Macdonalds, Camerons, and Mackintoshes. The castle of Macdonald of Glengarry, in this district, was burnt to the ground in the year 1715, in consequence of his declaring for the Pretender. The elegant house and gardens belonging to Cameron of Lochiel underwent the same fate, for the same reason, in the year 1746.\n\n**LOCHIA**, in Midwifery, a flux from the uterus consequent to delivery. See Midwifery.\n\n**LOCK**, a well-known instrument used for fastening doors, chests, &c., generally opened by a key.\n\nThe lock is reckoned the masterpiece in smithery; a great deal of art and delicacy being required in contriving and varying the wards, springs, bolts, &c., and adjusting them to the places where they are to be used, and to the various occasions of using them.\n\nFrom the various structure of locks, accommodated to their different intentions, they acquire various names. Those placed on outer doors are called flock-locks; those on chamber doors, spring-locks; those on trunks, trunk-locks, pad-locks, &c.\n\nOf these the spring-lock is the most considerable, both for its frequency and the curiosity of its structure. Its principal parts are, the main-plate, the cover-plate, and the pin-hole: to the main-plate belong the keyhole, top-hook, cross-wards, bolt-toe or bolt-knob, drawback-spring tumbler, pin of the tumbler, and the flaps; to the cover-plate belong the pin, main-ward, cross-ward, step-ward or dap-ward; to the pin-hole belong the hook-ward, main cross-ward, shank, the pot or bread, bow-ward, and bit.\n\nAs on the proper construction of locks the security of the most valuable kinds of property almost entirely depends, and as numberless devices are continually fallen upon to elude the utmost efforts of mechanical invention in this respect, it thence becomes an object of no small importance to invent a lock which it should be impossible to open except by its proper key. A treatise upon this subject has been published by Mr Joseph...\nLock.\n\nJoseph Bramah; who is confident that he has brought the matter to the requisite perfection, and that every one may rest assured of the security of his property when under the protection of a lock of his invention. He begins with observing, that the principle on which all locks depend, is the application of a lever to an interior bolt, by means of a communication from without; so that, by means of the latter, the lever acts upon the bolt, and moves it in such a manner as to secure the lid or door from being opened by any pull or push from without. The security of locks in general therefore depends on the number of impediments we can interpose betwixt the lever (the key) and the bolt which secures the door; and these impediments are well known by the name of wards, the number and intricacy of which alone are supposed to distinguish a good lock from a bad one. If these wards, however, do not in an effectual manner preclude the access of all other instruments besides the proper key, it is still possible for a mechanic of equal skill with the lock-maker to open it without the key, and thus to elude the labour of the other.\n\n\"Locks (says our author) have been constructed, and are at present much used and held in great esteem, from which the picklock is excluded; but the admission of false keys is an imperfection for which no locksmith has ever found a corrective; nor can this imperfection be remedied whilst the protection of the bolt is wholly confided to fixed wards.\" This position is proved by a remark, that the wards, let them be as intricate as we please, must all be expressed on what is called the bit or web of the key; and therefore, when all the varieties that can be expressed on this bit or web have been run through, every succeeding lock must be the counterpart of some other; and consequently the same key which opens one will open the other also. This is evident from the locks usually put upon drawers; and which, though they should be made to resist the picklock, are still liable to be opened by ten thousand other keys besides that appropriated to each of them. But though the variety of wards could be augmented even to infinity, still there could be no security against false keys; for as every one of the wards must be expressed on the web of the key, if another key with a web quite plain be made to fit the key-hole exactly, we have only to cover it over with some colouring substance upon which the wards may make an impression; after which, it is easy to cut out the web in a proper manner for admitting them, when the lock will be as easily opened by the false as by the true key.\n\nThe first person, according to our author, who had any claim to merit in the branch of lock-making, is Mr. Baron; whose lock he acknowledges to be by far more perfect and secure than any that ever appeared before; though he still considers it as unfit for giving that absolute security which is to be wished for. His improvement consists in the proper application of what are called tumblers. \"These (says Mr. Bramah) are a kind of grapple; by which the bolt is confined, as well in its active as in its passive station, and rendered immoveable till set at liberty by the key. One of these instruments is commonly introduced into all locks that are of any use or value; it is lodged behind the bolt, and is governed by a spring which acts upon the tumbler as the tumbler acts upon the bolt: The application therefore of any force to the tumbler, which is superior to the force of the spring, will cause it to quit its hold, and set the bolt at liberty.\" In the common method of applying these machines, however, it matters nothing how far the tumbler is lifted above the point at which it ceases to control the bolt; but it is otherwise in those of Mr. Baron's construction. The action of his tumblers is circumscribed by a certain space cut in the centre of the bolt, of dimensions sufficient only to answer the purpose intended. The space in which the tumbler moves is an oblong square; and is not only furnished with niches on the under side, into which the hooks of the tumblers are forced by the spring as in other locks, but is provided with correspondent niches on the other side, into which the hooks are driven, if any greater force be applied to the tumblers than what is just sufficient to disengage them from the bolt. Hence it becomes absolutely necessary, in the making of a false key, to construct it in such a manner, that it may with the greatest exactness give the requisite degree of pressure, and no more.\n\nMr. Bramah allows that this is a very great improvement, but objects that it is still possible to frame a key which will open it as well as its own; nor will the addition of any number of tumblers preclude the possibility of opening it. \"By giving (says he) an uniform motion to the tumblers, and presenting them with a face which exactly tallies with the key, they still partake, in a very great degree, of the nature of fixed wards; and the security of this lock is thereby rendered in a proportionate degree defective.\" Thus, suppose the false key to have passed the wards, and to be in contact with the most prominent of the tumblers, the impression, which the slightest touch will leave on the key, will direct the application of the file till sufficient space is prepared to give it a free passage. The key will then bear upon a more remote tumbler; which difficulty being in like manner got over, the lock will be as easily opened by the false as by the true key.\"\n\nThis seemingly insuperable objection to the perfection of lock-making, however, our author removes with the greatest ease imaginable, by causing the tumblers which project unequally to present a plane surface: whence they would require a separate and unequal motion to disengage them; of consequence no distinct impression could be made by them upon the plane surface of the web that would give any idea of their positions with regard to one another, and the construction of a false key would be altogether impossible.\n\nBut though the principal difficulty with regard to Mr. Baron's lock be now overcome, others still occur, viz., the difficulty of making locks which are constructed with tumblers sufficiently durable. The tumblers themselves, he observes, must be but slightly made; and being exposed to perpetual friction by the key and their own proper motion, they must soon decay; and the keys of Mr. Baron's locks, he also observes, are much less durable than those of any other locks he ever saw.\n\nWith regard to the lock which Mr. Bramah presents to the public as absolutely perfect, he informs us, that the idea of constructing it was first suggested by the alarming increase of house robberies, which may reasonably be supposed to be perpetrated in a great measure.\nmeasure by perfidious servants, or accomplished by their connivance. Thus it is evident, that the locks which might exclude ordinary housebreakers could be no security against faithless servants, who having constant access to the locks, might easily get false keys fabricated at their leisure. In considering the subject, our author was convinced, that his hope of success depended entirely upon his using means as dissimilar as possible to those by which the old locks were constructed; as these, however varied, had been found insufficient for the purpose. \"As nothing (says he) can be more opposite in principle to fixed wards than a lock which derives its properties from the motion of all its parts, I determined that the construction of such a lock should be the subject of my experiment.\" In the prosecution of this experiment he had the satisfaction to find, that the least perfect of all his models fully attested the truth and certainty of his principle. The exclusion of wards made it necessary to cut off all communication between the key and the bolt; as the same passage, which (in a lock simply constructed) would admit the key, might give admittance likewise to other instruments. The office, therefore, which in other locks is performed by the extreme point of the key, is here assigned to a lever, which cannot approach the bolt till every part of the lock has undergone a change of position. The necessity of this change to the purposes of the lock, and the absolute impossibility of effecting it otherwise than with the proper key, are the points to be ascertained; and this our author does in the following manner.\n\nFig. 1. Shows Mr. Bramah's first attempt to construct a lock upon this principle: which, to his surprise, turned out complete and perfect. A represents a common axis on which the six levers, crossing the face of the lock, are united as on a joint. Each of these rests upon a separate spring sufficiently strong to bear its weight; or, if depressed by a superior force, to restore it to its proper position when that force is removed. B represents a frame through which the levers pass by separate grooves, exactly fitted to their width, but of sufficient depth to allow them a free motion in a perpendicular direction. The part which projects from the opposite side of the joint A, and is inserted in the bolt C, is a lever to which two offices are assigned; one to keep the bolt in a fixed position, in the absence of the key; the other, to give it its proper motion upon the application of the key. D is a circular platform turning upon a centre. On this the joint or carriage of the levers, and the springs on which they rest, are fixed; and the motion of this platform impels the bolt, in either direction, by means of the lever which is projected from the joint A. The inviolable restraint upon this lock, by which means it is subjected only to the action of the key, is lodged in the part E, which is a thin plate, bearing at each extremity on a block, and having of course a vacant space beneath, equal in height to the thickness of the blocks on which it rests. By this plate the motion of the machine is checked or guided in the following manner: On the edge of the plate which faces the movement there are six notches which receive the ends of the levers projecting beyond the frame B; and while they are confined in this manner the motion of the machine is so totally suspended as to defy every power of art to overcome.\n\nTo understand in what manner the proper key of this lock overcomes these obstructions, it must be observed, that each lever has a notch on its extremity, and that these notches are disposed as irregularly as possible. To give the machine a capacity of motion, these notches must be brought parallel to each other, and by a distinct but unequal pressure upon the levers, be formed into a groove in a direct line with the edge of the plate E, which the notches are exactly fitted to receive. The least motion of the machine, while the levers are in this position, will introduce the edge of the plate into the groove; which, controlling the power of the springs, will give liberty to the levers to move in a horizontal direction as far as the space between the blocks which support the plate E will admit, and which is sufficient to give the machine a power of acting on the bolt. The impossibility of thus bringing the notches on the points of the levers into a direct line, so as to tally with the edge of the plate E by any other means than the motion and impulse of the key, is that which constitutes the principal excellency of this lock.\n\nThe key (fig. 2.) exhibits six different surfaces, against which the levers are progressively admitted in the operation of opening the lock: the irregularity of these surfaces shows the unequal and distinct degree of pressure which each lever requires to bring them to their proper bearings, in order to put the machine in motion. Hence it appears, that unless the various heights of the surfaces expressed on the bit of the key are exactly proportioned to the several distances necessary to bring the notches into a straight line with each other, they must remain immovable; \"and (says our author) as one stroke of a file is sufficient to cause such a disproportion as will prove an insurmountable impediment to their motion, I may safely assert, that it is not in art to produce a key or other instrument, by which a lock, constructed upon this principle, can be opened.\"\n\nOn this principle it would even be a matter of great difficulty for any workman, however skilful, to construct a key for the lock when open to his inspection: \"for the levers being raised, by the subjacent springs, to an equal height in the frame B, present a plane surface; and consequently convey no direction that can be of any use in forming a tally to the irregular surface which they present when acting in subjection to the key. Unless therefore we can contrive a method to bring the notches on the points of the levers in a direct line with each other, and to retain them in that position till an exact impression of the irregular surface, which the levers will then exhibit, can be taken; the workman will be unable to fit a key to the lock, or to move the bolt. This process must be rendered extremely troublesome by means of the springs; and if such difficulties occur, even when the lock is open to the inspection of a skilful workman, much more must we suppose it out of the power of one who has not access to the internal parts to make a false key to a lock of this kind.\n\nThese difficulties render it necessary in making locks of this kind not to fit the key to the lock, as is usual in\nin other locks, but to fit the lock to the key. In this kind of lock, therefore, the key must be made first; and the inequalities upon the surface of the bit worked as chance or fancy may direct, without any reference to the lock. The key being thus completed, and applied to the surface of the levers, will, by a gentle pressure, force them to unequal distances from their common station in the frame B, and sink their points to unequal depths into the space beneath the plate E. While the levers are in this position, the edge of the plate E will mark the precise point at which the notch on each lever must be expressed. The notches being cut by this direction, the irregularity which appears when the levers resume their station in the frame B, and the inequality of the recesses on the bit of the key, will appear as a seal and its corresponding impression.\n\nThe following is a lock contrived upon the same principle, but more curious; and, in our author's opinion, more extensively useful. Fig. 3 represents a circular block of metal divided from the centre into eight compartments, each containing a cell which forms a passage through the block, as is represented by the small circles described on the flat surface A. In each of these cells two grooves are cut at opposite points, which open a communication with the centre at one point, and with the spherical surface of the block or barrel at the other. The small circle, which marks the centre of the flat surface A, is the key-hole, which likewise forms a passage through the barrel in a parallel line with the cells which surround it. This figure represents the frame in which the active parts of the lock are deposited.\n\nFig. 4 shows a spiral spring lodged in the bottom of each cell, and occupying one half of the space, the other being filled with a slider resting upon the spring, and represented by fig. 5; the office of these sliders exactly corresponding with that of the levers in the lock already described. Thus, when lodged in their respective cells, they are sustained, like the levers, by the elasticity of the springs upon which they rest, till a superior power be applied; and they are again restored to their stations by the reaction of the springs when the weight is removed. The side B of each slider is projected beyond the circular surface, as represented fig. 6, in a manner similar to the projection of the levers in the former lock beyond the curved frame in which they move. The point C is projected through the interior groove into the space which forms the centre or key-hole, expressed on the flat surface A.\n\nFig. 7 represents the key. When this is applied, it must of course encounter these interior projections; and when pressed forward, the indented spaces on its point being unequal, will force the sliders to unequal distances from their bearers; bringing the notches expressed on their exterior projections in a direct line with each other, in a manner similar to that by which the effect is produced upon the levers in the former lock. When the key is withdrawn, and the sliders resume their stations by the pressure of the springs, the disposition of the notches must be irregular in the same proportion that the indentations on the point of the key are unequal; and they must necessarily fall again into a straight line when acted upon by the key.\n\nFig. 6 shows the barrel completely fitted for action. Its interior end is capped with a plate, which unites its compartments, and confines the springs and sliders within the cells to which they belong. From that plate proceeds the point A, which represents the lever by which the bolt is projected or withdrawn, according to the direction in which the machine performs its revolution.\n\nFig. 8 shows the flat surface of a thin plate, corresponding in its office with the part C of the former lock. The space cut in its centre is exactly fitted to the spherical surface of the barrel; the circle describing its circumference, and the notches cut on its edge coinciding with the projections of the sliders. The barrel, when encircled with this plate at the middle of its spherical surface, has its motion totally suspended till the notches on the projections of the sliders are forced, by the pressure of the key, into a line with each other; a groove being thus formed on the spherical surface of the barrel parallel to, and coinciding with, the edge of the plate, the machine is at liberty to perform a revolution in any direction, but returns to its confined state when the key is withdrawn.\n\nThe parts of the movement being thus united, the interior end of the barrel is deposited in a bed represented fig. 9. To this it is fastened at the angles of the plate represented fig. 8, by which the barrel is encircled. The station of the bolt is at A; the lever which acts upon it being projected on the other side. Fig. 10 is a cap or mask which covers the face of the movement, and completes the lock.\n\nOn this lock our author observes, that it is excellent for street doors: \"for no method of robbery (says he) is more practised, than gaining admittance into houses by those keys, which as is well known, may be procured at the old iron shops to fit almost any lock in use. Such robberies are generally committed where the servants are allowed to take the key with them when sent on errands, it being impracticable while the key is fixed in the lock. The variations, by which the production of correspondent keys is avoided, have two sources: the one arising from the changes that may be made in the disposition of the levers; the other from the number of points contained on the projected surface of each lever; by which the position of its notch may, in the smallest degree, be varied.\n\n\"The variations producible in the dispositions of six figures only, are 720; these, being progressively multiplied by additional figures, will increase by astonishing degrees; and eventually show, that a lock containing twelve levers will admit of 479,001,500 changes; which, with the addition of another lever, will increase to 6,227,020,800. These being again multiplied by the number of changes which the projected surface of the levers will admit in the disposition of the notches, their amount will exceed numeration, and may therefore be properly said to be infinite. The slightest inspection will at once show, that their construction precludes all possibility of obtaining an impression of their internal parts, which is necessary for the fabrication of a false key; for it will be easily seen, that the positions into which the levers are forced by the pressure of the key in opening the lock, can no more be ascertained when the key is withdrawn, than the seal can be copied from its impression on a fluid, or the course of a ship be discovered by tracing it on the surface of the waves.\"\nwaves. But inviolable security is not the only excellence they possess; the simplicity of their principle gives them likewise a great advantage over locks that are more complicated, in point of duration; for their essential parts being subject to no friction, nor exposed to any possible accident from without, they will be less affected by use, and less liable to stand in need of repair.\n\nLocks, or weirs, in inland navigations, the general name for all those works of wood or stone made to confine and raise the water of a river: the banks also which are made to divert the course of a river, are called by these names in some places. But the term lock is more particularly appropriated to express a kind of canal enclosed between two gates; the upper called by workmen the sluice gate, and the lower called the flood gate. These serve in artificial navigations to confine the water, and render the passage of boats easy in passing up and down the stream. See Canal.\n\nLOCKE, JOHN, an eminent English philosopher and writer in the latter end of the 17th century, was son of Mr John Locke of Pensford in Somersetshire, and born at Wrington near Bristol in 1632. He was sent to Christ-church in Oxford; but was highly dissatisfied with the common course of studies then pursued in the university, where nothing was taught but the Aristotelian philosophy; and had a great aversion to the disputes of the schools then in use. The first books which gave him a relish for philosophy were the writings of Des Cartes; for though he did not always approve of his notions, yet he thought he wrote with great perspicuity. He applied himself with vigour to his studies, particularly to physic, in which he gained a considerable knowledge, though he never practised it. In 1664, he went to Germany as secretary to Sir William Swan, envoy from the English court to the elector of Brandenburg and some other German princes. In less than a year, he returned to England; where, among other studies, he applied himself to that of natural philosophy, as appears from a register of the changes of the air, which he kept at Oxford from June 24, 1666, to March 28, 1667. There he became acquainted with the lord Ashley, afterwards earl of Shaftesbury, who introduced him into the conversation of some of the most eminent persons of that time. In 1670, he began to form the plan of his Essay on Human Understanding; but his employments and avocations prevented him from finishing it then. About this time he became a member of the Royal Society. In 1672, his patron, now earl of Shaftesbury, and lord chancellor of England, appointed him secretary of the presentations, which place he held till the earl resigned the great seal. In 1673, he was made secretary to a commission of trade, worth £500 a-year; but that commission was dissolved in 1674. The earl of Shaftesbury being restored to favour, and made president of the council in 1679, sent for Mr Locke to London; but that nobleman did not continue long in his post, being sent prisoner to the tower; and after his discharge retired to Holland in 1682.\n\nMr Locke followed his patron thither. He had not been absent from England a year, when he was accused at court of having written certain tracts against the government, which were afterward discovered to be written by another person; and in November 1684, Locke, he was deprived of his place of student in Christ-church. In 1685, the English envoy at the Hague demanded him and 83 other persons to be delivered up by the states general: upon which he lay concealed till the year following; and during this time formed a weekly assembly with Mr Limborch, Mr Le Clerc, and other learned men at Amsterdam. In 1689 he returned to England in the fleet which conveyed the princess of Orange; and endeavoured to procure his restoration to his place of student of Christ-church, that it might appear from thence that he had been unjustly deprived of it: but when he found the college would admit him only as a supernumerary student, he desisted from his claim.\n\nBeing esteemed a sufferer for revolution principles, he might easily have obtained a more profitable post; but he contented himself with that of commissioner of appeals, worth £500 a-year, which was procured for him by the Lord Mordaunt; and about the same time he was offered an appointment in a diplomatic character, but the infirm state of his health prevented him from accepting it. He went afterwards to reside with Sir Francis Matheson and his lady, at Oates in Essex, about 25 miles from London, where he spent most of his time during the rest of his life. In this agreeable situation he enjoyed that health and vigour which enabled him to exert his talents in writing on political subjects. Hence he appears in defence of the revolution in one piece; and considering the great national concern at that time, the ill state of the silver coin, and proposing remedies for it, in others. Hence he was made a commissioner of trade and plantations in 1695, which engaged him in the immediate business of the state; and with regard to the church, he published a treatise the same year, to promote the scheme which King William had much at heart, of a comprehension with the dissenters. This, however, drew him into one controversy; which was scarcely ended, when he entered into another in defence of his essay, which held till 1698; soon after which the asthma, his constitutional disorder, increasing with his years, began to subdue him; and he became so infirm, that in 1700 he resigned his seat at the board of trade, because he could no longer bear the air of London sufficient for a regular attendance upon it. After this resignation he continued altogether at Oates; in which retirement he employed the remaining last years of his life entirely in the study of the Holy Scriptures.\n\nHe died in 1704, aged 73. His writings will immortalize his name. The earl of Shaftesbury, author of the Characteristics, though in one place he speaks of Mr Locke's philosophy with severity; yet observes, concerning his Essay on the Human Understanding, in general, \"that it may qualify men as well for business and the world, as for the sciences and the university.\" His Discourses on Government, Letters on Toleration, and Commentaries on some of St Paul's Epistles, are also held in much esteem.\n\nLOCKED JAW.

There is mention of a log, 2 Kings vi. 25,\nunder the name of a fourth part of a cab. But in Levi-\nticus the word log is often met with, and signifies\nthat measure of oil which lepers were to offer at the\ntemple after they were cured of their disease. Dr\nArbutnott says, that the log was a measure of li-\nquids, the seventy-second part of the bath or ephah,\nand twelfth part of the hin, according to all the accounts of\nthe Jewish writers.\n\nLog, a sea term, signifying a small piece of timber a,\nof a triangular, sectoral, or quadrantial figure, on board\na ship, generally about a quarter of an inch thick, and\nfive or six inches from the angular point to the circu-\nmference. It is balanced by a thin plate of lead, nailed\nto the arch, or circular side, so as to swim perpendicu-\nlarly in the water.\n\nLog-Line, a little cord, or line, about a hundred and\nfifty fathoms long, fastened to the log by means of\ntwo legs a b (fig. 4.), one of which passes through a\nhole at the corner, and is knotted on the opposite side,\nwhile the other leg is attached to the arch by a pin\nfixed into another hole, so as to draw out occa-\nsionally. By these legs the log is hung in equilibrium;\nand the line thus annexed to it is wound round a reel\nfixed for that purpose in the gallery of the ship.\n\nThis line, from the distance of about ten, twelve,\nor fifteen fathoms off the log, has certain knots or divi-\nsions, which ought to be at least fifty feet from each\nother; though it was the common practice at sea not\nto have them above forty-two feet asunder.\n\nThe length of each knot ought to be the same part\nof a sea mile as half a minute is of an hour; and ad-\nmitting the measurement of Mr Norwood, who makes\na degree on a great circle of the earth to contain\n367,200 English feet, or about 69½ English statute\nmiles, and therefore ¼ of it, or a nautical\nmile, will be 6120 feet; ¼ of 6120, or 51 feet,\nshould be length of each knot. But because it is\nsafer to have the reckoning rather before the ship than\nafter it, therefore fifty feet may be taken as the pro-\nper length of each knot. The knots are sometimes\nmade to consist only of forty-two feet each, even in the\npredest practice; and this method of dividing the log-\nline was founded on the supposition that sixty miles,\neach of 5000 English feet, made a degree; for ¼ of\n5000 is 41¾, or, in round numbers, 42 feet. Mari-\nners, rather than quit the old way, though known to\nbe erroneous, use glases for half minute ones, that run\nbut 24 or 25 seconds. They have also used a line of\n45 feet to 30 seconds, or a glass of 28 seconds to 42\nfeet. When this is the case, the distance between\nthe knots should be corrected by the following pro-\nportion: as 30 is to 52; so is the number of seconds\nof the glass to the distance between the knots upon\nthe line. The heat or moisture of the weather has of-\nten a considerable effect upon the glass, so as to make\nit run slower or faster; it should, therefore, be fre-\nquently tried by the pendulum in the following man-\nner. On a round nail hang a string that has a mus-\nket ball fixed to one end, carefully measuring between\nthe centre of the ball and the string's loop over the\npeg 39½ inches, being the length of a second pendu-\nlum; then swing it, and count one for every time it\npasses under the peg, beginning at the second time it\npasses and the number of swings made during the time\nthe glass is running out shows the seconds it contains.\nThe line also is liable to relax and shrink, and should\ntherefore be occasionally measured.\n\nThe use of the log and line is to keep account and\nmake an estimate of the ship's way or distance run;\nwhich is done by observing the length of line unwound\nin half a minute's time, told by a half-minute glass;\nfor so many knots as run out in that time, so many\nmiles the ship sails in an hour. Thus, if there be four\nknots veered out in half a minute, the ship is computed\nto run four miles an hour.\nThe author of this advice for measuring the ship's way is not known; and no mention of it occurs till the year 1627, in an East India voyage published by Purchas; but from that time its name occurs in other voyages among his collections; and henceforward it became famous, being taken notice of by both our own authors and by foreigners; as by Gunter in 1623; Snellius in 1624; Metius in 1631; Oughtred in 1633; Herigon in 1634; Saltonstall in 1636; Norwood in 1617; Pournier in 1643; and almost by all the succeeding writers on navigation of every country.\n\nTo Heave the Log, as they call it, they throw it into the water on the lee side, letting it run till it comes without the eddy of the ship's wake; then one holding a half-minute glass, turns it up just as the first knot, or the mark from which the knots begin to be reckoned, turns off the reel (fig. 2.) or pallets over the stern. As soon as the glass is out, the reel is flopped, and the knots run off are told, and their parts estimated.\n\nIt is usual to heave the log once every hour in ships of war and East Indiamen, and in all other vessels once in two hours, allowance being made for the wind having increased or abated in the intervals.\n\nThe log is a very precarious way of computing, and must always be corrected by experience, there being much uncertainty from the motions of the ship, the winds of variable force, the friction of the reel and lightness of the log in the course of the current. Yet this is a much more exact way of computing than any other in use; much preferable certainly to that of the Spaniards and Portuguese, who guessed at the ship's way by the running of the froth or water by the ship's side; or to that of the Dutch, who used to heave a chip overboard, and to number the paces they walk on the deck while the chip swims between any two marks or bulk heads on the tide.\n\nCompound Log. The above-mentioned errors, and particularly the log's being subject to drive with the motion of the water at its surface, whereas the experiment requires it to be fixed in the place where it is when the mark commencing the knots goes off the reel, have been considered, and many methods proposed to remove or to lessen them. M. Bouguer proposed the following method. Take for the log a conical piece of wood, which fix to the log line palied through or along its axis, at about 40, 50, or 60, or more feet, from one end; and to this end fix the diver, which is a body formed of two equal square pieces of tin, or of thin iron plate, fixed at right angles to one another along their diagonals; and its size so fitted to that of the cone, that the whole may float. A cone of three inches diameter in the base, and of six inches in the flant height, is proposed by M. Bouguer to suit a diver made of plates about 9½ inches square; the intersection of the diagonals is joined to the log line, and the loop and peg fixed as in the common log. However, it has been found, that no kind of wood used in British dock yards, when formed into a cone of the above dimensions, will float a diver made of stout tin plates, one side of the square being 9½ inches. Such a diver weighing 12 lb. avoirdupois, required to float it a cone of five inches diameter and twelve inches on the flant side, so as the point of the cone, which was made of light fir, should just appear above the water. Now, supposing one side of such a square tin diver to be about ten inches, and made of plates only two-thirds of the thickness of the former, such a diver would weigh, with its folder, about 20 ounces, and can be floated by a light fir cone of four inches diameter in the base, and ten inches in the flant height or length; and such a compound log might perhaps be found on trial to be affected by about as much again as that proposed by M. Bouguer; and consequently the difference between the numbers given by the common log and compound log, must be augmented by two-thirds of itself for the necessary correction, as below. When the compound log of Bouguer, above described, is hove overboard, the diver will sink too deep to be much affected by the current or motion of water at the surface, and the log will thereby keep more steadily in the place where it first fell; and consequently the knots run off the reel will show more accurately the ship's rate of sailing. As the common log is affected by the whole motion of the current, so this compound log will feel only a part thereof, viz. such a part nearly as the resistance of the cone is to the resistance of the diver; then the resistances of the above cone and diver are about as 2 to 5; and consequently this log will drive but one-fifth part of what the common log would do; and so the ship's true run will be affected by one-fifth only of the motion of the waters. To obtain the true rate of sailing, it will be proper to heave alternately, hour and hour, the common log, and this compound log; then the difference of their knots run off, augmented by its one-fourth part, is the correction; which applied to the knots of the common log, will give the ship's true rate of sailing at the middle time between the hours when these logs were hove. The correction is additive when the compound log's run is the greatest, otherwise it is subtractive. To find the course made good: increase the observed angle between the log lines by one-fourth part; and this gives the correction to be applied to the apparent course, or the opposite of that shown by the common log; the correction is to be applied to the right of the apparent course, when the bearing of the common log is to the left of the compound log. Or thus: the lengths run off both logs, together with their bearings, being known; in a card or compass apply the knots run off, taken from a scale of equal parts along their respective bearings from the centre; join the ends; and in this line produced, on the side next the compound log's length, take one-fourth of the interval; then a line drawn from the end, thus produced, to the centre of the card, will show the true course and distance made good. When a current, such as a tide, runs to any depth, the velocity of that current may be much better ascertained by the compound log than by the common one, provided the diver does not descend lower than the run of the current; for as those ships which are deepest immersed, drive fastest with the tide; so the diver, by being acted on below, as well as the log on the surface, their joint motion will give the total effect of the current's motion better than what could be derived from the motion at the surface only. Also, by such a compound log, the depth to which any current runs may be easily tried.\n\nOther Logs. We have an account in the voyage to the North\nLOG\n\nNorth Pole, p. 97, of two other logs, which were tried by Captain Phipps: one invented by Mr Ruffel, the other by Foxon; both constructed upon this principle, that a spiral, in proceeding its own length in the direction of its axis through a resisting medium, makes one revolution round the axis; if, therefore, the revolutions of the spiral are registered, the number of times it has gone its own length through the water will be known.\n\nIn both these the motion of the spiral in the water is communicated to the clockwork within board, by means of a small line fastened at one end to the spiral, which tows it after the ship, and at the other to a spindle, which sets the clockwork in motion. That invented by Mr Ruffel has a half spiral of two threads, made of copper, and a small dial with clockwork, to register the number of turns of the spiral. The other log has a whole spiral of wood with one thread, and a larger piece of clockwork with three dials, two of them to mark the distance, and the other divided into knots and fathoms, to show the rate by the half-minute glass, for the convenience of comparing it with the log. This kind of log will have the advantage of every other in smooth water and moderate weather; and it will be useful in finding the trim of a ship when alone, in surveying a coast in a single ship, or in measuring distances in a boat between headlands and shoals; but it is subject to other inconveniences, which will not render it a proper substitute for the common log.\n\nPerpetual Log, a machine so called by its inventor, Mr Gottlieb of London, is intended for keeping a constant and regular account of the rate of a ship's velocity in the interval of heaving the log.\n\nFig. 1. is a representation of the whole machine; the lower part of which, EFG, is fixed to the side of the keel; H representing only the boundary line of the ship's figure. EF are the section of a wooden external case, left open at the ends KL, to admit the passage of the water during the motion of the ship. At M is a copper grating, placed to obstruct the entrance of any dirt, &c., into the machine. I is a section of a water wheel, made from 6 to 12 inches in diameter, as may be necessary, with floatboards upon its circumference, like a common water wheel, that turn by the resistance of the water passing through the channel LK. It turns upon a (shouldered) axis, represented by the vertical section at K. When the ship is in motion, the resistance of the water through the channel LK turns round the wheel I. This wheel, by means of a pinion, is connected with and turns the rod contained in the long copper tube N. This rod, by a pinion fixed at its upper extremity, is connected with and turns upon the whole system of wheels contained in the dial of the case ABCD. This dial, by means of the copper tube N, may be fixed to any convenient place aboard the ship. In the front of the dial are several useful circular graduations, as follow: The reference by the dotted line A has a hand which is moved by the wheels within, which points out the motion of the ship in fathoms of 6 feet each. The circle at B has a hand showing the knots, at the rate of 48 feet for each knot; and is to be observed with the half-minute glass at any time. The circle at C has a short and a long hand; the former of which points out the miles in land measure, and the latter or longer the number of knots contained in each mile, viz. 128, which is in the same proportion to a mile as 60 minutes to the hour in the reckoning. At e, a small portion of a circle is seen through the front plate called the register; which shows, in the course of 24 hours (if the ship is upon one tack), the distance in miles that she has run; and in the 24 hours the mariner need take but one observation, as this register serves as an useful check upon the fathoms, knots, and miles, shown upon the other circles.\n\nf Is a plate showing 100 degrees or 6000 miles, and also acts as another register or check; and is useful in case of any mistake being made in observing the distance run by the other circles. The reckoning by these circles, without fear of mistake, may therefore be continued to nearly 12,000 miles.\n\nA communication from this machine may easily be made to the captain's bedside, where by touching a spring only, a bell in the head ABCD will sound as many times in a half minute as the ship sails miles in an hour.\n\nLog-Board, a sort of table, divided into several columns, containing the hours of the day and night, the direction of the winds, the course of the ship, and all the material occurrences that happen during the 24 hours, or from noon to noon; together with the latitude by observation. From this table the officers of the ship are furnished with materials to compile their journals.\n\nLog-Book; a book into which the contents of the log-board is daily copied at noon, together with every circumstance deserving notice that may happen to the ship, either at sea or in a harbour. See Navigation.\n\nLOGARITHMS.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe labour and time required for performing the arithmetical operations of multiplication, division, and the extraction of roots, were at one time considerable obstacles to the improvement of various branches of knowledge, and in particular the science of astronomy. But about the end of the 16th century, and the beginning of the 17th, several mathematicians began to consider by what means they might simplify these operations, or substitute for them others more easily performed. Their efforts produced some ingenious contrivances for abridging calculations; but of these the most complete by far was that of John Napier Baron of Merchiston in Scotland, who invented a system of numbers called logarithms, which were so adapted to the numbers to be multiplied, or divided, that they being arranged in the form of a table, each opposite to the number...\nnumber called its logarithm, the product of any two numbers in the table was found by the addition of their logarithms; and, on the contrary, the quotient arising from the division of one number by another was found by the subtraction of the logarithm of the divisor from that of the dividend; and similar simplifications took place in the still more laborious operations of involution and evolution. But before we proceed to relate more particularly the circumstances of this invention, it will be proper to give a general view of the nature of logarithms, and of the circumstances which render them of use in calculation.\n\nLet there be formed two series of numbers, the one constituting a geometrical progression, the first term of which is unity or 1, and the common ratio any number whatever, and the other an arithmetical progression, the first term of which is 0, and the common difference also any number whatever; (but as a particular example we shall suppose the common ratio of the geometrical series to be 2, and the common difference of the arithmetical series 1), and let the two series be written opposite to each other in the form of a table, thus:\n\n| Geom.

Prog. |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| 1           | 0            |\n| 2           | 1            |\n| 4           | 2            |\n| 8           | 3            |\n| 16          | 4            |\n| 32          | 5            |\n| 64          | 6            |\n| 128         | 7            |\n| 256         | 8            |\n| 512         | 9            |\n| 1024        | 10           |\n| 2048        | 11           |\n| 4096        | 12           |\n| &c.         | &c.          |\n\nThe two series being thus arranged, the terms in the arithmetical series are called the logarithms of the corresponding terms of the geometrical series; that is, 0 is the logarithm of 1, and 1 is the logarithm of 2, and 2 is the logarithm of 4, and 3 that of 8, and so on.\n\nFrom the manner in which the two series are related to each other, it will readily appear by induction that the logarithms of the terms of the geometrical series have the two following properties:\n\n1. The sum of the logarithms of any two numbers or terms in the geometrical series is equal to the logarithm of that number, or term of the series, which is equal to their product.\n\nFor example, let the terms of the geometrical series be 4 and 32; the terms of the arithmetical series corresponding to them (that is, their logarithms) are 2 and 5; now the product of the numbers is 128, and the sum of their logarithms is 7; and it appears by inspection of the two series, that the latter number is the logarithm of the former, agreeing with the proposition we are illustrating. In like manner, if the numbers or terms of the geometrical series be 16 and 64, the logarithms of which are 4 and 6, we find from the table that \\(10^2 = 4 + 6\\) is the logarithm of \\(10^2 = 16 \\times 64\\); and so of any other numbers in the table.\n\n2. The difference of the logarithms of any two numbers, or terms of the geometrical series, is equal to the logarithm of that term of the series which is equal to the quotient arising from the division of the one number by the other.\n\nTake for example the terms 128 and 32, the logarithms of which are 7 and 5; the greater of these numbers divided by the less is 4, and the difference of their logarithms is 2; and by inspecting the two series, this last number will be found to be the logarithm of the former. In like manner, if the terms of the geometrical series be 1024 and 16, the logarithms of which are 10 and 4, we find that \\(10^2 = 16 = 64\\), and that \\(10 - 4 = 6\\); now it appears from the table that the latter number, viz. 6, is the logarithm of the former 64.\n\nThese two properties of logarithms, the second of which indeed is an immediate consequence of the first, enable us to find with great facility the product or the quotient of any two terms of a geometrical series to which they is adapted an arithmetical series, so that each number has its logarithm opposite to it, as in the preceding short table. For it is evident, that to multiply two numbers we have only to add their logarithms, and opposite to that logarithm which is the sum we shall find the product required. Thus, to multiply 16 by 128, to the logarithm of 16, which is 4, we add the logarithm of 128, which is 7, and opposite to the sum 11, we find 2048, the product sought.\n\nOn the other hand, to divide any number in the table by any other number, we must subtract the logarithm of the divisor from that of the dividend, and look for the remainder among the logarithms, and opposite to it we shall find the number sought. Thus, to divide 2048 by 128, from 11, which is the logarithm of 2048 we subtract 7, the logarithm of 128, and opposite to the remainder 4 we find 16, the quotient sought.\n\nLet us now suppose any number of geometrical means to be interposed between each two adjoining terms of the preceding geometrical series, and the same number of arithmetical means between every two adjoining terms of the arithmetical series; then, as the results will still be a geometrical and an arithmetical series, the interpolated terms of the latter will be the logarithms of the corresponding terms of the former, and the two new series will have the very same properties as the original series.\n\nIf we suppose the number of interpolated means to be very great, it will follow that among the terms of the resulting geometrical series, some one or other will be found nearly equal to any proposed number whatever. Therefore, although the preceding table exhibits the logarithms of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, &c., but does not contain the logarithms of the intermediate numbers, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, &c., yet it is easy to conceive that a table might be formed by interpolation which should contain, among the terms of the geometrical series, all numbers whatever to a certain extent, (or at least others very nearly equal to them) together with their logarithms. If such a table were constructed, or at least if such terms of the geometrical progression were found together with their logarithms, as were either accurately equal to, or coincided nearly with, all numbers...\nLOGARITHMS.\n\nThe first invention of logarithms has been attributed by some to Longomontanus, and by others to Jaffe Byrne, two mathematicians who were contemporary with Lord Napier; but there is no reason to suppose that either of these anticipated him, for Longomontanus never published any thing on the subject, although he lived thirty-three years after Napier had made known his discovery; and as to Byrne, he is indeed known to have printed a table containing an arithmetical and a geometrical progression written opposite to each other, so as to form in effect a system of logarithms of the same kind as those invented by Napier, without however explaining their nature and use, although it appears from the title he intended to do so, but was probably prevented by some cause unknown to us. But this work was not printed till 1620, six years after Napier had published his discovery.\n\nIt is therefore with good reason that Napier is now universally considered as the first, and most probably as the only inventor. This discovery he published in the year 1614 in a book entitled Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio, but he reserved the construction of the numbers till the opinion of the learned concerning his invention should be known. His work contains a table of the natural sines and cosines, and their logarithms for every minute of the quadrant, as also the differences between the logarithmic sines and cosines, which are in effect the logarithmic tangents. There is no table of the logarithms of numbers; but precepts are given, by which they, as well as the logarithmic tangents, may be found from the table of natural and logarithmic sines.\n\nIn explaining the nature of logarithms, Napier supposes some determinate line which represents the radius of a circle to be continually diminished, so as to have successively all possible values, and thus to be equal to every sine, one after another, throughout the quadrant. And he supposes this diminution to be effected by a point moving from one extremity towards the other extremity, (or rather some point very near it), with a motion that is not uniform, but becomes slower and slower, and such, that if the whole time between the beginning and the end of the motion be conceived to be divided into a very great number of equal portions, the decrements taken away in each of these shall be to one another as the respective remainders of the line. According to this mode of conceiving the line to decrease, it is easy to show that at the end of any successive equal intervals of time from the beginning of the motion, the portions of the line which remain will constitute a decreasing geometrical progression.\n\nAgain, he supposes another line to be generated by a point which moves along it equably, or which passes over equal intervals of it in equal times. Thus the portions of the line generated at the end of any equal successive intervals of time from the beginning of the motion will form a series of quantities in arithmetical progression. Now if the two motions be supposed to begin together, at the end of any equal intervals of time the remainders of the one line will form a series of quantities in geometrical progression, and the corresponding portions generated of the other line, will constitute a series in arithmetical progression, so that the latter will be the logarithms of the former. And as the terms of the geometrical progression decrease continuously from radius, which is the greatest term, to 0, while the terms of the corresponding arithmetical progression increase from 0 upwards, according to Napier's system the logarithm of radius is 0, and the logarithms of the fines from radius down to 0, are a series of numbers increasing from 0 to infinite.\n\nThe velocities or degrees of quickness with which the motions commence may have to each other any ratio whatever, and by assuming different ratios we shall have different systems of logarithms. Napier supposed the velocities to be equal; but the system of logarithms produced in consequence of this assumption having been found to have some disadvantages, it has been long disused, and a more convenient one substituted instead of it, as we shall presently have occasion to explain.\n\nNapier's work having been written in Latin was translated into English by Mr Edward Wright, an ingenious mathematician of that period, and the inventor of the principles of what is commonly though erroneously called Mercator's sailing. The translation was sent to Napier for his perusal, and returned with his approbation, and the addition of a few lines, intimating that he intended to make some alteration in the system of logarithms in a second edition. Mr Wright died soon after he received back his translation; but it was published after his death, in the year 1616, accompanied with a dedication by his son to the East India Company, and a preface by Henry Briggs, who afterwards distinguished himself so much by his improvement of logarithms. Mr Briggs likewise gave in this work the description and draught of a scale which had been invented by Wright, as also various methods of his own for finding the logarithms of numbers, and the contrary, by means of Napier's table, the use of which had been attended with some inconvenience on account of its containing only such numbers as were the natural sines to every minute of the quadrant and their logarithms. There was an additional inconvenience in using the table, arising from the logarithms being partly positive and partly negative; the latter of these was, however, well remedied by John Speidell in his New Logarithms, first published in the year 1619, which contained the sines, cosines, tangents, cotangents, secants, and cosecants, and given in such a form as to be all positive; and the former was still more completely removed by an additional table, which he gave in the fifth impression of his work, in the year 1624, and which contained the logarithms of the whole numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., to 1000, together with their differences and arithmetical complements, &c. This table is now commonly called hyperbolic logarithms, because the numbers serve to express the areas contained between a hyperbola and its asymptote, and limited by ordinates drawn parallel to the other asymptote. This name, however, is certainly improper, as the same spaces may represent the logarithms of any system whatever, (see Fluxions § 152. Ex. 5.)\n\nIn 1719 Robert Napier, son of the inventor of logarithms, published a second edition of his father's Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio. And along with this\nLOGARITHMS.\n\nThis the promised Logarithmorum Canonis Constructio, and other pieces written by his father and Mr Briggs. An exact copy of the same two works in one volume was also printed in 1620 at Lyons in France. In 1618 or 1619 Benjamin Ursinus, mathematician to the elector of Brandenburg, published Napier's tables of logarithms in his Curios Mathematicae, to which he added some tables of proportional parts; and in 1624 he printed his Trigonometria, with a table of natural sines, and their logarithms of the Napierian kind and form, to every ten seconds of the quadrant.\n\nIn the same year, 1624, the celebrated John Kepler published at Marburg logarithms of nearly the same kind, under the title of Chilas Logarithmorum ad totidem Numeros Rotundos, praemissa Demonstratio legitima Ortu Logarithmorum eorumque Ufus, &c., and in the following year he published a supplement to this work. In the preface to this last he lays, that several of the professors of mathematics in Upper Germany, and more especially those of them who were somewhat advanced in years, and were grown averse to new methods of reasoning that carried them out of the old doctrines and principles with which habit had rendered them familiar, doubted in some degree whether Napier's demonstration of the property of logarithms was perfectly true, and whether the application of them to trigonometrical calculations might not be unsafe and lead the calculator who should trust in them to erroneous results; and in either case, whether the doctrine were true or not, they considered Napier's demonstration of it as illegitimate and unsatisfactory. This opinion induced Kepler to compose the above-mentioned work, in which the whole doctrine is treated in a manner strictly geometrical, and free from the considerations of motion which the German mathematicians had objected to (and not without reason) in Napier's mode of treating the subject.\n\nOn the publication of Napier's logarithms, Mr Henry Briggs, some time professor of geometry in Gresham college London, and afterwards Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford (whom we have already mentioned) applied himself with great earnestness to their study and improvement, and it appears that he had projected at an early period that advantageous change in the system which has since taken place. From the particular view which Napier took of the subject, and the manner in which he conceived logarithms to be generated, it happened that in his system, the logarithms of a series of numbers which increased in a decuple ratio (as 1, 10, 100, 1000, &c.) formed a decreasing arithmetical series, the common difference of the terms of which was 2.3025851. But it occurred to Briggs that it would be better and more conformable to the received decimal notation, to adopt a system in which the logarithms of the terms of such a geometrical series should differ from each other by unity or 1. This idea Briggs communicated to the public in his lectures, and also to Napier himself. He even went twice to Edinburgh to see him, and to converse with him upon the subject; and on his first visit Napier said that he had also formerly thought of the same improvement, but that he chose to publish the logarithms he had previously calculated, till such time as his health and convenience would allow him to make others more commodious. And whereas in the change which Briggs proposed, it was intended to make the logarithms of the sines to increase from 0 (the logarithm of radius) to infinity, while the sines themselves should decrease, it was suggested to him by Napier that it would be better to make them increase so that 0, instead of being the logarithm of radius, should be the logarithm of 1; and that 100000, &c., should be the logarithm of radius; and this Briggs admitted would be an improvement; and having changed the numbers he had already calculated so as to make them suit Napier's modification of his plan, he returned with them next year to Edinburgh, and submitted them to his perusal.\n\nIt appears therefore that Briggs was the inventor of this improved system of logarithms which has since been universally adopted, and that the only share that Napier had in it was his suggestion to Briggs to begin with the low number 1, and to make the logarithms, or the artificial numbers, as Napier had always called them, to increase with the natural numbers, instead of decreasing, which made no alteration in the figures, but only in their affections or signs, changing them from negative to positive.\n\nOn Briggs's return from Edinburgh, in 1617, he printed the first thousand logarithms to eight places of figures, besides the index, with the title of Logarithmorum Chilas prima; but these seem not to have been published till after the death of Napier, which happened in 1618, for in his preface he expresses a hope, that the circumstances which led to a change in the system would be explained in Napier's posthumous work, which was presently to appear. But although Napier had intimated in a note he had given in Wright's translation of the Canon Mirificus, as well as his Rabdologia, printed in 1617, that he intended to alter the scale, yet he altogether omits to state that Briggs was the first to think of this improvement, or at least to publish it to the world. And as the same silence on this point was observed in Napier's posthumous work published in 1619 by his son, Briggs took occasion in the preface to his Arithmetica Logarithmica to assert his claims to the improvement he had now carried into execution.\n\nThe studied silence which Napier seems to have observed respecting the improvement of the system, which Briggs had communicated to him, has given just reason to suspect that he wished to be considered as the author of that improvement, as well as the original inventor. But although it is possible that he thought of it as soon as Briggs, it would seem to have been no more than justice, if, when announcing his intended change of the scale, he had acknowledged that the same idea had occurred to Briggs as well as to himself.\n\nIn 1620 Mr Edmund Gunter published his Canon of Triangles, which contains the artificial or logarithmic sines and tangents to every minute to seven places of figures besides the index, the logarithm of radius being 10. These logarithms are of the kind which had been agreed upon between Napier and Briggs, and they were the first tables of logarithmic sines and tangents that were published of this sort. Gunter also in 1623 reprinted the same in his book de Sectore et Radio, together with the Chilas prima of Briggs; and in the same year he applied the logarithms of numbers, sines, and tangents, to straight lines drawn upon a ruler. This instrument is now in common use for navigation and other purposes, and is commonly called Gunter's scale.\nThe discoveries in Logarithms were first carried to France by Mr Edmund Wingate, but not first of all as he says in the preface to his book. He published at Paris in 1624 two small tracts in the French language upon logarithms, and these were reprinted with improvements at London in 1626.\n\nIn the year 1624, Briggs published his *Arithmetica Logarithmica*, a stupendous work considering the short time he had been preparing it. He here gives the logarithms of 30000 natural numbers to fourteen places of figures, besides the index; namely, from 1 to 20000, and from 90000 to 100000, together with the differences of the logarithms. He also gives an ample treatise on their construction and use, and he carefully solicits others to undertake the computation of the intermediate numbers, offering to give instructions, and paper ready ruled for that purpose, to any persons inclined to contribute to the completion of so valuable a work. By this invitation he had hopes of collecting materials for the logarithms of the intermediate 70000 numbers, while he should employ his time upon the Canon of Logarithmic sines and tangents, and to carry on both works at once.\n\nSoon after this, Adrian Vlacq or Flack of Gouda in Holland completed the intermediate 70 chiliads, and republished the *Arithmetica Logarithmica* in 1627 and 1628, with these intermediate numbers, making in all, the logarithms of all numbers to 100,000, but only to 10 places of figures. To these was added a table of artificial sines, tangents, and secants, to every minute of the quadrant.\n\nBriggs himself lived also to complete a table of logarithmic sines and tangents, to the 100th part of every degree, to fourteen places of figures besides the index, together with a table of natural sines to the same parts to fifteen places, and the tangents and secants of the same to ten places, with the construction of the whole. But his death, which then happened, prevented him from completing the application and uses of them. However, when dying, he committed the performing of this office to his friend Henry Gellibrand, who accordingly added a preface, and the application of the logarithms to plane and spherical trigonometry. The work was called *Trigonometria Britannica*, and was printed at Gouda in the year 1633 under the care of Adrian Vlacq.\n\nIn the same year, 1633, Adrian Vlacq printed a work of his own, called *Trigonometria Artificialis, seu Magnus Canon Triangulorum Logarithmicus ad Decadas Secundorum Scrupolorum Constructus*. This work contains the logarithmic sines and tangents to 10 places of figures, with their differences for every 10 seconds in the quadrant. It also contains Briggs's table of the first 20000 logarithms to ten places, besides the index, with their differences; and to the whole is prefixed a description of the tables and their applications, chiefly extracted from Briggs's *Trigonometria Britannica*, which we have already mentioned.\n\nGellibrand published also, in 1635, *An Institution Trigonometrical*, containing the logarithms of the first 10,000 numbers, with the natural sines, tangents, and secants, and the logarithmic sines and tangents for degrees and minutes; all to seven places of figures besides the index.\n\nThe writers, whose works we have hitherto noticed, introduced were for the most part computors of logarithms. But the system best adapted to practice being now well ascertained, and the labour of constructing the table accomplished, succeeding writers on the subject have had little more to do than to give the tables in the most convenient form. It is true that, in consequence of the numerous discoveries which were afterwards made in mathematics, particularly in the doctrine of series, great improvements were made in the method of computing logarithms; but these, for the most part, came too late to be of use in the actual construction of the table, although they might be applied with advantage to verify calculations previously performed by methods much more laborious.\n\nAs it is of importance that such as have occasion to employ logarithms should know what works are held in estimation on account of their extent and accuracy, we shall enumerate the following:\n\n1. Sherwin's *Mathematical Tables*, in 8vo. These contain the logarithms of all numbers to 101,000; and the sines, tangents, secants, and verified sines, both natural and logarithmic, to every minute of the quadrant. The third edition, printed in 1742, which was revised by Gardiner, is esteemed the most correct; but, in the fifth edition, the errors are so numerous, that no dependence can be placed upon it when accuracy is required.\n\n2. Gardiner's Tables of Logarithms for all numbers to 101,000, and for the sines and tangents to every ten seconds of the quadrant; also for the sines of the first 72 minutes to every single second, &c. This work, which is in 4to, was printed in 1742, and is held in high estimation for its accuracy.\n\n3. An edition of the same work, with some additions, printed in 1770 in Avignon in France. The tables in both editions are to seven places of figures.\n\n4. *Tables Portatives de Logarithmes, publiées à Londres, par Gardiner, augmentées et perfectionnées dans leur disposition, par M. Callet.*—This work is most beautifully printed in a small octavo volume, and contains all the tables in Gardiner's quarto volume; with some additions and improvements.\n\n5. Dr Hutton's Mathematical Tables, containing common hyperbolic and logistic logarithms, &c.—This work has passed through several editions, under the care of the learned author: it is perhaps the most common of any in this country, and is deservedly held in the highest estimation, both on account of its accuracy, and the very valuable information it contains respecting the history of logarithms, and other branches of mathematics connected with them.\n\n6. Taylor's Table of Logarithmic Sines and Tangents to every second of the quadrant; to which is prefixed a table of logarithms from 1 to 100,000, &c.—This is a most valuable work; but being a very large quarto volume, and also very expensive, it is less adapted to general use than the preceding, which is an octavo, and may be had at a moderate price.\n\n7. *Tables portatives des logarithmes, contenant les logarithmes des nombres depuis 1 jusqu'à 108,000; les logarithmes des sinus et tangentes, de seconde en seconde pour les cinq premiers degrés, de dix en dix secondes pour tous les degrés du quart-de cercle, et suivant la nouvelle...*\nLOGARITHMS.\n\nNature of nouvelle division centesimal de dix-millieme en dix milliemes, &c., par Callet.—This work, which is in octavo, may be reasonably expected to be very accurate, it being printed in the stereotype manner, by Didot.\n\nIn addition to these, it is proper that we should notice a stupendous work relating to logarithms, originally suggested by the celebrated Carnot, in conjunction with Prieur de la Côte d'Or, and Brunet de Montpelier, about the beginning of the French revolution. This enterprise was committed, in the year 1794, to the care of Prony, a French mathematician of great eminence, who was not only to compose tables which should leave nothing to be desired with respect to accuracy, but to make them the most extended and most striking monument of calculation which had ever been executed or even imagined. It appears that two manuscript copies of the work were formed, composed of 17 volumes large folio; and containing, besides an introduction, the following tables:\n\n1. The natural sines for each 10,000th part of the quadrant, calculated to twenty-five places of decimals, to be published with twenty-two decimals and five columns of differences.\n\n2. The logarithms of these sines, calculated to fourteen decimals, with five columns of differences.\n\n3. The logarithms of the ratios of the sines to the arcs for the first five thousand 100,000th parts of the quadrant, calculated to fourteen decimal places, with three columns of differences.\n\n4. The logarithms of the tangents corresponding with the logarithms of the sines.\n\n5. The logarithms of the ratios of the tangents to the arcs calculated like those of the third article.\n\n6. Logarithms of numbers from 1 to 100,000, calculated to nineteen places of decimals.\n\n7. The logarithms of numbers from 100,000 to 200,000, calculated to 24 decimals, in order to be published to 12 decimals and three columns of differences.\n\nThe printing of this work was begun at the expense of the French government, but was suspended at the fall of the assignats; whether it has been since resumed we cannot positively say, but it certainly is not yet completed.\n\nSECT. I.\n\nOF THE NATURE OF LOGARITHMS AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION.\n\nWe have already shewn that the properties of logarithms are deducible from those of two series, the terms of one of which form a geometrical progression, and those of the other an arithmetical progression; and as this manner of treating the subject is simple, it is perhaps the best adapted of any to such of our readers as have not pursued the study of mathematics to any great extent. We shall now shew how, from the same principles, the logarithm of any proposed number whatever may be found.\n\nThe first step to be taken in constructing a system of logarithms is to assume the logarithm of some determinate number, besides that of unity or 1, which must necessarily be 0. From the particular view which Napier took of the subject, he was led to assume unity for the logarithm of the number 2.718282, by which it happened that the logarithm of 10 was 2.302585, and this assumption being made, the form of the system became determinate, and the logarithm of every number fixed to one particular value.\n\nMr Briggs however observed, that it would be better to assume unity for the logarithm of 10, instead of making it the logarithm of 2.718282, as in Napier's system, and hence the logarithms of the terms of the geometrical progression\n\n\\[1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, \\ldots\\]\n\nwere necessarily fixed to the corresponding terms of this arithmetical progression,\n\n\\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \\ldots\\]\n\nThat is, the logarithm of 1 being 0, and that of 10 being 1, the logarithm of 100 is 2, and that of 1000 is 3, and so on.\n\nThe logarithms of the terms of the progression, 1, 10, 100, 1000, &c. being thus determined; in order to form the logarithms of the numbers between 1 and 10, and between 10 and 100, and so on, we must conceive a very great number of geometrical means to be interposed between each two adjoining terms of the preceding geometrical series, and as many arithmetical means between the corresponding terms of the arithmetical series; then, like as the terms of the arithmetical series 0, 1, 2, 3, &c. are the logarithms of the corresponding terms of the geometrical series 1, 10, 100, 1000, &c., the interpolated terms of the former will also be the logarithms of the corresponding interpolated terms of the latter. Now as by supposing the number of means interpolated between each two terms of the geometrical series to be sufficiently great, some one or other of them may be found which will be very nearly equal to any proposed number; it is evident that to find the logarithm of such a number, we have only to seek for one of the interpolated means which is very nearly equal to it, and to take the logarithm of that mean as a near value of the logarithm required.\n\nAs a particular example, let it be required to find the logarithm of the number 5, according to Briggs's system.\n\nFirst step of the process.—The number 5 is between 1 and 10, the logarithms of which we already know to be 0 and 1: Let a geometrical mean be found between the two former, and an arithmetical mean between the two latter. The geometrical mean will be the square root of the product of the numbers 1 and 10, which is \\(3.162277\\); and the arithmetical mean will be half the sum of the logarithms 0 and 1, which is 0.5; therefore the logarithm of \\(3.162277\\) is 0.5. But as the mean thus found is not sufficiently near to the proposed number, we must proceed with the operation as follows:\n\nSecond step.—The number 5, whose logarithm is sought is between 3.162277, the mean last found, and 10, the logarithms of which we know to be 0.5 and 1; we must now find a geometrical mean between the two former, and an arithmetical mean between the two latter. The one of these is \\(\\sqrt{(3.162277 \\times 10)} = 5.623413\\), and the other is \\(\\frac{1 + 0.5}{2} = 0.75\\); therefore the logarithm of 5.623413 is 0.75.\n\nThird step.—We have now obtained two numbers, namely,\nNature of namely 3.162277 and 5.623413, one on each side of Logarithms, 5, together with their logarithms .05 and .075, we therefore proceed exactly as before, and accordingly we find the geometrical mean, or $\\sqrt{(3.162277 \\times 5.623413)}$, to be 4.216964, and the arithmetical mean, or $\\frac{0.5 + 0.75}{2}$ to be 0.625; therefore the logarithm of 4.216964 is 0.625.\n\nFourth step.—We proceed in the same manner with the numbers 4.216964, and 5.623413 (one of which is less, and the other greater than 5) and their logarithms 0.625 and 0.75, and find a new geometrical mean, viz. 4.869674, and its corresponding arithmetical mean, or logarithm, 0.6875.\n\nWe must go on in this way till we have found twenty-two geometrical means, and as many corresponding arithmetical means or logarithms. And that we may indicate how these are found from each other, let the numbers 1 and 10 be denoted by A and B, and their geometrical means taken in their order by C, D, E, &c., then the results of the successive operations will be as in the following table.\n\n| Numbers | Logarithms |\n|---------|------------|\n| A       | 1.000000   |\n| B       | 1.000000   |\n| C       | 3.162277   |\n| D       | 5.623413   |\n| E       | 4.216964   |\n| F       | 4.869674   |\n| G       | 5.232991   |\n| H       | 5.048065   |\n| I       | 4.958060   |\n| K       | 5.002865   |\n| L       | 4.980416   |\n| M       | 4.991627   |\n| N       | 4.997242   |\n| O       | 5.000052   |\n| P       | 4.998647   |\n| Q       | 4.999350   |\n| R       | 4.999701   |\n| S       | 4.999876   |\n| T       | 4.999963   |\n| V       | 5.000008   |\n| W       | 4.999984   |\n| X       | 4.999997   |\n| Y       | 5.000003   |\n| Z       | 5.000000   |\n\nAs the last of these means, viz. Z, agrees with 5, the proposed number, as far at least as the fifth place of decimals, we may safely consider them as very nearly equal, therefore their logarithms will also be very nearly equal, that is the logarithm of 5 will be 0.6989700 nearly.\n\nIn performing the operations indicated in the preceding table it will be necessary to find the geometrical means at the beginning to many more figures than are here put down, in order to obtain at last a result true to 7 decimal places. Thus it appears that the labour of computing logarithms by this method is indeed very great. It is, however, that which was employed by Briggs and Vlacq in the original construction of logarithms; but since the period in which they lived, others more easy have been found, as we shall presently have occasion to explain.\n\nThe logarithm of any number whatever may be found by a series of calculations similar to that which we have just now explained. But in constructing the Logarithms, table it would only be necessary to have recourse to this method in calculating the logarithms of prime numbers; for as often as the logarithm of a number which was the product of other numbers, whose logarithms were known, was required, it would be immediately obtained by adding together the logarithms of its factors. On the contrary, if the logarithm of the product of two numbers were known, and also that of one of its factors, the logarithm of the other factor would be obtained from these, by simply taking their difference.\n\nFrom this last remark it is obvious, that having now found the logarithm of 5, we can immediately find that of 2; for since 2 is the quotient of 10 divided by 5, its logarithm will be the difference of the logarithms of 10 and 5; now the logarithm of 10 is 1, and the logarithm of 5 is 0.6989700, therefore the logarithm of 2 is 0.3010300.\n\nHaving thus obtained the logarithms of 2 and 5, in addition to those of 10, 100, 1000, &c. we may thence find the logarithms of innumerable other numbers. Thus, because $4 = 2 \\times 2$, the logarithm of 4 will be the logarithm of 2 added to itself, or will be twice the logarithm of 2. Again, because $5 \\times 10 = 50$, the logarithm of 50 will be the sum of the logarithms of 5 and 10. In this manner it is evident we may find the logarithms of $8 = 2 \\times 4$, of $16 = 2 \\times 8$, of $25 = 5 \\times 5$, and of as many more such numbers as we please.\n\nBesides the view we have hitherto taken of the theory of logarithms, there are others under which it has been presented by different authors. Some of these we proceed to explain, beginning with that in which they are defined to be the measures of ratios; but to see the propriety of this definition, it must be understood what is meant by the measure of a ratio.\n\nAccording to the definition of a compound ratio, as laid down by writers on geometry, if there be any number of magnitudes A, B, C, D, which are continual proportions, or such that the ratio of A to B is equal to the ratio of B to C, and that again is equal to the ratio of C to D, and so on, the ratio of the first of these magnitudes A to the third C is considered as made up of two equal ratios, each equal to the ratio of the first A to the second B. And in like manner the ratio of the first A to the fourth D is considered as made up of three equal ratios, each equal to the ratio of the first to the second, and so on. (See Geometry Sect. III. Def. 10, 11, and 12.) Thus, to take a particular example in numbers, because the ratio of 81 to 3 may be considered as made up of the ratio of 81 to 27, and of 27 to 9, and of 9 to 3, which three ratios are equal among themselves, (Geometry Sect. III. Def. 4.) the ratio of 81 to 3 will be triple the ratio of 9 to 3; and in like manner the ratio of 27 to 3 will be double the ratio of 9 to 3. Also, because the ratios of 1000 to 100, 100 to 10, 10 to 1, are all equal, the ratio of 1000 to 1 will be three times as great as the ratio of 10 to 1; and the ratio of 100 to 1 will be twice as great; and so on.\n\nTaking this view of ratios, and considering them as a particular species of quantities, made up of others of the same kind, they may evidently be compared with each other, in respect of their magnitudes, in the same manner as we compare lines or quantities of any kind whatever.\nLOGARITHMS.\n\nNature of whatever. And as when estimating the relative magnitudes of two quantities, two lines for example, if we find that the one contains five such equal parts as the other contains seven, we say the one line has to the other the proportion of 5 to 7; in like manner, if two ratios be such, that the one can be resolved into five equal ratios, and the other into seven of the same ratios, we may conclude that the magnitude of the one ratio is to that of the other as the number 5 to the number 7; and a similar conclusion may be drawn, when the ratios to be compared are any multiples whatever of some other ratio.\n\nIt is well known that there may be lines and other quantities, which, as they admit of no common measure, are said to be incommensurable to each other; and the same will also happen to ratios: That is, there may be two ratios such that into whatever number of equal ratios the one is divided, the other cannot possibly be exactly equal to a ratio composed of any number of these. We may however conceive the number of equal ratios into which the one is divided to be so great that a certain number of them shall compose a ratio more nearly equal to the other ratio than by any assignable difference. Therefore, like as we can always find numbers which shall have among themselves, either accurately, or as nearly as we please, the same ratios as any number of lines or other magnitudes have to each other, and which therefore may be taken as the measures, or representatives of the lines; so also, corresponding to any system of ratios, there may be always found a series of numbers which will have the same proportions among themselves as the ratios have to each other, and which may in like manner be called the measures of the ratios.\n\nLet us now suppose that unity, or 1, is assumed as the common consequent of all ratios whatever; and that the ratio of 10 (or some particular number) to 1 is compounded of a very great number of equal ratios, as for example 1000000: then, as each of these will be very near to the ratio of equality, (for it will be the ratio of the first term to the second of a series of one million and one continued proportional, the first of which is 10 and last 1), it will follow, and is easy to conceive, that the ratios of all other numbers to unity will each be very nearly equal to some multiple of that small ratio. And by supposing the number of small equal ratios of which the ratio of 10 to 1 is composed to be sufficiently great, the ratios of all other numbers to unity may be as nearly equal to ratios which are multiples of that small ratio as we please. Let us still suppose, however, for the sake of illustration, that the number of small ratios contained in that of 10 to 1 is 1000000; then, as it may be proved that the ratio of 2 to 1 will be very nearly the same as a ratio composed of 301030 of these; and that the ratio of 3 to 1 will be nearly equal to a ratio composed of 477121 of them, and that the ratio of 4 to 1 will be nearly equal to a ratio composed of 602060 of them, and so on; these numbers, viz. 1000000, 301030, 477121, and 602060, or any other numbers proportional to them, will be the measures of the ratios of 10 to 1, 2 to 1, 3 to 1, and 4 to 1, respectively; and the same quantities will also be what have been called the logarithms of the ratios; for the word logarithm, if regard be had to its etymology, is λογισμός ἀριθμοῦ, or the numbers of small and equal ratios (or ratiunculae as they have been called) contained in the several ratios of quantities one to another.\n\nWe have for the sake of illustration, assumed 1000000 as the measure of the ratio of 10 to 1, by which it happens, as already observed, that the measures of the ratios of 2 to 1, 3 to 1, &c., are 301030 and 477121 respectively; as, however, these measures are not absolute, but relative quantities, we may assume any other numbers whatever instead of these, provided they have the same proportions to each other as these numbers have among themselves. Accordingly, we may assume 1 as the measure or logarithm of the ratio of 10 to 1; and then the logarithms of the ratios of 2 to 1, 3 to 1, &c., instead of being 301030, 477121, &c., will be .301030 and .477121, &c., respectively, that is, each will be the one-millionth of what it was before.\n\nIn Briggs's system, the logarithm of the ratio of 10 to 1, or, to speak briefly, the logarithm of 10, is unity; but we are at liberty to assume any number whatever, as that whose logarithm shall be unity. Napier, in consequence of his particular views of the subject, chose the number 2.718282; and hence it happens that the logarithms of the ratios are expressed by different numbers in the two systems.\n\nIt yet remains for us to shew the identity of the properties of logarithms, as explained in the two different views we have now given of the subject; and this may be done as follows.\n\nLet A and B denote any two numbers. The ratio of their product to unity, that is, the ratio of \\(A \\times B\\) to 1, is compounded of the ratio of \\(A \\times B\\) to B, and of B to 1; (see GEOMETRY Part III. Def. 10.) but since \\(A \\times B\\), B, A, and 1 are four proportional, the ratio of \\(A \\times B\\) to B is equal to the ratio of A to 1. Therefore the ratio of \\(A \\times B\\) to 1 is compounded of the ratio of A to 1 and of B to 1; and consequently the logarithm of the ratio of \\(A \\times B\\) to 1 will be equal to the sum of the logarithms of the ratios of A to 1, and of B to 1; or in other words, the logarithm of \\(A \\times B\\) will be the sum of the logarithms of A and B.\n\nAnd because \\(\\log(A \\times B) = \\log A + \\log B\\), therefore, \\(\\log(B) = \\log(A \\times B) - \\log A\\). In this equation let \\(\\frac{C}{D}\\) be substituted for B, and D for A, then, (because \\(A \\times B = D \\times \\frac{C}{D} = C\\)) we have \\(\\log \\frac{C}{D} = \\log C - \\log D\\).\n\nWe have now given a short sketch of the theory of logarithms as deducible from the doctrine of ratios. It was in this way that the celebrated Kepler treated the subject according to the strictest rules of geometrical reasoning; and in this he has been followed by Mercator, Halley, Cotes, as well as by other mathematicians of later times, as by Mr Baron Maclaurin, in his \"Elements of Plane Trigonometry,\" a work in which the whole theory of logarithms is treated with all that perspicuity and accuracy which characterize the ingenious author's various writings. The same mode of treating the subject was likewise adopted by that excellent geometrician Dr Robert Simson, as appears by a short tract in Latin, written by him and published in his posthumous works. As, however, the doctrine of ratios is of a very abstract nature, and the mode of reasoning upon which it has been established is of a peculiar and subtle kind, we presume that the greater number of readers\nNature of readers will think this view of the subject less simple than the following, in which we mean to deduce the theory of logarithms, as well as the manner of computing them, from the properties of the exponents of powers.\n\nIf we attend to the common scale of notation in arithmetic, we shall find that it is so contrived as to express all numbers whatever by means of the powers of the number 10, which is the root of the scale, and the nine digits which serve as coefficients to these powers. Thus, if R denote 10, the root of the scale, so that R^3 will denote 1000, and R^4 10000, and so on; the number 471529 is otherwise expressed by 4R^3 + 7R^2 + 1R^1 + 5R^0 + 2R^-1 + 9R^-2, which is equivalent to 4R^3 + 7R^2 + 1R^1 + 5R^0 + 2R^-1 + 9R^-2. Again, the mixed number 371.243 is expressed by 3R^3 + 7R^2 + 1R^1 + 2R^-1 + 4R^-2 + 3R^-3.\n\nAs to vulgar fractions, by transforming them to decimals, they may be expressed in the same manner. Thus \\( \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375 = 3R^{-1} + 7R^{-2} + 5R^{-3} \\). Also \\( \\frac{3}{4} = 0.666, \\ldots \\).\n\nAlthough the number 10 has been fixed upon as the root of the scale of notation, any other number may be employed to express all numbers whatever in the same manner; and some numbers are even preferable to 10. Thus, making 8 the root of a scale, and denoting it by R, the number 2735, when expressed according to this scale, is 5R^3 + 2R^2 + 3R^1 + 5R^0, or 5R^3 + 2R^2 + 3R^1 + 5R^0; and here we may observe, that if a number greater than 10 were assumed as the root of the scale of notation, it would be necessary to adopt some new numeral characters in addition to those in common use, and if a smaller number were assumed, we might dispense with some of those we already have.\n\nBut instead of expressing all numbers by the sums of certain multiples of the successive powers of some particular number, we may also express them, if not accurately, at least as near as we please, by a single power, whole or fractional, of any positive number whatever, which may be either whole or fractional, but must not be unity.\n\nLet us take, for example, 2 as the number, by the powers of which all others are to be expressed. Then it may be shewn that the numbers 1, 2, 3, &c., are all expressible by the powers of 2, as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1 &= 2^0 \\\\\n2 &= 2^1 \\\\\n3 &= 2^{1.58496}, \\text{nearly} \\\\\n4 &= 2^2 \\\\\n5 &= 2^{2.3170}, \\text{nearly}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand so on. And if instead of 2 we take the number 10, then we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1 &= 10^0 \\\\\n2 &= 10^{0.3010} \\\\\n3 &= 10^{0.4771} \\\\\n4 &= 10^{0.6020} \\\\\n5 &= 10^{0.69897}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence we may conclude, that if r be put for some determinate number, and n for any indefinite positive number, whole or fractional, it is always possible to find Logarithms, another number N, such, that the number r being raised to the power N shall either be exactly equal to n, or shall be as near to it as we please; that is, we shall have \\( r^N = n \\).\n\nWhen numbers are expressed in this way by the powers of some given number r; the exponent of that power of r which is equal to any assigned number is called the logarithm of that number. Therefore, if \\( r^N = n \\), (n being put for any number) then N will be the logarithm of the number n.\n\nThe logarithms which are produced by giving to r some determinate value constitute a system of logarithms, and the constant number r, from which the system is formed, is called the base or radical number of the system.\n\nThe properties of logarithms may be readily deduced from the above definition as follows. Let a and b be put for any two numbers, and A and B for their logarithms; then, r being supposed to denote the base, or radical number of the system, we have \\( a = r^A \\) and \\( b = r^B \\); now if we take the product of a and b, we have \\( ab = r^A \\times r^B = r^{A+B} \\); but according to the definition, A+B is the logarithm of ab, (for it is the index of that power of r which is equal to ab) therefore, the sum of the logarithms of any two numbers a and b is the logarithm of their product ab. Again, we have \\( \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{r^A}{r^B} = r^{A-B} \\), but here A-B is the index of that power of r which is equal to \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\); therefore, A-B is the logarithm of \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\); hence, if one number a be divided by another number b, the excess of the logarithm of the dividend above that of the divisor is equal to the logarithm of the quotient \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\).\n\nLet n express any number whatever, then, raising both sides of the equation \\( a = r^A \\) to the nth power, we have \\( a^n = (r^A)^n = r^{nA} \\); but here nA is manifestly the logarithm of \\( a^n \\); therefore, the logarithm of \\( a^n \\), any power of a number, is the product of the logarithm of the number by n, the index of the power. And this must evidently be true, whether that index be a whole number, or a fraction, either positive or negative.\n\nFrom these properties it is easy to see in what manner a table that exhibits the logarithms of all numbers within certain limits may be applied to simplify calculations: for since the sum of the logarithms of any two numbers is equal to the logarithm of their product; it follows, that as often as we have occasion to find the product of two or more numbers, we have only to add their logarithms into one sum, taking them from the table, and to look in the table for the number whose logarithm is equal to that sum, and this number will be the product required. Also, because the excess of the logarithm of the dividend above that of the divisor is equal to the logarithm of the quotient; as often as we have occasion to divide one number by another, we have only...\nNature of logarithms only to subtract the logarithm of the divisor from that of the dividend, and opposite to that logarithm in the table, which is the remainder, we shall find the quotient.\n\nAs the logarithm of any power of a number is the product of the logarithm of the number, and the index of the power; and on the contrary, the logarithm of any root of a number is the quotient found by dividing the logarithm of the number by the index of the root; it follows, that we may find any power or root of a number, by multiplying the logarithm of the number by the index of the power, or dividing it by the index of the root, and taking that number in the table whose logarithm is the product or quotient for the power or root required.\n\nIf in the equation \\(a = r^A\\) (where \\(a\\) is any number, \\(A\\) its logarithm, and \\(r\\) the base of the system) we suppose \\(a = 1\\), then, in this case \\(r^A = 1\\); but this equation can only be satisfied by putting \\(A = 0\\). Hence it appears, that in every system of logarithms, the logarithm of unity must be 0. If on the other hand we assume \\(a = r\\); then we have the equation \\(r = r^A\\), which is immediately satisfied by putting \\(A = 1\\); therefore, the logarithm of the base, or radical number of every system is necessarily unity.\n\nIf we suppose \\(r\\) to be a positive number greater than unity, and \\(a\\) a positive number greater than unity, then \\(A\\) will be a positive number; for if it be negative we would have \\(a = r^{-A} = \\frac{1}{r^A}\\) a proper fraction, and at the same time a number greater than unity by hypothesis, which is impossible. If on the contrary we suppose \\(a\\) a proper fraction, then \\(A\\) must necessarily be negative, for if it were positive, then \\(r^A\\) would be greater than unity, and \\(a = r^A\\) also greater than unity, while by hypothesis it is a fraction less than unity, which is impossible. Therefore, in every system, the base of which is greater than unity, the logarithm of a whole or mixed number is always positive, but the logarithm of a proper fraction is always negative.\n\nBecause the logarithm of \\(r\\) is unity, the logarithm of \\(r^n\\) will be \\(n\\); therefore, the logarithm of any integer power of the radical number \\(r\\) will always be an integer.\n\nLet \\(r\\) and \\(r'\\) denote bases of two different systems; and let \\(A\\) be the logarithm of a number, \\(a\\), taken according to the first of these, and \\(A'\\) its logarithm taken according to the last. Then because \\(a = r^A\\), and \\(a = r'^{A'}\\), it follows that \\(r^A = r'^{A'}\\), and \\(r = r'^{A'/A}\\). Let us now suppose that \\(r''\\) is the base of a third system of logarithms, and \\(R\\) and \\(R'\\) the logarithms of \\(r\\) and \\(r'\\) taken according to this third system; then because\n\n\\[r^{R/R'} = r', \\quad r'^{R/R'} = r;\\]\n\nwe have \\(r^{R/R'} = r'^{R/R'}\\), \\(r'^{R/R'} = r^{R/R'}\\);\n\ntherefore \\(r^{R/R'} = r'^{R/R'}\\), and \\(r = r'^{R/R'}\\); but we have already found \\(r = r'^{R/R'}\\), therefore \\(r^{R/R'} = r'^{R/R'}\\), and consequently\n\n\\[A' = R/R', \\quad \\text{and } A : A' : : R : R'.\\]\n\nHence it appears, that the logarithm of a number, taken according to any system, has to its logarithm, taken according to any other system, a constant ratio, which is the same as that of the reciprocals of the logarithms of the radical numbers of those systems, taken according to any system whatever.\n\nLet us next suppose, that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are two numbers, and \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) their logarithms, taken according to the same system, and \\(r\\) the base of the system; then because\n\n\\[r^A = a, \\quad r^B = b;\\]\n\nwe have \\(r^{AB} = a^B, \\quad r^{AB} = b^A;\\)\n\ntherefore \\(a^B = b^A\\), and \\(a = b^{\\frac{A}{B}}\\), now as \\(r\\) is not found in this equation, the value of the fraction \\(\\frac{A}{B}\\) depends only on the numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); therefore, the logarithms of any two given numbers have the same ratio in every system whatever.\n\nHaving now explained the properties which belong to the logarithms of any system whatever, we proceed to investigate general rules by which the number corresponding to any logarithm, and on the contrary, the logarithm corresponding to any number, may be found the one from the other. And for this end let us denote any number whatever by \\(y\\), and its logarithm by \\(x\\), and put \\(r\\) as before for the base, or radical number of the system; then by the nature of logarithms we have this equation\n\n\\[y = r^x.\\]\n\nPut \\(r = 1 + a\\), and let the expression \\((1 + a)^x\\) be expanded into a series by the binomial theorem; thus we shall have\n\n\\[y = 1 + xa + \\frac{x(x-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^2 + \\frac{x(x-1)(x-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^3 + \\frac{x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} a^4 + \\ldots\\]\n\nLet this series, the terms of which are arranged according to the powers of the quantity \\(a\\), be transformed into another the terms of which shall be arranged according to the powers of \\(x\\); and to effect this we must find the actual products of the factors which constitute the powers of \\(a\\), and arrange the terms anew, as follows,\n\n\\[1 = 1,\\]\n\\[xa = xa,\\]\n\\[\\frac{x(x-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^2 = \\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{a^2}{2},\\]\n\\[\\frac{x(x-1)(x-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^3 = \\frac{a^3}{3} + \\frac{a^3}{3},\\]\n\\[\\frac{x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} a^4 = \\frac{a^4}{4} + \\frac{a^4}{4},\\]\n\\[\\ldots\\]\n\nso that adding into one sum the quantities on each side of the sign \\(=\\), and recollecting that the sum of these on the left-hand side is equal to \\(y\\), we have\nLOGARITHMS.\n\n\\[\ny = r^x = \\left(1 + \\frac{a}{2} x + \\frac{a^2}{3} x^2 + \\frac{a^3}{4} x^3 + \\cdots \\right)\n\\]\n\nwhich equation, by substituting,\n\n\\[A \\text{ for } a - \\frac{a^4}{2} + \\frac{a^3}{3} - \\frac{a^4}{4} + \\cdots\\]\n\n\\[A' \\text{ for } \\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{11a^4}{24} + \\cdots\\]\n\n\\[A'' \\text{ for } \\frac{a^3}{6} - \\frac{a^4}{4} + \\cdots\\]\n\n\\[A''' \\text{ for } \\frac{a^4}{24} + \\cdots\\]\n\n&c.\n\nmay be abbreviated to\n\n\\[r^x = 1 + Ax + A'x^2 + A''x^3 + A'''x^4 + \\cdots\\]\n\nNext, to determine the law of connexion of the quantities \\(A, A', A'', A'''\\), &c. let \\(x + z\\) be substituted in the last equation for \\(x\\), (here \\(z\\) is put for any indefinite quantity) thus it becomes\n\n\\[r^{x+z} = 1 + A(x+z) + A'(x+z)^2 + A''(x+z)^3 + \\cdots\\]\n\nBut \\(r^{x+z} = r^x \\times r^z\\), and since it has been shewn that\n\n\\[r^x = 1 + Ax + A'x^2 + A''x^3 + A'''x^4 + \\cdots\\]\n\nfor the very same reason\n\n\\[r^z = 1 + Az + A'z^2 + A''z^3 + A'''z^4 + \\cdots\\]\n\ntherefore the series\n\n\\[1 + A(x+z) + A'(x+z)^2 + A''(x+z)^3 + A'''(x+z)^4 + \\cdots\\]\n\nis equal to the product of the two series\n\n\\[1 + Ax + A'x^2 + A''x^3 + A'''x^4 + \\cdots\\]\n\n\\[1 + Az + A'z^2 + A''z^3 + A'''z^4 + \\cdots\\]\n\nThat is, by actual involution and multiplication\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n1 + Ax + A'x^2 + A''x^3 + A'''x^4 + \\cdots \\\\\n+ Az + A'z^2 + A''z^3 + A'''z^4 + \\cdots \\\\\n+ A'x^2 + A''x^3 + A'''x^4 + \\cdots \\\\\n+ A''x^3 + A'''x^4 + \\cdots \\\\\n+ A'''x^4 + \\cdots\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nNow as the quantities \\(A, A', A'', A'''\\), &c. are quite independent of \\(x\\) and \\(z\\), the two sides of the equation can only be identical upon the supposition that the coefficients of like terms in each are equal; therefore, setting aside the first line of each side of the equation, because their terms are the same, and also the first term of the second line, for the same reason, let the coefficients of the remaining terms be put equal to one another, thus we have\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nA &= \\frac{A^2}{2} \\\\\nA' &= \\frac{3A^2}{2} \\\\\nA'' &= \\frac{4A^2}{2} \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nand hence\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nA' &= \\frac{A^3}{1 \\cdot 2} \\\\\nA'' &= \\frac{A^4}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nHere the law of the coefficients \\(A, A', A'', A'''\\), &c. is obvious, each being formed from the preceding by multiplying it by \\(A\\), and dividing by the exponent of the power of \\(A\\) which is thus formed.

Ex. 1. also § 200, Prob. 1.\nLOGARITHMS.\n\nNature of Logarithms. Thus the quantity \\( r^A \\), whatever be the value of \\( r \\), is evidently equal to a constant number, which, as appears from the last equation, is equal to the value of \\( r \\) when \\( A = 1 \\). By adding together a sufficient number of the terms of the series expressing the value of \\( r^A \\), we find that quantity equal to\n\n\\[ 2.718281828459045\\ldots \\]\n\nLet this number be denoted by \\( e \\), and we have \\( r^A = e \\),\n\nand \\( r = e^A \\); hence it appears, that if the number \\( e \\) be considered as the base of a logarithmic system, the quantity \\( A \\), that is\n\n\\[ r - 1 + \\frac{(r-1)^2}{2} + \\frac{(r-1)^3}{3} + \\frac{(r-1)^4}{4} + \\frac{(r-1)^5}{5} + \\ldots \\]\n\nis the logarithm of \\( r \\) to the base \\( e \\). But as \\( r \\) is not restricted here to any particular value, we may substitute \\( y \\) instead of it, keeping in mind that \\( y \\) denotes any number whatever, and \\( x \\) its logarithm; thus we have \\( x \\) the logarithm of \\( y \\), expressed by the series\n\n\\[ y - 1 + \\frac{(y-1)^2}{2} + \\frac{(y-1)^3}{3} + \\frac{(y-1)^4}{4} + \\frac{(y-1)^5}{5} + \\ldots \\]\n\nsupposing that the base of the system is the number we have expressed above by \\( e \\).\n\nWe have now found a general formula for the logarithm of any number, \\( y \\), taken according to a particular system, namely, that which has the number \\( e \\) for its base. But it is easy from hence to find a formula, which shall apply to any system whatever. For it has been shown that the logarithms of the same number, taken according to two different systems, are to each other as the reciprocals of the logarithms of the bases of the systems, these last logarithms being taken according to any system whatever, that is,\n\n\\[ \\log_y z \\text{ to base } e : \\log_y z \\text{ to base } r :: \\frac{1}{\\log_e r} : \\frac{1}{\\log_r e} ; \\]\n\nhence we find\n\n\\[ \\log_y z \\text{ to base } r = \\frac{\\log_e z}{\\log_e r} \\times \\log_y z \\text{ to base } e. \\]\n\nLet the value we have already found for the logarithm of \\( y \\) to base \\( e \\) be substituted in this equation, and it becomes\n\n\\[ \\log_y z = \\frac{\\log_e z}{\\log_e r} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{(1-y)^2}{2} + \\frac{(1-y)^3}{3} - \\frac{(1-y)^4}{4} + \\ldots \\right] \\]\n\nwhich is a general formula for the logarithm of any number whatever, to the base \\( r \\). And it is to be recollected that in the fraction \\( \\frac{\\log_e z}{\\log_e r} \\), which is a common multiplier to the series, the logarithms are to be taken according to the same base, which however may be any number whatever (b).\n\nIf in the above formula we suppose \\( r = e \\), the multiplier \\( \\log_e r \\) will be unity, and the formula will become simply\n\n\\[ \\log_y z = \\frac{(y-1)^2}{2} + \\frac{(y-1)^3}{3} - \\frac{(y-1)^4}{4} + \\ldots \\]\n\nas we have already remarked. Now this is the system which was adopted by Lord Napier; and although the logarithms which were computed according to this system, or upon the supposition that the radical number is 2.7182818 &c., have been called hyperbolic logarithms because they happen to be proportional to certain hyperbolic spaces, yet, as the logarithms of every system have the same property, it is more proper to call them Napierian logarithms.\n\nAs the constant multiplier \\( \\frac{\\log_e z}{\\log_e r} \\), which occurs in the general formula for the logarithm of any number, is the only part of the formula which depends for its value upon the base of the system, it has been called by writers on logarithms, the modulus of the system. If we suppose the logarithms taken to the base \\( e \\), then the numerator, viz. \\( \\log_e z \\), will be unity, and the denominator will be the Napierian logarithm of \\( r \\). If however we suppose the logarithms taken to the base \\( r \\), then the numerator will be \\( \\log_e z \\) to base \\( r \\); and the denominator will be unity, so that the modulus of any system whose base is \\( r \\), is the reciprocal of the Napierian logarithm of that base; or it is the logarithm of the number \\( e \\) (the base of the Napierian system) to the base \\( r \\).\n\nIn the Napierian system the modulus is unity, and hence the logarithms of this system, as far as depends upon facility of computation, are the most simple of any. It was however soon found that a system whose base should be the same as the root of the scale of the arithmetical notation, viz. the number 10, would be the most convenient of any in practice; and accordingly such a system was actually constructed by Mr Briggs. This is the only one now in common use, and is called Briggs's system, also the common system of logarithms. The modulus of this system therefore is the reciprocal of the Napierian logarithm of 10; or it is the common logarithm of \\( e = 2.7182818 \\) &c. the base of the Napierian system. We shall in future denote this modulus by \\( M \\); so that the formula expressing the common logarithm of any number \\( y \\) will be\n\n\\[ \\log_y z = M \\left[ 1 - \\frac{(1-y)^2}{2} + \\frac{(1-y)^3}{3} - \\frac{(1-y)^4}{4} + \\ldots \\right]. \\]\n\nIf the number \\( y \\), whose logarithm is required be very near to unity, so that \\( 1-y \\) is a small quantity, then the logarithm may be found from this formula with great ease, because the series will converge very rapidly. If, however, \\( 1-y \\) be greater than unity, the series, instead of converging, will diverge, so as to be in its present form of no use.\n\nIt may however be transformed into another, which shall converge in every case, by substituting in it \\( n\\sqrt{y} \\) instead of \\( y \\), and observing that \\( \\log_n (n\\sqrt{y}) = \\frac{\\log_y z}{n} \\);\n\n(b) For other methods of investigating the same formula see Algebra 284, and Fluxions § 70, Ex. 2, also § 136.\nThus we have two limits to the value of the logarithm of \\( y \\), which, by taking the number \\( n \\) sufficient, may come as near to each other as we please.\n\nIn like manner we find two limits to the value of the reciprocal to the modulus, viz.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{M} < n \\left( \\frac{n}{y} - 1 \\right), \\quad \\frac{1}{M} > n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{n \\sqrt{y}} \\right).\n\\]\n\nIt is evident that the difference between the two limits of log. \\( y \\), is\n\n\\[\nn M \\left( \\frac{n}{y} - 1 \\right) - \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{n \\sqrt{y}} \\right),\n\\]\n\ntherefore if we take either the one or the other of the two preceding expressions for log. \\( y \\), the error in excess or defect is necessarily less than this quantity.\n\nBy these formulas we may depend upon having the logarithm of any number true to \\( m \\) figures, if we give \\( n \\) such a value that the root \\( \\frac{n}{y} \\) shall have \\( m \\) cyphers between the decimal point and the first significant figure on the right. So that in general, as the error is the smaller according as \\( n \\) the exponent of the root is greater, we may conclude that it becomes nothing, or may be reckoned as nothing, when \\( n \\) is taken indefinitely great; and this being the case, we may conclude that either of these expressions\n\n\\[\nn M \\left( \\frac{n}{y} - 1 \\right), \\quad n M \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{n \\sqrt{y}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nis the accurate value of log. \\( y \\).\n\nThe best manner of applying the preceding formula is to take some power of the number 2 for \\( n \\); for by doing so, the root \\( \\frac{n}{y} \\) may be found by a repetition of extractions of the square root only. It was in this way that Briggs calculated the first logarithms; and he remarked, that if in performing the successive extractions of the square root, he at last obtained twice as many decimal places as there were cyphers after the decimal point, the integer before it being unity, then the decimal part of this root was exactly the half of that which went before; so that the decimal parts of the two roots were to each in the same proportion as their logarithms; now this is an evident consequence of the preceding formula.\n\nTo give an example of the application of the formula, let it be required to find the numerical value of \\( M \\), the modulus of the common system of logarithms, which, as it is the reciprocal of the Napierian logarithm of 10 is equal to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n} \\times \\frac{1}{n \\sqrt{10} - 1} \\text{ nearly},\n\\]\n\nwhen \\( n \\) is some very great number. Let us suppose \\( n = 2^{60} = 8^{30} \\); then, dividing unity by 8, and this result again by 8, and so on, we shall after 20 divisions have \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), or \\( \\frac{1}{8^{30}} \\) equal to\n\n0.00000000000000086736173798840354.\n\nAlso, by extracting the square root of 10, and the square root of this result, and so on, after performing 60 extractions we shall find \\( \\frac{1}{n \\sqrt{10}} \\) equal to\n\n1.000000000000000001997174281255052703257.\n\nTherefore,\nNature of Logarithms.\n\nTherefore, \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n} - 1} \\), or \\( M \\), is equal to\n\n\\[ 8673617398848054 = 0.434294819. \\]\n\nAs a second example, let it be required to find by the same formula the logarithm of the number \\( S \\), which is nearly equal to\n\n\\[ nM(\\sqrt[n]{S} - 1) = \\frac{n(\\sqrt[n]{S} - 1)}{n(\\sqrt[n]{S} - 1)}. \\]\n\n\\( n \\) being as before a very great number. Let us suppose also in this case that \\( n = 2^{60} \\); then after 62 extractions of the square root we have \\( \\sqrt[n]{S} \\) equal to\n\n\\[ 1.000000000000000 \\approx 95289426407458932. \\]\n\nTherefore, taking the value of \\( n\\sqrt[n]{S} \\) as found in last example, we have\n\n\\[ \\log_2 S = \\frac{n\\sqrt[n]{S} - 1}{n - 1} = \\frac{95289426407458932}{199717420812550527} = -471721154719602. \\]\n\nThis method of computing logarithms is evidently attended with great labour, on account of the number of extractions of roots which it requires, to obtain a result true to a moderate number of places of figures. But the two series, which we have given, serve to simplify and complete it. For, whatever be the number \\( y \\), it is only necessary to proceed with the extractions of the square root, till we have obtained for \\( n\\sqrt[n]{y} \\) a value which is unity followed by a decimal fraction; and then \\( n\\sqrt[n]{y} - 1 \\), being a fraction, its powers will also be fractions, which will be so much the smaller as their exponents are greater; thus a certain number of terms of the series will serve to express the logarithm to as many decimal places as may be required.\n\nThere are yet other analytical artifices by which the series\n\n\\[ \\log y = M \\left\\{ y - 1 + \\frac{1}{2}(y - 1)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}(y - 1)^3 + \\frac{1}{4}(y - 1)^4 + \\ldots \\right\\} \\]\n\nmay be transformed into others which shall always converge, and in particular the following.

In computing the logarithm\nLOGARITHMS.\n\nNature of logarithm of 3 the series would converge by the powers of the fraction \\( \\frac{3-1}{3+1} = \\frac{2}{4} \\), and in computing the logarithm of 5 it would converge by the powers of \\( \\frac{5-1}{5+1} = \\frac{4}{6} \\); but in each of these cases the series would converge slower, and of course the labour would be greater than in computing the logarithm of 2. And if the number whose logarithm was required was still more considerable; as for example 199, the series would converge so slow as to be useless.\n\nWe may however avoid this inconvenience by again transforming this last formula into another which shall express the logarithm of any number by means of a series, and a logarithm supposed to be previously known.\n\nTo effect this new transformation, let \\( \\frac{1+u}{1-u} = 1 + \\frac{x}{n} \\), then, by resolving this equation in respect of \\( u \\), we have\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{x}{2n+x}. \\]\n\nLet these values of \\( \\frac{1+u}{1-u} \\) and \\( u \\) be substituted in the formula,\n\n\\[ \\log_2 \\left( \\frac{1+u}{1-u} \\right) = 2M \\left( u + \\frac{u^3}{3} + \\frac{u^5}{5} + \\frac{u^7}{7} + \\ldots \\right) \\]\n\nand we have \\( \\log_2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{x}{n} \\right) \\) equal to\n\n\\[ 2M \\left\\{ \\frac{x}{2n+x} + \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{x}{2n+x} \\right)^3 + \\frac{1}{5} \\left( \\frac{x}{2n+x} \\right)^5 + \\ldots \\right\\} \\]\n\nbut \\( \\log_2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{x}{n} \\right) = \\log_2 \\left( n + \\frac{x}{n} \\right) - \\log_2 n \\)\n\ntherefore, by substituting this value of \\( \\log_2 \\left( n + \\frac{x}{n} \\right) \\), and transposing \\( \\log_2 n \\) to the other side of the equation, we have\n\n\\[ \\log_2 \\left( n + \\frac{x}{n} \\right) = \\log_2 n + 2M \\left\\{ \\frac{x}{2n+x} + \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{x}{2n+x} \\right)^3 + \\frac{1}{5} \\left( \\frac{x}{2n+x} \\right)^5 + \\ldots \\right\\} \\]\n\nBy the assistance of this formula, and the known properties of logarithms, we may proceed calculating the logarithm of one number from that of another as follows.\n\nTo find the Napierian logarithm of 3 from that of 2, which has been already found.

But the logarithm of 11 may be expressed by the logarithms of smaller numbers and a series which converges still more rapidly, by the following artifice, which will apply also to some other numbers. Because the numbers 98, 99, and 100 are the products of numbers, the greatest of which is 11, for \\( 98 = 2 \\times 7^2 \\), \\( 99 = 9 \\times 11 \\), and \\( 100 = 10 \\times 10 \\), it follows that if we have an equation composed of terms which are the logarithms of these three numbers, it may be resolved into another, the terms of which shall be the logarithms of the number 11 and other smaller numbers. Now by the preceding formula, if we put 99 for \\( n \\), we have\n\n\\[ 2 \\log. 99 - \\log. 98 - \\log. 100 = N. \\]\n\nthat is, substituting \\( \\log. 9 + \\log. 11 \\) for \\( \\log. 99 \\), \\( \\log. 2 + 2 \\log. 7 \\) for \\( \\log. 98 \\), and \\( 2 \\log. 10 \\) for \\( \\log. 100 \\),\n\n\\[ 2 \\log. 9 + 2 \\log. 11 - 2 \\log. 7 - 2 \\log. 10 = N, \\]\n\nand hence by transposition, &c.\n\n\\[ \\log. 11 = \\frac{2M}{199} + \\frac{2M}{3.199^3} + \\ldots \\]\n\nand in this equation,\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{2M}{199} + \\frac{2M}{3.199^3} + \\ldots \\]\n\nThe first term alone of this series is sufficient to give the logarithm of 11 true to 14 places.\n\nAnother formula, by which the logarithm of a number is expressed by the logarithms of other numbers and a series, may be found as follows.\n\nResuming the formula\n\n\\[ \\log. x = 2M \\left\\{ \\frac{x-1}{x+1} + \\frac{1}{(x+1)^3} + \\frac{1}{(x+1)^5} + \\ldots \\right\\} \\]\n\nLet us assume\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{(n-1)^2(n+2)}{(n-2)(n+1)^2} = \\frac{n^3 - 3n^2 + 2n}{n^3 - 3n^2} \\]\n\nthen\n\n\\[ \\frac{x-1}{x+1} = \\frac{2}{n^3 - 3n^2} \\]\n\nLet these values of \\( x \\), &c., \\( \\frac{x-1}{x+1} \\) be substituted in the formula, and it becomes\n\n\\[ \\log. \\frac{(n-1)^2(n+2)}{(n-2)(n+1)^2} = 2M \\left\\{ \\frac{2}{n^3 - 3n^2} + \\frac{1}{(n^3 - 3n^2)^3} + \\ldots \\right\\} \\]\n\nBut the quantity on the left-hand side of this equation is manifestly equal to \\( 2 \\log.

We may also employ it in the calculation of logarithms, as in the following example. Let the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, be substituted successively in the formula; then, observing that \\( \\log. 6 = \\log. 2 + \\log. 3 \\), and \\( \\log. 8 = 3 \\log. 2 \\), we have these four equations.\n\n\\[ \\log. 7 + 2 \\log. 2 - 3 \\log. 3 = \\frac{2M}{55} + \\frac{2M}{3.55^3} + \\ldots \\]\n\\[ -2 \\log. 7 + \\log. 2 + 2 \\log. 5 = \\frac{2M}{99} + \\frac{2M}{3.99^3} + \\ldots \\]\n\\[ 4 \\log. 3 - 4 \\log. 2 - \\log. 5 = \\frac{2M}{161} + \\frac{2M}{3.161^3} + \\ldots \\]\n\\[ \\log. 5 - 5 \\log. 3 + 2 \\log. 7 = \\frac{2M}{244} + \\frac{2M}{3.244^3} + \\ldots \\]\n\nLet \\( \\log. 2, \\log. 3, \\log. 5 \\) and \\( \\log. 7 \\) be now considered as four unknown quantities, and by resolving these equations in the usual manner, (see ALGEBRA, Sect.

Let C be the centre, and CH, CK the asymptotes of an hyperbola. In either of these let there be taken any number of continual proportionals CA, CB, CD, CE, &c., then if Bb, Dd, Ee, &c. be drawn parallel to the other asymptote, meeting the curve in a, b, d, e, &c., the hyperbolic spaces AabB, BbdD, DdeE, &c., are equal to one another; also if straight lines be drawn from C to the points a, b, d, e, &c., the hyperbolic sectors aCb, bCd, deE, &c., shall also be equal (Conic Sections Part III. prop. 30.) Now, since it appears by this proposition that the segments CA, CB, CD, CE, &c. of the asymptote being taken in continued geometrical progression, the corresponding hyperbolic areas AabB, AadD, AaeE, &c., constitute a series of quantities in continued arithmetical progression, it is evident that the two series will have, in respect to each other, the same properties as numbers and their logarithms; so that, if we assume CA any segment of the asymptote as the representative of unity, and suppose CB, CD, CE, &c. to be the representatives of other numbers, the hyperbolic areas AabB, AadD, AaeE will be the geometrical representatives of the logarithms of these numbers; and so also will the hyperbolic sectors Cb, Cd, Ce, &c.\n\nLet CA (the line denoting unity) be the side of a rhombus CAaL inscribed at the vertex of the hyperbola, and let CP=nCA (n being put for any number); draw Pp parallel to CL meeting the hyperbola in p, then it may be shewn, by the methods usually employed in reasoning about curvilinear areas, that the area of the rhombus CAaL is to the hyperbolic area AapP as 1 to the Napierian logarithm of the number \\(n\\). Therefore if the hyperbola be equilateral, so that CAaL is a square, &c. consequently its area=1×1=1, the Napierian logarithm of \\(n\\), and the area AapP may be taken as the mutual representatives of each other. It is this circumstance which induced mathematicians to call these logarithms hyperbolic. But with equal propriety might the logarithms of any other system be called hyperbolic, as they may be equally expressed by the area of the equilateral hyperbola, or indeed by the area of any hyperbola whatever, (see Fluxions § 152. Ex. 5.)\n\nSect. II.\n\nDESCRIPTION AND USE OF THE TABLE.\n\nThe common system of logarithms is so constructed, that, 0 being the logarithm of unity, or 1, the logarithm of 10 is 1; by which it happens that the logarithm of 100 is 2, that of 1000 is 3, and so on. Also, the logarithm of \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\), or .1, is —1, that is, 1 considered as subtractive; or, in the language of algebra, minus one; and the logarithm of \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\) or .01, is —2; and the logarithm of .001 is —3, and so on, as in the following short table.\n\n| Numbers | Logarithms |\n|---------|------------|\n| .001    | —3         |\n| .00     | —2         |\n| .0       | —1         |\n| 1       | 0          |\n| 10      | 1          |\n| 100     | 2          |\n| 1000    | 3          |\n| &c.     | &c.        |\n\nAs the terms of the geometrical progression 1, 10, 100, &c. continued backwards as well as forward, are the only numbers whose logarithms are integers; the logarithms of all other numbers whatever must be either fractions, or mixt numbers. Accordingly, the logarithms of all numbers, whether integer or mixt, between 1 and 10 are expressed by decimal fractions less than\nLOGARITHMS.\n\nDescription than unity. The logarithms of numbers between 10 and 100 are expressed by mixt numbers composed of unity and a decimal fraction. The logarithms of numbers between 100 and 1000 are expressed by mixt numbers composed of the number 2 and a decimal fraction, and so on. On the other hand, the logarithm of any vulgar or decimal fraction less than 1, but greater than \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) or .1, will be some negative decimal fraction between 0 and -1; and the logarithm of any fraction between .1 and .01, will be a negative mixed quantity between -1 and -2, and so on.\n\nBut it must be remarked, that any fraction, or mixt number, considered as entirely negative, may always be transformed into another mixt number of equal value, that shall have its integer part negative, but its fractional part positive, by diminishing the integer by unity, and increasing the fractional part by the same quantity. Thus let the mixt quantity be \\( -\\frac{2}{3} \\), which may be also written thus \\( -2-\\frac{1}{3} \\). Let the integer -2 be diminished by 1, and the result is \\( -2-1=-3 \\).\n\nAlso, let the fraction \\( -\\frac{1}{3} \\) be increased by 1, and it becomes \\( -\\frac{1}{3}+1=\\frac{2}{3} \\); therefore the fraction \\( -\\frac{2}{3} \\), when transformed, is \\( -3+\\frac{7}{3} \\), or \\( -3+\\frac{7}{3} \\), which may be written thus, \\( 3.7 \\); where the negative sign is placed over the integer to indicate that it is the only part of the expression that is considered as negative, the other part, viz., .7, being reckoned positive.\n\nSince therefore any fractional or mixt quantity, considered as entirely negative, is equivalent to another mixt quantity, the integer part of which only is negative, but the fractional part positive, it is evident that instead of expressing the logarithms of fractions by numbers considered as entirely negative, we may express them by numbers having their integer parts negative, and their decimal parts positive; and it is usual to express them. Thus the logarithm of .93, instead of being expressed by \\( -1.5288 \\), that is, by \\( -1.5288 \\), is usually expressed by 2.4712, by which is to be understood \\( -2+\\frac{47}{12} \\). Again, the logarithm of .7, which, if considered as entirely negative, would be \\( -1.5490 \\), is otherwise 1.84510.\n\nAs the logarithms of any series of numbers forming a geometrical progression, the common ratio of which is 10, will exceed each other by the logarithm of 10, that is, by 1, it follows that the logarithms of all numbers denoted by the same figures, and differing only in the position of the decimal point, will have the decimal part of their logarithms the same; but the integers standing before the decimals will be different, and will be positive or negative, according as the numbers are whole or fractional, as in these examples.\n\n| Numbers | Logarithms |\n|---------|------------|\n| 69150   | 4.83980    |\n| 6915    | 3.83980    |\n| 691.5   | 2.83980    |\n| 69.15   | 1.83980    |\n| 6.915   | 0.83980    |\n| .6915   | 1.83980    |\n| .06915  | 2.83980    |\n\nThe integer figure of a logarithm, is called its index or characteristic; and it is always less by one than the number of integer figures which the natural number consists of; or it is equal to the distance of the first figure from the place of units or first place of integers, whether on the left or on the right of it.\n\nThe table of logarithms given at the end of this article, contains the decimal parts of the logarithms of all numbers from 1 to 10,000; and indeed of all numbers which can be expressed by four figures, preceded or followed by any numbers of cyphers, such as the numbers 367500, .002795, &c. The index, however, is not put down; but it is easily supplied by the rule which has just now been given. The table also contains the differences of the logarithms of all numbers from 1000 to 10,000, by means of which the logarithm of any number consisting of five figures may be easily obtained.\n\n1. To find the logarithm of any number consisting of four or any smaller number of figures. Look for the number in the columns titled at the top Numbers; and in the same line with it, on the right, in the column of logarithms, will be found the decimal part of its logarithm, to which supply the decimal point, and its index according to rule delivered above. Thus,\n\n| Numbers | Logarithms |\n|---------|------------|\n| 9       | 0.95424    |\n| 17      | 1.23045    |\n| 2.63    | 0.41996    |\n| 13.42   | 1.12775    |\n| 6280    | 3.79796    |\n| 3749    | 3.57392    |\n| .6027   | 1.78010    |\n| .00234  | 3.36922    |\n| 852000  | 5.93975    |\n\n2. To find the logarithm of a number consisting of five figures.\n\nFind the decimal part of the logarithm of the first four figures of the number, (that is, find the logarithm of the proposed number as if the last figure were a cypher), by the preceding rule, and find the difference between that logarithm and the next greater, as given in the column of differences (to the right of the column of logarithms). Then state this proportion:\n\n\\[ 10 : 23 :: 7 : \\frac{7 \\times 23}{10} = 16.1 \\]\n\nThe fourth proportional is 16.1, or, rejecting the decimal part, .16 nearly; therefore,\n\n\\[ \\text{to log. of } 1684 \\quad \\text{add } \\frac{27045}{16} \\]\n\nthe log. of 168.47 is 2.27061\n\n3. To\n3. To find the logarithm of a vulgar fraction or mixt number.\n\nEither reduce the vulgar fraction to a decimal, and find its logarithm as above, or else (having reduced the mixt number to an improper fraction) subtract the logarithm of the denominator from the logarithm of the numerator, and the remainder will be the logarithm of the fraction sought.\n\nEx. 1. To find the logarithm of \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\).\n\nFrom the log. of 3 \\( 0.47712 \\)\nSubtract the log. of 16 \\( 1.20412 \\)\n\nRem. log. of \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\) or of .1875 \\( 1.27300 \\)\n\nHere, as the lower number is greater than the upper, the remainder must be negative; the subtraction, however, is so performed, that the decimal part of the remainder is positive, and the integer negative.\n\nEx. 2. To find the logarithm of \\( 13\\frac{1}{4} \\) or \\( \\frac{53}{4} \\).\n\nFrom log. of 55 \\( 1.74036 \\)\nSubtract log. of 4 \\( 0.60206 \\)\n\nRem. log. of \\( 13\\frac{1}{4} \\) or of 13.75 \\( 1.13830 \\)\n\n4. To find the number corresponding to any given logarithm.\n\nSeek the decimal part of the proposed logarithm in the column of logarithms, and if it be found exactly, the figures of the number corresponding to it will be found in the same line with it in the column of numbers. If the index of the given logarithm is 3, the four figures of the numbers thus found are integers; but if it be 2, the three first figures are integers, and the fourth is a decimal, and so on; the number of integer figures before the decimal point being always one greater than the index, if it be positive; but if it be negative, the number sought will be a decimal, and the number of cyphers between the decimal point and first significant figure will be one less than the index.—Examples. The number corresponding to the logarithm 3.57392 is 3749. The number corresponding to 1.12775 is 13.42. The number corresponding to 3.56922 is .00234, and so on.\n\nBut if the given logarithm is not exactly found in the table, subtract the next less tabular logarithm from it, and take the difference between that logarithm, and the next greater (as given in the column of differences). Then state this proportion:\n\nAs the difference, taken from the table,\nIs to 10,\nSo is the difference between the given logarithm and the next less,\nTo a fourth proportional,\n\nwhich being annexed to the four figures corresponding to the logarithm next less than the given one, will be the logarithm required.\n\nExample. Find the number answering to the logarithm 4.13278.\n\nThe dec. part of given log. is \\( 1.3278 \\)\nThat of next less, viz. log. of 1357, is \\( 1.3258 \\)\n\nDifference \\( 20 \\)\n\nThe tabular difference is 32, therefore we have this proportion,\n\n\\[ 32 : 10 :: 20 : \\frac{20 \\times 10}{32} = 6 \\text{ nearly.} \\]\n\nTherefore the number corresponding to the proposed logarithm is .13576.\n\nIn like manner may the numbers to the following logarithms be found.\n\n| Logarithms | Numbers |\n|------------|---------|\n| 1.23457   | 17.162  |\n| 3.73435   | 5423.8  |\n| 1.09214   | 12303   |\n| 4.61230   | 40954   |\n\nThe table of logarithms of numbers is followed by a Table of logarithmic Sines and Tangents, for every minute of the quadrants, with their differences. For the explanation of this table we refer to Trigonometry, to which branch of mathematics it is intended to be applied.\n\nWe shall now give practical rules, illustrated by examples, for performing the different operations of arithmetic by logarithms.\n\nMULTIPLICATION BY LOGARITHMS.\n\nRULE.\n\nTake out the logarithms of the factors from the table; then add them together, and their sum will be the logarithm of the product required. Then find, by inspection of the table, the natural number answering to their sum, and it will be the product required.\n\nObserving to add what is to be carried from the decimal part of the logarithm to the positive index or indices, or else subtract it from the negative.\n\nAlso adding the indices together when they are of the same kind, that is, both positive or both negative; but subtracting the less from the greater when the one is positive and the other negative, and prefixing the sign of the greater to the remainder.\n\nEXAMPLES.\n\nEx. 1.

By the arithmetical complement is meant the logarithm of the reciprocal of the given number, or the remainder by taking the given logarithm from 0, or from 10, changing the beginning of the scale from 0 to 10; the easiest way of doing which is to begin at the left hand, and subtract each figure from 9, except the last significant figure on the right hand, which must be subtracted from 10. But when the index is negative, it must be added to 9, and the rest subtracted as before; and for every complement that is added subtract 10 from the last sum of the indices.\n\nEXAMPLES.\n\nEx. 1.

But what is to be carried from the decimal part of the logarithm will always be positive. And therefore the difference will be the index of the product, and is always to be made of the same kind with the greater.\n\nEXAMPLES.\n\nEx. 1. To square the number 2.579.\n\nNumber.

extended, be taken AC, CE, EG, GI, IL, on the left hand; and also AG, GP, &c. on the right, all equal to one another; and if at the points P, G, A, C, E, G, I, L, be erected to the right line AN, the perpendiculars PS, GD, AB, CD, EF, GH, IK, LM, which let be continually proportional, and represent numbers, viz. AB, 1; CD, 10; EF, 100, &c. then shall we have two progressions of lines, arithmetical and geometrical: for the lines AC, AE, AG, &c. are in arithmetical progression, or as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. and so represent the logarithms to which the geometrical lines AB, CD, EF, &c. do correspond.\n\nFor since AG is triple of the first line AC, the number GH shall be in the third place from unity, if CD be in the first: so likewise shall LM be in the fifth place, since AL = 5 AC. If the extremities of the proportions S, d, B, D, F, &c. be joined by right lines, the figures SBML will become a polygon, consisting of more or less sides, according as there are more or less terms in the progression.\n\nIf the parts AC, CE, EG, &c. be bisected in the points c, e, g, i, l, and there be again raised the perpendiculars, cd, ef, gh, ik, lm, which are mean proportionals between AB, CD, CD, EF, &c. then there will arise a new series of proportionals whose terms, beginning from that which immediately follows unity, are double of those in the first series, and the difference of the terms is become less, and approaches nearer to a ratio of equality than before. Likewise, in this new series, the right lines AL, Ac, express the distances of the terms LM cd, from unity, viz. since AL is ten times greater than Ac, LM shall be the tenth term of the series from unity; and because Ac is three times greater than Ac, ef will be the third term of the series if cd be the first, and there shall be two mean proportionals between AB and ef, and between AB and LM there will be nine mean proportionals. And if the extremities of the lines Bd, Df, Fh, &c. be joined by right lines, there will be a new polygon made, consisting of more but shorter sides than the last.\n\nIf, in this manner, mean proportionals be continually placed between every two terms, the number of terms at last will be made so great, as also the number of the sides of the polygon, as to be greater than any given number, or to be infinite; and every side of the polygon so lessened, as to become less than any given right line; and consequently the polygon will be changed into a curve-lined figure; for any curve-lined figure may be conceived as a polygon, whose sides are infinitely\nLogarithmic Lines.\n\nIt is manifest from this description of the logarithmic curve, that all numbers at equal distances are continually proportional. It is also plain, that if there be four numbers, \\(AB\\), \\(CD\\), \\(IK\\), \\(LM\\), such that the distance between the first and second be equal to the distance between the third and the fourth, let the distance from the second to the third be what it will, these numbers will be proportional. For because the distances \\(AC\\), \\(IL\\), are equal, \\(AB\\) shall be to the increment \\(Dx\\), as \\(IK\\) is to the increment \\(MT\\). Wherefore, by composition, \\(AB : DC :: IK : ML\\). And, contrariwise, if four numbers be proportional, the distance between the first and second shall be equal to the distance between the third and fourth.\n\nThe distance between any two numbers is called the logarithm of the ratio of those numbers; and, indeed, doth not measure the ratio itself, but the number of terms in a given series of geometrical proportions, proceeding from one number to another, and defines the number of equal ratios by the composition whereof the ratios of number is known.\n\nLogarithmic Lines. For many mechanical purposes it is convenient to have the logarithms of numbers laid down on scales, as well as the logarithmic lines and tangents; by which means computations may be carried on by mere mensuration with compasses. Lines of this kind are always put on the common Gunter's scale; but as these instruments must be extended to a very great length, in order to contain any considerable quantity of numbers, it becomes an object of importance to shorten them. Such an improvement has been made by Mr William Nicholson, and published in the 77th volume of the Philosophical Transactions. The principles on which the construction of his instruments depends are as follow:\n\n1. If two geometrical series of numbers, having the same common ratio, be placed in order with the terms opposite to each other, the ratio between any term in one series and its opposite in the other will be constant:\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2 & \\quad 6 & 18 & 54 & 162, & \\text{&c.} \\\\\n3 & \\quad 9 & 27 & 81 & 243, & \\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2 & \\quad 3 & 6 & 9 & 18 & 27 & 54 & 81 & 162 & 243, & \\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhere it is evident, that each of the terms in the upper series is exactly two-thirds of the corresponding one in the lower.\n\n2. The ratio of any two terms in one series will be the same with that between those which have an equal distance in the other.\n\n3. In all such geometrical series as have the same ratio, the property above mentioned takes place, though we compare the terms of any series with those of another: Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2 & \\quad 4 & 8 & 16 & 32 & 64, & \\text{&c.} \\\\\n3 & \\quad 6 & 12 & 24 & 48 & 96, & \\text{&c.} \\\\\n4 & \\quad 8 & 16 & 32 & 64 & 128, & \\text{&c.} \\\\\n5 & \\quad 10 & 20 & 40 & 80 & 160, & \\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhere it is plain that \\(2, 4, 3, 6\\); also \\(2, 4, 4, 8\\), and \\(2, 4, 5, 10, &c.\\) have the same ratio with that of each series.\n\n4. If the differences of the logarithms of the numbers be laid in order upon equidistant parallel right lines, in such a manner that a right line drawn across the whole shall intersect it at divisions denoting numbers in geometrical progression; then, from the condition of the arrangement, and the property of this logarithmic line, it follows, 1st, That every right line so drawn will, by its intersections, indicate a geometrical series of numbers; 2dly, That such series as are indicated by these right lines will have the same common ratio; and, 3dly, That the series thus indicated by two parallel right lines, supposed to move laterally, without changing either their mutual distance or parallelism to themselves, will have each the same ratio and in all series indicated by such two lines, the ratio between an antecedent and consequent; the former taken upon one line, and the latter upon another, will be also the same.\n\nThe 1st of these propositions is proved in the following manner. Let the lines \\(AB\\), \\(CD\\), \\(EF\\), represent parts of the logarithmic line arranged according to the proportion already mentioned; and let \\(GH\\) be a right line passing through the points \\(e, c, a\\), denoting numbers in geometrical progression; then will any other line \\(IK\\), drawn across the arrangement, likewise pass through three points \\(f, d, b\\), in geometrical progression. From one of the points of intersection \\(f\\) in the last-mentioned line \\(IK\\), draw the line \\(fg\\) parallel to \\(GH\\), and intersecting the arrangement in the points \\(i, h\\); and the ratios of the numbers \\(e, f, c, i, h\\) will be equal, as well as of \\(a, b\\); because the intervals on the logarithmic line, or differences of the logarithms of those numbers, are equal. Again, The point \\(f\\), the line \\(id\\), and the line \\(hb\\), are in arithmetical progression denoting the differences between the logarithms of the numbers themselves; whence the quotients of the numbers are in geometrical progression.\n\nThe 2d proposition is proved in a similar manner. For as it was shown that the line \\(fg\\), parallel to \\(GH\\), passes through points of division denoting numbers in the same continued ratio as those indicated by the line \\(GH\\); it may also be shown, that the line \\(LM\\) parallel to any other line \\(IK\\), will pass through a series of points denoting numbers which have the same continued ratio with those indicated by the line \\(IK\\), to which it is parallel.\n\nThe 3d proposition arises from the parallelism of the lines to their former situation; by which means they indicate numbers in a geometrical series, having the same common ratio as before: their distance on the logarithmic line also remains unchanged; whence the differences between the logarithms of the opposite numbers, and of consequence their ratios, will always be constant.\n\n5. Supposing now an antecedent and consequent to be given in any geometrical series, it will always be possible to find them, provided the line be of unlimited length. Drawing two parallel lines, then, through each of the numbers, and supposing the lines to move without changing their direction or parallel situation, they will continually describe new antecedents and consequents in the same geometrical series as before.\n\n6. Though the logarithmic line contain no greater range of numbers than from 1 to 10, it will not be found necessary for the purpose of computation to repeat it. The only thing requisite is to have a slider or beam with two fixed points at the distance of the interval between 1 and 10, and a moveable point made to range betwixt them always to indicate the antecedent; then, if the consequent fixed point fall within\nLogarithmic Lines.\n\nOut the rule, the other fixed point will always denote the division on which it would have fallen had the rule been prolonged; and this contrivance may easily be adapted to any arrangement of parallel lines whatever. The arrangement of right lines, however, ought always to be disposed in such a manner as to occupy a right-angled parallelogram, or the cross line already mentioned ought always to be at right angles to the length of the ruler.\n\nFig. 7. is a ruler consisting of ten parallel lines.—Fig. 8. a beam-compas for measuring the intervals. B, A, C, are the parts which apply to the surface of the ruler; the middle one, A, being moveable sidewise in a groove in the piece DE, so as always to preserve its parallelism to the external pieces DC, which are fixed at a distance equal to the length of the ruler, and have their edges placed in such a manner as to form with the parallel lines which they intersect a ratio, which by composition is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\); which in the present case requires them to be at right angles to the length. The piece DE is applied to the edge FG of the ruler. The edges or borders H, I, K, L, are more conveniently made of transparent horn, or tortoise-shell, than of any opaque matter.\n\nIn using this ruler, apply the edge of either B or C to the consequent, and slide the piece A to the antecedent; observing the difference between the numbers on the pieces denoting the lines they are found on: then, applying the same edge of A to any other antecedent, the other piece B or C will intersect a consequent in the same ratio upon that line, having the same situation with regard to the antecedent that the line of the former consequent had to its antecedent. But if B be the consequent piece, and fall without the ruler, the piece C will show the consequent one line lower; or if C, in like manner, fall without the ruler, then B will show the consequent one line higher.\n\n\"It might be convenient (says Mr Nicholson) for the purpose of computation, to make instruments of this kind with one hundred or more lines; but in the present instrument, the numbers on the pieces will answer the same purpose; for if a consequent fall upon a line at any given number of intervals without the ruler, it will be found on that line of the arrangement which occupies the same number of intervals reckoned inwards from the opposite edge of the ruler.\"\n\nFig. 9. is an instrument on the plan of a Gunter's scale of 28½ inches long, invented by Mr Robertson. There is a moveable piece AB in the slider GH, across which is drawn a fine line; the slider having also lines CD, EF, drawn across it at distances from each other equal to the length of the ruler AB. In using the instrument, the line CD or EF is to be placed at the consequent, and the line in AB at the antecedent: then, if the piece AB be placed at any other antecedent, the same line CD or EF will indicate its consequent in the same ratio taken the same way: that is, if the antecedent and consequent lie on the same side of the slider, all other antecedents and consequents in that ratio will be in the same manner; and the contrary if they do not. But if the consequent line fall without the rule, the other fixed line on the slider will show the consequent, but on the contrary side of the slider to that where it would else have been seen by means of the first consequent line.\n\nFig. 10. is a circular instrument equivalent to the former; consisting of three concentric circles engraved and graduated upon a plate of an inch and a half diameter. Two legs A and B proceed from the centre, having right-lined edges in the direction of radii; and are moveable either singly or together. In using the instrument, place one of the edges at the antecedent and the other at the consequent, and fix them at the angle. Move the two legs together; and having placed the antecedent leg at any other number, the other will give the consequent one in the like position on the lines. If the line CD happen to lie between the legs, and B be the consequent leg, the number sought will be found one line farther from the centre than it would otherwise have been; and on the contrary, it will be found one line nearer in the like case, if A be the consequent leg. \"This instrument (says Mr Nicholson), differing from that represented fig. 7, only in its circular form, and the advantages resulting from that form, the lines must be taken to succeed each other in the same manner laterally; so that numbers which fall either within or without the arrangement of circles, will be found on such lines of the arrangement as would have occupied the vacant places if the succession of lines had been indefinitely repeated sidewise.\n\n\"I approve of this construction as superior to every other which has yet occurred to me, not only in point of convenience, but likewise in the probability of being better executed; because small arcs may be graduated with very great accuracy, by divisions transferred from a larger original. The instrument, fig. 7, may be contained conveniently in a circle of about four inches and a half diameter.\n\n\"The circular instrument is a combination of the Gunter's line and the sector, with the improvements here pointed out. The property of the sector may be useful in magnifying the differences of the logarithms in the upper parts of the line of sines, the middle of the tangents, and the beginning of the versed sines. It is even possible, as mathematicians will easily conceive, to draw spirals, on which graduations of parts, everywhere equal to each other, will show the ratios of those lines by moveable radii, similar to those in this instrument.\"\n\nLOGIC.\n\nLogic is the art of thinking and reasoning justly; or, it may be defined the science or history of the human mind, inasmuch as it traces the progress of our knowledge from our first and most simple conceptions through all their different combinations, and all those numerous deductions that result from variously comparing them one with another.\n\nThe precise business of logic therefore is, To explain the nature of the human mind, and the proper manner of conducting its several powers, in order to the attainment\nPart I.\n\nLOGIC.\n\nment of truth and knowledge. It lays open those errors\nPerception, and mistakes we are apt, through inattention, to run\ninto; and teaches us how to distinguish between truth,\nand what only carries the appearance of it. By these\nmeans we grow acquainted with the nature and force\nof the understanding; see what things lie within its\nreach; where we may attain certainty and demonstra-\ntion; and when we must be contented with probability.\n\nThis science is generally divided into four parts,\nviz. Perception, Judgement, Reasoning, and Method.\nThis division comprehends the whole history of the\nsensations and operations of the human mind.\n\nPART I. OF PERCEPTION.\n\nWE find ourselves surrounded with a variety of ob-\njects, which acting differently upon our senses, con-\nvey distinct impressions into the mind, and thereby\nrouse the attention and notice of the understanding.\nBy reflecting too on what passes within us, we become\nconscious of the operations of our own minds, and at-\ntend to them as a new set of impressions. But in all\nthis there is only bare consciousness. The mind, with-\nout proceeding any farther, takes notice of the im-\npressions that are made upon it, and views things in\norder, as they present themselves one after another.\nThis attention of the understanding to the object act-\ning upon it, whereby it becomes sensible of the im-\npressions they make, is called by logicians perception;\nand the notices themselves, as they exist in the mind,\nare there treasured up to be the materials of think-\ning and knowledge, are distinguished by the name of\nideas. In the article Metaphysics it shall be shown\nat large, how the mind, being furnished with ideas,\ncontrives to diversify and enlarge its stock: we have\nhere chiefly to consider the means of making known our\nthoughts to others; that we may not only understand\nhow knowledge is acquired, but also in what manner\nit may be communicated with the greatest certainty and\nadvantage.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Words, considered as the signs of our Ideas.\n\nI. Our ideas, though manifold and various, are ne-\nvertheless all within our own breasts, invisible to oth-\ners, nor can of themselves be made appear. But\nGod, designing us for society, and to have fellowship\nwith those of our kind, has provided us with organs\nfitted to frame articulate sounds, and given us also a\ncapacity of using those sounds as signs of internal con-\nceptions. Hence spring words and language: for,\nhaving once pitched upon any sound to stand as the\nmark of an idea in the mind, custom by degrees estab-\nlishes such a connexion between them, that the ap-\npearance of the idea in the understanding always brings\nto our remembrance the sound or name by which it\nis expressed; as in like manner the hearing of the\nsound never fails to excite the idea for which it is made\nto stand. And thus it is easy to conceive how a man\nmay record his own thoughts, and bring them again\ninto view in any succeeding period of life. For this\nconnexion being once settled, as the same sounds will\nalways serve to excite the same ideas; if he can but\ncontrive to register his words in the order and dispo-\nsition in which the present train of his thoughts pre-\nsent themselves to his imagination, it is evident he will\nbe able to recall these thoughts at pleasure, and that too\nin the very manner of their first appearance. Ac-\ncordingly we find, that the inventions of writing and\nprinting, by enabling us to fix and perpetuate such\nperishable things as sounds, have also furnished us with\nthe means of giving a kind of permanency to the\ntransactions of the mind, insomuch that they may be\nin the same manner subjected to our review as any other\nobjects of nature.\n\nII. But besides the ability of recording our own\nthoughts, there is this farther advantage in the use of mutual\nexternal signs, that they enable us to communicate com-\nmunication of our thoughts to others, and also to receive information and knowledge\nof what passes in their breasts. For any number of men, from one\nhaving agreed to establish the same sounds as signs of man to ano-\nthe same ideas, it is apparent that the repetition of other\nthese sounds must excite the like perceptions in each,\nand create a perfect correspondence of thoughts.\nWhen, for instance, any train of ideas succeed one\nanother in my mind, if the names by which I am\nwont to express them have been annexed by those\nwith whom I converse to the very same set of ideas,\nnothing is more evident, than that, by repeating those\nnames according to the tenor of my present concep-\ntions, I shall raise in their minds the same course of\nthought as has taken possession of my own. For by\nbarely attending to what passes within themselves\nupon hearing the sounds which I repeat, they will al-\nso become acquainted with the ideas in my under-\nstanding, and have them in a manner laid before their\nview. So that we here clearly perceive how a man\nmay communicate his sentiments, knowledge, and dis-\ncoveries to others, if the language in which he con-\nverses be extensive enough to mark all the ideas and\ntransactions of his mind. But as this is not always\nthe case, and men are often obliged to invent terms\nof their own to express new views and concep-\ntions of things; it may be asked, how in these cir-\ncumstances we can become acquainted with the thoughts\nof another, when he makes use of words, to which\nwe have never annexed any ideas, and that of course\ncan raise no perceptions in our minds? In order to un-\nveil this mystery, and give some little insight into the\nfoundation, growth, and improvement of language,\nthe following observations will be found of consider-\nable moment.\n\nIII. First, That no word can be to any man the sim-\nplest sign of an idea, till that idea comes to have a real ex-\nistence in his mind. For names, being only so far in-\ntelligible as they denote known internal concep-\ntions, mind by where they have none such to answer them, there words, or\nthey are plainly sounds without signification, and of a descrip-\ncourse convey no instruction or knowledge. But no-\nfoonner are the ideas to which they belong raised in the\nunderstanding, than, finding it easy to connect them\nwith the established names, we can join in any agree-\nment of this kind made by others, and thereby enjoy the\nbenefit of their discoveries. The first thing therefore to be considered is, how these ideas may be conveyed into the mind; that being there, we may learn to connect them with their appropriated sounds, and so become capable of understanding others when they make use of these sounds in laying open and communicating their thoughts. Now, to comprehend this distinctly, it will be necessary to attend to the division of our ideas into simple and complex, (see Metaphysics.) And first, as for our simple ideas; they can find no admission into the mind, but by the two original fountains of knowledge, sensation and reflection. If therefore any of these have as yet no being in the understanding, it is impossible by words or a description to excite them there. A man who had never felt the sensation of heat, could not be brought to comprehend that sensation by any thing we might say to explain it. If we would really produce the idea in him, it must be by applying the proper object to his senses, and bringing him within the influence of a hot body. When this is done, and experience has taught him the perception to which men have annexed the name heat, it then becomes to him the sign of that idea, and he thenceforth understands the meaning of the term, which, before, all the words in this world would not have been sufficient to convey into his mind. The case is the same in respect of light and colours. A man born blind, and thereby deprived of the only conveyance for the ideas of this class, can never be brought to understand the names by which they are expressed. The reason is plain: they stand for ideas that have no existence in his mind; and as the organ appropriated to their reception is wanting, all other contrivances are vain, nor can they by any force or description be raised in his imagination. But it is quite otherwise in our complex notions. For these being no more than certain combinations of simple ideas, put together in various forms; if the original ideas out of which the collections are made have already got admission into the understanding, and the names serving to express them are known; it will be easy, by enumerating the several ideas concerned in the composition, and marking the order and manner in which they are united, to raise any complex conception in the mind. Thus the idea answering to the word rainbow may be readily excited in the imagination of another who has never seen the appearance itself, by barely describing the figure, largeness, position, and order of colours; if we suppose these several simple ideas, with their names, sufficiently known to him.\n\nIV. And this leads to a second observation upon this subject, namely, That words standing for complex ideas are all definable, but those by which we denote simple ideas are not; for simple ideas being secondary perceptions, which have no other entrance into the mind than by sensation or reflection, can only be got by experience, from the several objects of nature, proper to produce those perceptions in us. Words indeed may very well serve to remind us of them, if they have already found admission into the understanding, and their connexion with the established names is known; but they can never give them their original being and existence there. And hence it is, that when any one asks the meaning of a word denoting a simple idea, we pretend not to explain it to him by a definition, well knowing that to be impossible; but, supposing him already acquainted with the idea, and only ignorant of the name by which it is called, we either mention it to him by some other name with which we presume he knows its connexion, or appeal to the object where the idea itself is found. Thus, were any one to ask the meaning of the word white, we should tell him it stood for the same idea as albus in Latin, or blanc in French; or, if we thought him a stranger to these languages, we might appeal to an object producing the idea, by saying it denoted the colour we observe in snow or milk. But this is by no means a definition of the word, exciting a new idea in his understanding; but merely a contrivance to remind him of a known idea, and teach him its connexion with the established name. For if the ideas after which he inquires have never yet been raised in his mind; as suppose one who had seen no other colours than black and white, should ask the meaning of the word scarlet; it is easy to perceive, that it would be no more possible to make him comprehend it by words, or a definition, than to introduce the same perception into the imagination of a man born blind. The only method in this case is, to present some object, by looking at which the perception itself may be excited; and thus he will learn both the name and the idea together.\n\nV. But how comes it to pass that men agree in the experience of their simple ideas, seeing they cannot view and observe the perceptions in one another's minds, nor make known their perceptions by words to others? The effect is produced by experience and observation. Thus finding, for instance, that the name of heat is annexed to names of that sensation which men feel when they approach the fire, I make it also the sign of the sensation excited in me by such an approach, nor have any doubt but it denotes the same perception in my mind as in theirs. For we are naturally led to imagine, that the same objects operate alike upon the organs of the human body, and produce an uniformity of sensations. No man fancies, that the idea raised in him by the taste of sugar, and which he calls sweetness, differs from that excited in another by the like means; or that wormwood, to whose relish he has given the epithet bitter, produces in another the sensation which he denotes by the word sweet. Presuming therefore upon this conformity of perceptions, when they arise from the same objects, we easily agree as to the names of our simple ideas; and if at any time, by a more narrow scrutiny into things, new ideas of this class come in our way, which we choose to express by terms of our own invention; these names are explained, not by a definition, but by referring to the objects whence the ideas themselves may be obtained.\n\nVI. Being in this manner furnished with simple ideas, and the names by which they are expressed; the conveyance of meaning of terms that stand for complex ideas is easily got, because the ideas themselves answering to these terms may be conveyed into the mind by definitions, a combination of simple ideas. When therefore these terms are enumerated, and the manner in which they are united into one conception explained, nothing more is wanting to raise that conception in the understanding; and thus the term denoting it comes of course to be understood. And here it is worth while to reflect\nPart I.\n\nLOGIC.\n\nOf a little upon the wise contrivance of nature, in thus furnishing us with the very aptest means of communicating our thoughts. For were it not so ordered, that we could thus convey our complex ideas from one to another by definitions, it would in many cases be impossible to make them known at all. This is apparent in those ideas which are the proper work of the mind. For as they exist only in the understanding, and have no real objects in nature in conformity to which they are framed; if we could not make them known by description, they must lie forever hid within our own breasts, and be confined to the narrow acquaintance of a single mind. All the fine scenes that arise from time to time in the poet's fancy, and by his lively painting give such entertainment to his readers, were he destitute of this faculty of laying them open to the view of others by words and description, could not extend their influence beyond his own imagination, or give joy to any but the original inventor.\n\nVII. There is this farther advantage in the ability great avail we enjoy of communicating our complex notions by towards the definitions; that as these make by far the largest class of our ideas, and most frequently occur in the progress of knowledge, and improvement of knowledge, so they are by these means imparted with the greatest readiness, than which nothing would tend more to the increase and spreading of science; for a definition is soon perused; and if the terms of it are well understood, the idea itself finds an easy admission into the mind. Whereas, in simple perceptions, where we are referred to the objects producing them, if these cannot be come at, as is sometimes the case, the names by which they are expressed must remain empty sounds. But new ideas of this class occurring very rarely in the sciences, seldom create any great obstruction. It is otherwise with our complex notions; for every step we take leading us into new combinations and views of things, it becomes necessary to explain these to others, before they can be made acquainted with our discoveries: and as the manner of definitions is easy, requiring no apparatus but that of words, which are always ready, and at hand; hence we can with the least difficulty remove such obstacles as might arise from terms of our own invention, when they are made to stand for new complex ideas suggested to the mind by some present train of thinking. And thus at last we are let into the mystery hinted at in the beginning of this chapter, viz. how we may become acquainted with the thoughts of another, when he makes use of words to which we have as yet joined no ideas. The answer is obvious from what has been already said. If the terms denote simple perceptions, he must refer us to these objects of nature whence the perceptions themselves are to be obtained; but, if they stand for complex ideas, their meaning may be explained by a definition.\n\nCHAP. II. Of Definition.\n\nI. A Definition is the unfolding of some conception of the mind, answering to the word or term made use of as the sign of it. Now as, in exhibiting any idea to another, it is necessary that the description be such as may excite that precise idea in his mind; hence it is plain that definitions, properly speaking, are not arbitrary, but confined to the representing of certain determinate settled notions, such namely as are annexed by the speaker or writer to the words he uses. As nevertheless it is universally allowed that the signification of words is perfectly voluntary, and not the effect of any natural and necessary connexion between them and the ideas for which they stand; some may perhaps wonder why definitions are not so too. In order therefore to unravel this difficulty, and show distinctly what is and what is not arbitrary in speech, we must carefully distinguish between the connexion of our words and ideas, and the unfolding of the ideas themselves.\n\nII. First, as to the connexion of our words and ideas; The connexion, it is plain, is a purely arbitrary institution. When, for instance, we have in our minds the idea of any particular species of metals, the calling it by the name ideas, a person gold is an effect of the voluntary choice of men speaking in the same language, and not of any peculiar aptness; but in that found to express that idea. Other nations we find make use of different sounds, and with the same effect. Thus aurum denotes that idea in Latin, and or in French; and even the word gold itself would have as well served to express the idea of that metal which we call silver, had custom in the beginning established it.\n\nIII. But although we are thus entirely at liberty in connecting any idea with any sound, yet it is quite otherwise in unfolding the ideas themselves. For every idea having a precise appearance of its own, by ed to which it is distinguished from every other idea: it is represented manifestly, that in laying it open to others, we must study such a description as shall exhibit that peculiar appearance. When we have formed to ourselves the idea of a figure bounded by four equal sides, joined and differing together at right angles, we are at liberty to express that idea by any sound, and call it either a square or a triangle. But whichever of these names we use, so long as the idea is the same, the description by which we would signify it to another must be so too. Let it be called square or triangle, it is still a figure having four equal sides, and all its angles right ones. Hence we clearly see what is and what is not arbitrary in the use of words. The establishing any sound as the mark of some determinate idea in the mind, is the effect of free choice, and a voluntary combination among men; and as different nations make use of different sounds to denote the same ideas, hence proceeds all that variety of languages which we meet with in the world. But when a connexion between our ideas and words is once settled, the unfolding of the idea answering to any word, which properly constitutes a definition, is by no means an arbitrary thing: for here we are bound to exhibit that precise conception which either the use of language, or our own particular choice, hath annexed to the term we use.\n\nIV. And thus it appears, that definitions, considered as descriptions of ideas in the mind, are steady and invariable, being bounded to the representation of the idea that has precise ideas. But then, in the application of definitions to particular names, we are altogether left to our own free choice. Because as the connecting of any definition with any sound is a perfectly arbitrary institution, the applying the description of that idea to that sound must be so too. When therefore logicians tell...\nus that the definition of the name is arbitrary, they mean no more than this; that as different ideas may be connected with any term, according to the good pleasure of him that uses it; in like manner may different descriptions be applied to the term, suitable to the ideas so connected. But this connexion being fettered, and the term considered as the sign of some fixed idea in the understanding, we are no longer left to arbitrary explications, but must study such a description as corresponds with that precise idea. Now this alone, according to what has been before laid down, ought to be accounted a definition. What seems to have occasioned no small confusion in this matter, is, that many explanations of words, where no idea is unfolded, but merely the connexion between some word and idea alluded, have yet been dignified with the name of definitions. Thus, when we say that a clock is an instrument by which we measure time; that is by some called a definition; and yet it is plain that we are beforehand supposed to have an idea of this instrument, and only taught that the word clock serves in common language to denote that idea. By this rule all explications of words in our dictionaries will be definitions, nay, the names of even simple ideas may be thus defined. White, we may say, is the colour we observe in snow or milk; heat the sensation produced by approaching the fire; and so in innumerable other instances. But these, and all others of the like kind, are by no means definitions, exciting new ideas in the understanding, but merely contrivances to remind us of known ideas, and teach their connexion with the established names.\n\nV. But now in definitions properly so called, we first consider the term we use, as the sign of some inward conception, either annexed to it by custom, or of our own free choice: and then the business of the definition is to unfold and explicate that idea. As therefore the whole art lies in giving just and true copies of our ideas; a definition is then said to be made perfect, when it serves distinctly to excite the idea described in the mind of another, even supposing him before wholly unacquainted with it. This point settled, let us next inquire what those ideas are which are capable of being thus unfolded? and in the first place it is evident, that all our simple ideas are necessarily excluded. We have seen already that experience alone is to be consulted here, inasmuch that if either the objects whence they are derived come not in our way, or the avenues appointed by nature for their reception are wanting, no description is sufficient to convey them into the mind. But where the understanding is already supplied with these original and primitive conceptions, as they may be united together in an infinity of different forms; so may all their several combinations be distinctly laid open, by enumerating the simple ideas concerned in the various collections, and tracing the order and manner in which they are linked one to another. Now these combinations of simple notices constitute what we call our complex notions, whence it is evident, that complex ideas, and those alone, admit of that kind of description which goes by the name of a definition.\n\nVI. Definitions, then, are pictures or representations of our ideas; and as these representations are then only possible when the ideas themselves are complex, it is obvious to remark, that definitions cannot have place, but where we make use of terms standing for such complex ideas. But our complex ideas being, as we have said, nothing more than different combinations of simple ideas; we then know and comprehend them perfectly, when we know the several simple ideas of which they consist, and can so put them together in our minds as may be necessary towards the framing of that peculiar connexion which gives every idea its distinct and proper appearance.\n\nVII. Two things are therefore required in every definition: first, That all the original ideas, out of which the complex one is formed, be distinctly enumerated; and, secondly, That the order and manner of combining them into one conception be clearly explained. Where a definition has these requisites, no explanation is wanting to its perfection; because every one who reads it and understands the terms, seeing at once their combination, can at pleasure form in his own mind the complex conception answering to the term defined. Let us, for instance, suppose the word square to stand for that idea by which we represent to ourselves a figure whose sides subtend quadrants of a circumscribed circle. The parts of this idea are the sides bounding the figure. These must be four in number, and all equal among themselves, because they are each to subtend a fourth part of the same circle. But, besides these component parts, we must also take notice of the manner of putting them together, if we would exhibit the precise idea for which the word square here stands. For four equal right lines, anyhow joined, will not subtend quadrants of a circumscribed circle. A figure with this property must have its sides standing also at right angles. Taking in therefore this last consideration respecting the manner of combining the parts, the idea is fully described, and the definition thereby rendered complete. For a figure bounded by four equal sides, joined together at right angles, has the property required; and is moreover the only right-angled figure to which that property belongs.\n\nVIII. It will now be obvious to every one, in what manner we ought to proceed, in order to arrive at just and adequate definitions. First, We are to take an exact view of the idea to be described, trace it to its original principles, and mark the several simple perceptions that enter into the composition of it. Secondly, We are to consider the particular manner in which these elementary ideas are combined, in order to the forming of that precise conception for which the term we make use of stands. When this is done, and the idea wholly unravelled, we have nothing more to do than fairly transcribe the appearance it makes to our own minds. Such a description, by distinctly exhibiting the order and number of our primitive conceptions, cannot fail to excite at the same time in the mind of every one that reads it, the complex idea resulting from them; and therefore attains the true and proper end of a definition.\n\nCHAP. III. Of the Composition and Resolutions of our Ideas, and the Rules of Definition thence arising.\n\nI. The rule laid down in the foregoing chapter is general, extending to all possible cases; and is indeed that\nthat to which alone we can have recourse, where any doubt or difficulty arises. It is not, however, necessary that we should practise it in every particular instance. Many of our ideas are extremely complicated, inasmuch that to enumerate all the simple perceptions out of which they are formed, would be a very troublesome and tedious work. For this reason logicians have established certain compendious rules of defining, of which it may not be amiss here to give some account. But in order to the better understanding of what follows, it will be necessary to observe, that there is a certain gradation in the composition of our ideas. The mind of man is very limited in its views, and cannot take in a great number of objects at once. We are therefore fain to proceed by steps, and make our first advances subservient to those which follow. Thus, in forming our complex notions, we begin at first with but a few simple ideas, such as we can manage with ease, and unite them together into one conception. When we are provided with a sufficient stock of these, and have by habit and use rendered them familiar to our minds, they become the component parts of other ideas still more complicated, and form what we may call a second order of compound notions. This process, as is evident, may be continued to any degree of composition we please, mounting from one stage to another, and enlarging the number of combinations.\n\nII. But now in a series of this kind, whoever would acquaint himself perfectly with the last and highest order of ideas, finds it much the most expedient method to proceed gradually through all the intermediate steps. For, were he to take any very compound idea to pieces, and, without regard to the several classes of simple perceptions that have already been formed into distinct combinations, break it at once into its original principles, the number would be so great as perfectly to confound the imagination, and overcome the utmost reach and capacity of the mind. When we see a prodigious multitude of men jumbled together in crowds, without order or any regular position, we find it impossible to arrive at an exact knowledge of their number. But if they are formed into separate battalions, and so stationed as to fall within the leisure survey of the eye; by viewing them successively and in order, we come to an easy and certain determination. It is the same in our complex ideas. When the original perceptions, out of which they are framed, are very numerous, it is not enough that we take a view of them in loose and scattered bodies; we must form them into distinct classes, and unite these classes in a just and orderly manner, before we can arrive at a true knowledge of the compound notices resulting from them.\n\nIII. This gradual progress of the mind to its compound notions, through a variety of intermediate steps, plainly points out the manner of conducting the definitions by which these notions are conveyed into the minds of others. For as the series begins with simple and easy combinations, and advances through a succession of different orders, rising one above another in the degree of composition, it is evident, that, in a train of definitions expressing these ideas, a like gradation is to be observed. Thus the complex ideas of the lowest order can no otherwise be described than by enumerating the simple ideas out of which they are made, and explaining the manner of their union. But Perception, then in the second, or any other succeeding order, as they are formed out of those gradual combinations, and constitute the inferior classes, it is not necessary, in describing them, to mention one by one all the simple ideas of which they consist. They may be more distinctly and briefly unfolded, by enumerating the compound ideas of a lower order, from whose union they result, and which are all supposed to be already known in consequence of previous definitions. Here then it is that the logical method of defining takes place; which, that it may be the better understood, we shall explain somewhat more particularly the several steps and gradations of the mind in compounding its ideas, and thence deduce that peculiar form of a definition which logicians have thought fit to establish.\n\nIV. All the ideas we receive from the several objects of nature that surround us, represent distinct in-by which individuals. These individuals, when compared together, are found in certain particulars to resemble each other. Hence, by collecting the resembling particulars into one conception, we form the notion of a species, general ideas. And here let it be observed, that this last idea is less complicated than that by which we represent any of the particular objects contained under it. For the idea of the species excludes the peculiarities of the several individuals, and retains only such properties as are common to them all. Again, By comparing several species together, and observing their resemblance, we form the idea of a genus; where, in the same manner as before, the composition is lessened, because we leave out what is peculiar to the several species compared, and retain only the particulars wherein they agree. It is easy to conceive the mind proceeding thus from one step to another, and advancing through its several classes of general notions, until at last it comes to the highest genus of all, denoted by the word being, where the bare idea of existence is only concerned.\n\nV. In this procedure we see the mind unravelling the complex idea, and tracing it in the ascending scale, down to the greatest or least degrees of composition, until it terminates in one simple perception. If now we take its contrary way, and, beginning with the ideas, as it last or highest genus, carry our view downwards, advances through all the inferior genera and species, quite through the individuals, we shall thereby arrive at a distinct apprehension of the conduct of the understanding in compounding its ideas. For, in the several classes of our perceptions, the highest in the scale is for the most part made up of but a few simple ideas, such as the mind can take in and survey with ease. This first general notion, when branched out into the different subdivisions contained under it, has in every one of them something peculiar, by which they are distinguished among themselves; inasmuch that, in descending from the genus to the species, we always superadd some new idea, and thereby increase the degree of composition. Thus the idea denoted by the word figure is of a very general nature, and composed of but few simple perceptions, as implying no more than space everywhere bounded. But if we descend farther, and consider the boundaries of this space, as that they may be either lines or surface, we...\nfall into the several species of figure. For where the space is bounded by one or more surfaces, we give it the name of a solid figure; but where the boundaries are lines, it is called a plain figure (A).\n\nVI. In this view of things it is evident, that the species is formed by superadding a new idea to the genus. Here, for instance, the genus is circumfribbed space. If now to this we superadd the idea of a circumscription by lines, we frame the notion of that species of figures which are called plain; but if we conceive the circumscription to be by surfaces, we have the species of solid figures. This superadded idea is called the specific difference, not only as it serves to divide the species from the genus, but because, being different in all the several subdivisions, we thereby also distinguish the species one from another. And as it is likewise that conception, which, by being joined to the general idea, completes the notion of the species: hence it is plain, that the genus and specific difference are to be considered as the proper and constituent parts of the species. If we trace the progress of the mind still farther, and observe it advancing through\n\n(A) This account of the composition and resolution of our ideas is agreeable to the common doctrine of logicians on the subject. Into the truth of the doctrine itself we shall inquire afterwards under the article Metaphysics: but to prevent mistakes, it may be proper to observe here, that though every writer of logic has treated largely of general and specific ideas, there is in reality nothing general in the matter but the terms of language. When we utter, for instance, the word triangle, that general term does not, as has been often said, suggest to the mind the general idea of a triangle, which is neither oblique nor rectangle, neither equilateral nor scalene, &c., for such a triangle, as it cannot exist in nature, cannot be conceived in idea. In like manner, the general term Virtue does not excite a general idea of virtue, which is neither prudence, nor temperance, nor fortitude, nor justice, nor charity, &c., for that which is distinct from all these is not virtue. What then is the import of such general terms? The answer is obvious: they denote classes of objects; and are never used without some word of limitation, but when something that has no dependence upon the particular qualities, which distinguish the individuals from each other, is affirmed or denied of the whole class. Thus we may affirm, that the three angles of a plain triangle are equal to two right angles: and this proposition is demonstrably true, not of a triangle, which is neither oblique nor rectangle, neither equilateral nor scalene, for such a triangle never was conceived; but of all those triangles equally, as the truth of the proposition and the progress of the demonstration has no dependence upon the peculiarities which distinguish these triangles from one another. Again, when we say that a man of virtue will be rewarded by God, we do not mean by the word virtue a general idea making part of each of the complex and more particular ideas of prudence, fortitude, justice, &c., and at the same time different from them all; but we affirm, that the man who practises any or all of these virtues, according as he has opportunity, will be rewarded by God.\n\nThe history of our ideas is shortly this:—That act of the mind, if it may be called an act, which makes known an external object, is termed perception. That act of the mind which makes known an internal object, is termed consciousness. Objects once perceived may be recalled to the mind by the power of memory; and when they are so recalled, we have a perception of them in all respects similar to the original perception, only less distinct; we fancy ourselves in the same place, and the object perceived attended by the same circumstances. This indistinct secondary perception of an object is termed an idea; and therefore the precise and accurate definition of an idea, in contradistinction to an original perception, is \"that perception of a real object which is raised in the mind by the power of memory.\" Now all our original perceptions being of particular objects, it is obvious that our ideas, which are only those perceptions recalled, must be of particular objects likewise, and that no man can have an idea of a thing of which the real existence is contradictory and impossible. But the general and specific ideas of logicians, are ideas of nothing which exists, or which can possibly exist. They are acquired, we are told, by abstraction, in the following manner. Among a number of individuals we perceive certain qualities the same in all, whilst in each individual there are other qualities which have nothing similar to them in any other individual: now the mind, it is said, has a power of abstracting the particular qualities of each individual from those which are common to the whole, and of these last forming a general idea of the whole class. Thus all men have nearly the same form; and they have each some stature and some colour, though there are not perhaps two individuals who have precisely the same stature and the same colour. Now, say the advocates for general ideas, if we abstract what is peculiar to each individual, and retain what is common to the whole race, we have the general idea signified by the word man. That is, if we conceive a being in human shape, which is of stature and colour, but neither tall nor short, neither white nor black, nor red nor brown, nor any other colour which we ever saw, we have the general idea of humanity, and understand the meaning of the word man! Surely no person who is not the slave of prejudice will pretend that he can frame such an idea as this—the idea of an object which cannot possibly exist in nature.\n\nBy this we do not mean to affirm, that we cannot frame ideas of such objects as have no real existence; for it is easy to imagine a man with ten heads as with one, because there is nothing contradictory between ten heads and one body. But figure, which is said to be space bounded neither by lines nor superficies; colour, which is neither red nor white, nor blue nor black, &c.; and animal, which is neither man, beast, bird, nor insect; are impossible in nature, and inconceivable in idea. There is, however, no harm in still retaining the phrase general idea, provided he who uses it takes care to let it be known, that by these words he means not any abstract and contradictory idea, but merely a class of real objects. The phrase may at times prevent much circumlocution; for which reason we have retained the use of it in the text.\nthrough the inferior species, we shall find its manner of proceeding to be always the same. For every lower species is formed by superadding some new idea to the species next above it; inasmuch that in this descending scale of our perceptions, the understanding passes through different orders of complex notions, which become more and more complicated at every step it takes. Let us resume here, for instance, the species of plain figures. They imply no more than space bounded by lines. But if we take in an additional consideration of the nature of these lines, as whether they are right or curves, we fall into the subdivisions of plain figure, distinguished by the names of rectilinear, curvilinear, and mixtilinear.\n\nVII. And here we are to observe, that though plain figures, when considered as one of those branches that come under the notions of figure in general, take the name of a species; yet compared with the classes of curvilinear, rectilinear, and mixtilinear, into which they themselves may be divided, they really become a genus, of which the beforementioned subdivisions constitute the several species. These species, in the same manner as in the case of plane and solid figures, consist of the genus and specific difference as their constituent parts. For in the curvilinear kind, the curvity of the lines bounding the figure makes what is called the specific difference; to which if we join the genus, which here is a plain figure or space circumscribed by lines, we have all that is necessary towards completing the notion of this species. We are only to take notice, that this last subdivision, having two genera above it, viz. plain figure, and figure in general; the genus joined with the specific difference, in order to constitute the species of curvilinears, is that which lies nearest to the said species. It is the notion of plain figure, and not of figure in general, that joined with the idea of curvity, makes up the complex conception of curve-lined figures. For in this descending scale of our ideas, figure in general, plain figures, curved-lined figures, the two first are considered as genera in respect of the third; and the second in order, or that which stands next to the third, is called the nearest genus. But now as it is this second idea, which, joined with the notion of curvity, forms the species of curve-lined figures; it is plain, that the third or last idea in the series is made up of the nearest genus and specific difference. This rule holds invariably, however far the series is continued; because, in a train of ideas thus succeeding one another, all that precede the last are considered as so many genera in respect of that last; and the last itself is always formed by superadding the specific difference to the genus next it.\n\nVIII. Here then we have an universal description, applicable to all our ideas of whatever kind, from the highest genus to the lowest species. For, taking them in order downwards from the said general idea, they everywhere consist of the genus proximum, and differentia specifica, as logicians love to express themselves. But when we come to the lowest species of all, comprehending under it only individuals, the superadded idea, by which these individuals are distinguished one from another, no longer takes the name of the specific difference. For here it serves not to denote distinct species, but merely a variety of individuals, each of which, having a particular existence of its own, is therefore numerically different from every other of the same kind. And hence it is, that in this last case, logicians choose to call the superadded idea by the name of the numerical difference; inasmuch that, as the idea of a species is made up of the nearest genus and specific difference, so the idea of an individual consists of the lowest species and numeric difference. Thus the circle is a species of curve-lined figures, and what we call the lowest species, as comprehending under it only individuals. Circles in particular are distinguished from one another by the length and position of their diameters. The length therefore and position of the diameter of a circle form what logicians call the numerical difference; because, there being given, the circle itself may be described, and an individual thereby constituted.\n\nIX. Thus the mind, in compounding its ideas, begins, we see, with the most general notions, which, following one another consisting of but a few simple notices, are easily combined and brought together into one conception, and pass Thence it proceeds to the species comprehended under this general idea; and these are formed by joining together the genus and specific difference. And as it often happens, that these species may be still farther subdivided, and run on in a long series of continued gradations, producing various orders of compound perceptions; so all these several orders are regularly and successively formed by annexing in every step the specific difference to the nearest genus. When by this method of procedure we are come to the lowest order of all, by joining the species and numeric difference, we frame the ideas of individuals. And here the series necessarily terminates, because it is impossible any farther to bound or limit our conceptions. This view of the composition of our ideas, representing their constituent parts in every step of the progression, naturally points out the true and genuine form of a definition. For as definitions are no more than descriptions of the ideas for which the terms defined stand; and as ideas are then described, when we enumerate distinctly and in order the parts of which they consist; it is plain, that by making our definitions follow one another according to the natural train of our conceptions, they will be subject to the same rules, and keep pace with the ideas they describe.\n\nX. As therefore the first order of our compound notions, or the ideas that constitute the highest genus in all the different scales of perception, are formed by uniting together a certain number of simple notices; so the terms expressing these genera are defined by conception, enumerating the simple notices so combined. And as the species comprehended under any genus, or the complex ideas of the second order, arise from superadding the specific difference to the said general idea; so the definition of the names of the species is abolished, in a detail of the ideas of the specific difference, connected with the term of the genus. For the genus having been before defined, the term by which it is expressed stands for a known idea, and may therefore be introduced into all subsequent definitions, in the same manner as the names of simple perceptions. It will now be sufficiently obvious, that the definitions of all the succeeding orders of compound notions will every-\nPART II. OF JUDGEMENT.\n\nCHAP. I. Of the Grounds of Human Judgement.\n\nTHE mind being furnished with ideas, its next step in the way to knowledge is, the comparing these ideas together, in order to judge of their agreement or disagreement. In this joint view of our ideas, if the relation is such as to be immediately discoverable by the bare inspection of the mind, the judgements thence obtained are called intuitive, from a word that denotes to look at; for in this case, a mere attention to the ideas compared suffices to let us see now far they are connected or disjoined. Thus, that the Whole is greater than any of its Parts, is an intuitive judgement; nothing more being required to convince us of its truth, than an attention to the ideas of whole and part. And this too is the reason why we call the act of the mind forming these judgements intuition; as it is indeed no more than an immediate perception of the agreement or disagreement of any two ideas.\n\nII. But here it is to be observed, that our knowledge of this kind respects only our ideas, and the relations between them; and therefore can serve only as a foundation to such reasonings as are employed in investigating those relations. Now it so happens, that many of our judgements are conversant about facts, and the real existence of things which cannot be traced by the bare contemplation of our ideas. It does not follow, because I have the idea of a circle in my mind, that therefore a figure answering to that idea has a real existence in nature. I can form to myself the notion of a centaur or golden mountain, but never imagine on that account that either of them exists. What then are the grounds of our judgement in relation to facts? experience and testimony. By experience we are informed of the existence of the several objects which surround us, and operate upon our senses. Testimony is of a wider extent, and reaches not only to objects beyond the present sphere of our observation, but also to facts and transactions, which being now past, and having no longer any existence, could not without this conveyance have fallen under our cognizance.\n\nIII. Here we have three foundations of human judgement, from which the whole system of our knowledge may with ease and advantage be derived. First, Intuition, which respects our ideas themselves, and their relations; and is the foundation of that species of reasoning which we call demonstration. For whatever is deduced from our intuitive perceptions, by a clear and connected series of proofs, is said to be demonstrated, and produces absolute certainty in the mind. Hence the knowledge obtained in this manner is what we properly term science; because in every step of the procedure it carries its own evidence along with it, and leaves no room for doubt or hesitation. And what is highly worthy of notice; as the truths of this class express the relations between our ideas, and the same relations must ever and invariably subsist between the same ideas, our deductions in the way of science constitute what we call eternal, necessary, and immutable truths. If it be true that the whole is equal to all its parts, it must be so unchangeably; because the relation of equality being attached to the ideas themselves, must ever intervene where the same ideas are compared. Of this nature all the truths of natural religion, morality, and mathematics, and in general whatever may be gathered from the bare view and consideration of our ideas.\n\nIV. The second ground of human judgement is experience; from which we infer the existence of those objects that surround us, and fall under the immediate notice of our senses. When we see the sun, or caitlidge of our eyes towards a building, we not only have per the perceptions of these objects within ourselves, but ascribe and qualify to them a real existence out of the mind. It is also by the information of the senses that we judge of the qualities of bodies; as when we say that snow is white, fire hot, or steel hard. For as we are wholly unacquainted with the internal structure and constitution of the bodies that produce these sensations in us, nay, and are unable to trace any connexion between that structure and the sensations themselves, it is evident, that we build our judgements altogether upon observation, ascribing to bodies such qualities as are answerable to the perceptions they excite in us. Not that we ever suppose the qualities of bodies to be things of the same nature with our perceptions; for there is nothing in fire similar to our sensation of heat, or in a sword similar to pain; but that when different bodies excite in our minds similar perceptions, we necessarily ascribe to these bodies not only an existence independent of us, but likewise similar qualities, of which it is the nature to produce similar perceptions in the human mind. But this is not the only advantage derived from experience; for to that too we are indebted for all our knowledge regarding the co-existence of sensible qualities in objects, and the operations of bodies one upon another. Ivory, for instance, is hard and elastic; this we know by experience, and indeed by that alone. For, being altogether strangers to the true nature both of elasticity and hardness, we cannot by the bare contemplation of our ideas determine how far the one necessarily implies the other, or whether there may not be a repugnance between them. But when we observe them to exist both in the same object, we are then assured from experience that they are not incompatible; and when we also find, that a stone is hard and not elastic, and that air though ela-\nPart II.\n\nLOGIC.\n\nOf Judgement.\n\nOur affekt rests, and whereto we appeal when the highest degree of evidence is required.\n\nVII. But there are many facts that will not allow of an appeal to the senses; and in this case testimony is the true and only foundation of our judgements. All human actions of whatever kind, when considered ground of already past, are of the nature here described; because having now no longer any existence, both the facts themselves, and the circumstances attending them, can be known only from the relations of such as had sufficient opportunities of arriving at the truth. Testimony therefore is justly accounted a third ground of human judgement; and as from the other two we have deduced scientific and natural knowledge, so we may from this derive historical; by which we mean, not merely a knowledge of the civil transactions of states and kingdoms, but of all facts whatsoever, where testimony is the ultimate foundation of our belief.\n\nCHAP. II. Of Affirmative and Negative Propositions.\n\nI. While the comparing of our ideas is considered merely as an act of the mind, assembling them together, and joining or disjoining them according to the result of its perceptions, we call it judgement; but when explained, our judgements are put into words, they then bear the name of propositions. A proposition therefore is a sentence expressing some judgement of the mind, whereby two or more ideas are affirmed to agree or disagree. Now, as our judgements include at least two ideas, one of which is affirmed or denied of the other, so must a proposition have terms answering to these ideas. The idea of which we affirm or deny, and of course the term expressing that idea, is called the subject of the proposition. The idea affirmed or denied, as also the term answering it, is called the predicate. Thus in the proposition, God is omnipotent: God is the subject, it being of him that we affirm omnipotence; and omnipotent is the predicate, because we affirm the idea expressed by that word to belong to God.\n\nII. But as, in propositions, ideas are either joined or disjoined; it is not enough to have terms expressing those ideas, unless we have also some words to denote their agreement or disagreement. That word in a proposition, which connects two ideas together, is called the copula; and if a negative particle be annexed, we thereby understand that the ideas are disjoined. The substantive verb is commonly made use of for the copula: as in the above mentioned proposition, God is omnipotent; where is represents the copula, and signifies the agreement of the ideas of God and omnipotence. But if we mean to separate two ideas; then, besides the substantive verb, we must also use some particle of negation, to express this repugnance. The proposition, man is not perfect, may serve as an example of this kind; where the notion of perfection being removed from the idea of man, the negative particle not is inserted after the copula, to signify the disagreement between the subject and predicate.\n\nIII. Every proposition necessarily consists of three parts; but then it is not alike needless that they times express all severally expressed in words; because the copula prefixed by is often included in the term of the predicate, as when a single word.\nwe say, he fits; which imports the same as he is fitting.\n\nIn the Latin language, a single word has often the force of a whole sentence. Thus ambulat is the same as ille est ambulans; amo, as ego sum amans; and so in innumerable other instances; by which it appears, that we are not so much to regard the number of words in a sentence, as the ideas they represent, and the manner in which they are put together. For wherever two ideas are joined or disjoined in an expression, though only but a single word; it is evident that we have a subject, predicate, and copula, and of consequence a complete proposition.\n\nIV. When the mind joins two ideas, we call it an affirmative judgement; when it separates them, a negative; and as any two ideas compared together must necessarily either agree or not agree, it is evident that all our judgements fall under these two divisions. Hence likewise the propositions expressing these judgements are all either affirmative or negative. An affirmative proposition connects the predicate with the subject, as a stone is heavy; a negative proposition separates them, as God is not the author of evil. Affirmation therefore is the same as joining two ideas together; and this is done by means of the copula. Negation, on the contrary, marks the repugnance between the ideas compared; in which case a negative particle must be called in, to show that the connexion included in the copula does not take place.\n\nV. Hence we see the reason of the rule commonly laid down by logicians, That in all negative propositions the negation ought to affect the copula. For as the copula, when placed by itself, between the subject and the predicate, manifestly binds them together; it is evident, that in order to render a proposition negative, the particles of negation must enter it in such a manner as to destroy this union. In a word, then only are two ideas disjoined in a proposition, when the negative particle may be referred to the copula, as to break the affirmation included in it, and undo that connexion it would otherwise establish. When we say, for instance, No man is perfect; take away the negation, and the copula of itself plainly unites the ideas in the proposition. But as this is the very reverse of what is intended, a negative mark is added, to show that this union does not here take place. The negation, therefore, by destroying the effect of the copula, changes the very nature of the proposition, inasmuch that, instead of binding two ideas together, it denotes their separation. On the contrary, in this sentence, The man who departs not from an upright behaviour is beloved of God, the predicate beloved of God is evidently affirmed of the subject an upright man; so that, notwithstanding the negative particle, the proposition is still affirmative. The reason is plain: the negation here affects not the copula; but, making properly a part of the subject, serves, with other terms in the sentence, to form one complex idea, of which the predicate beloved of God is directly affirmed.\n\nCHAP. III. Of Universal and Particular Propositions.\n\nI. The next considerable division of propositions is Division into universal and particular. Our ideas, according to proposition which has been already observed in the First Part, are divided into all singular as they enter the mind, and represent individual objects. But as by abstraction we can render them universal, so as to comprehend a whole class of things, and sometimes several classes at once; hence the terms expressing these ideas must be in like manner universal. If therefore we suppose any general term to become the subject of a proposition, it is evident, that whatever is affirmed of the abstract idea belonging to that term, may be affirmed of all the individuals to which that idea extends. Thus, when we say, Men are mortal; we consider mortality, not as confined to one or any number of particular men, but as what may be affirmed without restriction of the whole species. By this means the proposition becomes as general as the idea which makes the subject of it; and indeed derives its universality entirely from that idea, being more or less so according as this may be extended to more or fewer individuals. But it is further to be observed of these general terms, that they sometimes enter a proposition in their full latitude, as in the example given above; and sometimes appear with a mark of limitation. In this last case we are given to understand, that the predicate agrees not to the whole universal idea, but only to a part of it; as in the proposition, Some men are wise: For here wisdom is not affirmed of every particular man, but restrained to a few of the human species (u).\n\nII. Now from this different appearance of the general idea that constitutes the subject of any proposition, arises the division of propositions into universal and particular. An universal proposition is that where the subject is some general term taken in its full latitude; insomuch that the predicate agrees to all the individuals comprehended under it, if it denotes a proper species; and to all the several species, and their individuals, if it marks an idea of a higher order. The words all, every, no, none, &c. are the proper signs of this universality; and as they seldom fail to accompany general truths, so they are the most obvious criterion whereby to distinguish them. All animals have a power of beginning motion. This is an universal proposition; as we know from the word all prefixed to the subject animals, which denotes that it must be taken in its full extent. Hence the power of beginning motion may be affirmed of all the several species of animals.\n\nIII. A particular proposition has in like manner some general term for its subject; but with a mark of particular where limitation some universal subject appears with a mark of limitation.\n\n(B) See the preceding note, where it is demonstrated that the terms alone, and not the ideas, are in reality general. The term man is equally applicable to every individual of the human race; and therefore, what is affirmed or denied of men in general, is affirmed or denied of all the individuals, without regard to their discriminating qualities. Some is a definitive word (see Grammar), which, prefixed to the word man, limits the signification of that general term; and therefore what is affirmed of some men, is affirmed only of part of the race, but that part itself is not ascertained.\nPart II.\n\nLOGIC.\n\nOf limitation added, to denote, that the predicate agrees only to one or the individuals comprehended under a species, or to one or more of the species belonging to any genus, and not to the whole universal idea. Thus, Some stones are heavier than iron; Some men have an uncommon share of prudence. In the last of these propositions, the subject some men implies only a certain number of individuals, comprehended under a single species. In the former, where the subject is a genus that extends to a great variety of distinct classes, some stones may not only imply any number of particular stones, but also several whole species of stones, inasmuch as there may be not a few with the property there described. Hence we see, that a proposition does not cease to be particular by the predicate's agreeing to a whole species, unless that species, singly and distinctly considered, makes also the subject of which we affirm or deny.\n\nIV. There is still one species of propositions that remains to be described, and which the more deserves our notice, as it is not yet agreed among logicians to which of the two classes mentioned above they ought to be referred; namely, singular propositions, or those where the subject is an individual. Of this nature are the following: Sir Isaac Newton was the inventor of fluxions; This book contains many useful truths. What occasions some difficulty as to the proper rank of these propositions is, that, the subject being taken according to the whole of its extension, they sometimes have the same effect in reasoning as universals. But if it be considered that they are in truth the most limited kind of particular propositions, and that no proposition can with any propriety be called universal but where the subject is some universal idea; it shall not be long in determining to which class they ought to be referred. When we say, Some books contain useful truths; the proposition is particular, because the general term appears with a mark of restriction. If therefore we say, This book contains useful truths; it is evident that the proposition must be still more particular, as the limitation implied in the word this, is of a more confined nature than in the former case.\n\nV. We see, therefore, that all propositions are either affirmative or negative; nor is it less evident, that in both cases they may be universal or particular. Hence arises that celebrated fourfold division of them into universal affirmative and universal negative, particular affirmative and particular negative, which comprehends indeed all their varieties. The use of this method of distinguishing them will appear more fully afterwards, when we come to treat of reasoning and syllogism.\n\nCHAP. IV. Of Absolute and Conditional Propositions.\n\nI. The objects about which we are chiefly conversant in this world, are all of a nature liable to change. What may be affirmed of them at one time, cannot often at another; and it makes no small part of our knowledge to distinguish rightly these variations, and trace the reasons upon which they depend. For it is observable, that amidst all the vicissitudes of nature, some things remain constant and invariable; nor even are the changes, to which we see others liable, effected but in consequence of uniform and steady laws, which, when known, are sufficient to direct us in our judgements about them. Hence philosophers, in distinguishing the objects of our perception into various classes, have been very careful to note, that some properties belong essentially to the general idea, so as not to be separable from it but by destroying its very nature; while others are only accidental, and may be affirmed or denied of it in different circumstances. Thus solidity, a yellow colour, and great weight, are considered as essential qualities of gold; but whether it shall exist as an uniform conjoined mass, is not alike necessary. We see that by a proper menstrum it may be reduced to a fine powder, and that an intense heat will bring it into a state of fusion.\n\nII. From this diversity in the several qualities of things arises a considerable difference as to the manner of our judging about them. For all such properties as are inseparable from objects when considered as belonging to any genus or species, are affirmed absolutely and without reserve of that general idea. Thus we say, Gold is very weighty; A stone is hard; Animals have a power of self-motion. But in the case of mutual or accidental qualities, as they depend upon some other consideration distinct from the general idea; that also must be taken into the account, in order to form an accurate judgement. Should we affirm, for instance, of some stones, that they are very susceptible of a rolling motion; the proposition, while it remains in this general form, cannot with any advantage be introduced into our reasonings. An attempt to receive that mode of motion flows from the figure of the stone; which, as it may vary infinitely, our judgement then only becomes applicable and determinate, when the particular figure, of which volatility is a consequence, is also taken into the account. Let us then bring in this other consideration, and the proposition will run as follows: Stones of a spherical form are easily put into a rolling motion. Here we see the condition upon which the predicate is affirmed, and therefore know in what particular cases the proposition may be applied.\n\nIII. This consideration of propositions respecting the manner in which the predicate is affirmed of the subject gives rise to the division of them into absolute and conditional. Absolute propositions are those wherein we affirm some property inseparable from the idea of the subject, and which therefore belongs to it in all and possible cases; as, God is infinitely wise; Virtue tends to the ultimate happiness of man. But where the predicate is not necessarily connected with the idea of the subject, unless upon some consideration distinct from that idea, there the proposition is called conditional. The reason of the name is taken from the supposition annexed, which is of the nature of a condition, and may be expressed as such, thus: If a stone is exposed to the rays of the sun, it will contract some degree of heat; If a river runs in a very declining channel, its rapidity will constantly increase.\n\nIV. There is not anything of greater importance in philosophy than a due attention to this division of propositions. If we are careful never to affirm things absolutely but where the ideas are inseparably connected; and if in our other judgements we distinctly mark the conditions which determine the predicate to belong to the subject; we shall be the less liable to mistake.\nmistake in applying general truths to the particular concerns of human life. It is owing to the exact observance of this rule that mathematicians have been so happy in their discoveries, and that what they demonstrate of magnitude in general may be applied with ease in all obvious occurrences.\n\nV. The truth of it is, particular propositions are then known to be true, when we can trace their connexion with universals; and it is accordingly the great business of science to find out general truths that may be applied with safety in all obvious instances. Now the great advantage arising from determining with care the conditions upon which one idea may be affirmed or denied of another is this: that thereby particular propositions really become universal, may be introduced with certainty into our reasonings, and serve as standards to conduct and regulate our judgments. To illustrate this by a familiar instance: if we say, Some water acts very forcibly; the proposition is particular: and as the conditions on which this forcible action depends are not mentioned, it is as yet uncertain in what cases it may be applied. Let us then supply these conditions, and the proposition will run thus: Water conveyed in sufficient quantity along a steep descent acts very forcibly. Here we have an universal judgement, inasmuch as the predicate forcible action may be ascribed to all water under the circumstances mentioned. Nor is it less evident that the proposition in this new form is of easy application; and in fact we find that men do apply it in instances where the forcible action of water is required; as in corn-mills and many other works of art.\n\nCHAP. V. Of Simple and Compound Propositions.\n\nI. HITHERTO we have treated of propositions, where only two ideas are compared together. These are in the general called simple; because, having but one subject and one predicate, they are the effect of a simple judgement that admits of no subdivision. But if it happens that several ideas offer themselves to our thoughts at once, whereby we are led to affirm the same thing of different objects, or different things of the same object; the propositions expressing these judgements are called compound: because they may be resolved into as many others as there are subjects or predicates in the whole complex determination on the mind. Thus, God is infinitely wise and infinitely powerful. Here there are two predicates, infinite wisdom and infinite power, both affirmed of the same subject; and accordingly the proposition may be resolved into two others; affirming these predicates severally. In like manner in the proposition, Neither kings nor people are exempt from death; the predicate is denied of both subjects, and may therefore be separated from them in distinct propositions. Nor is it less evident, that if a complex judgement consists of several subjects and predicates, it may be resolved into as many simple propositions as are the number of different ideas compared together. Riches and honours are apt to elate the mind, and increase the number of our desires. In this judgement there are two subjects and two predicates, and it is at the same time apparent that it may be resolved into four distinct propositions. Riches are apt to elate the mind. Riches are apt to increase the number of our desires. And so of honours.\n\nII. Logicians have divided these compound propositions into a great many different classes; but, in our opinion, not with a due regard to their proper definition of a nation. Thus conditionals, causals, relatives, &c., are compound mentioned as so many distinct species of this kind, though in fact they are no more than simple propositions. To give an instance of a conditional: If a stone is exposed to the rays of the sun, it will contract some degree of heat. Here we have but one subject and one predicate; for the complex expression, A stone exposed to the rays of the sun, constitutes the proper subject of this proposition, and is no more than one determined idea. The same thing happens in causals. Rehoboam was unhappy because he followed evil counsel. There is here an appearance of two propositions arising from the complexity of the expression; but when we come to consider the matter more nearly, it is evident that we have but a single subject and predicate. The pursuit of evil counsel brought misery upon Rehoboam. It is not enough, therefore, to render a proposition compound, that the subject and predicate are complex notions, requiring sometimes a whole sentence to express them: for in this case the composition is still confined to two ideas, and constitutes what we call a simple judgement. But where there are several subjects or predicates, or both, as the affirmation or negation may be alike extended to them all, the proposition expressing such a judgement is truly a collection of as many simple ones as there are different ideas compared. Confining ourselves therefore to this more strict and just notion of compound propositions, they are all reducible to two kinds, viz. copulatives and disjunctives.\n\nIII. A copulative proposition is, where the subjects and predicates are so linked together, that they may be all severally affirmed or denied one of another. Of these, either this nature are the examples of compound propositions given above. Riches and honours are apt to elate the mind, and increase the number of our desires. Neither kings nor people are exempt from death. In the first of these the two predicates may be affirmed severally of each subject, whence we have four distinct propositions. The other furnishes an example of the negative kind, where the same predicate, being disjoined from both subjects, may also be denied of them in separate propositions.\n\nIV. The other species of compound propositions are or disjunctive those called disjunctives; in which, comparing several predicates with the same subject, we affirm that one of them necessarily belongs to it, but leave the particular predicate undetermined. If any one, for example, says, This world either exists of itself, or is the work of some all-wise and powerful cause, it is evident that one of the two predicates must belong to the world; but as the proposition determines not which, it is therefore of the kind we call disjunctive. Such too are the following: The sun either moves round the earth, or is the centre about which the earth revolves. Friendship finds men equal, or makes them so. It is the nature of all propositions of this class, supposing them to be exact in point of form, that upon determining the particular predicate, the rest are of course to be removed: or if all\nall the predicates but one are removed, that one necessarily takes place. Thus, in the example given above; if we allow the world to be the work of some wise and powerful cause, we of course deny it to be self-existent; or if we deny it to be self-existent, we must necessarily admit that it was produced by some wise and powerful cause. Now this particular manner of linking the predicates together, so that the establishing one displaces all the rest; or the excluding all but one necessarily establishes that one; cannot otherwise be effected than by means of disjunctive particles. And hence it is that propositions of this class take their names from these particles which make so necessary a part of them, and indeed constitute their very nature considered as a distinct species.\n\nCHAP. VI. Of the Division of Propositions into Self-evident and Demonstrable.\n\nI. When any proposition is offered to the view of the mind, if the terms in which it is expressed be understood; upon comparing the ideas together, the agreement or disagreement asserted is either immediately perceived, or found to lie beyond the present reach of the understanding. In the first case the proposition is said to be self-evident, and admits not of any proof, because a bare attention to the ideas themselves produces full conviction and certainty; nor is it possible to call in anything more evident by way of confirmation. But where the connexion or repugnance comes not to readily under the inspection of the mind, there we must have recourse to reasoning; and if by a clear series of proofs we can make out the truth proposed, inasmuch that self-evidence shall accompany every step of the procedure, we are then able to demonstrate what we assert, and the proposition itself is said to be demonstrable. When we affirm, for instance, that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be; whoever understands the terms made use of perceives at first glance the truth of what is asserted, nor can he by any efforts bring himself to believe the contrary. The proposition therefore is self-evident, and such that it is impossible by reasoning to make it plainer; because there is no truth more obvious or better known, from which as a consequence it may be deduced. But if we say, This world had a beginning; the assertion is indeed equally true, but shines not forth with the same degree of evidence. We find great difficulty in conceiving how the world could be made out of nothing; and are not brought to a free and full content, until by reasoning we arrive at a clear view of the absurdity involved in the contrary supposition. Hence this proposition is of the kind we call demonstrable, inasmuch as its truth is not immediately perceived by the mind, but yet may be made appear by means of others more known and obvious, whence it follows as an unavoidable consequence.\n\nII. From what has been said, it appears, that reasoning is employed only about demonstrable propositions, and that our intuitive and self-evident perceptions are the ultimate foundation on which it rests.\n\nIII. Self-evident propositions furnish the first principles of reasoning; and it is certain, that if in our researches we employ only such principles as have this character of self-evidence, and apply them according to the rules to be afterwards explained, we shall be in no danger of error in advancing from one discovery to another. For this we may appeal to the writings of the mathematicians, which, being conducted by the express model here mentioned, are an incontrovertible proof of the firmness and stability of human knowledge, when built upon so sure a foundation. For not only have the propositions of this science stood the test of ages; but are found attended with that invincible evidence, as forces the assent of all who duly consider the proofs upon which they are established. Since the mathematicians are universally allowed to have hit upon the right method of arriving at unknown truths, since they have been the happiest in the choice as well as the application of their principles, it may not be amiss to explain here their method of stating self-evident propositions, and applying them to the purposes of demonstration.\n\nIV. First then it is to be observed, that they have been very careful in ascertaining their ideas, and fixing a great signification of their terms. For this purpose help to begin with definitions, in which the meaning of their words is so distinctly explained, that they can scarcely fail to excite in the mind of an attentive reader knowledge of the very same ideas as are annexed to them by the writer. And indeed the clearness and irresistible evidence of mathematical knowledge is owing to nothing so much as this care in laying the foundation. Where the relation between any two ideas is accurately and justly traced, it will not be difficult for another to comprehend that relation, if in setting himself to discover it he brings the very same ideas into comparison. But if, on the contrary, he affixes to his words ideas different from those that were in the mind of him who first advanced the demonstration; it is evident that as the same ideas are not compared, the same relation cannot subsist, inasmuch that a proposition will be rejected as false, which, had the terms been rightly understood, must have appeared incontrovertibly true. A square, for instance, is a figure bounded by four equal right lines, joined together at right angles. Here the nature of the angles makes no less a part of the idea than the equality of the sides: and many properties demonstrated of the square flow entirely from its being a rectangular figure. If therefore we suppose a man, who has formed a partial notion of a square, comprehending only the equality of its sides, without regard to the angles, reading some demonstration that implies also this latter consideration; it is plain he would reject it as not universally true, inasmuch as it could not be applied where the sides were joined together at equal angles. For this last figure, answering still to his idea of a square, would be yet found without the property assigned to it in the proposition. But if he comes afterwards to correct his notion, and render his idea complete, he will then readily own the truth and justness of the demonstration.\n\nV. We see, therefore, that nothing contributes so much to the improvement and certainty of human knowledge, as the having determinate ideas, and procure a keeping them steady and invariable in all our discourse and reasonings about them. And on this account it is, that mathematicians, as was before observed, always advance...\nalways begin by defining their terms, and distinctly unfolding the notions they are intended to express. Hence such as apply themselves to these studies have exactly the same views of things; and, bringing always the very same ideas into comparison, readily discern the relations between them. It is likewise of importance, in every demonstration, to express the same idea invariably by the same word. From this practice mathematicians never deviate; and if it be necessary in their demonstrations, where the reader's comprehension is aided by a diagram, it is much more so in all reasonings about moral or intellectual truths where the ideas cannot be represented by a diagram. The observation of this rule may sometimes be productive of ill-founded periods; but when truth is the object, sound ought to be despised.\n\nVI. When the mathematicians have taken this first step, and made known the ideas whose relations they intend to investigate; their next care is, to lay down some self-evident truths, which may serve as a foundation for their future reasonings. And here indeed they proceed with remarkable circumspection, admitting no principles but what flow immediately from their definitions, and necessarily force themselves upon a mind in any degree attentive to its ideas. Thus a circle is a figure formed by a right line moving round some fixed point in the same plane. The fixed point round which the line is supposed to move, and where one of its extremities terminates, is called the centre of the circle. The other extremity, which is conceived to be carried round until it returns to the point whence it first let out, describes a curve running into itself, and termed the circumference. All right lines drawn from the centre to the circumference are called radii. From these definitions compared, geometricians derive this self-evident truth; that the radii of the same circle are all equal to one another.\n\nVII. We now observe, that in all propositions we either affirm or deny some property of the idea that constitutes the subject of our judgement, or we maintain that something may be done or effected. The first sort are called speculative propositions, as in the example mentioned above, the radius of the same circle are all equal one to another. The others are called practical, for a reason too obvious to be mentioned; thus, that a right line may be drawn from one point to another is a practical proposition; inasmuch as it expresses that something may be done.\n\nVIII. From this twofold consideration of propositions arises the twofold division of mathematical principles into axioms and postulates. By an axiom they understand any self-evident speculative truth; as, That the whole is greater than its parts; That things equal to one and the same thing are equal to one another. But a self-evident practical proposition is what they call a postulate. Such are those of Euclid; that a finite right line may be continued directly forwards; that a circle may be described about any centre with any distance. And here we are to observe, that as in an axiom the agreement or disagreement between the subject and predicate must come under the immediate inspection of the mind; so in a postulate, not only the possibility of the thing asserted must be evident at first view, but also the manner in which it may be effected. For where this manner is not of itself apparent, the proposition comes under the notion of the demonstrable kind and is treated as such by geometrical writers. Thus, to draw a right line from one point to another, is assumed by Euclid as a postulate, because the manner of doing it is so obvious, as to require no previous teaching. But then it is not equally evident, how we are to construct an equilateral triangle. For this reason he advances it as a demonstrable proposition, lays down rules for the exact performance, and at the same time proves, that if these rules are followed, the figure will be justly described.\n\nIX. This leads us to take notice, that as self-evident and demonstrable truths are distinguished into different kinds, according as they are speculative or practical; so is it also with demonstrable propositions. A demonstrable speculative proposition is by mathematicians called a theorem. Such is the famous 47th proposition of the first book of the Elements, known by the name of the Pythagorean theorem, from its supposed inventor Pythagoras, viz. \"that in every right-angled triangle, the square described upon the side subtending the right angle is equal to both the squares described upon the sides containing the right angle.\" On the other hand, a demonstrable practical proposition is called a problem; as where Euclid teaches us to describe a square upon a given right line.\n\nX. It may not be amiss to add, that, besides the Corollaries four kinds of propositions already mentioned, mathematicians have also a fifth, known by the name of corollaries. These are usually subjoined to theorems or problems, and differ from them only in this: that they flow from what is there demonstrated in so obvious a manner as to discover their dependence upon the proposition whence they are deduced, almost as soon as propounded. Thus Euclid having demonstrated, \"that in every right-lined triangle all the three angles taken together are equal to two right angles;\" adds by way of corollary, \"that all the three angles of any one triangle taken together are equal to all the three angles of any other triangle taken together:\" which is evident at first sight; because in all cases they are equal to two right ones, and things equal to one and the same thing are equal to one another.\n\nXI. The scholia of mathematicians are indifferently annexed to definitions, propositions, or corollaries; serve the same purpose as annotations upon a work of a classic author. For in them occasion is taken to explain whatever may appear intricate or obscure in a train of reasoning; to answer objections; to teach the application and uses of propositions; to lay open the original and history of the several discoveries made in the science; and, in a word, to acquaint us with all such particulars as deserve to be known, whether considered as points of curiosity or profit.\nPART III. OF REASONING.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Reasoning in general, and the Parts of which it consists.\n\nIT often happens in comparing ideas together, that their agreement or disagreement cannot be discerned at first view, especially if they are of such a nature as not to admit of an exact application one to another.\n\nWhen, for instance, we compare two figures of a different make, in order to judge of their equality or inequality, it is plain, that by barely considering the figures themselves, we cannot arrive at an exact determination; because, by reason of their disagreeing forms, it is impossible so to put them together, as that their several parts shall mutually coincide. Here then it becomes necessary to look out for some third idea that will admit of such an application as the present case requires; wherein if we succeed, all difficulties vanish, and the relation we are in quest of may be traced with ease. Thus, right-lined figures are all reduced to squares, by means of which we can measure their areas, and determine exactly their agreement or disagreement in point of magnitude.\n\nII. But how can any third idea serve to discover a relation between two others? The answer is, By being compared severally with these others; for such a comparison enables us to see how far the ideas with which this third is compared are connected or disjoined between themselves. In the example mentioned above of two right-lined figures, if we compare each of them with some square whose area is known, and find the one exactly equal to it, and the other less by a square inch, we immediately conclude that the area of the first figure is a square inch greater than that of the second. This manner of determining the relation between any two ideas, by the intervention of some third with which they may be compared, is that which we call reasoning; and is indeed the chief instrument by which we push on our discoveries, and enlarge our knowledge. The great art lies in finding out such intermediate ideas, as when compared with the others in the question, will furnish evident and known truths; because, as will afterwards appear, it is only by means of them that we arrive at the knowledge of what is hidden and remote.\n\nIII. Hence it appears, that every act of reasoning that constitutes an act wherein the ideas whose relation we want to discover are severally compared with the middle idea, and a third wherein they are themselves connected or disjoined, according to the result of that comparison. Now, as in the second part of logic, our judgements, when put into words, were called propositions, so here in the third part the expressions of our reasonings are termed syllogisms. And hence it follows, that as every act of reasoning implies three several judgements, so every syllogism must include three distinct propositions. When a reasoning is thus put into words, and appears in form of a syllogism, the intermediate idea made use of, to discover the agreement or disagreement, we search for, is called the middle term; and the two ideas themselves with which this third is compared, go by the name of the extremes.\n\nVI. But as these things are best illustrated by examples; let us, for instance, set ourselves to inquire whether men are accountable for their actions. As the account-relation between the ideas of man and accountability, comes not within the immediate view of the mind, our first care must be to find out some third idea that will enable us the more easily to discover and trace it. A very small measure of reflection is sufficient to inform us, that no creature can be accountable for his actions, unless we suppose him capable of distinguishing the good from the bad; that is, unless we suppose him possessed of reason. Nor is this alone sufficient. For what would it avail him to know good from bad actions, if he had no freedom of choice, nor could avoid the one and pursue the other? hence it becomes necessary to take in both considerations in the present case. It is at the same time equally apparent, that wherever there is ability of distinguishing good from bad actions, and of pursuing the one and avoiding the other, there also a creature is accountable. We have then got a third idea, with which accountability is inseparably connected, viz. reason and liberty; which are here to be considered as making up one complex conception. Let us now take this middle idea, and compare it with the other term in the question, viz. man, and we all know by experience that it may be affirmed of him. Having thus by means of the intermediate idea formed two several judgements, viz. that man is possessed of reason and liberty; and that reason and liberty imply accountability; a third obviously and necessarily follows, viz. that man is accountable for his actions. Here then we have a complete act of reasoning, in which, according to what has been already observed, there are three distinct judgements: two that may be styled previous, inasmuch as they lead to the other, and arise from comparing the middle idea with the two ideas in the question: the third is a consequence of these previous acts, and flows from combining the extreme ideas between themselves. If now we put this reasoning into words, it exhibits what logicians term a syllogism; and, when proposed in due form, runs thus:\n\n\"Every creature possessed of reason and liberty is accountable for his actions.\nMan is a creature possessed of reason and liberty:\nTherefore man is accountable for his actions.\"\n\nV. In this syllogism we may observe, that there are premises, three several propositions expressing the three judge-conclusions implied in the act of reasoning; and so disposed, as to represent distinctly what passes within the mind in tracing the more distant relations of its ideas. The two first propositions answer the two previous judgements in reasoning, and are called the premises, because they are placed before the other. The third is termed the conclusion, as being gained in consequence of what was asserted in the premises. We are also to remember,\nthat the terms expressing the two ideas whose relations we inquire after, as here man and accountability, are in general called the extremes; and that the intermediate idea, by means of which the relation is traced, viz., a creature possessed of reason and liberty, takes the name of the middle term. Hence it follows, that by the premises of a syllogism we are always to understand the two propositions where the middle term is severally compared with the extremes; for these constitute the previous judgements, whence the truth we are in quest of is by reasoning deduced. The conclusion is that other proposition, in which the extremes themselves are joined or separated agreeably to what appears upon the above comparison.\n\nVI. The conclusion is made up of the extreme terms of the syllogism: and the extreme, which serves as the predicate of the conclusion, goes by the name of the major term: the other extreme, which makes the subject in the same proposition, is called the minor term. From this distinction of the extremes arises also a distinction between the premises, where these extremes are severally compared with the middle term. That proposition which compares the greater extreme, or the predicate of the conclusion, with the middle term, is called the major proposition: the other, wherein the same middle term is compared with the subject of the conclusion or lesser extreme, is called the minor proposition. All this is obvious from the syllogism already given, where the conclusion is, Man is accountable for his actions. For here the predicate accountable for his actions being connected with the middle term in the first of the two premises, every creature possessed of reason and liberty is accountable for his actions, gives what we call the major proposition. In the second of the premises, man is a creature possessed of reason and liberty, we find the lesser extreme, or subject of the conclusion, viz., man, connected with the same middle term, whence it is known to be the minor proposition. When a syllogism is proposed in due form, the major proposition is always placed first, the minor next, and the conclusion last.\n\nVII. These things premised, we may in the general define reasoning to be an act or operation of the mind, deducing some unknown proposition from other previous ones that are evident and known. These previous propositions, in a simple act of reasoning, are only two in number; and it is always required that they be of themselves apparent to the understanding, inasmuch that we attend to and perceive the truth of them as soon as proposed. In the syllogism given above, the premises are supposed to be self-evident truths; otherwise the conclusion could not be inferred by a single act of reasoning. If, for instance, in the major, every creature possessed of reason and liberty is accountable for his actions, the connexion between the subject and predicate could not be perceived by a bare attention to the ideas themselves; it is evident that this proposition would not itself require a proof than the conclusion deduced from it. In this case a new middle term must be sought for, to trace the connexion here supposed; and this of course furnishes another syllogism, by which having established the proposition in question, we are then, and not before, at liberty to use it in any succeeding train of reasoning. And should it so happen, that in this second essay there was still some previous proposition whose truth did not appear at first sight, we must then have recourse to a third syllogism, in order to lay open that truth to the mind: because so long as the premises remain uncertain, the conclusion built upon them must be so too. When, by conducting our thoughts in this manner, we at last arrive at some syllogism where the previous propositions are intuitive truths; the mind then rests in full security, as perceiving that the several conclusions it has passed through stand upon the immoveable foundation of self-evidence, and when traced to their source terminate in it.\n\nVIII. We see, therefore, that in order to infer a conclusion by a single act of reasoning, the premises in the highest must be intuitive propositions. Where they are not, yet exercise previous syllogisms are required; in which case reasoning becomes a complicated act, taking in a variety of steps of successive steps. This frequently happens in tracing the more remote relation of our ideas; where, many middle terms being called in, the conclusion cannot be made out but in consequence of a series of syllogisms following one another in train. But although in this concatenation of propositions, those that form the premises of the last syllogism are often considerably removed from self-evidence; yet if we trace the reasoning backwards, we shall find them the conclusions of previous syllogisms, whose premises approach nearer and nearer to intuition in proportion as we advance, and are found at last to terminate in it. And if, after having thus unravelled a demonstration, we take it the contrary way; and observe how the mind, setting out with intuitive perceptions, couples them together to form a conclusion: how, by introducing this conclusion into another syllogism, it still advances one step farther; and so proceeds, making every new discovery subservient to its future progress; we shall then perceive clearly, that reasoning, in the highest sense of that faculty, is no more than an orderly combination of those simple acts which we have already fully explained.\n\nIX. Thus we see, that reasoning, beginning with first principles, rises gradually from one judgement to another, and connects them in such manner, that every stage of the progression brings intuitive certainty along of the process with it. And now at length we may clearly understand the definition given above of this distinguishing faculty of the human mind. Reason, we have said, is the ability of deducing unknown truths from principles or propositions that are already known. This evidently appears by the foregoing account, where we see that no proposition is admitted into a syllogism, to serve as one of the previous judgements on which the conclusion rests, unless it is itself a known and established truth, whose connexion with self-evident principles has been already traced.\n\nCHAP. II. Of the several kinds of Reasoning: and firstly, of that by which we determine the Genera and Species of Things.\n\nI. All the aims of human reason may in the general Reasoning be reduced to these two: 1. To rank things under twofold, those universal ideas to which they truly belong; and, 2. To ascribe to them their several attributes and properties in consequence of that distribution.\nII. One great aim of human reason is to determine the genera and species of things. We have seen in the First Part of this treatise, how the mind proceeds in framing general ideas*. We have also seen in the Second Part, how by means of these general ideas we come by universal propositions. Now as in these universal propositions we affirm some property of a genus or species, it is plain that we cannot apply this property to particular objects till we have first determined whether they are comprehended under that general idea of which the property is affirmed. Thus there are certain properties belonging to all even numbers, which nevertheless cannot be applied to any particular number, until we have first discovered it to be of the species expressed by that natural name. Hence reasoning begins with referring things to their several divisions and classes in the scale of our ideas; and as these divisions are all distinguished by particular names, we hereby learn to apply the terms expressing general conceptions to such particular objects as come under our immediate observation.\n\nIII. Now, in order to arrive at these conclusions, by which the several objects of perception are brought under general names, two things are manifestly necessary. First, That we take a view of the idea itself denoted by that general name, and carefully attend to the distinguishing marks which serve to characterize it. Secondly, That we compare this idea with the object under consideration, observing diligently wherever they agree or differ. If the idea is found to correspond with the particular object, we then without hesitation apply the general name; but if no such correspondence intervenes, the conclusion must necessarily take a contrary turn. Let us, for instance, take the number eight, and consider by what steps we are led to pronounce it an even number. First then, we call to mind the idea signified by the expression an even number, viz. that it is a number divisible into two equal parts. We then compare this idea with the number eight, and finding them manifestly to agree, see at once the necessity of admitting the conclusion. These several judgements therefore transferred into language, and reduced to the form of a syllogism, appear thus:\n\n\"Every number that may be divided into two equal parts is an even number:\n\"The number eight may be divided into two equal parts;\n\"Therefore the number eight is an even number.\"\n\nIV. Here it may be observed, that where the general idea, to which particular objects are referred, is very familiar to the mind, and frequently in view; this reference, and the application of the general name, seem to be made without any apparatus of reasoning. When we see a horse in the fields, or a dog in the street, we readily apply the name of the species; habit, and a familiar acquaintance with the general idea, suggesting it instantaneously to the mind. We are not however to imagine on this account that the understanding departs from the usual rules of just thinking. A frequent repetition of acts begets a habit; and habits are attended with a certain promptness of execution, that prevents our observing the several steps and gradations by which any course of action is accomplished. But in other instances, where we judge not by precontracted habits, as when the general idea is very complex, or less familiar to the mind, we always proceed according to the form of reasoning established above. A goldsmith, for instance, who is in doubt as to any piece of metal, whether it be of the species called gold, first examines its properties, and then comparing them with the general idea signified by that name, if he finds a perfect correspondence, no longer hesitates under what class of metals to rank it.\n\nV. Nor let it be imagined that our researches here, the great because in appearance bounded to the imposing of general names upon particular objects, are therefore of little consequence. Some of the most considerable debates among mankind, and such too as nearly regard their lives, interests, and happiness, turn wholly upon this article. Is it not the chief employment of our several courts of judicature to determine in particular instances, what is law, justice, and equity? Of what importance is it in many cases to decide aright whether an action shall be termed murder or manslaughter? We see then that no less than the lives and fortunes of men depend often upon these decisions. The reason is plain. Actions, when once referred to a general idea, draw after them all that may be affirmed of that idea; inasmuch that the determining the species of actions is all one with determining what proportion of praise or dispraise, commendation or blame, &c. ought to follow them. For as it is allowed that murder deserves death; by bringing any particular action under the head of murder, we of course decide the punishment due to it.\n\nVI. But the great importance of this branch of reasoning, and the necessity of care and circumspection in referring particular objects to general ideas, is still farther evident from the practice of the mathematicians. Every one who has read Euclid, knows, that cians frequently requires us to draw lines through certain points, and according to such and such directions. The figures thence resulting are often squares, parallelograms, or rectangles. Yet Euclid never supposes this from their bare appearance, but always demonstrates it upon the strictest principles of geometry. Nor is the method he takes in anything different from that described above. Thus, for instance, having defined a square to be a figure bounded by four equal sides joined together at right angles; when such a figure arises in any construction previous to the demonstration of a proposition, yet he never calls it by that name until he has shown that its sides are equal, and all its angles right ones. Now this is apparently the same form of reasoning we have before exhibited in proving eight to be an even number.\n\nVII. Having thus explained the rules by which we are to conduct ourselves in ranking particular objects under general ideas, and shown their conformity to a steady practice and manner of the mathematicians; it remains only to observe, that the true way of rendering names, rendering this part of knowledge both easy and certain, is by habituating ourselves to clear and determinate ideas, and keeping them steadily annexed to their respective words. For as all our aim is to apply general words and certain ideas, if these words stand for invariable ideas that are perfectly known to the mind, and can be readily distinguished upon occasion, there will be little danger\nof mistake or error in our reasonings. Let us suppose that, by examining any object, and carrying our attention successively from one part to another, we have acquainted ourselves with the several particulars observable in it. If among these we find such as constitute some general idea, framed and settled beforehand by the understanding, and distinguished by a particular name, the resemblance thus known and perceived necessarily determines the species of the object, and thereby gives it a right to the name by which that species is called. Thus four equal sides, joined together at right angles, make up the notion of a square. As this is a fixed and invariable idea, without which the general name cannot be applied; we never call any particular figure a square until it appears to have these several conditions; and contrarily, wherever a figure is found with these conditions, it necessarily takes the name of a square. The same will be found to hold in all our other reasonings of this kind, where nothing can create any difficulty but the want of settled ideas. If, for instance, we have not determined within ourselves the precise notion denoted by the word manlaughter, it will be impossible for us to decide whether any particular action ought to bear that name: because, however nicely we examine the action itself, yet, being strangers to the general idea with which it is to be compared, we are utterly unable to judge of their agreement or disagreement. But if we take care to remove this obstacle, and distinctly trace the two ideas under consideration, all difficulties vanish, and the resolution becomes both easy and certain.\n\nVIII. Thus we see of what importance it is towards the improvement and certainty of human knowledge, that we accustom ourselves to clear and determinate ideas, and a steady application of words.\n\nCHAP. III. Of Reasoning, as it regards the powers and Properties of Things, and the Relations of our general Ideas.\n\nI. We now come to the second great end which men have in view in their reasonings; namely, the discovering and ascribing to things their several attributes and properties. And here it will be necessary to distinguish between reasoning, as it regards the sciences, and as it concerns common life. In the sciences, our reason is employed chiefly about universal truths, it being by them alone that the bounds of human knowledge are enlarged. Hence the division of things into various classes, called otherwise genera and species. For these universal ideas being set up as the representatives of many particular things, whatever is affirmed of them may be also affirmed of all the individuals to which they belong. Murder, for instance, is a general idea, representing a certain species of human actions. Reason tells us that the punishment due to it is death. Hence every particular action, coming under the notion of murder, has the punishment of death allotted to it. Here then we apply the general truth to some obvious instance; and this is what properly constitutes the reasoning of common life. For men, in their ordinary transactions and intercourse one with another, have, for the most part, to do only with particular objects. Our friends and relations, their characters and behaviour, the constitution of the several bodies that surround us, and the uses to which they may be applied, are what chiefly engage our attention. In all these, we reason about particular things; and the whole result of our reasoning is, the applying the general truths of the sciences in the ordinary transactions of human life. When we see a viper, we avoid it. Wherever we have occasion for the forcible action of water to move a body that makes considerable resistance, we take care to convey it in such a manner that it shall fall upon the object with impetuosity. Now all this happens in consequence of our familiar and ready application of these two general truths. The bite of a viper is mortal. Water falling upon a body with impetuosity, acts very forcibly towards setting it in motion. In like manner, if we set ourselves to consider any particular character, in order to determine the share of praise or dispraise that belongs to it, our great concern is to ascertain exactly the proportion of virtue and vice. The reason is obvious. A just determination, in all cases of this kind, depends entirely upon an application of these general maxims of morality: Virtuous actions deserve praise; vicious actions deserve blame.\n\nII. Hence it appears that reasoning, as it regards the common life, is no more than the ascribing the general properties of things to those several objects with which we are more immediately concerned according as they are found to be of that particular division or common class to which the proprieties belong. The steps then by which we proceed are manifestly these. First, We refer the object under consideration to some general idea or class of things. We then recollect the several attributes of that general idea. And, lastly, Ascribe all those attributes to the present object. Thus, in considering the character of Sempronius, if we find it to be of the kind called virtuous, when we at the same time reflect that a virtuous character is deserving of esteem, it naturally and obviously follows that Sempronius is so too. These thoughts put into a syllogism, in order to exhibit the form of reasoning here required, run thus:\n\n\"Every virtuous man is worthy of esteem.\n\"Sempronius is a virtuous man:\n\"Therefore Sempronius is worthy of esteem.\"\n\nIII. By this syllogism it appears, that before we affirm any thing of a particular object, that object must next be referred to some general idea. Sempronius is pronounced worthy of esteem only in consequence of his being a virtuous man, or coming under that general branch of notion. Hence we see the necessary connexion of the reasoning various parts of reasoning, and the dependence they one upon another. The determining the genera and species of things is, as we have said, one exercise of human reason; and here we find that this exercise is the first in order, and previous to the other, which consists in ascribing to them their powers, properties, and relations. But when we have taken this previous step, and brought particular objects under general names; as the properties we ascribe to them are no other than those of the general idea, it is plain that, in order to a successful progress in this part of knowledge, we must thoroughly acquaint ourselves with the several relations and attributes of these our general ideas.\nPart III.\n\nLOGIC.\n\nWhen this is done, the other part will be easy, and requires scarce any labour or thought, as being no more than an application of the general form of reasoning represented in the foregoing syllogism. Now, as we have already sufficiently shown how we are to proceed in determining the genera and species of things, which, as we have said, is the previous step to this second branch of human knowledge; all that is farther wanting towards a due explanation of it is, to offer some considerations as to the manner of investigating the general relations of our ideas. This is the highest exercise of the powers of the understanding, and that by means whereof we arrive at the discovery of universal truths; insomuch that our deductions in this way constitute that particular species of reasoning which we have before laid regards principally the sciences.\n\nIV. But that we may conduct our thoughts with some order and method, we shall begin with observing, that the relations of our general ideas are of two kinds: either such as immediately discover themselves, upon comparing the ideas one with another; or such as, being more remote and distant, require art and contrivance to bring them into view. The relations of the first kind furnish us with intuitive and self-evident truths; those of the second are traced by reasoning, and a due application of intermediate ideas. It is of this last kind that we are to speak here, having depauperated what was necessary with regard to the other in the Second Part. As, therefore, in tracing the more distant relations of things, we must always have recourse to intervening ideas, and are more or less successful in our researches according to our acquaintance with these ideas, and ability of applying them; and it is evident, that to make a good reasoner, two things are principally required. First, An extensive knowledge of those intermediate ideas, by means of which things may be compared one with another. Secondly, The skill and talent of applying them happily in all particular instances that come under consideration.\n\nV. In order to our successful progress in reasoning, we must have an extensive knowledge of those intermediate ideas by means of which things may be compared one with another. For as it is not every idea that will answer the purpose of our inquiries, but such only as are peculiarly related to the objects about which we reason, so as, by a comparison with them to furnish evident and known truths; nothing is more apparent than that the greater variety of conceptions we can call into view, the more likely we are to find some among them that will help us to the truths here required. And, indeed, it is found to hold in experience, that in proportion as we enlarge our views of things, and grow acquainted with a multitude of different objects, the reasoning faculty gathers strength; for, by extending our sphere of knowledge, the mind acquires a certain force and penetration, as being accustomed to examine the several appearances of its ideas, and observe what light they cast one upon another.\n\nVI. This is the reason why, in order to excel remarkably in any one branch of learning, it is necessary to have at least a general acquaintance with the whole circle of arts and sciences. The truth of it is, all the various divisions of human knowledge are very nearly related among themselves, and, in innumerable instances, serve to illustrate and set off each other.\n\nAnd although it is not to be denied that, by an ob- To excel in flinate application to one branch of study, a man may anyone make considerable progress, and acquire some degree branch of of eminence in it; yet his views will be always narrow and contracted, and he will want that matterly in general discernment which not only enables us to pursue our acquaintance discoveries with ease, but also, in laying them open with the others, to spread a certain brightness around them. But when our reasoning regards a particular science, and science it is farther necessary that we more nearly acquaint ourselves with whatever relates to that science. A general knowledge is a good preparation, and enables us to proceed with ease and expedition in whatever branch of learning we apply to. But then, in the minute and intricate questions of any science, we are by no means qualified to reason with advantage until we have perfectly mastered the science to which they belong.\n\nVII. We come now to the second thing required, namely, the skill and talent of applying intermediate ideas happily in all particular instances that come under consideration. And here, rules and precepts are pily in particular instances. Use and experience are the best instructors. For, whatever logicians may boast of being able to form perfect reasoners by book and rule, we find by experience, that the study of their precepts does not always add any great degree of strength to the understanding. In short, it is the habit alone of reasoning that makes a reasoner. And therefore the true way to acquire this talent is, by being much conversant in those sciences where the art of reasoning is allowed to reign in the greatest perfection. Hence it was that the ancients, who so well understood the manner of forming the mind, always began with mathematics, as the foundation of their philosophical studies. Here the understanding is by degrees habituated to truth, contracts infinitely a certain fondness for it, and learns never to yield its affe- fect to any proposition but where the evidence is sufficient to produce full conviction. For this reason Plato has called mathematical demonstrations the cathartic or purgatives of the soul, as being the proper means to cleanse it from error, and restore that natural exercise of its faculties in which just thinking consists.\n\nVIII. If therefore we would form our minds to a The study habit of reasoning closely and in train, we cannot take any more certain method than the exercising our- selves in mathematical demonstrations, so as to contract a kind of familiarity with them. Not that we look great avail upon it as necessary that all men should be deep ma, in this re- thematicians; but that, having got the way of reason- ing which that study necessarily brings the mind to, they may be able to transfer it to other parts of knowl- ledge, as they shall have occasion.\n\nIX. But although the study of mathematics be of all others the most useful to form the mind and give it other sub- an early relish of truth, yet ought not other parts of objects, as are distinguished philosophy to be neglected. For there also we meet for with many opportunities of exercising the powers of strength the understanding; and the variety of subjects nature justifies rally of reasoning.\nrally leads us to observe all those different turns of thinking that are peculiarly adapted to the several ideas we examine, and the truth we search after. A mind thus trained acquires a certain mastery over its own thoughts, inasmuch that it can range and model them at pleasure, and call such into view as best suit its present designs. Now in this the whole art of reasoning consists; from among a great variety of different ideas to single out those that are most proper for the business in hand, and to lay them together in such order, that from plain and easy beginnings, by gentle degrees, and a continued train of evident truths, we may be insensibly led on to such discoveries, as at our first setting out appeared beyond the reach of human understanding. For this purpose, besides the study of mathematics before recommended, we ought to apply ourselves diligently to the reading of such authors as have distinguished themselves for strength of reasoning, and a just and accurate manner of thinking. For it is observable, that a mind exercised and seasoned to truth, seldom rests satisfied in a bare contemplation of the arguments offered by others; but will be frequently assaying its own strength, and pursuing its discoveries upon the plan it is most accustomed to. Thus we insensibly contract a habit of tracing truth from one stage to another, and of investigating those general relations and properties which we afterwards ascribe to particular things, according as we find them comprehended under the abstract ideas to which the properties belong.\n\nCHAP. IV. Of the Forms of Syllogisms.\n\nI. HITHERTO we have contented ourselves with a general notion of syllogisms, and of the parts of which they consist. It is now time to enter a little more particularly into the subject, to examine their various forms, and lay open the rules of argumentation proper to each. In the syllogisms mentioned in the foregoing chapters, we may observe, that the middle term is the subject of the major proposition, and the predicate of the minor. This disposition, though the most natural and obvious, is not however necessary; it frequently happens, that the middle term is the subject in both the premises, or the predicate in both; and sometimes, directly contrary to its disposition in the foregoing chapters, the predicate in the major, and the subject in the minor. Hence the division of syllogisms into various kinds, called figures by logicians. For figure, according to their use of the word, is nothing else but the order and disposition of the middle term in any syllogism. And as this disposition is, we see, fourfold, so the figures of syllogisms thence arising are four in number. When the middle term is the subject of the major proposition, and the predicate of the minor, we have what is called the first figure; As,\n\n\"No work of God is bad:\n\"The natural passions and appetites of men are\n\"the work of God:\n\"Therefore none of them is bad.\"\n\nIf, on the other hand, it is the predicate of both the premises, the syllogism is said to be the second figure: As,\n\n\"Whatever is bad is not the work of God:\n\"All the natural passions and appetites of men\n\"are the work of God:\n\"Therefore the natural passions and appetites of\n\"men are not bad.\"\n\nAgain, In the third figure, the middle term is the subject of the two premises: As,\n\n\"All Africans are black:\n\"All Africans are men:\n\"Therefore some men are black.\"\n\nAnd lastly, By making it the predicate of the major, and subject of the minor, we obtain syllogisms in the fourth figure: As,\n\n\"The only Being who ought to be worshipped is\n\"the Creator and Governor of the world:\n\"The Creator and Governor of the world is\n\"God:\n\"Therefore God is the only Being who ought to\n\"be worshipped.\"\n\nII. But, besides this fourfold distinction of syllogisms, there is also a farther subdivision of them in every figure, arising from the quantity and quality, as they are called, of the propositions. By quantity we mean the consideration of propositions, as universal or particular; by quality, as affirmative or negative.\n\nNow as, in all the several dispositions of the middle term, the propositions of which a syllogism consists may be either universal or particular, affirmative or negative; the due determination of these, and so putting them together as the laws of argumentation require, constitute what logicians call the moods of syllogisms. Of these moods there is a determinate number to every figure, including all the possible ways in which propositions differing in quantity or quality can be combined, according to any disposition of the middle term, in order to arrive at a just conclusion.\n\nThe first figure has only four legitimate moods. The major proposition in this figure must be universal, and the minor affirmative; and it has this property, that it yields conclusions of all kinds, affirmative and negative, universal and particular.\n\nThe second figure has also four legitimate moods. Its major proposition must be universal, and one of the premises must be negative. It yields conclusions both universal and particular, but all negative.\n\nThe third figure has six legitimate moods. Its minor must always be affirmative; and it yields conclusions both affirmative and negative, but all particular.\n\nThese are all the figures which were admitted by the inventor of syllogisms, and of which, so far as we know, the number of legitimate moods has been ascertained, and severally demonstrated. In every figure it will be found upon trial, that there are sixty-four different moods of syllogism; and he who thinks it worth while to construct so many in the fourth figure, always remembering that the middle term in each must be the predicate of the major and the subject of the minor proposition, will easily discern what number of these moods are legitimate, and give true conclusions.\n\nBesides the rules that are proper to each figure, Aristotle has given some that are common to all, by which the legitimacy of syllogisms may be tried.\nPart III.\n\nLOGIC.\n\nThere may be reduced to five:\n\n1. There must be only three terms in a syllogism: As each term occurs in two of the propositions, it must be precisely the same in both; if it be not, the syllogism is said to have four terms, which makes a vicious syllogism.\n\n2. The middle term must be taken universally in one of the premises.\n\n3. Both premises must not be particular propositions, nor both negative.\n\n4. The conclusion must be particular, if either of the premises be particular; and negative, if either of the premises be negative.\n\n5. No term can be taken universally in the conclusion, if it be not taken universally in the premises.\n\nFor understanding the second and fifth of these rules, it is necessary to observe, that a term is said to be taken universally, not only when it is the subject of a universal proposition, but also when it is the predicate of a negative proposition. On the other hand, a term is said to be taken particularly, when it is either the subject of a particular or the predicate of an affirmative proposition.\n\nIII. The division of syllogisms according to mood and figure reflects those especially which are known by the name of plain simple syllogisms; that is, which are bounded to three propositions, all simple, and where the extremes and middle term are connected, according to the rules laid down above. But as the mind is not tied down to any one precise form of reasoning, but sometimes makes use of more, sometimes of fewer premises, and often takes in compound and conditional propositions, it may not be amiss to take notice of the different forms derived from this source, and explain the rules by which the mind conducts itself in the use of them.\n\nIV. When in any syllogism the major is a conditional proposition, the syllogism itself is termed conditional. Thus:\n\n\"If there is a God, he ought to be worshipped:\n\"But there is a God:\n\"Therefore he ought to be worshipped.\"\n\nIn this example, the major, or first proposition, is, we see, conditional, and therefore the syllogism itself is also of the kind called by that name. And here we are to observe, that all conditional propositions are made of two distinct parts: one expressing the condition upon which the predicate agrees or disagrees with the subject, as in this now before us, \"if there is a God;\" the other joining or disjoining the said predicate and subject, as here, \"he ought to be worshipped.\" The first of these parts, or that which implies the condition, is called the antecedent; the second, where we join or disjoin the predicate and subject, has the name of the consequent.\n\nV. In all propositions of this kind, supposing them to be exact in point of form, the relation between the antecedent and consequent must ever be true and real; that is, the antecedent must always contain some certain and genuine condition, which necessarily implies the consequent; for otherwise the proposition itself will be false, and therefore ought not to be admitted into our reasonings. Hence it follows, that when any conditional proposition is assumed, if we admit the antecedent of that proposition, we must at the same time necessarily admit the consequent; but if we reject the consequent, we are in like manner bound to reject the antecedent. For as the antecedent always expresses some condition which necessarily implies the truth of the consequent; by admitting the antecedent, we allow of that condition, and therefore ought also to admit the consequent. In like manner, if it appears that the consequent ought to be rejected, the antecedent evidently must be so too: because, as was just now demonstrated, the admitting of the antecedent would necessarily imply the admission also of the consequent.\n\nVI. There are two ways of arguing in hypothetical syllogisms, which lead to a certain and unavoidable conclusion. For as the major is always a conditional proposition, consisting of an antecedent and a consequent; if the minor admits the antecedent, it is plain that the conclusion must admit the consequent. This is called arguing from the admission of the antecedent to the admission of the consequent, and constitutes that mood or species of hypothetical syllogisms which is distinguished in the schools by the name of the modus ponens; inasmuch as by it the whole conditional proposition, both antecedent and consequent, is established. Thus:\n\n\"If God is infinitely wise, and acts with perfect freedom, he does nothing but what is best:\n\"But God is infinitely wise, and acts with perfect freedom:\n\"Therefore he does nothing but what is best.\"\n\nHere we see the antecedent or first part of the conditional proposition is established in the minor, and the consequent or second part in the conclusion; whence the syllogism itself is an example of the modus ponens. But if now we on the contrary suppose that the minor reject the consequent, then it is apparent that the conclusion must also reject the antecedent. In this case we are said to argue from the removal of the consequent to the removal of the antecedent, and the particular mood or species of syllogisms thence arising is called by logicians the modus tollens; because in it both antecedent and consequent are rejected or taken away, as appears by the following example:\n\n\"If God were not a Being of infinite goodness, neither would he consult the happiness of his creatures:\n\"But God does consult the happiness of his creatures:\n\"Therefore he is a Being of infinite goodness.\"\n\nVII. These two species take in the whole class of They include all the possible ways of arguing that lead to a legitimate conclusion; because we cannot here proceed by a contrary process of arguing, that is, from the removal of the antecedent to the removal of the consequent, or from the establishing of the consequent to the establishing of the antecedent. For although the antecedent always expresses some real condition, which, once admitted, necessarily implies the consequent, yet it does not follow that there is therefore no other condition; and if so, then, after removing the antecedent, the consequent may still hold, because of some other determination that infers it. When we say, If a stone is exposed some time to the rays of the sun, it will contract a certain degree of heat; the proposition is certainly true; and, admitting the antecedent, we must also admit...\nadmit the consequent. But as there are other ways by which a stone may gather heat, it will not follow, from the ceasing of the before-mentioned condition, that therefore the consequent cannot take place. In other words, we cannot argue: *But the stone has not been exposed to the rays of the sun; therefore neither has it any degree of heat:* Inasmuch as there are a great many other ways by which heat might have been communicated to it. And if we cannot argue from the removal of the antecedent to the removal of the consequent, no more can we from the admission of the consequent to the admission of the antecedent: because, as the consequent may flow from a great variety of different suppositions, the allowing of it does not determine the precise supposition, but only that some one of them must take place. Thus in the foregoing proposition, *If a stone is exposed some time to the rays of the sun, it will contract a certain degree of heat;* admitting the consequent, viz. that it has contracted a certain degree of heat, we are not therefore bound to admit the antecedent, that it has been some time exposed to the rays of the sun: because there are many other causes whence that heat may have proceeded. These two ways of arguing, therefore, hold not in conditional syllogisms.\n\nVIII. As from the major's being a conditional proposition, we obtain the species of conditional syllogisms: so, where it is a disjunctive proposition, the syllogism to which it belongs is also called disjunctive, as in the following example:\n\n\"The world is either self-existent, or the work of some finite, or of some infinite Being:\n\"But it is not self-existent, nor the work of a finite being:\n\"Therefore it is the work of an infinite Being.\"\n\nNow, a disjunctive proposition is that, where of several predicates, we affirm one necessarily to belong to the subject, to the exclusion of all the rest, but leave that particular one undetermined. Hence it follows, that as soon as we determine the particular predicate, all the rest are of course to be rejected; or if we reject all the predicates but one, that one necessarily takes place. When, therefore, in a disjunctive syllogism, the several predicates are enumerated in the major; if the minor establishes any one of these predicates, the conclusion ought to remove all the rest; or if, in the minor, all the predicates but one are removed, the conclusion must necessarily establish that one. Thus, in the disjunctive syllogism given above, the major affirms one of the three predicates to belong to the earth, viz. self-existence, or that it is the work of a finite, or that it is the work of an infinite Being. Two of these predicates are removed in the minor, viz. self-existence, and the work of a finite being. Hence the conclusion necessarily attributes to it the third predicate, and affirms that it is the work of an infinite Being. If now we give the syllogism another turn, inasmuch that the minor may establish one of the predicates, by affirming the earth to be the production of an infinite Being: then the conclusion must remove the other two, asserting it to be neither self-existent, nor the work of a finite being. These are the forms of reasoning in these species of syllogisms, the justness of which appears at first sight: and that there can be no other, is evident from the very nature of a disjunctive proposition.\n\nIX. In the several kinds of syllogisms hitherto mentioned, we may observe that the parts are complete; imperfect that is, the three propositions of which they consist are or mutually represented in form. But it often happens, that some syllogism one of the premises is not only an evident truth, but also familiar and in the minds of all men; in which case it is usually omitted, whereby we have an imperfect syllogism, that seems to be made up of only two propositions. Should we, for instance, argue in this manner:\n\n\"Every man is mortal:\n\"Therefore every king is mortal:\n\nthe syllogism appears to be imperfect, as consisting but of two propositions. Yet it is really complete; only the minor [*every king is a man*] is omitted: and left to the reader to supply, as being a proposition so familiar and evident that it cannot escape him.\n\nX. These seemingly imperfect syllogisms are called enthymemes; and occur very frequently in reasoning, especially where it makes a part of common conversation. Nay, there is a particular elegance in them, because, not displaying the argument in all its parts, they leave somewhat to the exercise and invention of the mind. By this means we are put upon exerting ourselves, and seem to share in the discovery of what is propounded to us. Now this is the great secret of fine writing, so to frame and put together our thoughts, as to give full play to the reader's imagination, and draw him infallibly into our very views and course of reasoning. This gives a pleasure not unlike to that which the author himself feels in composing. It befits shortens discourse, and adds a certain force and liveliness to our arguments, when the words in which they are conveyed favour the natural quickness of the mind in its operations, and a single expression is left to exhibit a whole train of thoughts.\n\nXI. But there is another species of reasoning with ground of two propositions, which seems to be complete in itself, reasoning in immediate and where we admit the conclusion without supposing intermediate any tacit or suppressed judgement in the mind, from which it follows syllogistically. This happens between propositions, where the connexion is such, that the admission of the one necessarily and at the first sight implies the admission also of the other. For if it so falls out, that the proposition on which the other depends is self-evident, we content ourselves with barely affirming it, and infer that other by a direct conclusion. Thus, by admitting an universal proposition, we are forced also to admit of all the particular propositions comprehended under it, this being the very condition that constitutes a proposition universal. If then that universal proposition chances to be self-evident, the particular ones follow of course, without any farther train of reasoning. Whoever allows, for instance, that things equal to one and the same thing are equal to one another, must at the same time allow, that two triangles, each equal to a square whose side is three inches, are also equal between themselves. This argument therefore,\n\n\"Things equal to one and the same thing, are equal to one another:\n\"Therefore,\"\n\" Therefore these two triangles, each equal to the square of a line of three inches, are equal between themselves\"—is complete in its kind, and contains all that is necessary towards a just and legitimate conclusion. For the first or universal proposition is self-evident, and therefore requires no farther proof. And as the truth of the particular is inseparably connected with that of the universal, it follows from it by an obvious and unavoidable consequence.\n\nXII. Now, in all cases of this kind, where propositions are deduced one from another, on account of a known and evident connexion, we are said to reason by immediate consequence. Such a coherence of propositions manifest at first sight, and forcing itself upon the mind, frequently occurs in reasoning. Logicians have explained at some length the several suppositions upon which it takes place, and allow of all immediate consequences that follow in conformity to them. It is however observable, that these arguments, though seemingly complete, because the conclusion follows necessarily from the single proposition that goes before, may yet be considered as real enthymemes, whose major, which is a conditional proposition, is wanting. The syllogism but just mentioned, when represented according to this view, will run as follows:\n\n\"If things equal to one and the same thing, are equal to one another; these two triangles, each equal to a square whose side is three inches, are also equal between themselves.\n\nBut things equal to one and the same thing, are equal to one another:\n\nTherefore also these triangles, &c. are equal between themselves.\"\n\nThis observation will be found to hold in all immediate consequences whatsoever, infomuch, that they are in fact no more than enthymemes of hypothetical syllogisms. But then it is particular to them, that the ground on which the conclusion rests, namely its coherence with the minor, is of itself apparent, and seen immediately to flow from the rules and reasons of logic.\n\nXIII. The next species of reasoning we shall take notice of here is what is commonly known by the name of a fortis. This is a way of arguing, in which a great number of propositions are so linked together, that the predicate of one becomes continually the subject of the next following, until at last a conclusion is formed, by bringing together the subject of the first proposition, and the predicate of the last. Of this kind is the following argument:\n\n\"God is omnipotent:\nAn omnipotent Being can do every thing possible:\nHe that can do every thing possible, can do whatever involves not a contradiction:\nTherefore God can do whatever involves not a contradiction.\"\n\nThis particular combination of propositions may be continued to any length we please without in the least weakening the ground upon which the conclusion rests. The reason is, because the fortis itself may be resolved into as many simple syllogisms as there are middle terms in it; where this is found universally to hold, that when such a resolution is made, and the syllogisms are placed in train, the conclusion of the last in the series is also the conclusion of the fortis. This kind of argument, therefore, as it serves to unite several syllogisms into one, must stand upon the same foundation with the syllogisms of which it consists, and is indeed, properly speaking, no other than a compendious way of reasoning syllogistically.\n\nXIV. What is here said of plain simple propositions may be as well applied to those that are conditional; that is, any number of them may be so joined together in a series, that the consequent of one shall become continually the antecedent of the next following; in which case, by establishing the antecedent of the first proposition, we establish the consequent of the last, or by removing the last consequent remove also the first antecedent. This way of reasoning is exemplified in the following argument:\n\n\"If we love any person, all emotions of hatred towards him cease:\nIf all emotions of hatred towards a person cease, we cannot rejoice in his misfortunes:\nIf we rejoice not in his misfortunes, we certainly wish him no injury:\nTherefore, if we love a person, we wish him no injury.\"\n\nIt is evident that this fortis, as well as the last, may be resolved into a series of distinct syllogisms, with this only difference, that here the syllogisms are all conditional.\n\nXV. The last species of syllogism we shall take notice of in this chapter is that commonly distinguished of argued by the name of a dilemma. A dilemma is an argument by which we endeavour to prove the absurdity or falsehood of some assertion. In order to this, we assume a conditional proposition, the antecedent of which is the assertion to be disproved, and the consequent a disjunctive proposition, enumerating all the possible suppositions upon which that assertion can take place. If then it appears, that all these several suppositions ought to be rejected, it is plain, that the antecedent or assertion itself must be so too. When therefore such a proposition as that before mentioned is made the major of any syllogism; if the minor rejects all the suppositions contained in the consequent, it follows necessarily, that the conclusion ought to reject the antecedent, which, as we have said, is the very assertion to be disproved. This particular way of arguing is that which logicians call a dilemma; and from the account here given of it, it appears that we may in the general define it to be a hypothetical syllogism, where the consequent of the major is a disjunctive proposition, which is wholly taken away or removed in the minor. Of this kind is the following:\n\n\"If God did not create the world perfect in its kind, it must either proceed from want of inclination, or from want of power:\nBut it could not proceed either from want of inclination, or from want of power:\nTherefore, he created the world perfect in its kind.\"\nLOGIC.\n\nPart III.\n\nOf Reasoning.\n\n\"kind.\" Or, which is the same thing: \"It is absurd to say that he did not create the world perfect in its kind.\"\n\nAn universal description of it.\n\nXVI. The nature then of a dilemma is universally this. The major is a conditional proposition, whose consequent contains all the several suppositions upon which the antecedent can take place. As therefore these suppositions are wholly removed in the minor, it is evident that the antecedent must be so too; in much that we here always argue from the removal of the consequent to the removal of the antecedent. That is, a dilemma is an argument in the modus tollens of hypothetical syllogisms, as logicians love to speak. Hence it is plain, that if the antecedent of the major is an affirmative proposition, the conclusion of the dilemma will be negative; but if it is a negative proposition, the conclusion will be affirmative.\n\nCHAP. V. Of Induction.\n\nI. All reasoning proceeds ultimately from first truths, either self-evident or taken for granted; and the first truths of syllogistic reasoning are general propositions. But except in the mathematics, and such other sciences as, being conversant about mere ideas, have no immediate relation to things without the mind, we cannot assume as truths propositions which are general. The mathematician indeed may be considered as taking his ideas from the beginning in their general form. Every proposition composed of such ideas is therefore general; and those which are theoretic are reducible to two parts or terms, a predicate and a subject, with a copula generally affirmative. If the agreement or the relation between the two terms be not immediate and self-evident, he has recourse to an axiom, which is a proposition still more general, and which supplies him with a third or middle term. This he compares first with the predicate, and then with the subject, or vice versa. These two comparisons, when drawn out in form, make two propositions, which are called the premises; and if they happen to be immediate and self-evident, the conclusion, consisting of the terms of the question proposed, is said to be demonstrated. This method of reasoning is conducted exactly in the syllogistic form explained in the preceding chapter.\n\nII. But in sciences which treat of things external to the mind, we cannot assume as first principles the most general propositions, and from them infer others less and less general till we descend to particulars. The reason is obvious. Everything in the universe, whether of mind or body, presents itself to our observation in its individual state; so that perception and judgement employed in the investigation of truth, whether physical, metaphysical, moral, or historical, have in the first place to encounter with particulars. With these reason begins, or should begin, its operations. It observes, tries, canvasses, examines, and compares them together, and judges of them by some of those native evidences and original lights, which, as they are the first and indispensable inlets of knowledge to the mind, have been called the primary principles of truth.\" See Metaphysics.\n\nIII. \"By such acts of observation and judgement, diligently practised and frequently repeated, on many in which, by individuals of the same class or of a similar nature, not attending their agreements, marking their differences however general or ever minute, and rejecting all instances which, however similar in appearance, are not in effect the same, reason, with much labour and attention, extracts some general laws respecting the powers, properties, qualities, actions, passions, virtues, and relations of real things. This is no hasty, premature, notional abstraction of the mind, by which images and ideas are formed that have no archetypes in nature: it is a rational, operative, experimental process, instituted and executed upon the constitution of beings, which in part compose the universe. By this process reason advances from particulars to generals, from less general to more general, till by a series of slow progression, and by regular degrees, it arrive at the most general notions, called forms or formal causes (c). And by affirming or denying a genus of a species, or an accident of a substance or class of substances, through all the stages of the gradation, we form conclusions, which, if logically drawn, are axioms (d), or general propositions ranged one above another,\n\n(c) Qui formas novit, is, quae adhuc non facta sunt, qualia nec naturae vicissitudines, nec experimentales industrice unquam in actum produxissent, nec cogitationem humanam subiure sufflent, detegit et educit. Baconi Nov. Org.\n\n(d) The word axiom, ἀξίωμα, literally signifies dignity: Hence it is used metaphorically to denote a general truth or maxim, and sometimes any truth that is self-evident, which is called a dignity on account of its importance in a process of reasoning. The axioms of Euclid are propositions extremely general; and so are the axioms of the Newtonian philosophy. But these two kinds of axioms have very different origins. The former appear true upon a bare contemplation of our ideas; whereas the latter are the result of the most laborious induction. Lord Bacon therefore strenuously contends that they should never be taken upon conjecture, or even upon the authority of the learned; but that, as they are the general principles and grounds of all learning, they should be canvassed and examined with the most scrupulous attention, \"ut axiomatum corrigatur iniquitas, quae plerumque in exemplis vulgatis fundamentum habent;\" De Augm. Sc. lib. ii. cap. 2. \"Atque illa ipsa putativa principia ad rationes reddendas compellare decrevimus, quoique plane constat:\" Distr. Operis.—Dr Tatham makes a distinction between axioms intuitive and axioms self-evident. Intuitive axioms, according to him, pass through the first inlets of knowledge, and flash direct conviction on the minds, as external objects do on the senses, of all men. Other axioms, though not intuitive, may be properly said to be self-evident; because, in their formation, reason judges by single comparisons without the help of a third idea or middle term; so that they have their evidence in themselves, and though inductively framed they cannot be syllogistically proved. If this distinction be just, and we think it is, only particular truths can be intuitive axioms.\nIV. \"Thus, for instance, the evidence of the external senses is obviously the primary principle from which all physical knowledge is derived. But, whereas nature begins with causes, which, after a variety of changes, produce effects, the senses open upon the effects, and from them, through the slow and painful road of experiment and observation, ascend to causes. By experiments and observations skilfully chosen, artfully conducted, and judiciously applied, the philosopher advances from one stage of inquiry to another in the rational investigation of the general causes of physical truth. From different experiments and observations made on the same individual subject, and from the same experiments and observations made on different subjects of the same kind, by comparing and judging, he discovers some qualities, causes, or phenomena, which, after carefully distinguishing and rejecting all contradictory instances that occur, he finds common to many. Thus from many collateral comparisons and judgments formed upon particulars, he ascends to generals; and by a repetition of the same industrious process and laborious investigation, he advances from general to more general, till at last he is enabled to form a few of the most general, with their attributes and operations, into axioms or secondary principles, which are the well-founded laws enacted and enforced by the God of nature.—This is that just and philosophic method of reasoning which found logic procribes in this as well as in other parts of learning; by which, through the slow but certain road of experiment and observation, the mind ascends from appearances to qualities, from effects to causes; and from experiments upon many particular subjects forms general propositions concerning the powers and properties of physical body.\n\nV. \"Axioms to investigated and established are applicable to all parts of learning, and are the indispensable, and indeed the wonderful expedients, by which, in every branch of knowledge, reason pushes on its inquiries in the particular pursuit of truth: and the method of reasoning by which they are formed, is that of true and legitimate induction; which is therefore by Lord Bacon, the best and soundest of logicians, called the key of interpretation.\n\nVI. \"Instead of taking his axioms arbitrarily out of the great families of the categories (see Category), and erecting them by his own sophistical invention into the principles upon which his disputation was to be employed, had the analytical genius of Aristotle presented us with the laws of the true inductive logic, by which axioms are philosophically formed, and had he with his usual sagacity given us an example of it in a single branch of science; he would have brought to the temple of truth, an offering more valuable than he has done by the aggregate of all his logic and philosophical productions.\n\nVII. \"In all sciences, except the mathematics, it is only after the inductive process has been industriously pursued and successfully performed, that definition may be logically and usefully introduced, by beginning with the genus, passing through all the graduate and subordinate stages, and marking the specific difference as it descends, till it arrive at the individual, which is the reasoning subject of the question. And by adding an affirmation or negation of the attribute of the genus or the species or individual, or of a general accident on the particular substance so defined, making the definition a proposition, the truth of the question will be logically solved without any farther process. So that instead of being the first, as employed by the logic in common use, definition may be the last act of reason in the search of truth in general.\n\nVIII. \"These axioms or general propositions, thus and by inductively established, become another species of principles, which may be properly called secondary, and which lay the foundation of the syllogistic method of reasoning. When these are formed, but not before, we may safely admit the maxim with which logicians set out in the exercise of their art, as the great hinge on which their reasoning and disputation turn: From truths that are already known, to derive other which are not known. Or, to state it more comprehensively, so as to apply to probable as well as to scientific reasoning—From truths which are better known, to derive others which are less known. Philosophically speaking, syllogistic reasoning is, under general propositions to reduce others which are less general or which are particular; for the inferior ones are known to be true, only as we trace their connexion with the superior. Logically speaking, it is, To predicate a genus of a species or individual comprehended under it, or an accident of the substance in which it is inherent.\n\nIX. \"Thus induction and syllogism are the two methods of direct reasoning corresponding to the two kinds of principles, primary and secondary, on which syllogism is founded, and by which they are respectively different. In both methods, indeed, reason proceeds by judging and comparing, but the process is different throughout; and though it may have the sanction of Aristotle, an inductive syllogism is a fallacy.\n\nX. \"Till general truths are ascertained by induction, the third or middle terms by which syllogisms are the foundation are nowhere safely to be found. So that another position of the Stagyrite, that syllogism is naturally prior in order to induction, is equally unfounded; for induction does not only naturally but necessarily precede syllogism; and, except in mathematics, is in every respect indispensable to its existence; since, till generals are established, there can be neither definition, proposition, nor axiom, and of course no syllogism. And as induction is the first, so is it the most essential and fundamental instrument of reasoning: for as syllogism cannot produce its own principles, it must have them from induction; and if the general propositions or secondary principles be imperfectly or infirmly established, and much more if they be taken at hazard, upon authority, or by arbitrary assumption like those of Aristotle, all the syllogizing in the world is a vain and useless logicality, only instrumental to the multiplication of false learning, and to the invention and confirmation of error. The truth of syllogisms depends ultimately on the truth of axioms, and the truth of axioms on the foundations of inductions (E).”—But though induction is\n\n(E) This chapter is almost wholly taken from Tatham's Chart and Scale of Truth; a work which, notwithstanding\nprior in order, as well as superior in utility, to syllogism; we have thought it expedient to treat of it last; both because syllogism is an easier exercise of the reasoning faculty than induction, and because it is the method of mathematics, the first science of reason in which the student is commonly initiated.\n\nChap. VI. Of Demonstration.\n\nI. Having dispatched what seemed necessary to be said with regard to the two methods of direct reasoning, induction and syllogism; we now proceed to consider the laws of demonstration. And here it must be acknowledged, that in strict demonstration, which removes from the mind all possibility of doubt or error, the inductive method of reasoning can have no place. When the experiments and observations from which the general conclusion is drawn are numerous and extensive, the result of this mode of reasoning is moral certainty; and could the induction be made complete, it would be absolute certainty, equally convincing with mathematical demonstration. But however numerous and extensive the observations and experiments may be upon which an inductive conclusion is established, they must of necessity come short of the number and extent of nature; which, in some cases, by its immensity, will defeat all possibility of their co-extension; and in others, by its distance, lies out of the reach of their immediate application. Though truth does not appear in all other departments of learning with that bold and resolute conviction with which it presides in the mathematical science, it thines through them all, if not interrupted by prejudice or perverted by error, with a clear and useful, though inferior strength. And as it is not necessary for the general safety or convenience of a traveller, that he should always enjoy the heat and splendor of a mid-day sun, whilst he can with more ease pursue his journey under the weaker influence of a morning or an evening ray; so it is not requisite, for the various concerns and purposes of life, that men should be led by truth of the most redundant brightness. Such truth is to be had only in those sciences which are conversant about ideas and their various relations; where every thing being certainly what it appears to be, definitions and axioms arise from mere intuition. Here syllogism takes up the process from the beginning; and by a sublime intellectual motion advances from the simplest axioms to the most complicated speculations, and exhibits truth springing out of its first and purest elements, and spreading on all sides into a system of science. As each step in the progress of syllogistic, we shall endeavour to explain the use and application of syllogisms in this species of reasoning.\n\nWe have seen, that in all the different appearances they put on, we still arrive at a just and legitimate conclusion; now it often happens, that the conclusion of one syllogism becomes a previous proposition in another; by which means great numbers of them are sometimes linked together in a series, and truths are made to follow one another in train. And as in such a concatenation of syllogisms all the various ways of reasoning that are truly conclusive may be with safety introduced; hence it is plain, that in deducing any truth from its first principles, especially where it lies at a considerable distance from them, we are at liberty to combine all the several kinds of syllogisms above explained, according as they are found best to suit the end and purpose of our inquiries. When a proposition is thus, by means of syllogisms, collected from others more evident and known, it is said to be proved; so that we may in the general define the proof of a proposition to be a syllogism, or series of syllogisms, collecting that proposition from known and evident truths. But more particularly, if the syllogisms of which the proofs consist admit of no premises but definitions, self-evident truths, and propositions already established, then is the argument so constituted called a demonstration; whereby it appears that demonstrations are ultimately founded on definitions and self-evident propositions.\n\nII. All syllogisms whatsoever, whether compound, all syllogism, or defective, are reducible to plain simple syllogisms whatever syllogisms in some one of the four figures. But this is reducible to all syllogisms of the first figure, in particular to the first figure, that is, any proposition whatsoever, whether an universal affirmation or universal negative, a particular affirmative or particular negative, which fourfold division embraces all their varieties; any one of these may be inferred by virtue of some syllogism in the first figure. By this means it happens that the syllogisms of all the other figures are reducible also to syllogisms of the first figure, and may be considered as standing on the same foundation with them. We cannot here demonstrate and explain the manner of this reduction, because it would too much swell the bulk of this treatise. It is enough to take notice that the thing is universally known and allowed among logicians, to whose writings we refer such as desire farther satisfaction in this matter. This then being laid down, it is plain that any demonstration whatsoever may be considered as composed of a series of syllogisms, all in the first figure. For, since all the syllogisms that enter the demonstration are reducible to syllogisms of some one of the four figures; and since the syllogisms of all the other figures are farther reducible to syllogisms of the first figure, it is evident, that the whole demonstration may be resolved into a series of these last syllogisms. Let us now, if possible, discover the ground upon which the conclusion rests in syllogisms of the first figure; because, by so doing, we shall come at an universal principle of certainty, whence the evidence of all demonstrations in all their parts may be ultimately derived.\n\nIII. The rules then of the first figure are briefly these. The middle term is the subject of the major proposition, and the predicate of the minor. The major is always an universal proposition and the minor always affirmative. Let us now see what effect these rules will have in reasoning. The major is an universal proposition of which the middle term is the subject.\nOf subject, and the predicate of the conclusion the predicate. Hence it appears, that in the major the predicate of the conclusion is always affirmed or denied universally of the middle term. Again, The minor is an affirmative proposition, whereof the subject of the conclusion is the subject, and the middle term the predicate. Here then the middle term is affirmed of the subject of the conclusion; that is, the subject of the conclusion is affirmed to be comprehended under, or to make a part of, the middle term. Thus then we see what is done in the premises of a syllogism of the first figure. The predicate of the conclusion is universally affirmed or denied of some idea. The subject of the conclusion is affirmed to be or to make a part of that idea. Hence it naturally and unavoidably follows, that the predicate of the conclusion ought to be affirmed or denied of the subject. To illustrate this by an example, we shall resume one of the syllogisms of the first chapter.\n\n\"Every creature possessed of reason and liberty is accountable for his actions:\n\"Man is a creature possessed of reason and liberty:\n\"Therefore man is accountable for his actions.\"\n\nHere, in the first proposition, the predicate of the conclusion, accountability, is affirmed of all creatures that have reason and liberty. Again, In the second proposition, man, the subject of the conclusion, is affirmed to be or to make a part of this class of creatures. Hence the conclusion necessarily and unavoidably follows, viz. that man is accountable for his actions; because, if reason and liberty be that which constitutes a creature accountable, and man has reason and liberty, it is plain he has that which constitutes him accountable. In like manner, where the major is a negative proposition, or denies the predicate of the conclusion universally of the middle term, as the minor always affirms the subject of the conclusion to be or make a part of that middle term, it is no less evident that the predicate of the conclusion ought in this case to be denied of the subject. So that the ground of reasoning, in all syllogisms of the first figure, is manifestly this: \"Whatever may be affirmed universally of any idea, may be affirmed of every or any number of particulars comprehended under that idea.\"\n\nAnd again: \"Whatever may be denied universally of any idea, may be in like manner denied of every or any number of its individuals. These two propositions are called by logicians the dictum de omni, and dictum de nullo; and are indeed the great principles of syllogistic reasoning, inasmuch as all conclusions whatsoever rest immediately upon them, or upon propositions deduced from them. But what adds greatly to their value is, that they are really self-evident truths, and such as we cannot gainsay without running into an express contradiction. To affirm, for instance, that no man is perfect, and yet argue that some men are perfect; or to say that all men are mortal, and yet that some men are not mortal, is to assert a thing to be and not to be at the same time.\n\nIV. And now we may affirm, that, in all syllogisms of the first figure, if the premises are true, the conclusion must needs be true. If it be true that the predicate of the conclusion, whether affirmative or negative, agree universally to some idea; and if it be also true that the subject of the conclusion is a part of or comprehended under that idea; then it necessarily follows, that the predicate of the conclusion agrees also to the subject. For to assert the contrary, would be to run counter to some one of the two principles before established; that is, it would be to maintain an evident contradiction. And thus we are come at last to the point we have been all along endeavouring to establish; namely, that every proposition which can be demonstrated is necessarily true. For as every demonstration may be resolved into a series of syllogisms all in the first figure; and as in any one of these syllogisms, if the premises are true, the conclusion must needs be so too; it evidently follows, that if all the several premises are true, all the several conclusions are so, and consequently the conclusion also of the last syllogism, which is always the proposition to be demonstrated. Now that all the premises of a demonstration are true, will easily appear from the very nature and definition of that form of reasoning. A demonstration, as we have said, is a series of syllogisms, all whose premises are either definitions, self-evident truths, or propositions, already established. Definitions are identical propositions, wherein we connect the description of an idea with the name by which we choose to have that idea called, and therefore as to their truth there can be no dispute. Self-evident propositions appear true of themselves, and leave no doubt or uncertainty in the mind. Propositions, before established, are no other than conclusions gained by one or more steps from definitions and self-evident principles, that is, from true premises, and therefore must needs be true. Whence all the previous propositions of a demonstration being, we see, manifestly true; the last conclusion, or proposition to be demonstrated, must be so too. So that demonstration not only leads to certain truth, but we have here also a clear view of the ground and foundation of that certainty. For as, in demonstrating, we may be said to do nothing more than combine a series of syllogisms together, all resting on the same bottom; it is plain that one uniform ground of certainty runs through the whole, and that the conclusions are everywhere built upon some one of the two principles before established, as the foundation of all our reasoning. These two principles are easily reduced into one, and may be expressed thus: \"Whatever predicate, whether affirmative or negative, agrees universally to any idea; the same must needs agree to every or any number of individuals comprehended under that idea.\" And thus at length we have, according to our first design, reduced the certainty of demonstration to one simple and universal principle; which carries its own evidence along with it, and which is indeed the ultimate foundation of all syllogistic reasoning.\n\nV. Demonstration therefore serving as an infallible guide to truth and certainty.\nevident truths, or propositions previously established. To judge therefore of the validity of a demonstration, we must be able to distinguish whether the definitions that enter it are genuine, and truly descriptive of the ideas they are meant to exhibit; whether the propositions assumed without proofs as intuitive truths have really that self-evidence to which they lay claim; whether the syllogisms are drawn up in due form, and agreeable to the laws of argumentation; in fine, whether they are combined together in a just and orderly manner, so that no demonstrable propositions serve anywhere as premises unless they are conclusions of previous syllogisms. Now, it is the business of logic, in explaining the several operations of the mind, fully to instruct us in all these points. It teaches the nature and end of definitions, and lays down the rules by which they ought to be framed. It unfolds the several species of propositions, and distinguishes the self-evident from the demonstrable. It delineates also the different forms of syllogisms, and explains the laws of argumentation proper to each. In fine, it describes the manner of combining syllogisms, so that they may form a train of reasoning, and lead to the successive discovery of truth. The precepts of logic, therefore, as they enable us to judge with certainty when a proposition is duly demonstrated, furnish a sure criterion for the distinguishing between truth and falsehood.\n\nVI. Perhaps it may be objected, that demonstration is a thing very rare and uncommon, as being the prerogative of but a few sciences, and therefore the criterion here given can be of no great use. But wherever, by the bare contemplation of our ideas, truth is discoverable, there also demonstration may be attained. Now that is an abundantly sufficient criterion which enables us to judge with certainty, in all cases where the knowledge of truth comes within our reach; for with discoveries, that lie beyond the limits of the human mind, we have, properly, no business or concernment. When a proposition is demonstrated, we are certain of its truth. When, on the contrary, our ideas are such as have no visible connection or repugnance, and therefore furnish not the proper means of tracing their agreement or disagreement, there we are sure that scientific knowledge is not attainable. But where there is some foundation of reasoning, which yet amounts not to the full evidence of demonstration, there the precepts of logic, by teaching us to determine aught of the degree of proof, and of what is still wanting to render it full and complete, enable us to make a due estimate of the measures of probability, and to proportion our assent to the grounds on which the proposition stands. And this is all we can possibly arrive at, or even so much as hope for, in the exercise of faculties so imperfect and limited as ours.\n\nVII. Before we conclude this chapter, it may not be improper to take notice of the distinction of demonstration into direct and indirect. A direct demonstration is, when, beginning with definitions, self-evident propositions, or known and allowed truths, we form a train of syllogisms, and combine them in an orderly manner, continuing the series through a variety of successive steps, until at last we arrive at a syllogism whose conclusion is the proposition to be demonstrated. Proofs of this kind leave no doubt or uncertainty behind them; because, all the several premises being true, the conclusions must be so too, and of course the very last conclusion or proposition to be proved. The other species of demonstration is the indirect, or, as it is sometimes called, the apagogical. The manner of proceeding here is, by assuming a proposition which directly contradicts that we mean to demonstrate; and thence, by a continued train of reasoning, in the way of a direct demonstration, deducing some absurdity or manifest untruth. For hereupon we conclude, that the proposition assumed was false; and thence again, by an immediate consequence, that the proposition to be demonstrated is true. Thus Euclid, in his third book, being to demonstrate that circles which touch one another inwardly have not the same centre, affirms the direct contrary to this, viz. that they have the same centre; and thence, by an evident train of reasoning, proves that a part is equal to the whole. The supposition therefore leading to this absurdity he concludes to be false, viz. that circles touching one another inwardly have the same centre; and thence again immediately infers, that they have not the same centre.\n\nVIII. Now, because this manner of demonstration is accounted by some not altogether so clear and satisfactory; we shall therefore endeavour to show, that it equally with the other leads to truth and certainty. Two propositions are said to be contradictory one of another, when that which is affirmed to be in the one is affirmed not to be in the other. Thus the propositions, Circles that touch one another inwardly have the same centre, and Circles that touch one another inwardly have not the same centre, are contradictory, because the second affirms the direct contrary of what is affirmed in the first. Now, in all contradictory propositions, this holds universally, That one of them is necessarily true, and the other necessarily false. For if it be true, that circles which touch one another inwardly have not the same centre; it is unavoidably false that they have the same centre. On the other hand, if it be false that they have the same centre, it is necessarily true that they have not the same centre. Since therefore it is impossible for them to be both true or both false at the same time; it unavoidably follows, that one is necessarily true, and the other necessarily false. This then being allowed, which is indeed self-evident; if any two contradictory propositions are assumed, and one of them can by a clear train of reasoning be demonstrated to be false, it necessarily follows that the other is true. For as the one is necessarily true, and the other necessarily false; when we come to discover which is the false proposition, we thereby also know the other to be true.\n\nIX. Now this is precisely the manner of an indirect demonstration, as is evident from the account given of it above. For there we assume a proposition which directly contradicts that we mean to demonstrate; and having by a continued series of proofs shown it to be false, thence infer that it is contradictory, or the proposition to be demonstrated, is true. As, therefore, this last conclusion is certain and unavoidable; let us next inquire after what manner we come to be satisfied of the falsehood of the assumed proposition, that so no possible doubt may remain as to the force and validity of demonstrations of this kind. The manner then is plainly this: Beginning with the assumed proposition,\nPart IV.\n\nLOGIC.\n\nOf Method: we, by the help of definitions, self-evident truths, or propositions already established, continue a series of reasoning, in the way of a direct demonstration, until at length we arrive at some absurdity or known fallacy. Thus Euclid, in the example before mentioned, from the supposition that circles touching one another inwardly have the same centre, deduces that a part is equal to the whole. Since, therefore, by a due and orderly process of reasoning, we come at last to a false conclusion; it is manifest, that all the premises cannot be true: for, were all the premises true, the last conclusion must be so too, by what has been before demonstrated. Now, as to all the other premises made use of in the course of reasoning, they are manifest and known truths by supposition, as being either definitions, self-evident propositions, or truths previously established. The assumed proposition is that only as to which any doubt or uncertainty remains. That alone, therefore, can be false; and indeed, from what has been already shown, must unavoidably be so. And thus we see, that in indirect demonstrations, two contradictory propositions being laid down, one of which is demonstrated to be false, the other, which is always the proposition to be proved, must necessarily be true; so that here, as well as in the direct way of proof, we arrive at a clear and satisfactory knowledge of truth.\n\nX. This is universally the method of reasoning in all apagogical or direct demonstrations. But if any proposition is assumed, from which, in a direct train of reasoning, we can deduce its contradictory; the proposition so assumed is false, and the contradictory one true. For if we suppose the assumed proposition to be true, then, since all the other premises that enter the demonstration are also true, we shall have a series of reasoning consisting wholly of true premises; whence the last conclusion or contradictory of the assumed proposition must be true likewise: so that by this means we should have two contradictory propositions both true at the same time, which is manifestly impossible. The assumed proposition, therefore, whence this absurdity flows, must necessarily be false; and consequently its contradictory, which is here the proposition deduced from it, must be true. If then any proposition is supposed to be demonstrated, and we assume the contradictory of that proposition, and thence directly infer the proposition to be demonstrated; by this very means we know that the proposition so inferred is true. For, since from an assumed proposition we have deduced its contradictory, we are thereby certain that the assumed proposition is false; and if so, then its contradictory, or that deduced from it, which in this case is the same with the proposition to be demonstrated, must be true.\n\nXI. We have a curious instance of this in the twelfth proposition of the ninth book of the Elements. Euclid there proposes to demonstrate, that in any series of numbers, rising from unity in geometrical progression, all the prime numbers that measure the last term of the progression will also measure the next after unity. In order to this, he assumes the contradictory of the proposition to be demonstrated; namely, that some prime number will not measure the last term in the series does not make us measure the next after unity; and thence, by a continued train of reasoning, proves that it actually does measure it. Hereupon he concludes the assumed proposition to be false; and that which is deduced from it, or its contradictory, which is the very proposition he proposed to demonstrate, to be true. Now that this is a just and conclusive way of reasoning, is abundantly manifest from what we have so clearly established above. Whence it appears, how necessary some knowledge of the rules of logic is, to enable us to judge of the force, justness, and validity, of demonstrations. For, though it is readily allowed, that by the mere strength of our natural faculties we can at once discern, that of two contradictory propositions, the one is necessarily true, and the other necessarily false; yet when they are so linked together in a demonstration, as that the one serves as a previous proposition whence the other is deduced, it does not so immediately appear, without some knowledge of the principles of logic, why that alone, which is collected by reasoning, ought to be embraced as true, and the other, whence it is collected, to be rejected as false.\n\nXII. Having thus sufficiently evinced the certainty of and of its demonstration in all its branches, and thrown the rules by which we ought to proceed, in order to arrive at a just conclusion, according to the various ways of arguing, it is needless to enter upon a particular and false consideration of those several species of false reasoning—reasoning—which logicians distinguish by the name of sophisms. He that thoroughly understands the form and structure of a good argument, will of himself readily discern every deviation from it. And although sophisms have been divided into many classes, which are all called by sounding names, that therefore carry in them much appearance of learning; yet are the errors themselves so very palpable and obvious, that it would be lost labour to write for a man capable of being misled by them. Here, therefore, we choose to conclude this part of logic; and shall in the next give some account of Method, which, though inseparable from reasoning, is nevertheless always considered by logicians as a distinct operation of the mind; because its influence is not confined to the mere exercise of the reasoning faculty, but extends in some degree to all the transactions of the understanding.\n\nPART IV. OF METHOD.\n\nWE have now done with the three first operations of the mind, whose office it is to search after truth, and enlarge the bounds of human knowledge. There is yet a fourth, which regards the disposal and arrangement of our thoughts, when we endeavour to put them together as that their mutual connexion and dependence may be clearly seen. This is what logicians call Method, and place always the last in order in explaining the powers of the understanding; because it necessarily supposes a previous exercise of our other faculties, and some progress made in knowledge before we can exert it in any extensive degree.\nII. In this view, it is plain that we must be beforehand well acquainted with the truths we are to combine together; otherwise, how could we discern their several connexions and relations, or so dispose of them as their mutual dependence may require? But it often happens, that the understanding is employed, not in the arrangement and composition of known truths, but in the search and discovery of such as are unknown. And here the manner of proceeding is very different. We assemble at once our whole stock of knowledge relating to any subject, and, after a general survey of things, begin with examining them separately and by parts. Hence it comes to pass, that whereas, at our first setting out, we were acquainted only with some of the grand strokes and outlines of truth; by thus pursuing her through her several windings and recesses, we gradually discover those more inward and finer touches whence she derives all her strength, symmetry, and beauty. And here it is, that when, by a narrow scrutiny into things, we have unravelled any part of knowledge, and traced it to its first and original principles, infomuch that the whole frame and contexture of it lies open to the view of the mind; here it is, that, taking it the contrary way, and beginning with these principles, we can adjust and put together the parts as the order and method of science requires.\n\nIII. But as these things are best understood when illustrated by the multitude of examples, let us suppose any machine, for instance a watch, presented to us, whose structure and composition we are as yet unacquainted with, but want, if possible, to discover. The manner of proceeding, in this case, is, by taking the whole to pieces, and examining the parts separately, one after another. When, by such a scrutiny, we have thoroughly informed ourselves of the frame and contexture of each, we then compare them together, in order to judge of their mutual action and influence. By this means we gradually trace out the inward make and composition of the whole, and come at length to discern how parts of such a form, and so put together as we found in unravelling and taking them asunder, constitute that particular machine called a watch, and contribute to all the several motions and phenomena observable in it. This discovery being made, we can take things the contrary way, and, beginning with the parts, so dispose and connect them as their several uses and structures require, until at length we arrive at the whole itself, from the unravelling of which those parts resulted.\n\nIV. And as it is in tracing and examining the works of human knowledge: for the relations and mutual habitudes of things do not always immediately appear upon comparing them one with another. Hence we have recourse to intermediate ideas; and, by means of them, are furnished with those previous propositions that lead to the conclusion we are in quest of. And if it so happens that the previous propositions themselves are not sufficiently evident, we endeavour, by new middle terms, to ascertain their truth; still tracing things backward, in a continual series, until at length we arrive at some syllogism where the premises are first and self-evident principles. This done, we become perfectly satisfied as to the truth of all the conclusions we have passed through, insomuch as they are now seen to stand upon the firm and immovable foundation of our intuitive perceptions. And as we arrived at this certainty by tracing things backward to the original principles whence they flow; so may we at any time renew it by a direct contrary process, if, beginning with these principles, we carry the train of our thoughts forward until they lead us, by a connected chain of proofs, to the very last conclusion of the series.\n\nV. Hence it appears, that, in disposing and putting together our thoughts, either for our own use, that the method discoveries we have made may at all times lie open to analytic review of the mind, or where we mean to communicate and synthesize and unfold the discoveries to others, there are two ways of proceeding equally within our choice: for we may propose the truths relating to any part of knowledge, as they presented themselves to the mind in the manner of investigation; carrying on the series of proofs, in a reverse order, until they at last terminate in first principles; or, beginning with these principles, we may take the contrary way, and from them deduce, by a direct train of reasoning, all the several propositions we want to establish. This diversity in the manner of arranging our thoughts gives rise to the twofold division of method established among logicians; for method, according to their use of the word, is nothing else but the order and disposition of our thoughts relating to any subject. When truths are so proposed and put together as they were or might have been discovered, this is called the analytic method, or the method of resolution; insomuch as it traces things backward to their source, and resolves knowledge into its first and original principles. When, on the other hand, they are deduced from these principles, and connected according to their mutual dependence, infomuch that the truths first in order tend always to the demonstration of those that follow; this constitutes what we call the synthetic method or method of composition. For here we proceed by gathering together the several scattered parts of knowledge, and combining them into one whole or system, in such manner that the understanding is enabled distinctly to follow truth through all her different stages and gradations.\n\nVI. There is this farther to be taken notice of, in calling attention to these two species of method; that the first therewith has also obtained the name of the method of invention, the method because it observes the order in which our thoughts succeed one another in the invention or discovery of the method truth. The other, again, is often denominated the doctrine, method of doctrine or instruction; insomuch as, in laying our thoughts before others, we generally choose to proceed in the synthetic manner, deducing them from their first principles. For we are to observe, that although there is great pleasure in pursuing truth in the method of investigation, because it places us in the condition of the inventor, and shows the particular train and process of thinking by which he arrived at his discoveries; yet it is not so well accommodated to the purposes of evidence and conviction. For, at our first setting out, we are commonly unable to divine where the analysis will lead us; infomuch that our researches are for some time little better than a mere groping in the dark. And even after light begins to break in upon us, we are still obliged to many reviews, and\nPart IV.\n\nLOGIC.\n\nOf Method, and a frequent comparison of the several steps of the investigation among themselves. Nay, when we have unravelled the whole, and reached the very foundation on which our discoveries stand, all our certainty, in regard to their truth, will be found in a great measure to arise from that connexion we are now able to discern between them and first principles, taken in the order of composition. But in the synthetic manner of disposing our thoughts, the case is quite different: for as we here begin with the intuitive truths, and advance by regular deductions from them, every step of the procedure brings evidence and conviction along with it; so that, in our progress from one part of knowledge to another, we have always a clear perception of the ground on which our afflent rests. In communicating therefore our discoveries to others, this method is apparently to be chosen, as it wonderfully improves and enlightens the understanding, and leads to an immediate perception of truth.\n\nVII. The logic which for so many ages kept possession of the schools, and was deemed the most important of the sciences, has long been condemned as a mere art of wrangling, of very little use in the pursuit of truth. Attempts have been made to restore it to credit, but without success; and of late years little or no attention whatever has been paid to the art of reasoning in the course of what is called a liberal education. As both extremes may be faulty, it should seem that we cannot conclude this short treatise more properly than with the following\n\nREFLECTIONS ON THE UTILITY OF LOGIC.\n\nIf Aristotle was not the inventor of logic, he was certainly the prince of logicians. The whole theory of syllogisms he claims as his own, and as the fruit of much time and labour; and it is universally known, that the later writers on the art have borrowed their materials almost entirely from his Organon and Porphyry's Introduction. But after men had laboured near 2000 years in search of truth by the help of syllogisms, Lord Bacon proposed the method of induction, as a more effectual engine for that purpose; and since his days the art of logic has gradually fallen into disrepute.\n\nTo this consequence many causes contributed. The art of syllogism is admirably calculated for wrangling; and by the schoolmen it was employed with too much success, to keep in countenance the absurdities of the Romish church. Under their management it produced numberless disputes, and numberless sects, who fought against each other with much animosity without gaining or losing ground; but it did nothing considerable for the benefit of human life, whilst the method of induction has improved arts and increased knowledge. It is no wonder, therefore, that the excessive admiration of Aristotle, which continued for so many ages, should end in an undue contempt: and that the high esteem of logic, as the grand engine of science, should at last make way for too unfavourable an opinion, which seems now prevalent, of its being unworthy of a place in a liberal education. Men rarely leave one extreme without running into the contrary: Those who think according to the fashion, will be as prone to go into the present extreme as their grandfathers were to go into the former; and even they who in general think for themselves, when they are offended at the abuse of any thing, are too apt to entertain prejudices against the thing itself. \"In practice (says the learned Warburton*), logic is more a trick than a science, formed rather to amuse than to instruct.\" And in some sort we may apply to the art of syllogism what a man of wit says of rhetoric, that it only tells us how to name those tools which nature had before put into our hands. In the service of chicane, indeed, it is a mere juggler's knot, now fast, now loose; and the schools where this legerdemain was exercised in great perfection are full of the stories of its wonders.\" The authority of Warburton is great; but it may be counterbalanced by another, which, on subjects of this nature, is confessedly greater.\n\n\"Laying aside prejudice, whether fashionable or unfashionable, let us consider (says Dr Reid†) whether logic is or may be made subservient to any good purpose. Its professed end is, to teach men to think, to judge, and to reason, with precision and accuracy. No man will say this is a matter of little importance; and the only thing therefore that can admit of doubt is whether it can be taught?\n\n\"To resolve this doubt, it may be observed, that our rational faculty is the gift of God, given to men in very different measures: Some have a large portion, some a less; and where there is a remarkable defect of the natural power, it cannot be supplied by any culture. But this natural power, even where it is the strongest, may lie dead for want of the means of improvement. Many a savage may have been born with as good faculties as a Newton, a Bacon, or an Aristotle; but their talents were buried by having never been put to use, whilst those of the philosophers were cultivated to the best advantage. It may likewise be observed, that the chief mean of improving our rational power, is the vigorous exercise of it in various ways and on different subjects, by which the habit is acquired of exercising it properly. Without such exercise, and good sense over and above, a man who has studied logic all his life may be only a petulant wrangler, without true judgement or skill of reasoning in any science.\"\n\nThis must have been Locke's meaning, when in his Thoughts on Education, he says, \"If you would have your son to reason well, let him read Chillingworth.\" The state of things is much altered since Locke wrote; Logic has been much improved chiefly by his writings; and yet much less stress is laid upon it, and less time consumed in its study. His counsel, therefore, was judicious and feasible; to wit, That the improvement of our reasoning power is to be expected much more from an intimate acquaintance with the authors who reason best, than from studying voluminous systems of school logic. But if he had meant, that the study of logic was of no use, nor deserved any attention, he surely would not have taken the pains to make so considerable an addition to it, by his Essay on the Human Understanding, and by his Thoughts on the Conduct of the Understanding; nor would he have remitted his pupil to Chillingworth, the acutest logician as well as the best reasoner of his age.\"\n\nThere is no study better fitted to exercise and strengthen the reasoning powers than that of the mathematical sciences; because there is no other branch\nOf Method of science which gives such scope to long and accurate trains of reasoning, or in which there is so little room for authority or prejudice of any kind to give a false bias to the judgement. When a youth of moderate parts begins to study Euclid, every thing is new to him: His apprehension is unsteady; his judgement is feeble; and rests partly upon the evidence of the thing, and partly upon the authority of his teacher. But every time he goes over the definitions, the axioms, the elementary propositions, more light breaks in upon him; and as he advances, the road of demonstration becomes smooth and easy; he can walk in it firmly, and take wider steps, till at last he acquires the habit not only of understanding a demonstration, but of discovering and demonstrating mathematical truths.\n\nIt must indeed be confessed, that a man without the rules of logic may acquire a habit of reasoning justly in mathematics, and perhaps in any other science. Good sense, good examples, and affiduous exercise, may bring a man to reason justly and acutely in his own profession without rules. But whoever thinks, that from this conception he may infer the inutility of logic, betrays by this inference a great want of that art; for he might as well infer, because a man may go from Edinburgh to London by the way of Paris, that therefore any other road is useless.\n\nThere is perhaps no art which may not be acquired, in a very considerable degree, by example and practice, without reducing it to rules. But practice joined with rules may carry a man forward in his art farther and more quickly than practice without rules.—Every ingenious artist knows the utility of having his art reduced to rules, and thereby made a science. By rules he is enlightened in his practice, and works with more assurance. They enable him sometimes to correct his own errors, and often to detect the errors of others; and he finds them of great use to confirm his judgements, to justify what is right, and to condemn what is wrong.\n\nNow mathematics are the noblest praxis of logic. Through them we may perceive how the stated forms of syllogism are exemplified in one subject, namely the predicament of quantity; and by marking the force of these forms, as they are there applied, we may be enabled to apply them of ourselves elsewhere. Whoever, therefore, will study mathematics with this view, will become not only by mathematics a more expert logician, and by logic a more rational mathematician, but a wiser philosopher, and an acute reasoner, in all the possible subjects either of science or deliberation. But when mathematics, instead of being applied to this excellent purpose, are used not to exemplify logic, but to supply its place; no wonder if logic fall into contempt, and if mathematics, instead of furthering science, become in fact an obstacle. For when men, knowing nothing of that reasoning which is universal, come to attach themselves for years to a single species, a species wholly involved in lines and numbers, the mind becomes incapacitated for reasoning at large, and especially in the search of moral truth. The object of mathematics is demonstration; and whatever in that science is not demonstration, is nothing, or at least below the sublime inquirer's regard. Probability, through its almost infinite degrees, from simple ignorance up to absolute certainty, is the terra incognita of the mathematician. And yet here it is that the great business of the human mind is carried on in the search and discovery of all the important truths which concern us as reasonable beings. And here too it is that all its vigour is exerted: for to proportion the assent to the probability accompanying every varying degree of moral evidence, requires the most enlarged and sovereign exercise of reason.\n\nIn reasonings of this kind, will any man pretend that it is of no use to be well acquainted with the various powers of the mind by which we reason? Is it of no use to resolve the various kinds of reasoning into their simple elements; and to discover, as far as we are able, the rules by which these elements are combined in judging and in reasoning? Is it of no use to mark the various fallacies in reasoning, by which even the most ingenious men have been led into error? It must surely betray great want of understanding, to think these things useless or unimportant. Now these are the things which logicians have attempted; and which they have executed—not indeed so completely as to leave no room for improvement, but in such a manner as to give very considerable aid to our reasoning powers. That the principles they have laid down with regard to definition and division, with regard to the conversion and opposition of propositions, and the general rules of reasoning, are not without use, is sufficiently apparent from the blunders committed daily by those who disdain any acquaintance with them.\n\nAlthough the art of categorical syllogism is confessedly little fitted for the discovery of unknown truth, it may yet be employed to excellent purposes, as it is perhaps the most compendious method of detecting a fallacy. A man in quest of unknown truths must generally proceed by the way of induction, from effects to causes; but he, who as a teacher is to inculcate any system upon others, begins with one or more self-evident truths, and proceeds in the way of demonstration, to the conclusion which he wishes to establish. Now every demonstration, as has been already observed, may be resolved into a series of syllogisms, of which the conclusion of the preceding always enters into the premises of that which follows: and if the first principles be clear and evident, and every syllogism in some legitimate mode and figure, the conclusion of the whole must infallibly be admitted. But when the demonstration is thus broken into parts; if we find that the conclusion of one syllogism will not, without altering the meaning of the terms, enter legitimately into the premises of that which should immediately follow; or, supposing it to make one of the premises of a new syllogism, if we find that the conclusion, resulting from the whole series thus obtained, is different from that of the demonstration; we may, in either of these cases, rest assured that the author's reasoning is fallacious, and leads to error; and that if it carried an appearance of conviction before it was thus resolved into its elementary parts, it must have been owing to the inability of the mind to comprehend at once a long train of arguments. Whoever wishes to see the syllogistic art employed for this purpose, and to be convinced of the truth of what we have said respecting its utility, may consult the excellent writer recommended by Locke, who, in places innumerable of his incomparable book, has, without pedantry, even in that pedantic age, made the happiest application of the rules of...\nLOGISTÆ, certain officers at Athen, in number ten, whose busines consulted in receiving and passing the accounts of magistrates when they went out of office. The logifter were elected by lot, and had ten euthyni or auditors of accounts under them.\n\nLOGOGRAPHY, a new method of printing, in which the types, instead of answering only to single letters, are made to correspond to whole words.\n\nThis method, though seemingly a retrograde procession in the printing art, has lately obtained the sanction of his majesty's patent, and has for some time been actually put in execution in the way of trade, apparently with advantage to the proprietors. In the year 1783, a treatise upon this subject appeared by Henry Johnson, in which the origin as well as the utility of the art are fully laid down, and the matter set forth in such a light as can scarce allow us to doubt that it is an improvement in the art. Mr Johnson informs us, that about five years before, viz. in the year 1778, intending to publish a daily list of blanks and prizes in the lottery numerically arranged, he found it could not be accomplished in time by the ordinary way of printing. On this account he procured types of two, three, or more figures as was necessary for his purpose; and thus any entire number might as readily be taken up as if it had been a single type. His next attempt was in forming some large mercantile tables of pounds, shillings, pence, and farthings. For these he procured types expressive of any sum of money ready composed and united, \"by which (says he) every species of figure-printing could be performed for the tenth part of the cost, printers always charging it double the price of letter-printing.\" Having thus succeeded to his wish in his two first attempts, he next began to consider if the method could not be applied to words; and in this also the success was equal.\n\nThe properties of the logographic art, according to our author, are, 1. That the compositor shall have less charged upon his memory than in the common way. 2. It is much less liable to error. 3. The type of each word is as easily laid hold of as that of a single letter. 4. The decomposition is much more readily performed, even by the most novices, than they now decompose letters. 5. No extraordinary expense nor greater number of types is required in the logographic than in the common method of printing.\n\nThe first of these positions is proved by our author in the following manner. In the common method, the compositor has 150 divisions to which there is no reference, and the printing offices are not agreed with respect to the mode of placing their boxes; \"but under this improvement he has only to know the letters of the alphabet, and is assisted with an index of them, insomuch that the simplicity of the latter apparatus enables him, by a little practice, to lay his finger almost blindfold on the word required; and the meanest capacity is equal to this mental exercise, having little more to do than knowing by inspection the difference between words under three and those above three syllables; and all the apparatus being within a compass not a great deal more extended than common printing, for these reasons he is as soon proficient of his type of a word as they are of a single letter.\"\n\nThus the first and third positions may be said to be proved; but in his proof of the second, our author himself shows that his art is not infallible, by substituting the word third instead of second. Substitutions of this kind, he owns, may readily take place; but such errors are much more conspicuous than literal ones, though they may be corrected with equal ease; \"for the erroneous substitution cannot fail of being nearly equal in length to the word required; although, even otherwise, it would not be attended with greater disadvantage than in the common way, and it would be rectified with greater facility.\"\n\nThe ease with which the composition is performed, shows that there must be an equal ease in performing the decomposition; \"from whence (says Mr Johnson) it is further demonstrable, that any work can be composed by this method nearly as soon as it can be deliberately read; and as to the fifth position, that it shall not require a greater expense of types, it is answered, that it is impossible for more types of letters to be wanted for this method than by any other printer according to the equal quantity of business to be performed, every office having certain known quantities of each letter called a fount. A printer's fount contains about 92,500 letters, and our want is not more; nay, nearer the truth, the present quantity for a fount containing much more of some letters than necessary, and fewer of others; which arises from the calculation of the quantity of each letter wanted being adhered to since the old spelling.\"\n\nOur author now proceeds to demonstrate that the number of types must necessarily decrease as they are combined in syllables, and much more when formed into words. The whole art of arranging the words consists in placing them under as few divisions as possible, and still fewer subdivisions; which is attained by the following process.\n\n1. A collection of words, with the addition of tenses, plurals, and degrees of comparison, amounting to more than 100,000, was made from the best English dictionaries;\n2. Collections were made from the miscellaneous part\nof newspapers, the Spectator, and Common Prayer-book. The method was, by procuring duplicates of every sheet, so that each alternate side might be pasted over with white paper, in order to leave the whole of the words on both sides perfect; and thus the whole might be touched with less danger of injury than otherwise could have been done. The confusion arising from the parts of other words being seen from the opposite side was likewise prevented.\n\n3. The words, being separately cut out, were then put into a case marked with the divisions from one to 16, according to the number of letters contained in each word. Thus several letters were distinctly collected, and then each separate parcel sorted in a case containing 26 divisions, marked with the letters of the alphabet, according to the commencing letter of the word; and thus all the words were ranged alphabetically, consisting of two, three, four, or five letters, in separate parcels.\n\n4. The same words were then placed together, and posted into an alphabet, with the number of times marked to each that had occurred on the whole; that in this manner a proportion might be determined how many times particular words ought to be repeated for the printing of one sheet, and also to know what words are in general use: There are likewise a number of technical terms, and favourite phrases, a great number of times repeated almost by every author; but though these occur throughout the whole book in great proportion to the rest, no more of them will be necessary than what suffice for a single sheet.\n\n5. The whole of the above might be done without the trouble just mentioned, by posting every word at once into a triformed alphabet; because the subdivisions of the second and third commencing letter of each word for references are now obtained, and thus can easily be placed in its proper division, and may be marked as often as it occurs, without repeating the same word; whence we plainly see the ease and expedition of it, from the facility and expedition of posting every word from a leaf in any book. Before such subdivisions were known, they could only have been placed under the first commencing letter of the word; which would cause such a multiplicity of repetitions, that it would take up more time, be far more liable to error, and require more subordinate postings to bring them into arrangement; so that they may be found more easily than by the above proceedings. Thus also a collection will be obtained of single and double words, which are constantly required from 20 to 400 or 500 times in the printing one sheet of any work whatever; and which alone would abridge the compositor's work near one-third. This second process likewise enabled the author to reject, out of the first collection, obsolete words, technical terms, &c., which reduces the original collection to one-fifth part.\n\n6. By proceeding in this manner, several species of words are omitted in the fonts. 1. Obsolete words; because they occur so seldom, that the difference of time lost in composing them in the ordinary method would be imperceptible. 2. Technical terms, names of places, animals, &c.; though, for any particular work, the terms peculiar to it may be added to the font in a biformal alphabet apart. 3. Real compounds, or words that may be compounded of others, are also rejected; because we actually have the words Logography already, and they may be joined with sufficient expedition, though the spaces are annexed to each, by being constructed accordingly. 4. Those of the same spelling are likewise omitted, though they bear different significations, for obvious reasons.\n\n7. The variation of tenes, degrees of comparison, and numerous words in the English language, having in general, the same terminations, such as ED, INC, LY, MENT,NESS, &c. an alphabet may be formed of such a kind as is capable of being annexed to the absolute words or radices, as expeditiously as the whole word could be found in the font, from its being thereby so much less extended. Thus, by dividing several words into their radices and terminations, many other words may be formed from their radix by the addition of various terminations, and each termination may be added to other radices to which they are applicable.\n\n8. Some radices are imperfect, viz. such as end with the vowel e, which must therefore be added in the usual way of composition. Thus, in the word adore, the radix is ador, to which the terminations es, ed, ef, eth, er, ing, may be added occasionally.\n\n9. By rejecting also the words which come under this last denomination, the number necessary for a font is reduced to one-tenth of what it would otherwise be, as will appear evident from the following considerations:\n\n1. There are at least 42 verbs, the infinitive of which ends in ify; as qualify, signify; the radices of which are qual, sign; the terminations are, ish, ified, ifying, &c. And Mr Johnson informs us, that by applying these radices to other terminations, he was enabled to dispense with more than 500 words which would otherwise have been necessary.\n\n2. For all regular verbs, no more than six terminations are necessary, viz. s, ef, eth, ed, ei, ing. There are but few irregular ones in the English language; whence it happens that 12 or 14 words may be formed from one single perfect verb as a radix, and many imperfect ones save double that number.\n\n10. By using only the set of terminations which may be contained in a box of two feet square, the common operation of printing would be shortened nearly one half; and in order to find out those which are most in use, and fitted to retain, our author digested them alphabetically, with the radices, words, or syllables, which make complete words annexed to them.\n\nThus,\n\ntain\n—s\n—ed\n—ing\n—ment\n\nabs—apper—after\nde—dis—con\ncer—cap—cur\nenter—main—re—fus, &c.\n\n11. Thus it will be found, that out of more than 100,000 words of which the English language consists, there will not be wanted much above 3,500 for a complete font. This will be very evident to any person who consults a dictionary. He will there find, that a vast number of words require an explanation; whereas in any miscellaneous work, there are none but what can be understood most readily either together or apart. Newspapers retain more of the uncommon kind of words than any others. \"The vocabulary (says our author)\nLogography or alphabet as it is called, of the Chinese, consists of above 80,000 letters or characters; yet he is admitted a master of the language who knows about 4000 of them, no more being in general use.\n\nThe expedition with which the logographic method of printing can be accomplished, depends essentially on their arrangement; which, from great numbers of experiments, our author found to be best accomplished in the following manner: 1. Words of one, two, or three syllables, are alphabetically placed by themselves, including all possible commencing syllables, by which the compositor cannot fail of finding the word either in whole or in part, let it be what it will; and when the whole cannot be found at once, the remainder may easily be found in single or double syllables among the terminations. 2. All words above three syllables have the same alphabetical arrangement; the terminations being the same at the bottom of each. Experience shows, that by a very few lessons, the meanest capacity may determine the number of syllables, and refer to the particular case containing words of that number, there being conspicuous references to each; and by thus equalizing them, any person may possess himself very expeditiously of what he wants. Even boys who scarcely knew more than the letters of the alphabet, were hardly a fortnight employed in this method, when they could at the first glance tell the number of letters contained in any word.\n\nBy this simplicity of arrangement, any intelligent person, who never composed in his life, by being placed in a room with the apparatus, could compose and print, without other previous instruction than desiring him to remember that the words under three syllables, and those above three, are placed in separate alphabets; and that whenever he wants a word, the first letter is seen in capitals of two inches on the walls, the second in letters of one inch in right lines; and where it is necessary to have more columns than one for such second letter, the third is given in red down the column, comprehending about 12 divisions, to contain the types of the word coming under such reference.\n\nTo exemplify this method as far as it can be done without actually seeing the apparatus, our author instances the two words Above and Unfortunately. In looking for the former, the first letter, A, is seen upon the wall as already mentioned; the second, B, is on the case under it, and down that column is OVE, opposite to the cell containing the types of the whole word; which would be only three references instead of five with spaces, as in the common method. The other word, viz. Unfortunately, may be found by the same references, though it contains 13 letters; but \"admitting that practice will give the word as soon as a single letter, the average will be found eight for one.\"—Our author's explanation of the method in which this word might be composed, however, seems by no means intelligible.—\"For this distinction in the cases (says he), the alphabet, or rather marks of first reference in large characters on the wall, is divided into two classes, not as vowels and consonants, but as follows, viz. A, Con, Dif, E, In, O, P, S, Un, commencing references, the second or subsequent letters of the words being in a right line from left to right, and down each column is found the remainder of the reference to the words, distinguishing always the third letter in red. The second distinction is that for all other commencing letters, the second letter of reference is in a column down, and the third letter in lines from left to right in red.\n\nThese are the directions given by our author for forming a fount of words; the next requisite is a fount of syllables, formed in the following method: 1. A complete set of two letters was obtained in all their possible combinations, amounting to 676. 2. Having next obtained the possible combination of these letters, viz. 17576, by retaining only all possible syllables, and words of three letters, it is reduced to the 30th part; which answer all the purposes of composing with syllables of two and three letters, for Latin, French, English, and all names of persons, places, and things, every possible syllable being comprehended among them. Hence it forms an universal triformed alphabet, where English characters are used; from whence all partial biformed and triformed alphabets in the arrangement of English, French, Latin, and all technical matters, are drawn. Though combinations of four letters are again 26 times the number of those of three letters, and five letters increase in the same ratio; yet as much as all possible combinations increase in quantity proportionate to the number of letters combined, so they decrease in the actual number of syllables included among them, inasmuch, that all the syllables of four, five, six, and seven letters together, are considerably fewer than the syllables of three letters only.—Besides the two fonts already mentioned, a third was found necessary for such terminations as are most commonly followed by particular punctuations; but, after some consideration, this was judged unnecessary.\n\nOur author now proceeds to obviate some objections which must naturally occur to one who first hears of his invention. These are,\n\n1. A single letter damaged in a word renders the whole useless.\n\nThis is not denied by Mr Johnson; but he contends, that the quantity of metal lost in this manner is quite trifling.\n\n2. How are the blanks or spaces in a line to be managed, as these are by no means equal?\n\nTo this our author replies, that, at the time of writing the pamphlet, he was undetermined whether it be most eligible to have spaces cast along with the beginnings of words, or to space them in the common manner. The former would be more expeditious; and where a greater distance is required, other spaces may be introduced in the ordinary method.\n\n3. How is a long word at the end of a line to be divided?\n\nThis may be easily accomplished by means of the syllabic font already mentioned.\n\n4. How is the error of substituting one word for another to be rectified?\n\nThe answer to this is, that an error of the kind specified may be corrected in the very same manner as is done in common printing. Long words may be divided by means of the syllabic font already mentioned, and the intervals between the words may be filled up with spaces as usual.\n\nLOGWOOD.

Some suppose him to have been the same with Æsop the mythologist: and indeed we find in the parables or apologies of Lokman in Arabic, many particulars that are seen in Æsop's fables; so that it is not easy to determine whether the Greek or the Arabian are the originals. He is said to have been deformed in his person; but that this defect was sufficiently made up by the perfections of his mind. Some pieces of his are extant; and he was looked upon as so excellent a person, that Mahomet has inserted a chapter of the Koran, called after his name, in which he introduces God as saying, \"We heretofore bestowed wisdom on Lokman.\"—It is related that he got his liberty on the following occasion. His master having given him a bitter melon to eat, he ate it all. His master, surprised at his exact obedience, asked, How is it possible for him to eat such a nauseous fruit? He answered, \"I have received so many favours from you, that it is no wonder I should once in my life eat a bitter melon from your hand.\" This generous answer of the slave struck the master to such a degree, that he immediately gave him his liberty.\n\nM.

See Botany Index.\n\nOLLARDS, in ecclesiastical history, a religious sect, differing in many religious points from the church of Rome, which arose in Germany about the beginning of the 14th century; so called, as many writers have imagined, from Walter Lollard, who began to dogmatize in 1315, and was burnt at Cologne: though others think that Lollard was no surname, but merely a term of reproach applied to all heretics who concealed the poison of error under the appearance of piety.\n\nThe monk of Canterbury derives the origin of the word Lollard among us, from lolium, \"a tare;\" as if the Lollards were the tares grown in Christ's vineyard. Abelly says, that the word Lollard signifies \"praising, Lollards, God,\" from the German loben, \"to praise,\" and herr, \"Lord;\" because the Lollards employed themselves in travelling about from place to place, singing psalms and hymns.\n\nOthers, much to the same purpose, derive lollhard, lollhard, or lollert, lollert, as it was written by the ancient Germans, from the old German word lullen, lollen, or tallen, and the termination hard, with which many of the High Dutch words end. Lollen signifies \"to sing with a low voice,\" and therefore Lollard is a singer, or one who frequently sings; and in the vulgar tongue of the Germans it denotes a person who is continually praising God with a song, or singing hymns to his honour. The Alexians or Celites were called Lollards, because they were public singers who made it their business to inter the bodies of those who died of the plague, and sang a dirge over them in a mournful and indignant tone as they carried them to the grave. The name was afterwards assumed by persons who dishonoured it; for we find, among those Lollards who made extraordinary pretences to piety and religion, and spent the greatest part of their time in meditation, prayer, and such acts of piety, there were many abominable hypocrites, who entertained the most ridiculous opinions and concealed the most enormous vices under the specious mark of this extraordinary profession. And many injurious aspersions were propagated against those who assumed this name by the priests and monks; so that, by degrees, any person who covered heresies or crimes under the appearance of piety, was called a Lollard. Thus the name was not used to denote any one particular sect, but was formerly common to all persons and all sects who were supposed to be guilty of impiety towards God or the church, under an external profession of extraordinary piety. However, many societies consisting both of men and women under the name of Lollards, were formed in most parts of Germany and Flanders, and were supported partly by their manual labours, and partly by the charitable donations of pious persons. The magistrates and inhabitants of the towns where these brethren and sisters resided, gave them particular marks of favour and protection, on account of their great usefulness to the sick and needy. They were thus supported against their malignant rivals, and obtained many papal constitutions by which their institute was confirmed, their persons exempted from the cognizance of the inquisitors, and subjected entirely to the jurisdiction of the bishops; but as these measures were insufficient to secure them from molestation, Charles duke of Burgundy, in the year 1472, obtained a solemn bull from Pope Sixtus IV. ordering that the Celites or Lollards should be ranked among the religious orders, and delivered from the jurisdiction of the bishops; and Pope Julius II. granted them yet greater privileges in the year 1506. Mothe informs us that many societies of this kind are still subsisting at Cologne, and in the cities of Flanders, though they have evidently departed from their ancient rules.\n\nLollard and his followers rejected the sacrifice of the mass, extreme unction, and penances for sin; arguing, that Christ's sufferings were sufficient. He is likewise said to have set aside baptism, as a thing of no effect; and repentance, as not absolutely necessary, &c.\nLombard, &c.—In England, the followers of Wickliffe were called, by way of reproach, Lollards, from some affinity there was between some of their tenets; though others are of opinion that the English Lollards came from Germany.\n\nThey were solemnly condemned by the archbishop of Canterbury and the council of Oxford.\n\nLOMBARD, PETER, well known by the title of Master of the Sentences, was born at Novara in Lombardy; but being bred at Paris, he distinguished himself so much at that university, that he first had the canonry of Chartres conferred on him, was some time tutor to Philip son of Louis le Gros, and lastly obtained the see of Paris. He died in 1364. His work of the Sentences is looked on as the source of the scholastic theology of the Latin church. He wrote also Commentaries on the Psalms, and on St Paul’s Epistles.\n\nLOMBARDS, a Scandinavian nation, who formerly settled in Italy, and for some time made a considerable figure.\n\nTheir name of Lombards, or Longobards, is by some derived from the word lack, or lache, signifying in the German tongue winter; because the Lombards, while in Scandinavia, lived in marshes, or near the sea. Others think that it comes from the two German words langen barden, or helleborden, that is, from the long halberds they were supposed to use in war. But Paulus Diaconus their historian, and who was himself a Lombard, tells us that they were called Longobards from the length of their beards. A nation called the Lombards is mentioned by Tacitus, Strabo, and Ptolemy; but these are different from the Lombards who afterwards settled in Italy, and are reckoned to be the same with the Gepidae, whom the Italian Lombards almost exterminated. The Lombards who settled in Italy are first mentioned by Prosper Aquitanus, bishop of Rheims, in the year 379. That writer tells us, that about this time the Lombards, abandoning the most distant coasts of the ocean, and their native country Scandinavia, and seeking for new settlements, as they were overstocked with people at home, first attacked and overcame the Vandals in Germany. They were then headed by two chiefs, Iboro and Aion; who, dying about the year 389, were succeeded by Agilulf, who is commonly reckoned the first king of the Lombards.\n\nBefore the time of Odoacer, the Lombard history in the counsels affords nothing remarkable; in his time, however, they settled on the Danube, in the country of the Rugians, whom Odoacer had almost totally exterminated or carried into captivity. During their stay in this country, they rendered themselves formidable to the neighbouring nations, and carried on successful wars with the Herali and Gepide. In 526, they were allowed by the emperor Justinian to settle in Pannonia; and here they made war a second time with the Gepide. Alboin, the Lombard king, killed the king of the Gepide with his own hand, put his army to the rout, and cut such numbers of them in pieces, that they ceased from that time to be a nation. Having caused the deceased king’s head to be cut off, he made a cup of his skull, called in the language of the Lombards schala, which he made use of in all public entertainments. However, having taken, among many other captives of great distinction, the late king’s daughter, by name Rofamunda, he married her after the death of his former wife Clodifinta, the daughter of Cloaiteir king of France.\n\nBy this victory Alboin gained such reputation that his friendship was courted by Justinian; and, in consequence of the emperor’s application, a body of 6000 Lombards were sent to the assistance of Narles against the Goths. The success of the Romans in this expedition, the invasion of Italy by the Lombards, and their successes in that country, have been taken notice of under the article ITALY, No 28—32. At last Alboin, having made himself master of Venetia, Alboin Liguria, Æmilia, Hetururia, and Umbria, was slain by king of the Lombards the treachery of his wife, in the year 575, the fourth anniversary of his reign. This princess was the daughter of the king of the Gepidae, whom Alboin had killed in battle, and made a cup of his skull, as above related, his wife. As he was one day feasting at Verona, with his chief favourites and principal officers, in the height of his mirth he sent for the queen, and, filling the detested cup, commanded her to drink merrily with her father. Rofamund, struck with horror, hurried out of the room; and highly incensed against her husband for thus barbarously triumphing over the misfortunes of her family, resolved, at all events, to make him pay dear for such an inhuman and affronting conduct. Accordingly, she discovered her intention to Helmichild the king’s shield-bearer, a youth of great boldness and intrepidity. Helmichild imperiously refused to imbue his hands in the blood of his sovereign, or to be any way accessory to his death; and in this resolution he persisted, till he was, by a shameful stratagem, forced by the queen to a compliance: for she, knowing that he carried on an intrigue with one of her ladies, placed herself one night in her bed, and receiving the youth, indulged him as if he had been her own mistress in his amorous desires; which she had no sooner done, than discovering herself to the deceived lover, she told him that he must now either put the king to death, or be put to death by him. Helmichild, well apprised, that, after what he had done, his safety depended upon the death of the king, engaged in the treason, which he otherwise abhorred. One day, therefore, while Alboin was reposing in his chamber after dinner, Helmichild, with some others whom he had made privy to his design, breaking in unexpectedly, fell upon the king with their daggers. Alboin starting up at their first coming in, laid hold of his sword, which he had always by him; but having in vain attempted to draw it, the queen having before-hand fastened it in the scabbard, he defended himself for some time with a footstool; but was in the end overpowered, and dispatched with many wounds.\n\nRofamund had promised to Helmichild, that, as soon as he had dispatched the king, she would marry him, and, with her person, bestow upon him the kingdom of the Lombards. The first part of her promise immediately performed; but was so far from being able to bestow the crown upon him, that both of them were obliged to save themselves by flight. They fled to Longinus the exarch of Ravenna, taking with them all the jewels and treasure of the late king. Longinus received her with the greatest marks of friendship and kindness, and assured her of his protection. She had not been long in Ravenna, however, before the exarch, judging\njudging that a favourable opportunity now offered of making himself king of Italy by her means, imparted his design to her, and declared his intention to marry her, provided, by some means or other, the despatched Helmichild.—Rofamund, highly pleased with the proposal, resolved to satisfy her ambition by getting rid of the person whom she had married in order to gratify her revenge. Accordingly, having prepared a strong poison, she mixed it with wine, and gave it to her husband as he came out of the bath, and called for drink, according to his custom. Helmichild had not half emptied the cup, when, by the sudden and strange operation which he felt in his bowels, he concluded what it was; and, with his sword pointed at the queen’s breast, compelled her to drink the rest. The poison had the same effect on both; for they died in a few hours. Longinus, on the death of the queen, laid aside all thoughts of making himself king of Italy, and sent the king’s treasure to Constantinople, together with Albifonda, the daughter of Alboin by Rofamund, whom she had brought alone with her.\n\nAfter the death of Alboin, the Lombards chose Clephis, one of the nobility, for their king. He was murdered after a short reign of 18 months; upon which ensued an interregnum of 10 years, as related under the article ITALY, No. 32. During this time, they extended their conquests in that country; but at last the Romans, jealous of their progress, resolved to put a stop to their victories, and, if possible, to drive them quite out. For this purpose, they deigned not only to employ their own force, but entered into alliance with the Franks; which so alarmed the Lombards that they re-established the monarchical form of government among themselves, and chose Autharis the son of Clephis for their king. This monarch, considering that the power of the dukes, who had governed Lombardy for the space of 10 years, was during that length of time very much established, and that they would not probably be willing to part with the authority which they had so long enjoyed, allowed them to continue in their government; but obliged them to contribute one moiety of their revenues towards the maintenance and support of his royal dignity, suffering them to dispose of the other as they thought proper. He referred to himself the supreme dominion and authority; and took an oath of the dukes, that in time of war, they would readily assist him to the utmost of their power. Though he could remove the dukes at pleasure, yet he deprived none of them of their dukedoms, except in cases of treason; nor gave them to others, except when their male issue failed.\n\nHaving settled matters in this manner with the dukes, he enacted several wholesome laws against theft, rapine, murder, adultery, and other vices which prevailed among his subjects, and was the first of the Lombard kings who embraced Christianity. Most of his subjects followed the example of their monarch; but as they were all instructed by Arian bishops, they continued long infected with that heresy; which occasioned great disputes between them and the orthodox bishops of the cities subject to them.\n\nFrom the re-establishment of the monarchy under Autharis, to the reign of Rotharis in 636, the history of the Lombards affords nothing memorable. This period is remarkable for the introduction of written laws among these people. Before his time they had been governed only by tradition; but Rotharis, in imitation of the Romans and Goths, undertook the publishing of written laws; and to those which he enacted, many were added by the succeeding princes. Grotius prefers the method which the Lombards followed in making laws, to that which was practised by the Romans themselves. Among the latter the emperor was the sole lawgiver; so that whatever pleased him had the force of a law. But the Lombard kings did not assume that power to themselves, since their laws were enacted in public assemblies, convened for that purpose, after they had been maturely examined and approved of by all the lords of the kingdom. From these assemblies were excluded the ecclesiastic order, and the people; so that the legislative power was lodged in the king and nobles alone.\n\nThe reign of Rotharis is remarkable, not only for his introducing written laws among his subjects, but for the conquests he made, and the successful wars carried on with the exarch of Ravenna, whom he totally defeated in several engagements, and made himself master of some part of his territories. This monarch died in 652; and the affairs of the Lombards went prosperously, till the ambition of Luitprand laid the foundation of the total ruin of his kingdom.\n\nHe ascended the throne of Lombardy in 711, and watched all opportunities of enlarging his dominions at ambition, the expense of the emperor’s. Of this, a fair opportunity offered in 716; for the emperor Leo II, who at that time reigned in the east, having, by his famous edict, forbidden the worship of images, and ordered them to be everywhere pulled down, the people were so provoked at that innovation, that, in several places, they openly revolted, and, falling upon the emperor’s officers, drove them out of the cities. In the east, Germanus, patriarch of Constantinople, opposed the emperor’s edict with great warmth; but Leo caused him to be deposed, and Anastasius to be raised to that see in his room, ordering at the same time all the images in the imperial city to be pulled down and publicly burnt. He strictly enjoined his officers in the west, especially the exarch of Ravenna, to see his edict punctually obeyed in their respective governments. In compliance with these orders, Scholastics, then exarch, began to pull down the images in all the churches and public places in Ravenna; which incensed the superstitious multitude to such a degree, that taking arms, they openly declared they would rather renounce their allegiance to the emperor than the worship of images.\n\nThus a kind of civil war being kindled in the city, Luitprand thought he had now a favourable opportunity of making himself master of the seat of the exarch, not doubting but the conquest of such an important place would be followed by that of the whole exarchate. Having therefore drawn together all his forces, he unexpectedly appeared before Ravenna, and at last closely besieged it. The exarch little expected such a surprise, as a friendly correspondence had been maintained for many years between the exarchs and the Lombard kings. However, he defended the place with such courage and resolution, that Luitprand, despairing of success, broke up the siege and led his army against Clafiss, at a small distance from Ravenna, which\nLombards, which he took, plundered, and levelled with the ground. The loss of this place, and the severe treatment the inhabitants met with from the king, threw the citizens of Ravenna into the utmost consternation; which Luitprand being informed of, he resolved to take advantage of their fears, and, returning before Ravenna while the inhabitants were thus disheartened, to attempt once more the reduction of that place. Accordingly he led his whole army against it, and, by frequent attacks, tired the inhabitants and garrison to such a degree, that the exarch, finding they could hold out no longer, and despairing of relief, privately withdrew. Luitprand, informed of his retreat, attacked the town with more violence than ever; and, having carried it by storm, gave it to be plundered by his soldiers, who found in it an immense booty, as it had been for a long time the seat of the Roman emperors, of the Gothic kings, and the exarchs. The king stripped it of most of its valuable monuments of antiquity, and caused, among the rest, an equestrian statue of an emperor, of wonderful workmanship, to be conveyed to Pavia, where it is to be seen to this day.\n\nThe reduction of Ravenna was followed by the surrender of several cities of the exarchate, which Luitprand reduced to a dukedom; appointing Hildebrand his grandson to govern it with the title of duke; and giving him, as he was yet an infant, Peredeus duke of Vicenza for his guardian.\n\nThe conquest of Ravenna and the greater part of the exarchate did not a little alarm Gregory II., bishop of Rome. He was then at variance with the emperor, whose edict against the worshipping of images he had opposed with all his might, and by that means provoked Leo to such a degree, that he had threatened to drive him from the see, and send him into exile. However, the pope, no less jealous of the power of the Lombards than all his predecessors had been, resolved, by some means or other, to put a stop to their conquests. The only prince in Italy to whom he could have recourse was Ursus duke of Venice, the Venetians making already no inconsiderable figure. To him accordingly he wrote a very pressing letter; conjuring him to assist his worthy son the exarch, and, for the love of the holy faith, to attempt with him the recovery of the exarchate, which the wicked nation of the Lombards had unjustly taken from his sons Leo and Constantine emperors. Ursus and the Venetians, moved with the pope's letter, and at the same time greatly alarmed at the growth of so powerful a neighbour, promised to assist the exarch with the whole strength of their republic; and accordingly fitted out a considerable fleet, pretending it was designed for the service of the emperor against the Saracens. At the same time the exarch, who had taken refuge in Venice, abandoning that place, as it were in despair of bringing the duke over to his party, raised, in the places still subject to the emperor, what forces he was able; and having got together a considerable body, he marched with them towards Imola, giving out that he designed to besiege that city; but turning on a sudden towards Ravenna, as had been agreed on between him and the Venetians, he laid siege to it by land, while they invested it almost at the same instant by sea. Peredeus defended the town for some time with great courage and resolution; obliging all those who were able to bear arms to repair to the walls. But Lombards, the Venetians having, in spite of all opposition, forced open one of the gates on the side of the sea, the city was taken, and Peredeus slain, while he was attempting to retake Ravenna, at the head of a choice body, to drive the enemy from the posts they had seized. As for Hildebrand, he fell into the hands of the Venetians; who, having thus recovered Ravenna to the emperor, returned home, leaving the exarch in possession of the city. Luitprand was then at Pavia; but the town was taken before he could assemble his troops to relieve it.\n\nAnd now Gregory bishop of Rome, to whom the recovery of Ravenna was chiefly owing, persuading himself, that the emperor would, out of gratitude, give ear to his remonstrances and admonitions, began to solicit him with more pressing letters than ever to revoke his edict against the worship of images: but Leo, well apprised that the bishop, in all the measures he had taken, had been more influenced by a regard to his own interest than to that of the empire, instead of hearkening to his remonstrances, was still more provoked against him, for thus obstinately opposing the execution of his edict. Being, therefore, resolved at all events to have it observed in Rome itself, and, on the other hand, not doubting but the pope would oppose it to the last with all his might; in order to remove all obstacles, he sent three officers to Rome, with private orders, either to dispatch the pope, or to take him prisoner and convey him to Constantinople. At the same time, he wrote to Mauritius duke of Rome, secretly enjoining him to assist his three officers in their undertaking: but no favourable opportunity offering to put their design in execution, the emperor, in the year 725, recalled Scholasticus, and sent Paul a patrician into Italy, to govern in his room, with private instructions to encourage the above-mentioned officers with the promise of great rewards, and to assure them of his protection.\n\nBut, in the mean time, the plot was discovered, and two of the conspirators were apprehended by the citizens of Rome, and put to death; the third having escaped into a monastery, where he took the monastic habit and ended his days. Hereupon the exarch, in compliance with the emperor's orders, resolved to proceed no longer by secret plots, but by open force. Accordingly, he drew together a considerable body of troops, and set out at the head of them on his march to Rome, with a design to seize on the pope, and send him, as he had engaged to do, in chains to Constantinople. But, Luitprand on this occasion, Luitprand, though highly provoked against Gregory for having stirred up the Venetians against him, yet resolved to assist him and the citizens of Rome against the exarch, in order to keep the balance even between them, and by afflicting sometimes the one and sometimes the other, weaken both. Pursuant to this resolution, he ordered the Lombards of Tuscany, and those of the dukedom of Spoleto, to join the pope and the inhabitants of Rome; who, being by this reinforcement far superior in strength and number to the exarch, obliged him to return to Ravenna, and give over all thoughts of any further attempt on the person of the pope.\n\nIn the mean time, Leo, perspiring in his former resolution of suppressing throughout his dominions the worship of images, sent fresh orders to the exarch Paul,\nLombards. Paul, strictly enjoining him to cause his edict to be put in execution in all the cities of Italy under his empire, especially in Rome. At the same time, he wrote to the pope, promising him his favour and protection if he complied with the edict; and declaring him, if he continued to oppose it, a rebel, and no longer vested with the papal dignity. But Gregory was so far from yielding to the emperor's threats, or promises, that, on the contrary, he solemnly excommunicated the exarch for attempting to put the imperial edict in execution: and at the same time wrote circular letters to the Venetians, to King Luitprand, to the Lombard dukes, and to all the chief cities of the empire, exhorting them to continue steadfast in the Catholic faith, and to oppose with all their might such a detestable innovation. These letters made such an impression on the minds of the people in Italy, that though of different interests, and often at war with one another, they all united; professing they would defend the Catholic faith, and the life of the pope, in so glorious a cause, at the expense of their own; nay, the citizens of Rome, and the inhabitants of Pentapolis, now Marca d'Ancona, not contenting themselves with such a pretension, openly revolted from the emperor; and, pulling down his statues, they elected, by their own authority, magistrates to govern them during the interregnum. We are even told, that, transported with a blind zeal, they were for choosing a new emperor, and conducting him to Constantinople, not doubting but the people would everywhere join them. But the pope, thinking this revolution unfeasible, and not to be easily put in execution, opposed it; so that it did not take place.\n\nIn the mean time, the exarch Paul, having gained a considerable party in Ravenna, began, pursuant to the repeated orders from the emperor, to remove the images, as so many idols, out of the churches. Hereupon the adverse party, supported and encouraged by the pope, flew to arms; and, falling upon the iconoclasts, or image-breakers, as they styled them, gave rise to a civil war within the walls of Ravenna. Great numbers were killed on both sides; but those who were for the worship of images prevailing in the end, a dreadful slaughter was made of the opposite party; and, among the rest, the exarch himself was murdered. However, the city of Ravenna continued faithful to the emperor; but most of the cities of Romagna belonging to the exarchate, and all those of Pentapolis or La Marca d'Ancona, abhorring the emperor as an heretic, submitted to Luitprand king of the Lombards; who, pretending a zeal for the Catholic religion, took care to improve the discontent of the people to his advantage, by representing to them, that they could never maintain their religious rights under a prince, who was not only an heretic, but a persecutor of the orthodox.\n\nIn Naples, Exhilaratus, duke of that city, having received peremptory orders from the emperor to cause his edict to be put in execution, did all that lay in his power to persuade the people to receive it; but finding all his endeavours thwarted by the bishop of Rome, for whom the Neapolitans had a great veneration, he hired assassins to murder him. But the plot being discovered, though carried on with great secrecy, the Neapolitans, highly provoked against the duke, tore both him and his son to pieces, and likewise put to death one of his chief officers, who had composed a libel against the pope. Luitprand, and Gregory at that time duke of Benevento, laying hold of so favourable an opportunity to make themselves masters of the dukedom of Naples, did all that lay in their power to persuade the Neapolitans to submit to them. But the Neapolitans, bearing an irreconcilable hatred to the Lombards, with whom they had been constantly at variance, rejected every overture of that nature with the utmost indignation; and, continuing steadfast in their allegiance to Leo, received from Constantinople one Peter, who was sent to govern them in the room of Exhilaratus. Some writers suppose the Neapolitans, in this general revolt of the cities of Italy, to have shaken off the yoke with the rest, and to have appointed magistrates of their own election to govern them, in the room of the officers hitherto sent from Constantinople, or named by the exarch: but they are certainly mistaken; it being manifest from history, that Peter succeeded Exhilaratus in that dukedom, and that the Neapolitans continued to live under the emperors, till they were conquered many years after by the Normans.\n\nIn the mean time, Leo hearing of the murder of the exarch, and the general revolt of the cities, and not doubting but the pope was the chief author of so much mischief, sent the eunuch Eutychius into Italy, with the title and authority of exarch, strictly enjoining him to get the pope delpatched by some means or other, since his death was absolutely necessary for the tranquillity of Italy. The exarch spared no pains to get the pope into his power: but a messenger, whom he had sent to Rome, being apprehended by the citizens, and an order from the emperor being found upon him to all his officers in that city, commanding them to put the pope to death at all events, the pope's friends thenceforth guarded him with such care, that the exarch's emissaries could never afterwards find an opportunity of executing their design. As for the messenger, the Romans were for putting him to death; but the pope interposed, contenting himself with excommunicating the exarch.\n\nAnd now the Romans, provoked more than ever against Leo, and, on the other hand, unwilling to remain under the Lombards, resolved to revolt from the vassal emperor, and appoint their own magistrates, keeping themselves united under the pope, not yet as their prince, but only as their head. This they did accordingly; and from these slender beginnings the sovereignty of the popes in Italy took its rise, though they did not then, as is commonly supposed by historians, but many years after, become sovereign lords of Rome.\n\nEutychius failed in his design upon the life of the pope; but having brought with him from Constantinople a good number of troops, he easily quelled the rebellion in Ravenna, and severely punished the authors of the late disturbances. As for the rebellious Romans, he was well apprised he could never reduce them, so long as they were supported by the king of the Lombards; and therefore he employed all his art and policy to take off that prince from the party of the Romans, and bring him over to his own.\n\nLuitprand, for some time, withstood all his offers; but\nbut Thrasimund duke of Spoletto revolting at this very juncture, the exarch, laying hold of that opportunity, offered to assist the king with all his strength against the rebellious duke, provided he would, in like manner, assist him against the pope and the Romans. With this proposal Luitprand readily closed; and a league being concluded upon these terms between him and the exarch, the two armies joined, and began their march towards Spoletto. At their approach, the duke, despairing of being able to resist two such powers, came out with a small attendance to meet them, and, throwing himself at the king's feet, sued, in that humble posture, for pardon; which Luitprand not only granted him, but confirmed him in the dukedom, after he had obliged him to take a new oath of allegiance, and give hostages for his fidelity in time to come. From Spoletto, the two armies marched, in pursuance of the treaty, to Rome; and encamped in the meadows of Nero, between the Tiber and the Vatican.\n\nGregory had caused the city of Rome to be fortified in the best manner he could; but being sensible that the Romans alone could not long hold out against two such armies, and reflecting on the kind treatment the duke of Spoletto had met with upon his submitting to the king, he resolved to follow his example: and accordingly, taking with him some of the clergy, and the principal inhabitants of the city, he went to wait on the king in his camp; and there, with a pathetic speech, as he was a great master of eloquence, softened Luitprand to such a degree, that, throwing himself at his feet in the presence of the whole army, he begged pardon for entering into an alliance against him: and, assuring him of his protection for the future, he went with them to the church of St Peter; and there, disarming himself in the presence of his chief officers, he laid his girdle, his sword, and his gauntlet, with his royal mantle, his crown of gold, and crofs of silver, on the apostle's sepulchre. After this, he reconciled the pope with the exarch, who was thereupon received into the city, where he continued for some time, maintaining a friendly correspondence with the pope. At this time an impostor, taking the name of Tiberius, and pretending to be descended from the emperors, seduced a great many people in Tuscany, and was by them proclaimed emperor. The exarch, resolved to march against him; but as he had not sufficient forces to oppose the rebels, Gregory, who let no opportunity slip of obliging Leo, persuaded the Romans to attend the exarch in this expedition; by which means the usurper being taken in a castle, his head was sent to the emperor, and the rebellion utterly suppressed. But the emperor still insisting upon his edict against the images being received in Rome, the Romans, at the instigation of the pope, publicly renounced their allegiance to Leo, paid him no more tribute, and withdrew for ever their obedience to the emperors of the East.\n\nLeo, informed of this revolt, and not questioning but the pope was the author of it, immediately caused all the patrimonies of the church of Rome in Sicily, Calabria, and his other dominions, to be confiscated. At the same time, he ordered a powerful army to be raised, with a design to recover the towns that had revolted; to chastise the Romans for their rebellion; and, above all, to be revenged on the pope, who had raised all these disturbances, by himself opposing, and persuading others to oppose, the execution of his edict. Gregory, alarmed at the warlike preparations that were carrying on throughout the empire, and well apprised that they were chiefly designed against him and the Romans, resolved to recur to the protection of the French, the only nation at that time capable of coping with the emperor, and on whom, on account of their zeal for religion, he thought he might depend. The Lombards were then very powerful; but, as they wanted to be masters of Rome, he did not think it advisable to trust them. The Venetians, though zealous in the defence of the pope, were not yet in a condition to withstand the power of the emperor; and, besides, were jealous of the Lombards, who watched all opportunities of enlarging their dominions at the expense of their neighbours. As for Spain, it was then in a most deplorable condition, being overrun, and almost wholly ruined, by the Saracens.\n\nThe French nation was at this time governed by the celebrated Charles Martel, who had distinguished himself in a most eminent manner in the wars of France and Germany; and had, not long before, gained a signal victory over the Saracens in the neighbourhood of Tours; whence he was generally reputed the best commander, and the greatest hero, of his time. To him, therefore, Gregory sent a solemn embassy, with a great number of relics, earnestly entreating him to take the Romans, and the church, under his protection, and defend them against the attempts of Leo. The ambassadors were received with extraordinary marks of honour; and a treaty was soon concluded between them and Charles, who engaged to march into Italy in person, at the head of a powerful army, in defence of the Romans and the church, if they should be attacked either by the emperor or the Lombards. On the other hand, the Romans were to acknowledge him for their protector, and confer on him the honour of the consulship, as it had been formerly conferred on Clovis by the emperor Anastasius, after that prince had defeated the Visigoths. The ambassadors returned from France loaded with rich presents. But Gregory did not long enjoy the fruit of their negotiations; for he died the same year 731, and was succeeded by Gregory III., in whose time some place the above-mentioned embassy.\n\nThe French nation was at this time just recovered from its distressed situation under the descendants of Lombard Clovis; and by the bravery and conduct of Charles Martel, had become the most powerful kingdom in the west. His successor Pepin was no less wise and powerful than his father had been; and as the ambition of the Lombard princes would be satisfied with nothing less than the entire conquest of Italy, the French monarch, Charlemagne, under colour of afflicting the pope, at last put an end to the empire of Lombardy, as related under the article FRANCE, No. 21, 22.\n\nThe Lombards were at first a cruel and barbarous nation; but divesting themselves by degrees of their native fierceness and barbarity, especially after they had embraced the Christian religion, they governed with such equity and moderation, that most other nations\nLombart, or Lombard, Peter, an engraver of considerable eminence, who flourished about the year 1660. He was a native of Paris, where he learned the art of engraving. It appears that he came to England before the revolution, because some of his plates for English publications are dated prior to that event. He executed a vast variety of plates, as well historical as emblematical; which, however, were chiefly for books. But his best works are portraits; and of these he produced a considerable number, which are esteemed. They are mostly after Vandyck.—He also engraved historical subjects, from Poussin, Raphael, Annibal Carracci, Guido, and other masters.\n\nLOMENTACEÆ, in Botany, (from lomentum, a colour used by painters), the name of the 33rd order in Linnæus's Fragments of a Natural Method, consisting of the following genera, many of which furnish beautiful tinctures that are used in dyeing, viz. adenanthera, bauhinia, caesalpina, caffia, ceratonia, cercis, gleditsia, guilandina, hæmatoxylon, hymenæa, mimosa, parkinsonia, poinciana, polygama. See Botany.\n\nLoch-Lomond, a large lake of Dunbarton or Lennox-shire in Scotland, of which Mr Pennant gives the following description. \"Loch-Lomond, the last, the most beautiful of the Caledonian lakes. The first view of it from Tarbet presents an extensive serpentine winding amidst lofty hills; on the north, barren, black, and rocky, which darken with their shade that contracted part of the water. On the west side, the mountains are clothed near the bottoms with woods of oak quite to the water edge; their summits lofty, naked, and craggy. On the east side, the mountains are equally high; but the tops form a more even ridge parallel to the lake, except where Ben-Lomond, like Saul amidst his companions, overtops the rest. The upper parts were black and barren; the lower had great marks of fertility, or at least of industry, for the yellow corn was finely contrasted with the verdure of the groves intermixed with it.\n\n\"This eastern boundary is part of the Grampian hills, which extend from hence through the counties of Perth, Angus, Mearns, and Aberdeen. The road runs sometimes through woods; at others is exposed and naked; in some, so steep as to require the support of a wall; the whole the work of the foldery; blest exchange of instruments of destruction for those that give safety to the traveller, and a polish to the once inaccessible native! Two great headlands covered with trees separate the first scene from one totally different; the last is called the Point of Firkin. On passing this cape an expanse of water bursts at once on your eye, varied with all the softer beauties of nature. Immediately beneath is a flat covered with wood and corn: beyond, the headlands stretch far into the water, and consist of gentle ridges; many have their surfaces covered with wood, others adorned with trees loofly scattered either over a fine verdure or the purple bloom of the heath. Numbers of islands are dispersed over the lake, of the same elevated form as the little capes, and wooded in the same manner; others just peep above the surface, and are tufted with trees; and numbers are so disposed as to form magnificent vistas between.\n\n\"Opposite Luss, at a small distance from thence, is a mountainous island almost covered with wood; it is near half a mile long, and has a most fine effect. I could not count the number of islands, but was told there are 28; the largest two miles long, and stocked with deer.\n\n\"The length of this charming lake is 24 miles; its greatest breadth 8; its greatest depth, which is between the point of Firkin and Benlomond, is 120 fathoms. Besides the fish common to the lochs are gnats, called here poans.\n\n\"The surface of Loch-lomond has for several years past been observed gradually to increase, and invade the adjacent shore; and there is reason to suppose that churches, houses, and other buildings, have been lost in the water. Near Luss is a large heap of stones at a distance from the shore, known by the name of the old church; and about a mile to the south of that, in the middle of a large bay, between Camtraddan and the isle Inch-tavanack, is another heap, said to have been the ruins of a house. To confirm this, it is evident by a passage in Camden's Atlas Britannica, that an island, existing in his time, is now lost; for he speaks of the isle of Camtraddan, placed between the lands of the same name and Inch-tavanack, in which, adds he, was an house and orchard. Besides this proof, large trees with their branches still adhering are frequently found in the mud near the shore, overwhelmed in former times by the increase of water. This is supposed to be occasioned by the vast quantities of stone and gravel that are continually brought down by the mountain rivers, and by the falls of the banks of the Leven; the first filling the bed of the lake, the last impeding its discharge through the bed of the river.\"\n\nLomonozof, a celebrated Russian poet, the great refiner of his native tongue, was the son of a dealer in fish at Kolmogori: he was born in 1711, and was fortunately taught to read; a rare circumstance at that time for a person of his station in Russia. His natural genius for poetry was first kindled by the perusal of the Song of Solomon, done into verse by Polotkoff, whose rude compositions, perhaps scarcely superior to our version of the psalms by Sternhold and Hopkins, inspired him with such an irresistible passion for the muses, that he fled from his father, who was desirous of compelling him to marry, and took refuge in the Kailkonofpalki monastery at Moscow; there he had\nLomonozof had an opportunity of indulging his taste for letters, and of studying the Greek and Latin languages. In this seminary he made so considerable progress in polite literature, as to be noticed and employed by the Imperial Academy of Sciences. In 1736 he was sent at the expense of that society, to the university of Marburg in Hesse-Cassel, where he became a scholar of the celebrated Christian Wolf, under whom he studied universal grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy. He continued at Marburg four years, during which time he applied himself with indefatigable diligence to chemistry, which he afterwards pursued with still greater success under the famous Henckel at Freyberg in Saxony. In 1741 he returned into Russia; was chosen in 1742 adjunct to the Imperial Academy; and in the ensuing year member of that society and professor of chemistry. In 1760 he was appointed inspector of the seminary then annexed to the academy; in 1764 he was gratified by the late empress with the title of counsellor of state; and died April 4th that year, in the 54th year of his age. Lomonozof excelled in various kinds of composition: but his chief merit, by which he bears the first rank among the Russian writers, is derived from his poetical compositions, the finest of which are his odes. The first was written in 1739, while he studied in Germany, upon the taking of Kotchin, a fortress in Crime Tartary, by Marshal Munich. The odes of Lomonozof are greatly admired for originality of invention, sublimity of sentiment, and energy of language; and compensate for the turgid style which, in some instances, has been imputed to them, by that spirit and fire which are the principal characteristics in this species of composition. Pindar was his great model; and if we may give credit to a person well versed in the Russian tongue, he has succeeded in this daring attempt to imitate the Theban bard, without incurring the censure of Horace. In this, as well as several other species of composition, he enriched his native language with various kinds of metre, and seems to have merited the appellation bestowed upon him of the Father of Russian Poetry. A brief recapitulation of the principal works of Lomonozof, which were printed in three volumes octavo, will serve to show the versatility of his genius, and his extensive knowledge in various branches of literature. The first volume, besides a Preface on the advantages derived to the Russian tongue from the ecclesiastical writings, contains ten sacred and nineteen panegyric odes, and several occasional pieces of poetry. The second comprises An Essay in Prose on the Rules for Russian Poetry; Translation of a German Ode; Idyls; Tamira and Selim, a tragedy; Demophon, a tragedy; Poetical Epistle on the Utility of Glass; two cantos of an epic poem, entitled, Peter the Great; A Congratulatory Copy of Verses; An Ode; Translation of Baptist Rouffleau's Ode Sur le Bonheur; Heads of a Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy; certain passages translated in verse and prose, according to the original, from Cicero, Erasmus, Lucian, Ælian, Ammianus Marcellinus, Quintus Curtius, Homer, Virgil, Martial, Ovid, Horace, and Seneca, which Russian translations were brought as examples in his Lectures upon Rhetoric; lastly, Description of the Comet which appeared in 1744. The third volume consists chiefly of Speeches and Treatises read before the Academy; Panegyric on the Empress Elizabeth; on Peter the Great; Treatise on the Advantages of Chemistry; on the Phenomena of the Air occasioned by the Electrical Fire, with a Latin translation of the same; on the Origin of Light as a new Theory of Colours; Methods to determine with precision the Course of a Vessel; on the origin of Metals by the means of Earthquakes; Latin Dissertation on Solidity and Fluidity; on the Transit of Venus in 1761, with a German translation. Besides these various subjects, Lomonozof made no inconsiderable figure in history, having published two small works relative to that of his own country. The first, styled Annals of the Russian Sovereigns, is a short chronology of the Russian monarchs; and the second is, the Ancient History of Russia, from the Origin of that Nation to the Death of the Great Duke Yaroslaf I. in 1054; a performance of great merit, as it illustrates the most difficult and obscure period in the annals of this country.\n\nLONDON, a large city of Middlesex in England, the metropolis of Great Britain, and one of the most wealthy and populous cities in the world, is situated on the river Thames, in 51° 31' north latitude, 400 miles south of Edinburgh, and 270 south-east of Dublin; 180 miles west of Amsterdam, 210 north-west of Paris, 500 south-west of Copenhagen, 600 north-west of Vienna, 790 south-west of Stockholm, 800 north-east of Madrid, 820 north-west of Rome, 830 north-east of Lisbon, 1360 north-west of Constantinople, and 1414 south-west of Moscow.\n\nThis city was by the Romans first called Londinium or Lundinum, as we find it in Tacitus, Ptolemy, Ammianus, and Ammianus. That name was afterwards changed into Augusta; in honour, as some say, of Helena Augusta, the mother of Constantine the Great; while others think it more probable that it had this name from the second legion, whose peculiar title was Augusta; and some imagine that the honourable appellation of Augusta was conferred upon this city by the Romans, as upon other principal cities of their empire, on account of its being grown up to be the capital of their British province. How long the name of Augusta prevailed, is not now certainly known; but after the establishment of the Saxons we find no more mention of Augusta. It was then called Caer Llundain, Lundunum Burig, Lunden Cæsæter, Lundenwyse, Lundenme, Lunden-berk or Lundenburg; since the conquest the records call it Londinia, Londonia, Londine, Londres; and, for several ages past, it has been called London, a manifest corruption from Tacitus's Londinium. The most probable derivation of these names appears to be, either from the British words thong, \"a ship,\" and din, \"a town,\" i.e., a town or harbour for ships; or from Llin \"a lake,\" i.e., Llin din, \"the town upon the lake,\" the Saxon side being supposed, upon very probable grounds, to have been anciently a great expanse of water.\n\nLondinium, however, was not the primitive name of this famous place, which existed before the invasion of the Romans; being, at the time of Caesar's arrival in the island, the capital of the Trinobantes or Trinovantes. The name of this nation, as appears from Baxter's British Glossary *, was derived from the three following British words, tri, nou, hant, which signify the \"inhabitants of the new city.\" This name, it is supposed,\nLondon, supposed, might have been given them by their neighbours, on account of their having newly come from the continent into Britain, and having there founded a city called *iri-nou*, or the \"new city;\" the most ancient name of the renowned metropolis of Britain. The Trinobantes had come so lately from Belgium, that they seem scarcely to have been firmly established in Britain at the time of the first Roman invasion: For their new city, which soon after became so famous, was then so inconsiderable, that it is not mentioned by Cæsar, though he must have been within sight of the place where it was situated. His silence about this place, indeed, is brought as a proof that he did not cross the Thames; while Norden by the *firmissima civitas* of the Trinobantes understands the city in question, the Trinobantes themselves having been among the first of the British states who submitted to that conqueror.\n\nBy Ptolemy, and some other ancient writers of good authority, indeed, Londinium is placed in Cantium, or Kent, on the south side of the Thames; and it is the opinion of some moderns, that the Romans probably had a station there, to secure their conquests on that side of the river, before they reduced the Trinobantes. The place fixed upon for this station is St George's Fields, a large plat of ground situated between Lambeth and Southwark, where many Roman coins, bricks, and chequered pavements, have been found. Three Roman ways from Kent, Surrey, and Middlesex, intersected each other in this place; this therefore is supposed to be the original Londinium, which it is thought became neglected after the Romans reduced the Trinobantes, and settled on the other side of the Thames; and the name was transferred to the new city.\n\nThe situation of this city, as Mr Pennant observes, was just such as the people would select according to the rule established among the Britons. An immense forest originally extended to the river side, and even as late as the reign of Henry II. covered the northern neighbourhood of the city, and was filled with various species of beasts of chase. It was defended naturally by fosses; one formed by the creek which runs along Fleet-ditch, the other afterwards known by that of Wallbrook; the south side was guarded by the Thames; the north they might think sufficiently protected by the adjacent forest.\n\nThe Romans possessed themselves of London, on their second invasion in the reign of Claudius, about 105 years after their first under Cæsar. They had begun with Camelodunum, the present Maldon in Essex; and having taken it, planted there a colony consisting of veterans of the 14th legion. London and Verulam were next taken possession of about one and the same time. Camelodunum was made a *colonia* or place governed entirely by Roman laws and customs; Verulam (on the site of which St Alban's now stands), a *municipium*, in which the natives were honoured with the privileges of Roman citizens, and enjoyed their own laws and constitutions; and Londinium only a *praefectura*, the inhabitants, a mixture of Romans and Britons, being suffered to enjoy no more than the name of citizens of Rome, being governed by prefects sent annually from thence, without having either their own laws or magistrates. \"It was even then of such concourse (says Mr Pennant), and such vast trade, that the wife\n\nconquerors did not think fit to trust the inhabitants of London, with the same privileges as other places of which they had less reason to be jealous.\" But others observe, that this is a mistake; and that the Romans, in order to secure their conquest, and to gain the affections of those Britons who had already submitted to their authority, made London equally a municipium or free city with Verulanium, as may be seen by referring to Aulus Gellius, lib. xvi. c. 13, and to Spanhem, orbis Roman. tom ii. p. 37, 38.\n\nIt is difficult to say what were the particular articles of commerce exported from and imported into the commerce port of London at this period. The imports and exports of the island in general we know: Strabo says, \"Britain produceth corn, cattle, gold, silver, iron; besides which, skins, slaves, and dogs, naturally excellent hunters, are exported from that island.\" It is probable that the two first and three last articles were exported from London; and perhaps, too, the *gagates* or jet-stone mentioned by Solinus as one of the productions of Britain, together with horses, were exported from thence. The imports were at first salt, earthenware, and works in brafs, polished bits of bones emulating ivory, horse collars, toys of amber, glaisses, and other articles of the same material.\n\nIn the reign of Nero, as Tacitus informs us, London became a city highly famous for the great conflux of merchants, her extensive commerce, and plenty of all things. No fewer than seven of the fourteen itineraries of Antoninus begin or end at London; which tends to corroborate the many proofs which might be adduced, that this city was the capital of Britain in the Roman times.\n\nAt first London had no walls or other fortifications when first to defend it, and was therefore exposed to the attacks surrounded of every enemy; and thus it suffered severely about the year 64, being burnt by the Britons under Boadicea, and all the inhabitants massacred. But it was soon restored by the Romans; and increased so much, that in the reign of the emperor Severus it is called by Herodian a *great and wealthy city*. It continued, however, in a defenceless state for more than a century after this last period; when at last a wall of hewn stone and British bricks was erected round it.\n\nLondon at this time extended in length from Ludgate-hill to a spot a little beyond the Tower. The breadth was not half equal to the length, and at each end grew considerably narrower. Maitland attributes the building of the walls to Theodosius governor of Britain in 369. Dr Woodward, with more probability, supposes them to have been founded under the auspices of Constantine the Great; and this seems to be confirmed by the numbers of coins of that emperor's mother Helena, which have been discovered under them, placed there by him in compliment to her. The same emperor made it a bishop's see; for it appears that the bishops of London and York, and another English bishop, were at the council of Arles in the year 314; he also fettered a mint in it, as is plain from some of his coins. The ancient course of the wall was as follows: It began with a fort near the present site of the Tower, was continued along the Minories, and the back of Houndsditch, across Bishopsgate-street, in a straight line by London-wall to Cripplegate; then returned southward by Crowder's Well\nLondon. alley (where several remnants of lofty towers were lately to be seen), to Aldersgate, thence along the back of Bull-and-Mouth-street to Newgate, and again along the back of the houses in the Old Bailey to Ludgate; soon after which, it probably finished with another fort, where the house, late the king's printing house, in Black Friars, now stands: from hence another wall ran near the river side, along Thames-street, quite to the fort on the eastern extremity. The walls were three miles a hundred and sixty-five feet in circumference, guarded at proper distances on the land side with fifteen lofty towers; some of them were remaining within these few years, and possibly may still. Maitland mentions one twenty-six feet high, near Gravel-lane, on the west side of Houndsditch; another, about eighty paces south-east towards Aldgate; and the bases of another, supporting a modern house, at the lower end of the street called the Vinegar-yard, south of Aldgate. The walls, when perfect, are supposed to have been twenty-two feet high, the towers forty. These, with the remnants of the wall, proved the Roman structure, by the titles and disposition of the masonry. London-wall, near Moorfields, is now the most entire part left of that ancient precinct. The gates which received the great military roads, were four. The Praetorian way, the Saxon Watling-street, passed under one, on the site of the late Newgate; vestiges having been discovered of the road in digging above Holburn-bridge: it turned down to Dowgate, or more properly Dwr-gate or Water-gate, where there was a trajeetus or ferry, to join it to the Watling-street, which was continued to Dover. The Hermin-street passed under Cripplegate; and a vicinal way went under Aldgate by Bethnal-green, towards Oldford, a pass over the river Lee to Duroleiton, the modern Leighton Essex.\n\nAfter the Romans deserted Britain, a new and fierce race succeeded. The Saxons, under their leaders Hengist and Horsa, landed in 448, having been invited over by the provincials as auxiliaries against the Scots and Picts; but quarrelling with their friends, they found means to establish themselves in the island, and in process of time entirely subdued them, as related under the article ENGLAND, No. 31—44. London fell into the hands of those invaders about the year 457; and became the chief city of the Saxon kingdom in Essex. It suffered much in the wars carried on between the Britons and Saxons: but it soon recovered; so that Bede calls it a princely mart-town, under the government of a chief magistrate, whose title of portusvase, or portrewa, (for we find him called by both names), conveys a grand idea of the mercantile state of London in those early ages, that required a governor or guardian of the port. During the civil wars of the Saxons with each other, the Londoners had always the address to keep themselves neuter; and about the year 819, when all the seven Saxon kingdoms fell under the power of Egbert, London became the metropolis of England, which it has ever since continued.\n\nDuring the invasions of the Danes, London suffered greatly. In 849, these invaders entered the Thames with 250 ships, plundered and burnt the city, and massacred the inhabitants; and two years after they returned with a fleet of 350 sail, fully determined to destroy every thing that had escaped their barbarity in the former expedition. At this time, however, they were disappointed; most of their troops being cut in pieces by King Ethelwolf and his son Athelbald; yet such was the destruction made by those barbarians at London, that it suffered more from these two incursions than ever it had done before.\n\nIn the reign of King Alfred the Great, London began to recover from its former ruinous state. He restored its walls, drove out the Danish inhabitants who had settled there, restored the city to its former liberties and beauty, and committed the care of it to his son-in-law, Ethelred duke of Mercia, in hopes that this might always be a place of secure retreat within its strong walls, whatever might happen from a foreign or domestic enemy. In 893, however, he had the mortification to see his capital totally reduced to ashes by an accidental fire, which could not be extinguished, as the houses at that time were all built of wood. The walls, however, being constructed of incombustible materials, continued to afford the same protection as before; the houses were quickly rebuilt, and the city divided into wards and precincts, for its better order and government. This king also instituted the office of sheriff, the nature of which office made it necessary to its government in London; so that here we have the glimmerings of the order of magistrates afterwards settled in the city of London: in the person of the portreeve, or portergrave, or governor of the city, as supreme magistrate; in the sheriff, and in the officer or subordinate magistrate by what name forever then distinguished, which, being placed at the head of each ward or precinct, were analogous to the more modern title of aldermen and common-council men.\n\nAlfred having settled the affairs of England in the brick and most prudent manner, directed his attention to the ornamenting, as much as possible, the city of London, houses first. For this purpose, he spirited up the English to an emulation in building their houses of stronger and more durable materials than formerly. At that time their houses were mostly of wood; and an house built of any other materials was looked upon as a kind of wonder. But Alfred having begun to raise his palaces of stone and brick, the opulent Londoners, and the nobility resident in and about London, followed the example, though the custom did not come into general use till some ages after.\n\nIn 1015, a foreign enemy again appeared before London. Canute king of Denmark having invaded Canute and plundered the counties of Dorset, Somerset, and Wilts, sailed up the Thames with 200 ships, and laid siege to the city. The citizens continued faithful, notwithstanding the defection of the greatest part of the kingdom; and made such a brave resistance, that Canute thought fit to withdraw his army, leaving only his fleet to blockade the city by water, that when he found a fair opportunity he might renew the siege with better success. At last, however, being defeated in several battles by Edmund Ironside, he was obliged to call off his ships to cover his own army in case of necessity. In the compromise, however, which was afterwards made between Edmund and Canute, the city of London was given to the latter, and owned him for his lawful sovereign. We have a strong proof of the opulence of London even at this time, from the tax laid upon\nupon it by Canute in order to pay his army; this being no less than 10,500l., while the rest of the nation was at the same time taxed only at 72,000l.\n\nIn 1046, we have the first instance of the Londoners sending representatives to parliament. This happened on settling the succession to the throne after Canute's death. The English in general declared for Edward son of King Ethelred; or, if that could not be carried, for Hardicanute, son of Canute by Queen Emma, and then absent on a tour to Denmark. The city of London espoused the claim and interest of Harold Harefoot, son also of Canute, by Queen Elgiva of Northampton. Edward's party soon declined; and the Londoners agreed, for the peace of the realm, that the two brothers should divide the kingdom between them; but Hardicanute did not return in proper time to England, a writena-gemote was held at Oxford, where Earl Leofric, and most of the thanes on the north of the Thames, with the pilots of London, chose Harold for their king. Here, by pilots we are to understand the directors, magistrates, or leading men of the city: and this manifestly shows, that London was then of such consequence, that no important national affair was transacted without the consent of the inhabitants; for the Saxon annals assure us, that none were admitted into this assembly of election but the nobility and the pilots of London.\n\nOn the invasion of the Normans under William I. London submitted as well as the rest of the kingdom; and received two charters from that prince, confirming all the privileges they had under the Saxon kings, and adding several new ones. But while the citizens were promising themselves all manner of security and tranquillity under the new government, it was almost entirely reduced to ashes by an accidental fire in 1077. It had scarcely recovered from this calamity, when it was visited by another of the same kind in 1086, which began at Ludgate and destroyed the best and most opulent part of the city; consuming, among other buildings, the cathedral of St Paul's; which, however, was soon rebuilt more magnificently than before. Under the reign of William Rufus, London suffered considerably by fires, hurricanes, and inundations, and seems to have been deprived by the tyranny of that prince; but Henry I. granted large immunities to the city, which again revived its trade, and was favourable to the progress of the arts. The king, however, still retained the privilege of appointing the portreeve, or chief magistrate; but the immunities granted to the Londoners secured their affections, and tended much to secure him on the throne. At the same time, there was such a plenty of all kinds of provisions, that as much corn was sold for 1s. as would suffice 100 people for a day; 4d. would purchase as much hay and corn as would maintain 20 horses for a day; and a sheep could be bought for a groat.\n\nHenry thought proper also to check the licentious behaviour of the Normans, which, by the favour showed them under the two Williams, had carried them into the most barbarous practices. Those who followed William Rufus in his excursions, harried and plundered the country at discretion. Many of them were so extravagant in their barbarity, that what they could not eat or drink in their quarters, they either obliged the people to carry to market and sell for their use, or else they would throw it into the fire: and, at their going off, they frequently washed their horses' heels with the drink, and flaved the casks containing the remainder. King Henry resolved to put a stop to these excesses and savage customs; and therefore published a proclamation at London, commanding that henceforward all persons who should be convicted of such barbarities should have their eyes pulled out, or their hands or feet cut off, as the ministers of justice should think fit. This effectually checked the licence of the Normans, and the city continued to flourish throughout the reigns of Henry I. and Stephen. The attachment of the citizens to Stephen, however, was a crime which never could be forgiven by Henry II. and, of consequence, he made them sensible of his displeasure, by making frequent demands of money from them. About this time, indeed, the Londoners were arrived at such a pitch of licentiousness, that their prosperity seemed a curse rather than a blessing. The sons of the most eminent and wealthy citizens entered into a confederacy to commit burglaries, and to rob and murder all that came in their way in the nighttime. The king took an opportunity from these irregularities to enrich himself. He demanded several loans and free gifts; till at last the Londoners, to prevent further inquiries into their conduct, paid into the exchequer 5000l. in three years. These disorders, however, were at last stopped by the execution of John Senex; who, though a very rich and reputable citizen, had engaged in these enterprises. He offered 500l. weight of silver, a prodigious sum in those days, for his pardon, but was refused. The king, however, still continued to drain the citizens of their money by free gifts; and at last fined every separate guild, fraternity, or company, that had presumed to act as bodies corporate without the royal letters-patent.\n\nOn the death of Henry II. the title of the first magistrate of London was changed from portreeve to that of bailiff; and in 1189 claimed and acted in the office of the chief butler at the coronation of Richard I. In 1191 this monarch permitted the bailiff, named Henry Fitz-Alwine, to assume the title of mayor. For, in which first 1192, we find certain orders of the mayor and aldermen, men to prevent fires; whereby it was ordained, that \"all houses thereafter to be erected in London and the liberties thereof, should be built of stone, with party-walls of the same; and covered either with flates or tiles, to prevent those dreadful calamities by fire, which were frequently and chiefly occasioned by houses built of wood, and thatched with straw or reeds.\" And for this purpose, it was also provided by the discreet men of the city, \"that 12 aldermen of the city should be chosen in full hustings, and there sworn to assist the mayor in appeasing contentions that might arise among neighbours in the city upon encloshure between land and land, and to regulate the dimensions of party-walls, which were to be of stone, 16 feet high and three feet thick; and to give directions about girders, windows, gutters, and wells.\" Such confidence also did Richard put in the wisdom and faithfulness of the city of London, that when it was resolved to fix a standard for weights and measures for the whole realm, his majesty committed the execution thereof to the sheriffs of London and Middlesex, whom he commanded to provide measures, gallons, iron rods, and\nLondon; and inquiring for the authors of the riot, London. Confiantine, the ringleader boldly answered, that \"he was one; that they had done no more than they ought; and that they were resolved to avow what they had done, let the consequence be what it would.\" In this he was seconded by his nephew and one Geoffrey: but the judiciary, having dismissed all the rest, detained these three, and ordered them to be hanged next morning, though Confiantine offered 15,000 marks for his pardon. Hubert then coming into the city with a strong guard, caused the hands and feet of most of the principal rioters he could seize to be cut off: all which was executed without any legal proceedings or form of trial. After these arbitrary cruelties, he degraded the mayor and all the magistrates; placed a curfew over the city, and obliged 30 persons of his own choosing to become securities for the good behaviour of the whole city. Several thousand marks were also exacted by the king, before he would consent to a reconciliation.\n\nThis arbitrary conduct alarmed the whole nation. The parliament of 1224 began to be uneasy for themselves, and addressed his majesty that he would be pleased to confirm the charter of liberties which he had sworn to observe; and the consequence of this application was a confirmation of the magna charta in the full parliament at Westminster in the year 1225. At this time also, the rights and privileges of the citizens were confirmed. They were exempted from prosecution for burials, i.e., lifted cloth; and were granted the right of having a common seal. The necessitous circumstances of this monarch, however, made him often exact money arbitrarily as long as he lived.\n\nUnder the succeeding reigns, as the liberty of the people in general, was augmented, so the liberty, opulence, and power of the citizens of London increased, until they became a kind of balance to the power of the crown itself, which in some measure they still continue to be. Riots indeed, for which they generally suffered, were by no means unfrequent; the city often suffered by fires and plagues. Nothing, however, happened which materially affected the welfare of the city, till the reign of Charles II. in 1665—This year London was ravaged by the most violent plague ever known in Britain. The whole summer had been remarkably still and warm, so that the weather was sometimes suffocating even to people in perfect health; and by this unusual heat and sultry atmosphere, people were undoubtedly prepared for receiving the infection, which appeared with violence in the months of July, August, and September. A violent plague had raged in Holland in the year 1663; on which account the importation of merchandise from that country was prohibited by the British legislature in 1644. Notwithstanding this prohibition, however, it seems the plague had actually been imported; for in the close of the year 1664, two or three persons died suddenly in Westminster, with marks of the plague on their bodies. Some of their neighbours, terrified at the thoughts of their danger, removed into the city; but their removal proved too late for themselves, and fatal to those among whom they came to reside. They soon died of the plague; and communicated the infection to so many others, that it became impossible to extinguish the seeds of it, by separating those that were infected from such as were.\nwere not. It was confined, however, through a hard frosty winter, till the middle of February, when it again appeared in the parish of St Giles's, to which it had been originally brought; and, after another long rest till April, showed its malignant force afresh, as soon as the warmth of the spring gave it opportunity.\n\nAt first, it took off one here and there, without any certain proof of their having infected each other, and houses began to be shut up, with a design to prevent its spreading. But it was now too late; the infection gained ground every day, and the shutting up of houses only made the disease spread wider. People, afraid of being shut up, and sequestrated from all communication with society, concealed their illness, or found means to escape from their places of confinement; while numbers expired in the greatest torments, destitute of every affiance; and many died both of the plague and other diseases, who would in all probability have recovered, had they been allowed their liberty, with proper exercise and air.—A house was shut up on account of a maid-servant, who had only spots, and not the gangrenous plague-blotches, upon her, so that her distemper was probably a petechial fever. She recovered; but the people of the house obtained no liberty to stir, either for air or exercise, for 40 days. The bad air, fear, anger, and vexation, attending this injurious treatment, cast the miseries of the family into a fever. The visitors appointed to search the house, said it was the plague, though the physicians were of a different opinion: the family, however, were obliged to begin their quarantine anew though it had been almost expired before; and this second confinement affected them so much, that most of the family fell sick, some of one distemper and some of another. Every illness that appeared in the family produced a fresh prolongation of their confinement; till at last the plague was actually brought in by some of those who came to inquire into the health of the family, and almost every person in the house died.\n\nMany examples of a similar kind happened, and this was one of the worst consequences of shutting up houses. All means of putting a stop to the infection were evidently ineffectual. Multitudes fled into the country; many merchants, owners of ships, &c., shut themselves up, on board their vessels, being supplied with provisions from Greenwich, Woolwich, and single farm houses on the Kentish side. Here, however, they were safe; for the infection never reached below Deptford, though the people went frequently on shore to the country towns, villages, and farm houses, to buy fresh provisions. As the violence of the plague increased, the ships which had families on board removed farther off; some went quite out to sea, and then put into such harbours and roads as they could best get at.\n\nIn the mean time, the distemper made the most rapid advances within the city. In the last week of July, the number of burials amounted to 2010; but the first week of August it rose to 3817; thence to 3880; then to 4237; the next week, to 6102; and at last to 7500 and 8000 weekly. In the last week of September, however, the fury of the disease began to abate; though vast numbers were sick, yet the number of burials decreased from 7155 to 5538; the next week there was a farther decrease to 4929, then to 4327, next to 2665, then to 1421, and the next week to 1031.\n\nAll this while, the poor people had been reduced to the greatest distresses, by reason of the stagnation of trade, and the sicknesses to which they were peculiarly liable on account of their manner of living. The rich, however, contributed to their subsistence in a most liberal manner. The sums collected on this occasion are indeed almost incredible; being said to amount to 100,000l. per week. The king is reported to have contributed 1000l. weekly; and in the parish of Cripplegate alone, 17,000l. was distributed weekly among the poor inhabitants.—By the vigilance also of the magistrates, provisions continued remarkably cheap throughout the whole time of this dreadful calamity, so that all riots and tumults on that account were prevented; and at last, on the cessation of the disease in the winter of 1665, the inhabitants who had fled returned to their habitations, and London to appearance became as populous as ever, though it was computed that 100,000 persons had been carried off by the plague.\n\nThe city was scarcely recovered from the desolation occasioned by the plague, when it was almost totally destroyed by a most dreadful fire. This broke out in a baker's shop in Pudding-lane, on Saturday night, September 2, 1666. In a few hours Billingsgate ward was entirely burnt down; and before morning the fire had crossed Thames-street, and destroyed the church of St Magnus. From thence it proceeded to the bridge, and consumed a great pile of buildings there; but was stopped by the want of anything more to destroy. The flames, however, being scattered by a strong east wind, continued their devastations in other quarters. All efforts to stop it proved unsuccessful throughout the Sunday. That day it proceeded up as far as Garlick-hill; and destroying Canon-street, invaded Cornhill and the Exchange. On Monday, the flames having proceeded eastward against the wind through Thames-street, invaded Tower-street, Gracechurch-street, Fenchurch-street, Dowgate, Old Fish-street, Watling-street, Threadneedle-street, and several others, from all which it broke at once into Cheapside. In a few hours Cheapside was all in flames, the fire having reached it from so many places at once. The fire then continuing its course from the river on one side, and from Cheapside on the other, surrounded the cathedral of St Paul's. This building stood by itself at some distance from any houses; yet such was the violence of the flames, and the heat of the atmosphere occasioned by them, that the cathedral took fire at top. The great beams and masonry stones broke through into Faith-church underneath, which was quickly set on fire; after which, the flames invaded Pater-noster-row, Newgate-street, the Old Bailey, Ludgate-hill, Fleet-street, Ironmonger-lane, Old Jewry, Laurence-lane, Milk-street, Wood-street, Gutter-lane, Foster-lane, Lothbury, Cateaton-street; and, having destroyed Christ-church, burnt furiously through St Martin's le Grand towards Aldergate.\n\nThe fire had now attained its greatest extent, and was several miles in compass. The vast clouds of smoke obscured the sun so, that he either could not be seen at all, or appeared through it as red as blood. The flames reached an immense way up into the air, and\ntheir reflection from the smoke, which in the nighttime seemed also like flame, made the appearance still more terrible. The atmosphere was illuminated to a great extent, and this illumination is said to have been visible as far as Jedburgh in Scotland. Some of the light ashes also are said to have been carried to the distance of 16 miles. Guildhall exhibited a singular appearance. The oak with which it was built was so solid that it would not flame, but burnt like charcoal, so that the building appeared for several hours like an enchanted palace of gold or burnished braes.\n\nAt last, on Wednesday morning, when everyone expected that the suburbs as well as the city were to have been burnt, the fire began of itself to abate by reason of the wind having ceased, and some other changes no doubt taken place in the atmosphere. It was checked by the great building in Leadenhall-street, and in other streets by the blowing up several houses with gunpowder; and on Thursday the flames were quite extinguished.—The following is a calculation of the damage done by this extraordinary conflagration.\n\n| Calculation of the damage done. |\n|--------------------------------|\n| Thirteen thousand two hundred houses, at 12 years purchase, supposing the rent of each £1 sterling, L. 3,960,000 |\n| Eighty-seven parish churches, at 800l. 696,000 |\n| Six consecrated chapels, at 200l. 1,200 |\n| The royal exchange - 50,000 |\n| The customhouse - 10,000 |\n| Fifty-two halls of companies, at 1,500l. each - 78,000 |\n| Three city gates, at 3,000l. each - 9,000 |\n| Jail of Newgate - 15,000 |\n| Four stone bridges - 6,000 |\n| Seftons house - 7,000 |\n| Guildhall, with the courts and offices belonging to it - 40,000 |\n| Blackwell-hall - 3,000 |\n| Bridewell - 3,000 |\n| Poultry compter - 3,000 |\n| Woodlifreet compter - 3,000 |\n| St Paul's church - 2,000,000 |\n| Wares, household stuff, money, and venemable goods lost or spoiled - 2,000,000 |\n| Hire of porters, carts, waggons, barges, boats, &c. for removing goods - 200,000 |\n| Printed books and paper in shops and warehouses - 150,000 |\n| Wine, tobacco, sugar, &c. of which the town was at that time very full - 1,500,000 |\n\nL. 10,689,000\n\nIt was never certainly known whether this fire was accidental or designed. A suspicion fell upon the Papists; and this gained such general credit, that it is asserted for a truth on the monument which is erected in memory of the conflagration. Of the truth of this assertion, however, though there was not sufficient proof, it had the effect of making the Papists most violently suspected and abhorred by the Protestants, which some time after proved very prejudicial to the city itself.\n\nFrom this calamity, great as it was, London soon recovered itself, and became much more magnificent than before; the streets, which were formerly crooked and narrow, being now built wide and spacious; and the industry of its inhabitants repaired the losses they had sustained. In 1679, the city was again alarmed by the discovery of a design to destroy it by fire a second time. Elizabeth Oxly, servant to one Rind in Fetter-lane, having set her master's house on fire, was apprehended on suspicion, and confessed, that she had been hired to do it by one Stubbs a Papist, for a re-ward of 5l. Stubbs being taken into custody, acknowledged that he had persuaded her to it; and that he himself had been prevailed upon by one Father Gifford his confessor, who had assured him, that by burning the houses of heretics he would do a great service to the church. He also owned that he had several conferences with Gifford and two Irishmen on the affair. The maid and Stubbs also agreed in declaring, that the Papists intended to rise in London, expecting to be powerfully supported by a French army. In consequence of this discovery, the Papists were banished from the city, and five miles round, and five Jesuits were hanged for the above-mentioned plot.\n\nThe Papists thought to revenge themselves by forging what was called the meal-tub plot, in which the Presbyterians were supposed to hatch treacherous designs against the life of the king. Sir Edmondbury Godfrey also, who had been very active in his proceedings against the Papists, was murdered by some unknown persons; and this murder, together with the discovering the falsehood of the meal-tub plot, so exasperated the Londoners, that they resolved to show their detestation of Popery, by an extraordinary exhibition on the 17th of November, Queen Elizabeth's accession to the throne, on which day they had usually burnt the pope in effigy. The procession began with a person on horseback personating Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, attended by a bellman proclaiming his execrable murder. He was followed by a person carrying a large silver cross, with priests in copes, Carmelites, and Gray-friars, followed by six Jesuits; then proceeded divers waiters, and after them some bishops with lawn sleeves, and others with copes and mitres. Six cardinals preceded the pope, enthroned in a state pageant, attended by divers boys with pots of incense, and the devil whispering in his ear. In this order they marched from Bishopsgate to Fleet-street; and there, amidst a great multitude of spectators, committed his holiness to the flames.\n\nThis procession gave great offence to the court, at which the duke of York, afterwards James II., had a great influence. The breach was farther widened by the choice of sheriffs for that year. The candidates set up by the court were rejected by a majority of almost two to one; but this did not deter their party from demanding a poll in their behalf, upon which a tumult ensued. This was represented by the Popish party in such colours to the king, that he issued out a commission that same evening for trying the rioters; which, however, was so far from intimidating the rest, that they grew more and more determined, not only to oppose the Popish party, but to exclude the duke of York from his succession to the crown.\nIn the mean time, the king prorogued the parliament, to prevent them from proceeding in their inquiry concerning the Popish plot, and the exclusion-bill. Upon this the lord-mayor, aldermen, and common-council, presented a petition to his majesty, in which they requested, that he would permit the parliament to sit in order to complete their salutary measures and councils. This petition was highly resented by the king; who, instead of granting it, dissolved the parliament, and could never afterwards be reconciled to the city. From this time it was determined to seize their charter; and fresh provocations having been given about the election of sheriffs, a quo warranto was at last produced by the attorney-general, in order to overthrow their charter, and thereby to deprive the citizens of the power to choose sheriffs.\n\nThis information set forth, That \"the mayor and commonalty and citizens of the city of London, by the space of a month then last past and more, used, and yet do claim to have and use, without any lawful warrant or legal grant, within the city of London aforesaid, and the liberties and privileges of the same city, the liberties and privileges following, viz. 1. To be of themselves a body corporate and politic, by the name of mayor and commonalty and citizens of the city of London. 2. To have theretofore civitatis, et com. London. et com. Middlesex, and to name, make, and elect, and constitute them. 3. That the mayor and aldermen of the said city should be justices of the peace, and hold seifions of the peace. All which liberties, privileges, and franchises, the said mayor and commonalty, and citizens of London, upon the king did by the space aforesaid usurp, and yet do usurp.\"\n\nThough nothing could be more unjust than this prosecution, the ministry were determined at all events to crush the Londoners; rightly judging, that it would be an easy matter to make all other corporations surrender their charters into the king's hands, and that they had no other body in the nation to fear. Accordingly they displaced such judges as would not approve of their proceedings; and, on the 12th of June 1683, Justice Jones pronounced the following sentence: \"That a city might forfeit its charter; that the malversations of the common council were acts of the whole city; and that the points set forth in the pleadings were just grounds for the forfeiting of a charter.\"\n\nNotwithstanding this sentence, however, the attorney-general, contrary to the usual custom in such cases, was directed to move that the judgement might not be recorded: being afraid of the consequences. Yet it was judged that the king might seize the liberties of the city. A common-council was immediately summoned to deliberate on this exigency. The country party moved to have the judgement entered; but they were overruled by the court party, who insisted upon an absolute submission to the king before judgement was entered; and though this was in effect a voluntary surrender of the city-liberties, and deprived themselves of the means of getting the judgement reversed, the act of submission was carried by a great majority; and in a petition from the lord mayor, aldermen, and common-council, they acknowledged their own misgovernment, and his majesty's lenity; begged his pardon, and promised constant loyalty and obedience; and humbly begged his majesty's commands and directions.\"\n\nTo this his majesty answered, that he would not reject their suit, if they would agree upon the following conditions. 1. That no lord mayor, sheriff, recorder, common be- common serjeant, town clerk, or coroner, of the city of London, or steward of the borough of Southwark, king and shall be capable of, or admitted to, the exercise of their respective offices before his majesty shall have approved of them under his sign-manual. 2. That if his majesty shall disapprove the choice of any person to be lord mayor, and signify the same under his sign-manual to the lord mayor, or in default of a lord mayor, to the recorder or senior alderman, the citizens shall, within one week, proceed to a new choice: and if his majesty shall in like manner disapprove the second choice, his majesty may, if he pleases, nominate a person to be lord mayor for the year ensuing. 3. If his majesty shall, in like manner, disapprove the persons chosen to be sheriffs, or either of them, his majesty may appoint sheriffs for the year ensuing. 4. That the lord mayor and court of aldermen may, with the leave of his majesty, displace any alderman, recorder, &c. 5. Upon the election of an alderman, if the court of aldermen shall judge and declare the person presented to be unfit, the ward shall choose again; and upon a disapproval of a second choice, the court may appoint another in his room. 6. That the justices of the peace should be by the king's commission; and the settling of those matters to be left to his majesty's attorney-general and counsel learned in the law.\"\n\nTo these the lord-keeper added, in the king's name, \"That these regulations being made, his majesty would not only pardon this prosecution, but would confirm their charter in such a manner as should be consistent with them; concluding thus: 'My lord mayor, the term draws towards an end, and Midsummer-day is at hand, when some of the officers used to be chosen; whereof his majesty will reserve the approbation. Therefore, it is his majesty's pleasure, that you return to the city, and consult the common-council, that he may speedily know your resolutions thereupon, and accordingly give his directions. That you may see the king is in earnest, and the matter is not capable of delay, I am commanded to let you know he hath given orders to his attorney-general to enter upon judgement on Saturday next; unless you prevent it by your compliance in all these particulars.'\"\n\nA common-council was summoned, when the friends of liberty treated those flattery conditions as they deserved; and even declared, that they were ready to sacrifice all that was near or dear to them, rather than submit to such arbitrary impositions: but when it was put to the vote, there appeared a majority of 18 for submission.\n\nThus the king got the government of the city into his own hands, though he and his brothers entirely lost the affections of the Londoners. But, not content with the king's submission, his majesty departed from his promise; broke his commandment upon the quo warranto to promulge, be entered; and commissioned Sir William Pritchard, the lord mayor, to hold the same office during his majesty's pleasure. In the same manner he appointed or displaced the other magistrates as he thought proper; after\nafter which the ministry, having nothing to fear, proceeded in the most arbitrary manner.\n\nIn this subjection to the will of the court, the city of London continued till the Revolution; but, in 1689, the immediate restoration of the Londoners to their franchises was ordered; and in such a manner and form, as to put it out of the powers of an arbitrary ministry and a corrupt judge and jury to deprive them of their chartered liberties for the time to come. Accordingly a bill was brought into parliament, and passed, for reverting the judgement of the quo warranto against the city of London, and for restoring the same to its ancient rights and privileges. Since that time the city of London hath enjoyed tranquillity; its commerce hath been carried to the highest pitch, and for the politeness, riches, and number of its inhabitants, as well as is extent and the magnificence of its buildings, is inferior to no city in Europe, if not superior to every one.\n\nThat part of this immense capital which is distinguished by the name of The City, stands on the north shore of the river, from the Tower to the Temple, occupying only that space formerly encompassed by the wall, which in circumference measures but three miles and 165 feet. In this wall there were seven gates by land, viz. Ludgate, Aldgate, Cripplegate, Aldergate, Moorgate, Bishopsgate, which were all taken down in September 1760; and Newgate, the county gaol, which was also taken down in 1776, and a massive building erected a little south of it, which by the rioters in 1780 received damage to the amount of £2,000. On the side of the water there were Dowgate and Billingsgate, long since demolished, as well as the postern-gate near the Tower. In the year 1670 there was a gate erected called Temple-Bar, which terminates the bounds of the city westward. The liberties, or those parts of this great city which are subject to its jurisdiction, and lie without the walls of London, are bounded on the east, in Whitechapel, the Minories, and Bishopsgate, by bars, which were formerly polls and chains, that were frequently taken away by arbitrary power, when it was thought proper to seize the franchises of the city of London: on the north, they are bounded in the same manner in Pickaxe-street, at the end of Fan-alley, and in St John's-street: on the west, by bars in Holborn: at the east end of Middle Row, and at the west end of Fleet-street, by the gate called Temple-Bar, already mentioned: on the south, we may include the jurisdiction which the city holds on the river Thames, and over the borough of Southwark.\n\nThe city, including the borough, is at present divided into 26 wards.\n\n1. Aldergate ward takes its name from a city-gate which lately stood in the neighbourhood. It is bounded on the east by Cripplegate ward; on the west, by Farringdon ward within and without; and on the south, by Farringdon ward within. It is very large, and is divided into Aldergate-within and Aldergate-without. Each of these divisions consists of four precincts, under one alderman, eight common-council men, of whom two are the alderman's deputies, eight constables, fourteen inquest-men, eight scavengers, and a beadle; exclusive of the officers belonging to the liberty of St Martin's le Grand, which contains 168 houses.\n\n2. Aldgate takes its name also from a gate, which was of great antiquity, being mentioned in King Edgar's charter to the knights of the Knighton Guild about the year 967; and was probably of a much more ancient foundation, for it was the gate through which the Roman vicinal way lay to the ferry at Oldford. In the time of the wars betwixt King John and his barons, the latter entered the city through this gate, and committed great devastations among the houses of the religious. Aldgate was rebuilt by the leaders of the party after the Roman manner. They made use of stone which they brought from Caen, and a small brick called the Flanders tile, which Mr Pennant thinks has been often mistaken for Roman. The new gate was very strong, and had a deep well within it. In 1471 this gate was assaulted by the Ballard of Falconbridge, who got possession of it for a few hours; but the portcullis being drawn up, the troops which had entered were all cut off, and the citizens, headed by the alderman of the ward and recorder, having made a sally, defeated the remainder with great slaughter. In 1600 Aldgate was taken down and rebuilt; and many Roman coins were found in digging the foundations.—The ward of Aldgate is bounded on the east by the city wall, which divides it from Portfoken ward; on the north, by Bishopsgate ward; on the west, by Lime-street and Langbourn wards; and on the south, by Tower-street ward. It is governed by an alderman, six common-council men, six constables, twenty inquest-men, seven scavengers, and a beadle; besides the officers belonging to St James's, Duke's Place.—It is divided into seven precincts.\n\n3. Baffinhow or Baffinghall ward, is bounded on the east and south, by Coleman-street ward, on the north by part of Cripplegate, and one the west by part of the wards of Cheap and Cripplegate. On the south, it begins at Blackwell-hall; and runs northward to London-wall, pulled down some time ago to make way for new buildings in Fore-street, and spreads 88 feet east, and 54 feet west against the place where that wall stood. This is a very small ward, and consists only of two precincts: the upper precinct contains no more than 66, and the lower only 76 houses. It is governed by an alderman, four common-council men, of whom one is the alderman's deputy, three constables, seventeen inquest-men, three scavengers, and a beadle. It has its name from Baffinghall, the mansion-house of the family of Baffings, which was the principal house in it, and stood in the place of Blackwell-hall.\n\n4. Billingsgate ward is bounded on the east by Tower-street ward; on the north, by Langbourn ward; on the west, by the ward of Bridge-within; and on the south, by the river Thames. There have been many conjectures concerning the origin of the name of Billingsgate, none of which seems to be very well authenticated. It is, for instance, supposed to have derived its name from a British king named Belinus, said to have been an affiant of Brennus king of the Gauls at the taking of Rome, and is the same with the Beli-Maur mentioned in the Welsh genealogies. The name of Ludgate is said to be derived from his son Lud.\nLondon. Lud.—It is divided into 12 precincts; and is governed by an alderman, 10 common-council men, one of whom is the alderman's deputy, 11 constables, 14 inquest-men, six scavengers, and a beadle. The situation of Billingsgate, on the river, gives it great advantages with respect to trade and merchandise; so that it is well inhabited, and is in a continual hurry of business at the several wharfs or quays.\n\n5. Bishopsgate ward is bounded on the east by Aldgate ward, Portfoken ward, and part of the Tower-liberty, or Norton-falgate; on the west, by Broad-street ward and Moorfields; and on the south, by Langbourn ward. It is very large, and divided into Bishopsgate-within and Bishopsgate-without. The first contains all that part of the ward within the city-wall and gate, and is divided into five precincts; the second lies without the wall, and is divided into four precincts. Bishopsgate-without extends to Shoreditch, taking its name from one Sir John de Sordich, an eminent lawyer much in favour with King Edward III., both on account of his knowledge in the law, and of his personal valour. In the time of Henry VIII., one Barlo, a citizen and inhabitant of this place, was named duke of Shoreditch, on account of his skill in archery; and, for a number of years after, the title belonged to the captain of the London archers. This ward is governed by an alderman, two deputies, one within and the other without, 12 common-council men, seven constables, 13 inquest-men, nine scavengers, and two beadles. It took its name from the gate, which has been pulled down to make that part of the city more airy and commodious. This gate was built by Erkenwald bishop of London in 675; and it is said to have been repaired by William the Conqueror soon after the Norman conquest. In the time of Henry III., the Hanse merchants had certain privileges confirmed to them, in return for which they were to support this gate; and in consequence of this they rebuilt it elegantly in 1479. There were two statues of bishops, in memory of the founder and first repairer; other two were also put up, which are supposed to have been designed for Alfred and Ælfric earl of Mercia to whose care the gate had been committed.\n\n6. Bread-street ward is encompassed on the north and north-west, by the ward of Farringdon within; on the east, by Cordwainers ward; on the south, by Queenhithe ward; and on the west, by Castle-Baynard ward. It is divided into 13 precincts; and is governed by an alderman, 12 common-council men, of whom one is the alderman's deputy, 13 constables, 13 inquest-men, 13 scavengers, and a beadle; and yet contains no more than 331 houses. It takes its name from the ancient bread-market, which was kept in the place now called Bread-street; the bakers being obliged to sell their bread only in the open market and not in shops.\n\n7. Bridge-ward within is bounded on the south by the river Thames and Southwark; on the north, by Langbourn and Bishopsgate ward; on the east, by Billingsgate; and on the west, by Candlewick and Dowgate wards. It is divided into 14 precincts, three of which were on London bridge; and is governed by an alderman, 15 common-council men, one of whom is the alderman's deputy, 14 constables, 15 inquest-men, 14 scavengers, and a beadle. It takes its name from its connexion with London bridge.\n\n8. Broad-street ward is bounded, on the north and east, by Bishopsgate ward; on the south, by Cornhill and Wallbrook ward; and on the west by Coleman-street ward. It is divided into 10 precincts; and governed by an alderman, 10 common-council men, one of whom is the alderman's deputy, 10 constables, 13 inquest-men, eight scavengers, and a beadle. It has its name from that part of it now distinguished by the name of Old Broad-street; and which, before the fire of 1666, was accounted one of the broadest streets in London.\n\n9. Candlewick ward, Candlewick-street, or Candlewright-street ward as it is called in some ancient records, is bounded on the east by Bridge ward; on the south, by Dowgate and part of Bridge ward; on the west, by Dowgate and Wallbrook; and on the north, by Langbourn ward. It is but a small ward, consisting of about 286 houses; yet is divided into seven precincts. It is governed by an alderman, eight common-council men, of whom one is the alderman's deputy, seven constables, 13 inquest-men, seven scavengers, and a beadle. It has its name from a street, formerly inhabited chiefly by candle wrights or candle-makers, both in tallow and wax: a very profitable business in the times of Popery, when incredible quantities of wax candles were consumed in the churches. That street, however, or at least its name, Candlewick, is lost since the great conflagration, for which the name Canon-street is substituted, the candle wrights being at that time burnt out and dispersed through the city.\n\n10. Castle-Baynard ward is bounded by Queenhithe and Bread-street wards on the east; on the south, by the Thames; and on the west and north, by the ward of Farringdon-within. It is divided into 10 precincts, under the government of an alderman, 10 common-council men, one of whom is the alderman's deputy, nine constables, 14 inquest-men, seven scavengers, and a beadle. It takes its name from a castle built on the bank of the river by one Baynard, a folder of fortune, who came in with William the Conqueror, and was by that monarch raised to great honours and authority.\n\n11. Cheap ward is bounded on the east by Broad-street and Wallbrook wards; on the north, by Coleman-street, Baffishaw, and Cripplegate; and on the south, by Cordwainers ward. It is divided into nine precincts; and is governed by an alderman, 12 common-council men, of whom one is the alderman's deputy, 11 constables, 13 inquest-men, nine scavengers, and a beadle. It has its name from the Saxon word chepe, which signifies a market, kept in this division of the city, now called Cheapside: but then known by the name of Welfcheap, to distinguish it from the market then also kept in Eastcheap, between Canon or Candlewick street and Tower-street.\n\n12. Coleman-street ward is bounded on the east by Bishopsgate, Broad-street, and Cheap wards; on the north, by Cripplegate ward, Middle Moorfields, and Bishopsgate; on the south, by Cheap ward; and on the west, by Baffishaw ward. It is divided into six precincts; and is governed by an alderman, six common-council\nLondon. council men, one of whom is the alderman's deputy, six constables, 13 inquest-men, six scavengers, and a beadle. The origin of the name is not certainly known.\n\n13. Cordwainers ward is bounded on the east by Wallbrook, on the south by Vintry ward, on the west by Bread-street, and on the north by Cheap ward. It is divided into eight precincts; and is governed by an alderman, eight common-council men, one of whom is the alderman's deputy, eight constables, 14 inquest-men, eight scavengers, and a beadle. Its proper name is Cordwainers-street ward; which it has from Cordwainers-street, now Bow-lane, formerly occupied chiefly by shoemakers and others that dealt or worked in leather.\n\n14. Cornhill ward is but of small extent. It is bounded on the east by Bishopsgate, on the north by Broad-street, on the west by Cheap ward, and on the south by Langbourn ward. It is divided into four precincts, which are governed by one alderman, five common-council men, of whom one is the alderman's deputy, four constables, 16 inquest-men, four scavengers, and a beadle. It takes its name from the principal street in it, known from the earliest ages by the name of Cornhill, because the corn-market was kept there.\n\n15. Cripplegate ward is bounded on the east by Moorfields, Coleman-street ward, Baffishaw ward, and Cheap ward; on the north by the parish of St Luke's, Old-street; on the west by Aldersgate ward; and on the south, by Cheap ward. It is divided into 13 precincts, nine within and four without the wall; and is governed by an alderman, 12 common-council men, of whom two are the alderman's deputies, 13 constables, 34 inquest-men, 16 scavengers, and three beadles. It takes its name from Cripplegate, which stood on the north-west part of the city wall. It was an old plain structure, void of all ornament, with one postern; but had more the appearance of a fortification than any of the other gates. It was removed in order to widen the entrance into Wood-street, which, by the narrowness of the gateway, was too much contracted and rendered dangerous for passengers and great waggons.\n\n16. Dowgate ward is bounded on the east by Candlewick and Bridge wards, on the north by Wallbrook ward, on the west by Vintry ward, and on the south by the Thames. It is divided into eight precincts, under the government of an alderman, eight common-council men, of whom one is the alderman's deputy, eight constables, 15 inquest-men, five scavengers, and a beadle. It has its name from the ancient water gate, called Dowgate, which was made in the original wall that ran along the north side of the Thames, for the security of the city against all attempts to invade it by water.\n\n17. Farringdon ward within is bounded on the east by Cheap ward and Baynard-castle ward; on the north, by Aldersgate and Cripplegate wards, and the liberty of St Martin's le Grand; on the west by Farringdon-without; and on the south, by Baynard-castle ward, and the river Thames. It is divided into 18 precincts; and governed by one alderman, 17 common-council men, of whom one is the alderman's deputy, 19 constables, 17 inquest-men, 19 scavengers, and two beadles. It takes its name from William Farringdon citizen and goldsmith of London, who, in 1279, purchased all the aldermanry with the appurtenances, within the city of London and suburbs of the same, between Ludgate and Newgate, and also without these gates.\n\n18. Farringdon ward without is bounded on the east by Farringdon within, the precinct of the late priory of St Bartholomew near Smithfield, and the ward of Aldersgate; on the north, by the Charter-house, the parish of St John's Clerkenwell, and part of St Andrew's parish without the freedom; on the west, by High Holborn and St Clement's parish in the Strand; and on the south by the river Thames. It is governed by one alderman, 16 common-council men, of whom two are the alderman's deputies, 23 constables, 48 inquest-men, 24 scavengers, and four beadles. It takes its name from the same goldsmith who gave name to Farringdon within.\n\n19. Langbourn ward is bounded on the east by Aldgate ward; on the north, by part of the same, and Lime-street ward; on the south, by Tower-street, Bishopsgate, Bridge, and Candlewick wards; and on the west by Wallbrook. It is divided into 12 precincts. It had its name from a rivulet or long bourn of fresh water, which anciently flowed from a spring near Magpie alley adjoining to St Catherine Coleman's church.\n\n20. Limefreet ward is bounded on the east and north by Aldgate ward, on the west by Bishopsgate; and on the south by Langbourn ward. It is divided into four precincts; and governed by an alderman, four common-council men, one of whom is the alderman's deputy, four constables, 13 inquest-men, four scavengers, and a beadle. It is very small; and has its name from some lime-kilns that were formerly built in or near Lime-street.\n\n21. Portfoken ward is bounded on the east by the parishes of Spitalfields, Stepney, and St George's in the east; on the south, by Tower-hill; on the north, by Bishopsgate ward, and on the west by Aldgate ward. It is divided into five precincts; and is governed by an alderman, five common-council men, one of whom is the alderman's deputy, five constables, 19 inquest-men, five scavengers, and a beadle. Its name signifies the franchise of the liberty gate. This Portfoken was for some time a guild; and had its beginning in King Edgar, when 13 knights, \"well beloved of the king and realm, for services by them done,\" requested to have a certain portion of land on the east part of the city left desolate and forfeited of the inhabitants by reason of too much fervitude. They besought the king to have this land, with the liberty of a guild for ever. The king granted their request on the following conditions, viz. that each of them should victoriously accomplish three combats, one above the ground, one underground, and the third in the water: and after this, at a certain day, in East Smithfield, they should run with spears against all comers. All this was gloriously performed; upon which the king named it Knighten Guild, and extended it from Aldgate to the places where the bars now are on the east, and to the Thames on the south, and as far into the water as a horseman could ride at low water and throw his spear.\n\n22. Queen-hithe ward is bounded on the east by Dowgate, on the north by Bread-street and Cordwainers-\nwainers wards, on the south by the Thames, and on the west by Castle-Baynard ward. It is divided into nine precincts; and is governed by one alderman, six common-council men, one of whom is the alderman's deputy, and nine constables. It has its name from the hithe, or harbour for large boats, barges, and lighters; for which, and even for ships, it was the anchoring place, and the quay for loading and unloading vessels almost of any burden used in ancient times. It has the name of queen, because the queens of England usually possessed the tolls and customs of vessels that unloaded goods at this hithe, which were very considerable.\n\n23. Tower ward, or Tower-street ward, is bounded on the south by the river Thames, on the east by Tower-hill and Aldgate ward, on the north by Langbourn ward, and on the west by Billingsgate ward. It is governed by one alderman, 12 common-council men, of whom one is the alderman's deputy, 12 constables, 13 inquest-men, 12 scavengers, and one beadle. It takes its name from Tower-street, so called because it leads out of the city in a direct line to the principal entrance of the Tower of London.\n\n24. Vintry ward is bounded on the east by Dowgate, on the south by the Thames, on the west by Queenhithe ward, and on the north by Cordwainers ward. It is a small ward, containing only 418 houses; but is divided into nine precincts, and governed by an alderman, nine common-council men, one of whom is the alderman's deputy, nine constables, 13 inquest-men, three scavengers, and a beadle. It takes its name from the vintners or wine-merchants of Bordeaux, who formerly dwelt in this part of the city, were obliged to land their wines on this spot, and to sell them in 40 days, till the 28th of Edward I.\n\n25. Wallbrook ward is bounded on the east by Langbourn, on the south by Dowgate ward, on the west by Cordwainers ward, and on the north by Cheap ward. It is small, containing only 306 houses; but is divided into seven precincts, and governed by an alderman, eight common-council men, of whom one is the alderman's deputy, seven constables, 13 inquest-men, five scavengers, and a beadle. It has its name from the rivulet Wall-brook, that ran down the street of this name into the river Thames near Dowgate; but in process of time it was so lost by covering it with bridges, and buildings upon those bridges, that its channel became a common sewer.\n\n26. The ward of Bridge-without includes the borough of Southwark, and the parishes of Rotherhithe, Newington, and Lambeth. It has its name from London bridge, with the addition of the word without, because the bridge must be passed in order to come at it. Wolf-miller is generally reckoned a part of London, though under a distinct government; and has long been famous for the palaces of our kings, the seat of our law tribunals, and of the high court of parliament; all which shall be described in their order.\n\nThe city and liberties of London are under an ecclesiastical, a civil, and a military government.\n\nAs to its ecclesiastical government, London is a bishop's see, the diocese of which comprehends not only Middlesex, Essex, and part of Hertfordshire, but the British plantations in America. The bishop of London takes precedence next to the archbishops of Canterbury and York; but the following parishes of this city are exempt from his jurisdiction, being peculiarly under the immediate government of the archbishop of Canterbury; viz. All-hallows in Bread-street, All-hallows, Lombard-street; St Dionys Back-church, St Dunstan in the East, St John Baptist, St Leonard Eastcheap, St Mary Aldermanry, St Mary Bothaw, St Mary le Bow, St Michael Crooked-lane, St Michael Royal, St Pancras Soper-lane, and St Vedast Foster-lane.\n\nThe civil government of London divides it into wards and precincts, under a lord mayor, aldermen, and common-council.\n\nThe mayor, or lord mayor, is the supreme magistrate, chosen annually by the citizens, pursuant to a charter of King John. The present manner of electing a lord mayor is by the liverymen of the several companies, assembled in Guildhall annually on Michaelmas-day, according to an act of common council in A.D. 1476, where, and when, the liverymen choose, or rather nominate, two aldermen below the chair, who have served the office of sheriff, to be returned to the court of aldermen, who may choose either of the two; but generally declare the senior of the two, so returned, to be lord mayor elect. The election being over, the lord mayor elect, accompanied by the recorder and divers aldermen, is soon after presented to the lord chancellor (as his majesty's representative in the city of London) for his approbation; and on the 9th of November following is sworn into the office of mayor at Guildhall; and on the day after, before the barons of the exchequer at Westminster; the procession on which occasion is exceedingly grand and magnificent.\n\nThe lord mayor sits every morning at the mansion-house, or place where he keeps his mayoralty, to determine any difference that may happen among the citizens, and to do other business incident to the office of a chief magistrate. Once in six weeks, or eight times in the year, he sits as chief judge of oyer and terminer, or gaol-delivery of Newgate for London and the county of Middlesex. His jurisdiction extends all over the city and suburbs, except some places that are exempt. It extends also from Colneyditch, above Staines-bridge in the west, to Yeudale, or Yenflete, and the mouth of the river Medway, and up that river to Upnor-castle, in the east: by which he exercises the power of punishing or correcting all persons that shall annoy the streams, banks, or fish. For which purpose his lordship holds several courts of conservancy in the counties adjacent to the said river, for its conservation, and for the punishment of offenders. See the article Mayor's-Court.\n\nThe title of dignity, alderman, is of Saxon original, and of the greatest honour, answering to that of earl; though now it is nowhere to be found but in chartered societies. And from hence we may account for the reason why the aldermen and commonalty of London were called barons after the conquest. These magistrates are properly the subordinate governors of their respective wards under the lord mayor's jurisdiction; and they originally held their aldermanries either by inheritance or purchase; at which time the aldermanries or wards charged their names as often as their governors or aldermen. The oppressions, to which the citizens were subject from such a government, put them\nLondon, upon means to abolish the perpetuity of that office and they brought it to an actual election. But that manner of election being attended with many inconveniences, and becoming a continual bone of contention among the citizens, the parliament, 17 Richard II. A.D. 1594, enacted, that the aldermen of London should continue in their several offices during life or good behaviour. And so it still continues; though the manner of electing has several times varied. At present it is regulated by an act of parliament, passed in the year 1724-5; and the person so elected is to be returned by the lord mayor (or other returning officer in his stead, duly qualified to hold a court of wardmote) to the court of lord mayor and aldermen, by whom the person so returned must be admitted and sworn into the office of alderman before he can act. If the person chosen refuses to serve the office of alderman, he is liable to fine.\n\nTheir high officers constitute a second part of the city legislature when assembled in a corporate capacity, and exercise an executive power in their respective wards. The aldermen who have filled the chair, or served the high office of lord mayor, are justices of the quorum; and all the other aldermen are not only justices of the peace, but by the statute of 43 Eliz. entitled, \"An act for the relief of the poor,\" every alderman of the city of London, within his ward, shall and may do and execute, in every respect, so much as is appointed and allowed by the said act to be done or executed by one or two justices of peace of any county within this realm.\" They every one keep their wardmote, or court, for choosing ward officers and settling the affairs of the ward, to redress grievances, and to prevent all defaults found within their respective wards.\n\nThe next branch of the legislative power in this city is the common-council. The many inconveniences that attended popular assemblies, which were called folkmote, determined the commonality of London to choose representatives to act in their name and for their interest, with the lord mayor and aldermen, in all affairs relating to the city. At first these representatives were chosen out of the several companies: but that not being found satisfactory, nor properly the representatives of the whole body of the inhabitants, it was agreed to choose a certain number of discreet men out of each ward: which number has from time to time increased according to the dimensions of each ward: and at present the 25 wards, into which London is divided, being subdivided into 236 precincts, each precinct sends a representative to the common-council, who are elected after the same manner as an alderman, only with this difference, that as the lord mayor presides in the wardmote, and is judge of the poll at the election of an alderman, so the alderman of each ward is judge of the poll at the election of a common-council man.\n\nThus the lord mayor, aldermen, and common-council, when assembled, may be deemed the city parliament, resembling the great council of the nation. For it consists of two houses; one for the lord mayor and aldermen, or the upper house; another for the commoners or representatives of the people, commonly called the common-council men. And they have power in their incorporate capacity to make and repeal by-laws; and the citizens are bound to obey or submit to those laws. When they meet in their incorporate capacity, they wear deep blue silk gowns: and such assemblies are called the court of common-council, and their ordinances acts of common-council. No act can be performed in the name of the city of London without their concurrence. But they cannot assemble without summons from the lord mayor; who, nevertheless, is obliged to call a common-council, whenever it shall be demanded, upon extraordinary occasions, by six reputable citizens and members of that court.\n\nThis corporation is assisted by two sheriffs and a recorder. The sheriffs are chartered officers, to perform certain suits and services, in the king's name, within the city of London and county of Middlesex, chosen by the liverymen of the several companies on Midsummer day. Their office, according to Camden, in general, is to collect the public revenues within their several jurisdictions; to gather into the exchequer all fines belonging to the crown; to serve the king's writs of preceps; to attend the judges, and execute their orders; to impanel juries; to compel headstrong and obstinate men by the poire comitatus to submit to the decisions of the law; and to take care that all condemned criminals be duly punished and executed. In particular, in London, they are to execute the orders of the common-council, when they have resolved to address his majesty, or to petition parliament.\n\nThe sheriffs, by virtue of their office, hold a court at Guildhall every Wednesday and Friday, for actions entered at Wood-street Compter; and on Thursdays, and Saturdays for those entered at the Poultry Compter; of which the sheriffs being judges, each has his assistant, or deputy, who are called the judges of those courts; before whom are tried actions of debt, trespass, covenant, &c. and where the testimony of any absent witness in writing is allowed to be good evidence. To each of these courts belong four attorneys, who, upon their being admitted by the court of aldermen, have an oath administered to them.\n\nTo each of these courts likewise belong a secondary, a clerk of the papers, a prothonotary, and four clerk-fitters. The secondary's office is to allow and return all writs brought to remove clerks out of the said courts, the clerk of the papers files and copies all declarations upon actions; the prothonotary draws and engrosses all declarations; the clerk-fitters enter actions and attachments, and take bail and verdicts. To each of the compters, or prisons belonging to these courts, appertain 16 sergeants at mace, with a yeoman to each, besides inferior officers, and the prison-keeper.\n\nIn the sheriffs' court may be tried actions of debt, case, trespass, account, covenant, and all personal actions, attachments, and sequestrations. When an erroneous judgement is given in either of the sheriffs' courts of the city, the writ of error to reverse this judgement must be brought in the court of huldings before the lord mayor; for that is the superior court. The sheriffs of London may make arrests and serve executions on the river Thames.\n\nWe do not read of a recorder till the 1304, who, by the nature of his office, seems to have been intended as an assistant to, or successor with, the lord mayor, in the execution of his high office, in matters of justice and law. He is chosen by the lord mayor and aldermen.\nLondon men only; and takes place in all courts, and in the common-council, before any one that hath not been mayor. Of whom we have the following description in one of the books of the chamber: \"He shall be, as is wont to be, one of the most skilful and virtuous apprentices of the law of the whole kingdom; whose office is always to sit on the right hand of the mayor, in recording pleas, and passing judgements; and by whom records and processses, had before the lord mayor and alderman at Great St Martin's, ought to be recorded by word of mouth before the judges assigned there to correct errors. The mayor and aldermen have therefore used commonly to set forth all other businesses, touching the city, before the king and his council, as also in certain of the king's courts, by Mr Recorder, as a chief man, endued with wisdom, and eminent for eloquence.\"—Mr Recorder is looked upon to be the mouth of the city, to deliver all addresses to the king, &c., from the corporation; and he is the first officer in order of precedence that is paid a salary, which originally was no more than £10 sterling per annum, with some few perquisites; but it has from time to time been augmented to £100 per annum, and become the road to preferment in the law. This office has sometimes been executed by a deputy.\n\nThe next chartered officer of this corporation is the chamberlain; an officer of great repute and trust, and is in the choice of the livery annually. This officer, though chosen annually on Midsummer-day, is never displaced during his life, except some very great crime can be made out against him. He has the keeping of the moneys, lands, and goods, of the city orphans, or takes good security for the payment thereof when the parties come to age. And to that end he is deemed in the law a sole corporation, to him and his successors, for orphans; and therefore a bond or a recognition made to him and his successors, is recoverable by his successors. This officer hath a court peculiarly belonging to him. His office may be termed a public treasury, collecting the customs, moneys, and yearly revenues, and all other payments belonging to the corporation of the city. It was customary for government to appoint the chamberlain receiver of the land tax; but this has been discontinued for several years past.\n\nThe other officers under the lord mayor are, 1. The common serjeant. He is to attend the lord mayor and court of aldermen on court days, and to be in council with them on all occasions, within or without the precincts or liberties of the city. He is to take care of orphans estates, either by taking account of them, or to sign their indentures, before their passing the lord mayor and court of aldermen. And likewise he is to let, set, and manage the orphans estates, according to his judgement, to the best advantage. 2. The town clerk; who keeps the original charter of the city, the books, rolls, and other records, wherein are registered the acts and proceedings of the city; so that he may not be improperly termed the city-register: he is to attend the lord mayor and aldermen at their courts, and signs all public instruments. 3. The city remembrancer; who is to attend the lord mayor on certain days, his husband being to put his lordship in mind of the select days he is to go abroad with the aldermen, &c. He is to attend daily at the parliament house, during the sessions, and to report to the lord mayor their transactions. 4. The sword-bearer; who is to attend the lord mayor at his going abroad, and to carry the sword before him, being the emblem of justice. This is an ancient and honourable office, representing the state and princely office of the king's most excellent majesty, in his representative the lord mayor; and, according to the rule of armory, \"He must carry the sword upright, the hilt being holden under his bulk, and the blade directly up the midst of his breast, and so forth between the sword-bearer's brows.\" 5. The common hunt; whose business it is to take care of the pack of hounds belonging to the lord mayor and citizens, and to attend them in hunting in those grounds to which they are authorized by charter. 6. The common crier. It belongs to him and the serjeant at arms, to summon all executors and administrators of freemen to appear, and to bring in inventories of the personal estates of freemen, within two months after their decease: and he is to have notice of the appraisements. He is also to attend the lord mayor on set days, and at the courts held weekly by the mayor and aldermen. 7. The water bailiff; whose office is to look after the preservation of the river Thames against all encroachments; and to look after the fishermen for the preservation of the young fry, to prevent the destroying them by unlawful nets. For that end, there are juries for each county, that hath any part of it lying on the sides or shores of the said river; which juries, summoned by the water bailiff at certain times, do make inquiry of all offences relating to the river and the fish, and make their pretenments accordingly. He is also bound to attend the lord mayor on set days in the week.—These seven purchase their places; except the town clerk, who is chosen by the livery.\n\nThere are also three serjeant carvers; three serjeants of the chamber; a serjeant of the channel; four yeomen of the water side; an under water bailiff; two yeomen of the chamber; two meal weighters; two yeomen of the wood wharfs; a foreigner; a city marshal. There are besides these, seven gentlemen's men; as the sword-bearer's man, the common hunt's two men, the common crier's man, and the carver's three men.\n\nNine of the foregoing officers have liveries of the lord mayor, viz. the sword-bearer and his man, the three carvers, and the four yeomen of the water side. All the rest have liveries from the chamber of London.\n\nThe following officers are likewise belonging to the city; farmer of the markets, auditor, clerk of the chamber, clerk to the commissioners of the sewers, clerk of the court of conscience, beadle of the same court, clerk of the city works, printer to the city, justice of the Bridge yard, clerk comptroller of the Bridge house, steward of the Borough, bailiff of the Borough.\n\nThere is also a coroner, called so from corona, i.e. a crown, because he deals principally with the crown, or in matters appertaining to the imperial crown of England. See the article CORONER.\n\nBesides these officers, there are several courts in this city for the executing of justice, viz. the court of hustings, lord mayor's court, &c. In the city there are also\nLondon also two subordinate kinds of government. One executed by the alderman, deputy, and common-councilmen, and their inferior officers, in each ward; under which form are comprehended all the inhabitants, free or not free of the city. Every ward is therefore like a little free state, and at the same time subject to the lord mayor as chief magistrate of the city. The housekeepers of each ward elect their representatives, the common council, who join in making bye-laws for the government of the city. The officers and servants of each ward manage the affairs belonging to it, without the assistance of the rest; and each has a court called the wardmote, as has been already described, for the management of its own affairs. The other, by the matter, wardens, and court of assistants, of the incorporate companies; whose power reaches no farther than over the members of their respective guilds or fraternities; except that in them is vested the power to choose representatives in parliament for the city, and all those magistrates and officers elected by a common hall; which companies are invested with distinct powers, according to the tenor of their respective charters.\n\nThe military government of the city is lodged in a lieutenantcy, consisting of the lord mayor, aldermen, and other principal citizens, who receive their authority by commission from the king. Those have under their command the city trained bands, consisting of five regiments of foot, distinguished by the names of the white, orange, yellow, blue, green, and red, each containing eight companies of 150 men, amounting in all to 7200. Besides these five regiments, there is a corps called the artillery company, from its being taught the military exercise in the artillery ground. This company is independent of the rest, and consists of 700 or 800 volunteers. All these, with two regiments of foot of 800 men each commanded by the lieutenant of the Tower of London, make the whole militia of this city; which, exclusive of Westminster and the borough of Southwark, amounts to about 10,000 men.\n\nThe trading part of the city of London is divided into 89 companies; though some of them can hardly be called so, because they have neither charters, halls, nor liveries. Of these 89 companies, 55 have each a hall for transacting the business of the corporation; and this consists of a master or prime warden, a court of assistants, and livery.—Twelve of these companies are superior to the rest both in antiquity and wealth; and of one of these 12 the lord mayors have generally made themselves free at their election. These companies are the mercers, grocers, drapers, fishmongers, goldsmiths, skinners, merchant-tailors, haberdashers, falters, ironmongers, vintners, and clothworkers.—The principal incorporated societies of the merchants of this city are, the Hamburgh Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, the Ruffia Company, the Turkey Company, the East India Company, the Royal African Company, the South Sea Company, and some Insurance Companies. The most of these companies have lately houses for transacting their business, particularly the East India and South Sea companies. See COMPANY.\n\nThe streets and public buildings in London and its Remarkable liberties being far too numerous for a particular description in this work, we shall only select the most remarkable, beginning with London Bridge as the most in the ancient, and proceeding in our survey through the City.\n\nI. Remarkable buildings, &c., in the City.—The original bridge, which stands in Bridge ward, was of wood, and appears to have been first built between the years 993 and 1016; but being burnt down about the year 1136, it was rebuilt of wood in 1163. The expenses, however, of maintaining and repairing it became so burdensome to the inhabitants of the city, that they resolved to build a stone bridge a little westward of the wooden one. This building was begun in 1176, and finished in 1209; and was 915 feet long, 44 feet high, and 73 feet wide; but houses being built on each side, the space between was only 23 feet.\n\nThis great work was founded on enormous piles driven as closely as possible together; on their tops were laid long planks 10 inches thick, strongly bolted; and on them was placed the base of the piers, the lowermost stones of which were bedded in pitch, to prevent the water from damaging the work: round all were the piles which were called the flerlings, designed for the preservation of the foundation piles. These contracted the space between the piers so greatly, as to occasion at the retreat of every tide a fall of five feet, or a number of temporary cataracts, which since the foundation of the bridge have occasioned the loss of many thousand lives. The number of arches was 19, of unequal dimensions, and greatly deformed by the flerlings and the houses on each side, which overhung and leaned in a most terrific manner. In most places they hid the arches, and nothing appeared but the rude piers. Within recollection, frequent arches of strong timber crossed the street from the tops of the houses to keep them together, and from falling into the river (A). Nothing but use could preserve the quiet of the inmates, who soon grew deaf to the noise of the falling waters, the clamours of watermen, or the frequent shrieks of drowning wretches. In one part had been a drawbridge, useful either by way\n\n(A) The gallant action of Edmund Osborne, ancestor to the duke of Leeds, when he was apprentice to Sir William Hewet cloth-worker, may not improperly be mentioned in this place. About the year 1536, when his master lived in one of those tremendous houses, a servant maid was playing with his only daughter in her arms in a window over the water, and accidentally dropped the child. Young Osborne, who was witness to the misfortune, instantly sprang into the river, and beyond all expectation, brought her safe to the terrified family! Several persons of rank paid their addresses to her when she was marriageable, among others the earl of Shrewsbury; but Sir William gratefully decided in favour of Osborne: Osborne, says he, saved her, and Osborne shall enjoy her. In her right he possessed a great fortune. He became sheriff of London in 1575, and lord mayor in 1582.\nLondon. of defence or for the admission of ships into the upper part of the river. This was protected by a strong tower. It served to repulse Falconbridge the Baiford in his general assault on the city in 1471, with a fet of banditti, under pretence of relieving the unfortunate Henry, then confined in the Tower. Sixty houses were burnt on the bridge on the occasion. It also served to check, and in the end annihilate, the ill-conducted insurrection of Sir Thomas Wyat, in the reign of Queen Mary. The top of this tower, in the sad and turbulent days of this kingdom, used to be the thambles of human flesh, and covered with heads or quarters of unfortunate partizans. Even so late as the year 1598, Hentzner, the German traveller, with German accuracy, counted on it above 30 heads. The old map of the city in 1597 represents them in a most horrible clutter.—An unparalleled calamity happened on this bridge within four years after it was finished. A fire began on it at the Southwark end; multitudes of people rushed out of London to extinguish it; while they were engaged in this charitable design, the fire seized on the opposite end, and hemmed in the crowd. Above 3000 persons perished in the flames, or were drowned by overloading the vessels which were hardly enough to attempt their relief.\n\nThe narrowness of the passage on this bridge having occasioned the loss of many lives from the number of carriages continually passing; and the straitness of the arches, with the enormous size of the sterlings, which occupied one-fourth part of the water-way, having also occasioned frequent and fatal accidents, as already mentioned; the magistrates of London in 1756 obtained an act of parliament for improving and widening the passage over and through the bridge, which granted them a toll for every carriage and horse passing over it, and for every vessel with goods passing through it: but these tolls proving insufficient, were abolished by an act made in 1758 for explaining, amending, and rendering the former act more effectual; and for granting the city of London money towards carrying on that work. In consequence of these acts of parliament, a temporary wooden bridge was built, and the houses on the old bridge were taken down. Instead of a narrow street 23 feet wide, there is now a passage of 31 feet for carriages, with a raised pavement of stone on each side 7 feet broad for the use of foot passengers. The sides are secured by stone balustrades, enlightened in the night with lamps. The passage through the bridge is enlarged by throwing the two middle arches into one, and by other alterations and improvements; notwithstanding which, however, it is still greatly subject to its former inconveniences.—Under the first, second, and fourth arches, from the north side of the bridge, and now likewise towards the southern extremities, there are engines worked by the flux and reflux of the river, the water of which they raise to such a height as to supply many parts of the city. These engines were contrived in 1582 by one Peter Morice a Dutchman, and are called London-bridge water-works. By the report of a committee appointed to consider of the requisite improvements in and about London, it was proposed to remove the present London bridge, and to replace it by one of cast iron 65 feet high in the clear above high water. Part of the plan which came under the consideration of the committee in 1801, was a design of Messrs. Telford and Douglas, in which it is proposed to construct the bridge of a single arch, composed wholly of cast iron; the span of the arch is to be 600 feet, being the width to which, by Mr. Jeffery's report, the river ought to be contracted. The boldness and simplicity of this design render it an object of great attention, not only to the committee engaged in considering the further improvement of the port of London, but to the public. No progress, we believe, has yet been made in the execution of this plan.\n\nNear the north side of London bridge stands the The Mo- Monument, a beautiful and magnificent fluted column of the Doric order, built with Portland stone, and erected in memory of the conflagration 1666. It was begun by Sir Christopher Wren in 1671, and finished by him in 1677. Its height from the pavement is 20 feet; the diameter of the shaft, or body of the column, is 15 feet; the ground-plinth, or lowest part of the pedestal, is 28 feet square; and the pedestal is 40 feet high. Over the capital is an iron balcony encompassing a cone 32 feet high, which supports a blazing urn of gilt brass. Within is a large staircase of black marble, containing 345 steps, each 10 inches and a half broad, and six inches thick. The west side is adorned with a curious emblem in alt-relief, denoting the destruction and restoration of the city. The first female figure represents London fitting in ruins, in a languishing posture, with her head dejected, her hair dishevelled, and her hand carelessly lying on her sword. Behind is Time, gradually raising her up: at her side is a woman touching her with one hand, whilst a winged sceptre in the other directs her to regard the goddefs in the clouds; one with a cornucopia, denoting Plenty; the other with a palm branch, the emblem of Peace. At her feet is a bee hive, showing, that by industry and application the greatest misfortunes are to be overcome. Behind the figure of Time are citizens exulting at his endeavours to restore her; and beneath, in the midst of the ruins, is a dragon, who, as the supporter of the city arms, with his paw endeavours to preserve the same. Opposite to the city, on an elevated pavement, stands the king, in a Roman habit, with a laurel on his head, and a truncheon in his hand; and approaching her, commands three of his attendants to descend to her relief. The first represents the Sciences with a winged head and circle of naked boys dancing thereon; and holding Nature in her hand, with her numerous breasts, ready to give assistance to all. The second is Architecture, with a plan in one hand, and square and a pair of compasses in the other; and the third is Liberty, waving a hat in the air, showing her joy at the pleasing prospect of the city's speedy recovery. Behind the king stands his brother the duke of York, with a garland in one hand to crown the rising city, and a sword in the other for her defence. The two figures behind are Justice and Fortitude; the former with a coronet, and the latter with a reined lion; and under the royal pavement lies Envy, gnawing a heart, and incessantly emitting pestiferous fumes from her mouth. On the plinth the reconstruction of the city is represented by builders and labourers at work upon houses. On the north, south, and east sides, are inscriptions relating to the destruction occasioned by the conflagration, the regulations about rebuilding the city, and erecting the monument; and\nLondon, and round it is the following one:—\"This pillar was let up in perpetual remembrance of the most dreadful burning of this Protestant city, begun and carried on by the treachery and malice of the Popish faction, in the beginning of September, in the year of our Lord 1666, in order to their carrying on their horrid plot for extirpating the Protestant religion and old English liberty, and introducing Popery and slavery.\" Dr Wendeorn, in his account of London, observes, that the monument, though not much above 100 years old, bears visible marks of decay already; and it will not probably be long before it must be pulled down. Some are of opinion that this is occasioned by the fault of the architect, others by the continual shaking of the ground by coaches; but the doctor inclines to the latter opinion.\n\nEastward of the bridge and monument stands the Tower, which gives name to another ward. It is the chief fortress of the city, and supposed to have been originally built by William the Conqueror. It appears, however, to have been raised upon the remains of a more ancient fortress, erected probably by the Romans: for in 1722, in digging on the south side of what is called Caesar's Chapel, there were discovered some old foundations of stone, three yards broad, and so strongly cemented that it was with the utmost difficulty they were forced up. The first work (according to Mr Pennant) seems to have been suddenly flung up in 1066 by the Conqueror, on his taking possession of the capital; and included in it a part of the ancient wall.\n\nThe great square tower, called the White Tower, was erected in the year 1078, when it arose under the directions of Gundulph bishop of Rochester, who was a great military architect. This building originally stood by itself. Fitz-Stephen gives it the name of Arx Palatina, \"the Palatine Tower;\" the commander of which had the title of Palatine bestowed on him. Within this tower is a very ancient chapel for the use of such of our kings and queens who wished to pay their devotion here. In 1092 a violent tempest did great injury to the Tower; but it was repaired by William Rufus and his successor. The first added another castellated building on the south side between it and the Thames, which was afterwards called St Thomas's Tower.\n\nThe Tower was first enclosed by William Longchamp bishop of Ely and chancellor of England, in the reign of Richard I. This haughty prelate having a quarrel with John, third brother to Richard, under pretence of guarding against his designs, surrounded the whole with walls embattled, and made on the outside a vast ditch, into which, in after times, the water from the Thames was introduced. Different princes added other works. The present contents within the walls are 12 acres and 5 rods, the circuit on the outside of the ditch 1052 feet. It was again enclosed with a mud wall, by Henry III.: this was placed at a distance from the ditch, and occasioned the taking down part of the city-wall, which was restored by the citizens; who, pulling down this precinct of mud, were punished by the king with a fine of a thousand marks.\n\nThe Lions Tower was built by Edward IV. It was originally called the Bulwark, but received the former name from its use. A menagerie had very long been a piece of regal state: Henry I. had his at his manor of Woodstock, where he kept lions, leopards, lynxes, porcupines, and several other uncommon beasts. They were afterwards removed to the Tower. Edward II. commanded the sheriffs of London to pay the keepers of the king's leopards sixpence a-day for the sustenance of the leopards, and three halfpence a-day for the diet of the keeper out of the fee-farm of the city. The royal menagerie is to this day exceedingly well supplied.\n\nIn 1758 the Tower ditch was railed all round. New barracks were some years ago erected on the Tower wharf, which parts it from the river; and upon the wharf is a line of 61 pieces of cannon, which are fired upon state holidays. On this side of the Tower the ditch is narrow, and over it is a drawbridge. Parallel to the wharf, within the walls, is a platform 70 yards in length, called the Ladies Line, because much frequented by the ladies in the summer; it being shaded in the inside with a row of lofty trees, and without is a delightful prospect of the shipping with boats passing and repassing on the river Thames. You ascend this line by stone steps, and being once upon it you may walk almost round the walls of the Tower without interruption.\n\nThe principal entrance into the Tower is by a gate to the west, large enough to admit coaches and heavy carriages; but these are first admitted through an outward gate, situated without the ditch upon the hill, and must pass a stout stone bridge built over the ditch before they can approach the main entrance. There is, besides, an entrance near the very south-west corner of the Tower outward wall, for persons on foot, over the drawbridge already mentioned to the wharf. There is also a water-gate, commonly called Traitor's gate, through which it has been customary to convey traitors and other state prisoners to or from the Tower, and which is seldom opened on any other occasion; but the lords committed to the Tower in 1746 were publicly admitted at the main entrance. Over this gate is a regular building, terminated at each end by two round towers, on which are embrasures for pointing cannon. In this building there are the infirmary, the mill, and the water-works that supply the Tower with water.\n\nIn the Tower, the curiosities of which are more particularly described in the note (b), are a church, the offices of ordnance and of the mint, those of the keepers.\n\n(b) In examining the curiosities of the Tower of London, it will be proper to begin with those on the outside of the principal gate. The first thing a stranger usually goes to visit is the wild beasts; which, from their situation, first present themselves: for having entered the outer gate, and passed what is called the guard, the keeper's house presents itself before you, which is known by a painted lion on the wall, and another...\nkeepers of the records, of the jewel office, of the Spanish armory, the horse armory, and the new or small armory; with barracks for the soldiers of the garrison, and handsome houses for several officers who reside here.\n\nThe principal officers of the Tower are, a constable, a lieutenant, and a deputy-lieutenant. Belonging to this fortres are 11 hamlets; the militia of which, consisting of 400 men, are obliged, at the command of the constable of the Tower, to repair hither, and reinforce the garrison.\n\nOn Little Tower-hill is the Victualling Office for the navy. It is separated from Towerhill by a wall and gate, and contains houses for the officers, slaughterhouses, storerooms, a brewhouse, a salting-house, and barrelling-house; under the direction of seven commissioners and other inferior officers.\n\nIn\n\nover the door which leads to their dens. By ringing a bell, and paying sixpence each person, you may easily gain admittance.\n\nThe next place worthy of observation is the Mint, which comprehends near one-third of the Tower, and contains houses for all the officers belonging to the coinage. On passing the principal gate you see the White Tower, built by William the Conqueror. This is a large, square, irregular stone building, situated almost in the centre, no one side answering to another, nor any of its watch-towers, of which there are four at the top, built alike. One of these towers is now converted into an observatory. In the first story are two noble rooms, one of which is a small armory for the sea-service, it having various sorts of arms, very curiously laid up, for above 10,000 seamen. In the other room are many closets and presses, all filled with warlike engines and instruments of death. Over this are two other floors, one principally filled with arms; the other with arms and other warlike instruments, as spades, shovels, pickaxes, and chevaux de frise. In the upper story are kept match, sheepskins, tanned hides, &c., and in a little room called Julius Caesar's chapel, are deposited some records, containing perhaps the ancient usages and customs of the place. In this building are also preserved the models of the new-invented engines of destruction that have from time to time been presented to the government. Near the south-west angle of the White Tower is the Spanish armory, in which are deposited the spoils of what was vainly called the Invincible Armada; in order to perpetuate to latest posterity the memory of that signal victory obtained by the English over the whole naval power of Spain in the reign of Philip II.\n\nYou are now come to the grand storehouse, a noble building to the northward of the White Tower, that extends 245 feet in length and 60 in breadth. It was begun by King James II, who built it to the first floor; but it was finished by King William III, who erected that magnificent room called the New or Small Armoury, in which that prince, with Queen Mary his consort, dined in great form, having all the warrant workmen and labourers to attend them, dressed in white gloves and aprons, the usual badges of the order of masonry. To this noble room you are led by a folding door, adjoining to the east end of the Tower chapel, which leads to a grand staircase of 50 easy steps. On the left side of the uppermost landing-place is the work-shop, in which are constantly employed about 14 furbishers, in cleaning, repairing, and new-placing the arms. On entering the armory, you see what they call a wilderness of arms, so artfully disposed, that at one view you behold arms for near 80,000 men, all bright and fit for service; a sight which it is impossible to behold without astonishment; and beside those exposed to view, there were, before the late war, 16 chests shut up, each chest holding about 1000 muskets. The arms were originally disposed by Mr Harris, who contrived to place them in this beautiful order, both here and in the guard-chamber of Hampton-court. He was a common gunsmith; but after he had performed this work, which is the admiration of people of all nations, he was allowed a pension from the crown for his ingenuity.\n\nUpon the ground floor, under the small armory, is a large room of equal dimensions with that, supported by 20 pillars, all hung round with implements of war. This room, which is 24 feet high, has a passage in the middle 16 feet wide. At the sight of such a variety of the most dreadful engines of destruction, before whose thunder the most superb edifices, the noblest works of art, and numbers of the human species, fall together in one common and undistinguished ruin; one cannot help wishing that those horrible inventions had still lain, like a false conception, in the womb of nature, never to have been ripened into birth.\n\nThe horse armory is a plain brick building, a little to the eastward of the White Tower; and is an edifice rather convenient than elegant, where the spectator is entertained with a representation of those kings and heroes of our own nation, with whose gallant actions it is to be supposed he is well acquainted; some of them equipped and sitting on horseback, in the same bright and shining armour they were used to wear when they performed those glorious actions which gave them a distinguished place in the British annals.\n\nYou now come to the line of kings, which your conductor begins by reverting the order of chronology; so that in following them we must place the last first.\n\nIn a dark, strong stone room, about 20 yards to the eastward of the grand storehouse, or new armory, the crown jewels are deposited. 1. The imperial crown, with which it is pretended that all the kings of England have been crowned since Edward the Confessor in 1040. It is of gold, enriched with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and pearls; the cap within is of purple velvet, lined with white taffety, turned up with three rows of ermine. They are, however, mistaken in showing this as the ancient imperial diadem of St Edward; for that, with the other most ancient regalia of this kingdom, was kept in the arched room in the cloisters in Westminster Abbey till the civil war; when, in 1642, Harry Martin, by order of the parliament, broke open the iron chest in which it was secured, took it thence, and sold it, together with the robes,\nIn Tower ward is also the Customhouse, a large, handsome, and commodious building of brick and stone. It stands upon the bank of the Thames, and is accommodated with large wharfs, keys, and warehouses. On this spot is the busy concourse of all nations, who pay their tribute towards the support of Great Britain. About the year 1559, the loss to the revenue, by collecting it in different parts of the city, was first discovered, and an act passed to compel people to land their goods in such places as were appointed by the commissioners of the revenue; and thus was the spot fixed on: A customhouse was erected; which, being destroyed by the great fire, was rebuilt by Charles II. In 1718 it underwent the same fate, and was restored in its present form. Before the customhouse was established here, the principal place for receiving the duties was at Billingsgate. In 1268 the half year's customs for foreign merchandise in the city of London came\n\nrobes, sword, and sceptre, of St Edward. However, after the Restoration, King Charles II. had one made in imitation of it, which is that now shown. 2. The golden orb, or globe, put into the king's right hand before he is crowned: and borne in his left hand, with the sceptre in his right, upon his return into Westminster-hall after he is crowned. It is about six inches in diameter, edged with pearl, and enriched with precious stones. On the top is an amethyst, of a violet colour, near an inch and a half in height, set with a rich cross of gold, adorned with diamonds, pearls, and precious stones. The whole height of the ball and cup is 11 inches. 3. The golden sceptre, with its cross set upon a large amethyst of great value, garnished round with table diamonds. The handle of the sceptre is plain, but the pommel is set round with rubies, emeralds, and small diamonds. The top rises into a fleur de lis of six leaves, all enriched with precious stones, from whence issues a mound or ball, made of the amethyst already mentioned. The cross is quite covered with precious stones. 4. The sceptre, with the dove, the emblem of peace, perched on the top of a small Jerusalem cross, finely ornamented with table diamonds and jewels of great value. This emblem was first used by Edward the Confessor, as appears by his seal; but the ancient sceptre and dove was sold with the rest of the regalia, and this now in the Tower was made after the Restoration. 5. St Edward's staff, four feet seven inches and a half in length, and three inches three quarters in circumference, all of beaten gold, which is carried before the king at his coronation. 6. The rich crown of state, worn by his majesty in parliament; in which is a large emerald seven inches round; a pearl esteemed the finest in the world; and a ruby of inestimable value. 7. The crown belonging to his royal highness the prince of Wales. The king wears his crown on his head when he sits upon the throne; but that of the prince of Wales is placed before him, to show that he is not yet come to it. 8. The late Queen Mary's crown, globe, and sceptre, with the diadem she wore at her coronation with her consort King William III. 9. An ivory sceptre, with a dove on the top, made for King James II.'s queen, whose garniture is gold, and the dove on the top gold enamelled with white. 10. The curta, or sword of mercy, which has a blade of 32 inches long, and near two broad, is without a point, and is borne naked before the king at his coronation, between the two swords of justice, spiritual and temporal. 11. The golden spurs, and the armillars, which are bracelets for the wrists. These, though very antique, are worn at the coronation. 12. The ampulla, or eagle of gold, finely engraved, which holds the holy oil the kings and queens of England are anointed with; and the golden spoon that the bishop pours the oil into. These are two pieces of great antiquity. The golden eagle, including the pedestal, is about nine inches high, and the wings expand about seven inches. The whole weighs about ten ounces. The head of the eagle screws off about the middle of the neck, which is made hollow for holding the holy oil; and when the king is anointed by the bishop, the oil is poured into the spoon out of the bird's bill. 13. A rich falstaffer of plate, in form like the square White Tower, and so exquisitely wrought, that the workmanship of modern times is in no degree equal to it. It is of gold, and used only on the king's table at the coronation. 14. A noble silver font, double gilt, and elegantly wrought, in which the royal family are christened. 15. A large silver fountain presented to King Charles II. by the town of Plymouth, very curiously wrought; but much inferior in beauty to the above. Besides these, which are commonly shown, there are in the jewel office all the crown jewels worn by the princes and princesses at coronations, and a great variety of curious old plate.\n\nThe record office consists of three rooms, one above another, and a large round room, where the rolls are kept. These are all handsomely wainscotted, the wainscot being framed into prefices round each room, within which are shelves and repositories for the records; and for the easier finding of them, the year of each reign is inscribed on the inside of these prefices, and the records placed accordingly. Within these prefices, which amount to 56 in number, are deposited all the rolls, from the first year of the reign of King John to the beginning of the reign of Richard III., but those after this last period are kept in the Rolls Chapel. The records in the Tower, among other things, contain the foundation of abbeys and other religious houses; the ancient tenures of all the lands in England, with a survey of the manors; the original of laws and statutes; proceedings of the courts of common law and equity; the rights of England to the dominion of the British seas; leagues and treaties with foreign princes; the achievements of England in foreign wars; the settlement of Ireland, as to law and dominion; the forms of submission of some Scottish kings for territories held in England; ancient grants of our kings to their subjects; privileges and immunities granted to cities and corporations during the period above mentioned; enrolments of charters and deeds made before the conquest; the bounds of all the forests in England, with the several respective rights of the inhabitants to common pasture, and many other important records, all regularly disposed, and referred to in near a thousand folio indexes. This office is kept open, and attendance constantly given, from seven o'clock till one, except in the months of December, January, and February, when it is open only from eight to one, Sundays and holidays excepted. A search here is half a guinea, for which you may peruse any one subject a year.\nLondon came only to £751. 6s. 10½d.; the annual produce of the customs, ending in April 1789, amounted to £3,711,126l.\n\nIn Water-lane, a little to the north-west of the customhouse, is the Trinity House; a society founded in 1515, at a period in which the British navy began to assume a system. The founder was Sir Thomas Spert, comptroller of the navy, and commander of the great ship Henry Grace de Dieu. It is a corporation, consisting of a master, four wardens, eight assistants, and eighteen elder brethren; selected from commanders in the navy and the merchants service; and now and then a compliment is paid to one or two of our first nobility. They may be considered as guardians of our ships, military and commercial. Their powers are very extensive: they examine the mathematical children of Christ's hospital, and the masters of his majesty's ships; they appoint pilots for the river Thames; settle the general rates of pilotage; erect light houses and sea marks; grant licenses to poor seamen, not free of the city, to row on the Thames; prevent foreigners from serving on board our ships without license; punish seamen for mutiny and defection; hear and determine complaints of officers and men in the merchants service, but liable to appeal to the judge of the court of admiralty; superintend the deepening and cleansing of the river Thames, and have under their jurisdiction the bailiff office; have powers to buy lands, and receive donations for charitable uses; and in consequence, relieve annually many thousands of poor seamen, their widows, and orphans.\n\nIt is in this house the business of the institution is carried on; but the mother house is at Deptford, the corporation being named, \"the master, wardens, and assistants of the guild or fraternity of the most glorious and undivided Trinity, and of St Clement, in the parish of Deptford Strand, in the county of Kent.\"\n\nBetween Aldgate and the Tower is the street called the Minories, from some poor ladies of the order of St Clare, or minorellas. They had been invited to London by Blanch queen of Navarre, and wife to Edmund earl of Lancaster, who founded a convent for them in 1293. On the suppression of the monasteries it was converted into a dwelling house for some of the nobility, and is now in the possession of the Dartmouth family. Till of late years, the Minories were but a despicable street; but have now been excellently rebuilt, and are as elegant as any in the city.\n\nOn the west side of the city walls at this place, stood the house of the Crutched or Crofied Friars, an order instituted at Bologna in 1169, and of which a branch settled in England in 1244, where they were accommodated with a house in this place by two citizens named Ralph Foster and William Sabernat, who became members of their order. Henry VIII. granted their house to Sir Thomas Wyat the elder, who built a handsome mansion on part of the ground where it stood. This mansion became afterwards the residence of John Lord Lumley, a celebrated warrior in the time of Henry VIII. In process of time, it was converted into a navy office; but this office being removed to Somerset-house, the India Company have erected in its place a most magnificent warehouse, in form of an oblong square of about 250 feet by 160, enclosing a court of 150 by 60 feet, the entrance to which is by an arched gateway.\n\nBillinggate ward is distinguished by its market. Billinggate was a small port for the reception of ships' goods, and for a considerable time the most important place for the landing of almost every article of commerce. In the time of King William, Billinggate began to be celebrated as a fish-market. In 1699 it was by act of parliament made a free port for fish to be sold there every day except Sunday; but Mr Pennant informs us, that the object of this has long been frustrated, and that fish are now no longer to be had there in perfection. The same author gives a list of the fish which in the time of Edward III. were brought to the London market; the monarch himself having condescended to regulate the prices, that his subjects might not be imposed upon by those who sold them. Among these were the conger-eel and porpoise, neither of which is now admitted to any table. A pike at that time cost 6½. 6½d.; whence our author concludes, that it was an exotic fish, and brought over at a vast expense. Some fishes are mentioned in his list with which this naturalist owns himself unacquainted, viz. the barkey, bran, batrile, crolping, and rumb. In Archbishop Nevill's great feast is mentioned also a fish named third-poole, unknown at present. Seals were formerly accounted a fish; and these, together with the flurgeon and porpoise, were the only fresh fish permitted by the 33rd of Henry VIII. to be bought by any stranger at sea between England, France, Flanders, and Zealand.\n\nLimefreet ward is remarkable for a very large building of great antiquity, called Leadenhall, with flat battlements leaded on the top, and a spacious square in the middle. In 1309 it was the house of Sir Hugh Nevill, knight; in 1384, of Humphry Bohun earl of Hereford; in 1428 it became the property of the celebrated Whittington, who presented it to the mayor and commonalty of London; and in 1419, a public granary was erected here by Sir Simon Eyre, a citizen and draper, who built it with stone in its present form. This granary was designed as a preservative against famine, and to be kept always full of corn, which design was for some time happily answered. The house came to be used for many other purposes besides that of a granary; as for keeping the artillery and arms of the city. Preparations for any kind of pageantry or triumph were also made here; and from its strength the place was considered as the chief fortress within the city in case of any popular insurrection, and was likewise the place from whence arms were distributed. In this edifice are warehouses for the sale of leather, Chester baize, meal, and wool. Adjoining to Leadenhall is a market, thence called Leadenhall market, consisting of five considerable squares or courts, and reckoned one of the greatest markets in Europe for flesh and other provisions, as well as for leather, green hides, and wool. A little to the eastward is the India House, built in 1726, on the spot occupied by Sir William Craven, mayor in 1610. According to Mr Pennant, this house \"is not worthy of the lords of India.\"\n\nIn Broad-street is the Bank of England, a stone building, which occupies one side of Threadneedle-street, England. The centre, and the building behind, were founded in\nLondon. in the year 1733; the architect George Sampson. Before that time the business was transacted in Grocers-hall. The front is a sort of vestibule; the base rustic, the ornamental columns above Ionic. Within is a court leading to a second elegant building, which contains a hall and offices, where the debt of above 250 millions is punctually discharged. Of late years two wings of uncommon elegance, designed by Sir Robert Taylor, have been added, at the expense of a few houses, and of the church of St Christopher's le Stocks. \"The name of the projector of this national glory (says Mr Pennant), was Mr James Paterson of Scotland. This palladium of our country was in 1780 saved from the fury of an infamous banditti by the virtue of its citizens, who formed suddenly a volunteer company, and overawed the miscreants; while the chief magistrate shook trembling in his mansion-house, and left his important charge to its fate. This important building has ever since been very properly guarded by the military; who, in passing through the city, have often given offence to many busy characters who would strive to preserve the city rights at the expense of the national destruction. A lord mayor was the last who interested himself by applying to Mr Grenville, who gave him to understand, that if the guards were not quietly permitted to discharge their duty, the bank would be removed to Somerset-house.\"\n\nAt the extremity of Threadneedle-street is Merchant Taylors Hall. In this street also is the South Sea House, first established in 1711 for the purpose of an exclusive trade to the South sea, and for supplying Spanish America with negroes.\n\nNear the junction of Throgmorton-street with Broad-street stood a magnificent house built by Cromwell earl of Essex; after whose fall, the house and gardens were bought by the Drapers company. The house was destroyed in the great fire, but rebuilt for the use of the company in a magnificent manner.\n\nMr Pennant informs us, that St Giles's church in the fields, and a few houses to the west of it, in the year 1660, were barely separated from Broad-street. The church is supposed to have belonged to an hospital for lepers, founded about the year 1117, by Matilda queen to Henry I. In ancient times it was customary here to present to malefactors, on their way to the gallows (which, about the year 1413, was removed from Smithfield, and placed between St Giles's high street and Hog lane (c), a great bowl of ale, as the last refreshment they were to receive in this life. On the door to the churchyard is a curious piece of sculpture, representing the last day, containing an amazing number of figures, set up about the year 1686. This church was rebuilt in 1625. By the amazing raising of the ground by filth and various adventitious matter, the floor in the year 1730 was eight feet below the surface acquired in the intervening time. This alone made it necessary to rebuild the church in the present century. The first stone was laid in 1730; it was finished in 1734, at the expense of £19,000.—In the churchyard is a great square pit, with many rows of coffins piled one upon the other, all exposed to sight and smell, the latter of which is highly offensive if not dangerous.\n\nOn the west side of Broad-street stood the house of the Augustines, founded by Humphrey Bohun earl of Somerset in 1253, for friars and hermits of the Augustine order. On the dissolution of the monastery, great part of the house was granted to Lord William Lord St John, afterwards marquis of Winchester, and lord treasurer, who founded a magnificent house named Winchester-house. The west end of the church was granted in 1551 to John de Lafoe for the use of the Germans and other fugitive Protestants, and afterwards to the Dutch as a place for preaching. A part of it was also converted into a glasshouse for Venice glasses, in which the manufacture was carried on by artists from that city, and patronized by the duke of Buckingham. The place was afterwards converted into Plaisterers-hall, belonging to the company of pinnakers.\n\nTo the eastward of Winchester-street stood the house of that very eminent merchant Sir Thomas Gresham, afterwards known by the name of Gresham college. (See GRESHAM.) It has been pulled down not many years ago; and the Excise Office, a most magnificent and at the same time simple building, rose in its place. Mr Pennant informs us, that from the 5th of January 1786 to January 5th 1787, the payments into this office amounted to no less than £5,331,114l. 6s. 10½d.\n\nThe Royal Exchange, which is the meeting place of the merchants of London, stands in the ward of change. Cornhill, and is the finest and strongest fabric of the kind in Europe. It was founded in the year 1566. Sir Thomas Gresham merchant in London, made an offer to the lord mayor and citizens, to build, at his own expense, a commodious edifice for merchants to meet and transact business, provided the city would find him a convenient situation for the same. Mr Pennant informs us, that one Richard Clough a Welshman, originally Sir Thomas's servant, first put him on this design by a letter from Antwerp, in which he reproached the London merchants with having no place to transact their business, but walking about in the rain, more like pedlars than merchants. The citizens, in compliance with Sir Thomas's desire, purchased,\n\n(c) This late place of execution, according to Mr Pennant, was called in the time of Edward III. when the gentle Mortimer finished his days here, the Elms: but the original as well as the present name was Tyburne; not from tye and burn, as if it were called so from the manner of capital punishments; but from bourne, the Saxon word for a \"brook,\" and Tyre the name of that brook, which joined gave name to a manor before the conquest. Here was also a village and church denominated St John the Evangelist, which fell to decay, and was succeeded by that of Mary-bourne, corrupted into Mary-la-bonne. In 1626, Queen Henrietta Maria was compelled by her prince to take a walk by way of penance to Tyburn. What her offence was we are not told; but Charles was frightened at this insolence, that he soon after sent them and all her majesty's French servants out of the kingdom.\nchaired, for the sum of £3521. 80 houses in the two alleys called New St Christopher's and Swan-alley, leading out of Cornhill into Threadneedle-street. The materials of those houses were sold for £781. and the ground, when cleared, was conveyed to Sir Thomas Gresham, who, accompanied by several aldermen, laid the first brick of the new building on the 7th of June that year. Each alderman also laid his brick, and left a piece of gold for the workmen; who set about it with such fidelity and resolution, that the whole fabric was roofed by the month of November 1567, and was soon after completed under the name of the Burse. This building was totally destroyed by the fire in 1666; and in its place the present magnificent structure was erected at the expense of £80,000, which stands upon a plat of ground 203 feet in length and 171 in breadth, containing an area in the middle, of 61 square perches, surrounded with a substantial and regular stone building, wrought in rustic. It has two fronts, north and south, each of which is a piazza; and in the centre are the grand entrances into the area, under a very lofty and noble arch. The south front in Cornhill is the principal; on each side of which are Corinthian demi-columns, supporting a compas pediment; and, in the intercolumniation on each side, in the front next the street, is a niche, with the statues of King Charles I. and II. in Roman habits, and well executed. Over the aperture, on the cornice between the two pediments, are the king's arms in relief; on each side of this entrance is a range of windows placed between demi-columns and pilasters of the composite order, above which runs a balustrade. This building is 56 feet high; and from the centre, in this front, rises a lanthorn and turret 178 feet high, on the top of which is a vane of gilt brass made in the shape of a grasshopper, the crest of Sir Thomas Gresham's arms. The north front in Threadneedle-street is adorned with pilasters of the composite order; but has neither columns nor statues on the outside; and has triangular, instead of compas pediments. The inside of the area is also surrounded with piazzas, forming ambulatories for merchants, &c., to shelter themselves from the weather, when met there upon business. Above the arches of this piazza is an entablature with curious ornaments: and on the cornice a range of pilasters with an entablature extending round, and a compas pediment in the middle of the cornice of each of the four sides. Under the pediment on the north side are the king's arms; on the south, the city's arms; on the east, Sir Thomas Gresham's arms; and on the west, the mercers' arms, with their respective enrichments. In these intercolumns are 24 niches, 20 of which are filled with the statues of the kings and queens of England. Under these piazzas, within the area, are 28 niches, all vacant but that in which Sir Thomas Gresham's statue is placed in the north-west angle, and that in the south-west, where the statue of Sir John Barnard was placed in his lifetime by his fellow-citizens to express their sense of his merit. The centre of this area also is ornamented with a statue of King Charles II. in a Roman habit, standing upon a marble pedestal about eight feet high, and encompassed with iron rails; which pedestal is enriched on the south side with an imperial crown, a sceptre, sword, palm branches, and other decorations, with a very flattering inscription to the king. On the west side is a Cupid cut in relief, resting his right hand on a shield, with the arms of France and England quartered, and holding a rose in his left hand. On the north side is another Cupid supporting a shield, with the arms of Ireland; and on the east side are the arms of Scotland, with a Cupid holding a thistle; all done in relief: the whole executed by that able statuary Mr Gibbon.\n\nIn this area, merchants, and such as have businesses with them, meet every day at change hours; and for the more regular and readier despatch of businesses, they dispose of themselves into separate walks, according to the following plan.\n\n**North.**\n\n| Threadneedle-Street. |\n|---------------------|\n| East country walk.  |\n| Clothiers walk.     |\n| Silkmen's walk.    |\n| Norway walk.       |\n| Turkey walk.       |\n| East India walk.   |\n\n**South.**\n\n| Scotch walk. |\n|--------------|\n| Salters walk.|\n| Brokers of Stock, &c. walk.|\n| Italian walk.|\n\n**East.**\n\n| Dutch and Jewellers. |\n|----------------------|\n| Armenian walk.       |\n| Swithin's-alley.    |\n| Portugal walk.      |\n\n**West.**\n\n| Virginia walk. |\n|---------------|\n| Jamaica walk. |\n\n**Central.**\n\n| Spanish walk. |\n|---------------|\n| Jews walk.    |\nIn building this expensive structure there was an eye not only to magnificence, and to accommodate the merchants, but also to reimburse the expense. For this reason a gallery was built over the four sides of the Royal Exchange. This was divided into 200 shops, which were let out to haberdashers, milliners, &c., and which for several years were well occupied. But these shops have now for a long time been deserted, and the galleries are let out to the Royal Exchange Assurance Office, the Merchant-merchants Office, the Marine Society, and to auctioneers, &c. Under the whole area there are the finest dry vaults that can be found anywhere, which are let out to the East-India Company to deposit their pepper. In the turret is a good clock with four dials, which is well regulated every day, so that it becomes a standard of time to all the mercantile part of the town; and it goes with chimes at three, six, nine, and twelve o'clock, playing upon twelve bells. The outside of this grand fabric suffers very much in its elegance from the shops that surround it; and are built within its walls; and which are occupied by booksellers, toymen, cutlers, hosiers, watchmakers, &c.\n\nSouth of the Royal Exchange, and near the west extremity of Lombard-street, is the General Post Office, which is a handsome and commodious building.\n\nIn Walbrook ward is the Mansion-house, for the residence of the lord mayor. This edifice was begun in 1739, and finished in 1753. It is built of Portland stone, with a porch of six fluted columns, of the Corinthian order, in the front. The basement story is very lofty, and consists of rustic work; in the centre of it is the door, which leads to the kitchen, cellars, and other offices. On each side rises a flight of steps, leading up to the portico, in the middle of which is the principal entry. The stone balustrade of the stairs is continued along the front of the portico, and the columns support a large angular pediment, adorned with a group of figures in bas relief, representing the dignity and opulence of the city of London. It is an extremely heavy building, of an oblong form, and its depth is the long side, having several magnificent apartments, which are not, however, well lighted, on account of the houses that surround it.\n\nBehind the Mansion-house is St Stephen's Church, in Walbrook, justly reputed the masterpiece of the celebrated Sir Christopher Wren, and is said to exceed every modern structure in the world in proportion and elegance.\n\nThe Mansion-house, and many adjacent buildings, stand on the place where the Stocks-market once stood. This took its name from a pair of stocks erected near the spot in 1281; and was the great market of London for provisions during many centuries.\n\nIn this ward is situated one of the most remarkable pieces of antiquity in London. It is a great stone, now standing in a case on the north side of Canon-street, close under the south wall of St Swithin's church. It is called London-stone; and was formerly pitched edgeways on the other side of the street, opposite to where it now stands, fixed deeply in the ground, and strongly fastened with iron bars; but for the convenience of wheel-carriges it was removed to its present situation. This stone is mentioned so early as the time of Athelstan, king of the West Saxons, and has been carefully preserved from age to age. Of the original cause of its erection no memorial remains; but it is conjectured, that as London was a Roman city, this stone might be the centre, and might serve as an object from which the distance was computed to the other considerable cities or stations in the province.\n\nIn Dowgate ward is a noted academy, called Merchant-Taylors School, from its having been founded by Taylors the merchant-taylors company, in the year 1561. It was destroyed by the fire of London in 1666, but was rebuilt, and is a very large structure, with commodious apartments for the masters and others, and a fine library. Sir Thomas White, lord mayor of this city, having founded St John's college in Oxford in 1557, appointed this school as a seminary for it, and established at Oxford 40 fellowships for scholars elected from this school.\n\nThe church of St Mary le Bow, in Cordwainers-St Mary le street ward, is the most eminent parochial church in the Bow city. It was originally built in the reign of William the Conqueror; and being the first church the steeple of which was embellished with stone arches or bows, took hence its denomination of le Bow. It was burnt down in the fire of 1666, but soon afterwards rebuilt. The steeple of this church is reckoned the most beautiful of its kind in Europe.\n\nIn Cheap ward is Guildhall, or the townhouse of Guildhall, London. This was originally built in 1411, but so damaged by the great fire already mentioned, as to be rebuilt in 1666. The front has a Gothic appearance; and this character is also due to the two gigantic effigies which stand within the hall. The hall is 153 feet long, 50 broad, and 55 high, adorned with the royal arms, and those of the city and its companies, as well as with several portraits of English sovereigns and judges. In this building are many apartments for transacting the business of the city, besides one for each of the judicial courts, namely, that of the King's Bench, the Common Pleas, and the Exchequer.\n\nIn the year 1246 Cheapside was an open field, Cheapside, named Crown field, from an inn with the sign of the crown. At that time, and even for 200 years afterwards, none of the streets of London were paved excepting Thames-street, and from Ludgate-hill to Charing-Cross.\n\nGoldsmiths Hall stands in Foster-lane, which opens Goldsmiths into the west end of Cheapside.—In this lane also is Hall. St Martin's le Grand, which, though surrounded by St Mary the city, was yet subject, near three centuries, to Grand Westminster Abbey. A fine college was built here in 700 by Wythred king of Kent; and, about the year 1056, rebuilt and chiefly endowed by Ingelric and Edward, two noble brothers. In 1068, it was confirmed and made independent of every other ecclesiastical jurisdiction, even that of the pope himself not excepted; and its privileges were confirmed by succeeding monarchs. It was governed by a dean, and a number of secular canons. In this jurisdiction a magnificent church was erected, but pulled down in 1548, when the college was surrendered; after which a tavern was erected on the spot.\n\nA little to the westward of Mary le Bow church (in the adjoining ward), stood the Cross and Conduit and Conduit in the middle of the street. The former was built by Edward I. in 1290, in memory of his queen Eleanor, whole\nwhose body was rested on that spot in its way to be buried. Originally it had the statue of the queen at full length, resembling exactly that at Northampton. Having at length fallen to decay, it was rebuilt in 1441 by John Hutherby mayor of the city, at the expense of several citizens, being now ornamented with various images, as those of the Resurrection, the Virgin Mary, &c. As the magnificent processions took this road, it was new gilt at every public entry. After the Reformation, the images gave so much offence, that it was thought proper to substitute that of Diana in place of the Virgin Mary. This, however, was relented by Queen Elizabeth, who offered a reward for the discovery of the offenders. As she imagined that a cross, the symbol of the Christian religion, could not justly give offence to any professed of that religion, she ordered a cross to be placed on the summit and gilt; but in 1643, the parliament ordered the demolition of all crosses and other marks of Romish superstition.\n\nSplendid tournaments were held between the Cross and Sopers-lane in the year 1333; but as Queen Philippa and a great number of other ladies, dressed in rich attire, were sitting on the upper scaffolding to behold the sports, the seat gave way, and they suddenly fell down among the knights and others who stood below; many of whom were grievously hurt. The carpenters were saved from punishment by the intercession of the queen; but the king, to prevent accidents of like nature, ordered a building of stone to be erected near Bow church, from whence the queen and other ladies might behold such spectacles in safety. This was used for the same purpose till the year 1412, when Henry IV. granted it to certain mercers, who converted it into shops, warehouses, and other places necessary for their trade.\n\nA small distance eastward from the Cross stood the Conduit, which served to fill the lesser ones with water brought by pipes from Paddington.—This stood on the spot where the old conduit was situated, which was founded in 1285, constructed of stone lined with lead, and rebuilt in 1479 by Thomas Han, one of the sheriffs. On some grand occasions, these conduits have been made to run with claret; as at the coronation of Anna Bullen.\n\nOn the north side of Cheapside stood the Hospital of St Thomas of Acon, founded by Fitz-Theobald de Helles, and his wife Agnes, sister to the famous Thomas à Becket. The hospital was built 20 years after the murder of Thomas; and such was his reputation for sanctity, that it was dedicated to him even before he was canonized, and that in conjunction with the Virgin Mary herself. The whole was granted by King Henry VIII. to the company of mercers. It was destroyed by the great fire in 1666; but rebuilt by the mercers company, who have their hall here.—Immediately to the east is a narrow street called the Old Jewry, which took its name from a great synagogue which stood here till the Jews were expelled the kingdom in 1291. After them an order of friars named Friars de focca, or de penitentia, took possession of the synagogue; and in 1305, Robert Fitzwalter, the great banner-bearer of the city, requested that the friars might assign it to him; the reason of which probably was, that it stood near to his house, which was situated in the neighbourhood of the present Grocers-hall. The chapel was bought by the grocers from Fitzwalter in 1411 for 320 marks.\n\nIn Bishopsgate ward, is Blackwell or Bakeswell Hall, which adjoins to Guildhall, and is the Hall's greatest mart of woollen cloth in the world. It was purchased of King Richard II. by the city; and has ever since been used as a weekly market for broad and narrow woollen cloths, brought out of the country. Formerly proclamations were issued to compel people to bring their goods into the hall, to prevent deceit in the manufactures, which might be productive of discredit in foreign markets, and likewise be the means of defrauding the poor children of Christ's hospital of part of the revenue which arose from the hallage of this great magazine. It suffered in the general devastation in 1666; but was rebuilt in 1672, and is now a spacious edifice, with a stone front adorned with columns.\n\nCripplegate ward is remarkable for a college, called Sion College, founded in 1627, on the site of Elsing-hospital (D) or priory, by Dr Thomas White, vicar of St Dunstan's in the West, for the improvement of the London clergy; and with almshouses, under their care, for 20 poor persons, 10 men and 10 women. In the year 1631, a charter was procured for incorporating the clergy of London, by which they were constituted fellows of the college; and out of the incumbents are annually elected, on Tuesday three weeks after Easter, a president, two deans, and four assistants, who are to meet quarterly, to hear a Latin sermon, and afterwards be entertained at dinner in the college-hall at the expense of the foundation. John Simpson, rector of St Olaves, who superintended the building, added, at his own expense, for the use of the studious part of the London clergy, a library 120 feet long, and amply filled with books.\n\nIn this ward is a hall which belonged to the company of barber-surgeons, the professions of barber and surgeon being formerly exercised by the same person. It was built by the celebrated Inigo Jones, and the upper end is formed out of one of the towers or barbicans of London wall. The anatomical theatre is elliptical, and very finely contrived. This hall is now called Barbers' Hall; the surgeons, who disdained to be any longer associated with their ancient brethren, having obtained a separate charter, and built themselves a new hall in the Old Bailey.\n\nFarringdon ward, within, is distinguished by the most magnificent Protestant church in the world, the cathedral of St Paul. The best authority we have for the origin of this church, is from its great restorer Sir Christopher Wren. His opinion that there had been\n\n(D) This was founded by William Elzing mercer in 1329 (on the site of a decayed nunnery), for the support of 100 blind men. He afterwards changed it into four canons-regular were to superintend the miserable objects.\nLondon: a church on this spot, built by the Christians in the time of the Romans, was confirmed; when he searched for the foundations for his own design, he met with those of the original presbyterium, or semicircular chancel, of the old church. They consisted only of Kentish rubble stone, artfully worked, and consolidated with exceedingly hard mortar, in the Roman manner, much excelling the superstructure. He exploded the notion of there having been here a temple of Diana, and the discovery of the horns of animals used in the sacrifices to that goddess, on which the opinion had been founded, no such having been discovered in all his searches.\n\nThe first church is supposed to have been destroyed in the Diocletian persecution, and to have been re-built in the reign of Constantine. This was again demolished by the pagan Saxons; and restored, in 627, by Sebert, a petty prince, ruling in these parts, under Ethelberht king of Kent, the first Christian monarch of the Saxon race; who, at the instance of St. Augustine, appointed Mellitus the first bishop of London. Erkenwald, the son of King Offa, fourth in succession from Mellitus, ornamented his cathedral very highly, and improved the revenues with his own patrimony. He was most deservedly canonized: for the very litter, in which he was carried in his last illness, continued many centuries to cure fevers by the touch; and the very chips, carried to the sick, restored them to health.\n\nWhen the city of London was destroyed by fire, in 1283, this church was burnt; the bishop Mauritius began to rebuild it, and laid the foundations, which remained till its second destruction, from the same cause, in the last century. Notwithstanding Mauritius lived twenty years after he had begun this pious work, and Bishop Beauvages enjoyed the see twenty more, yet such was the grandeur of the design, that it remained unfinished. The first had the ruins of the Palatine Tower bestowed on him, as materials for the building; and Henry I. bestowed on Beauvages part of the ditch belonging to the Tower, which, with purchases made by himself, enabled him to enclose the whole with a wall. The same monarch granted, besides, that every ship which brought stone for the church, should be exempted from toll; he gave him also all the great fish taken in his precincts, except the tongues; and, lastly, he secured to him and his successor the delicious tithes of all his venison in the county of Essex.\n\nThe style of the ancient cathedral was a most beautiful Gothic; over the east end was an elegant circular window; alterations were made in the ends of the two transepts, so that their form is not delivered down to us in the ancient plans; and from the central tower rose a lofty and most graceful spire. The dimensions, as taken in 1399, were these: The length five hundred and ninety feet; the breadth a hundred and twenty; the height of the roof of the west part, from the floor, one hundred and two; of the east part, a hundred and eighty-eight; of the tower, two hundred and sixty-five; of the spire, which was made of wood covered with lead, two hundred and seventy-four. The whole space the church occupied was three acres, three roods, and twenty-one perches.\n\nWe may be astonished at this amazing building, and naturally inquire what fund could supply money to support so vast an expense. But monarchs refueled their revenues resulting from the customs due for the materials, which were brought to the adjacent wharfs; they furnished wood from the royal forests; prelates gave up much of their revenues; and, what was more than all, by the pious bait of indulgences, and remissions of penance, brought in from the good people of this realm most amazing sums. Pope Innocent III. in 1252, gave a release of sixty days penance; the archbishop of Cologne gave, a few years before, a relaxation of fifty days; and Boniface archbishop of Canterbury, forty days.\n\nThe high altar dazzled with gems and gold, the gifts of its numerous votaries. John king of France, when prisoner in England, first paying his respects to St. Erkenwald's shrine, offered four balcons of gold; and the gifts at the obsequies of princes, foreign and British, were of immense value. On the day of the conversion of the tutelar saint, the charities were prodigious, first to the souls, when an indulgence of forty days pardon was given, were pontificibus, contritis et confessis; and, by order of Henry III., fifteen hundred tapers were placed in the church, and fifteen thousand poor people fed in the churchyard.\n\nThe holiness of this place did not prevent thieves and profligates of all denominations from lurking within the precincts, and committing, under the favour of the night, murders and every sort of crime. Edward I. gave the dean and canons permission to enclose the whole within a wall; and to have gates to be shut every night, to exclude all disorderly people. Within these walls, on the north-west side, was the bishop's palace. Froissart tells us, that after the great tournament in Smithfield, King Edward III. and his queen lodged here, on occasion of their nuptials (e).—In 1561, the noble spire was totally burnt by lightning, and never restored.\n\nIn consequence of the resolutions taken in 1629, by James I.\n\n(e) Before this cathedral was the famous Paul's Cross, a pulpit formed of wood, mounted upon steps of stone, and covered with lead, in which the most eminent divines were appointed to preach every Sunday in the forenoon. To this place, the court, the mayor and aldermen, and principal citizens, used to resort. The greatest part of the congregation sat in the open air; the king and his train had covered galleries; and the better sort of people were also protected from the injury of the weather; but the far greater part stood exposed in the open air: for which reason the preacher went in very bad weather to a place called the Shrouds; a covered space on the side of the church, to protect the congregation in inclement seasons. Considerable contributions were raised among the nobility and citizens, to support such preachers as were (as was often the case) called to town from either of the universities. In particular, the lord mayor and aldermen ordered that every preacher, who came from a distance, should be freely accommodated, during five days, with sweet and convenient lodgings, fire, candle,\nLondon. James I. to repair the cathedral, the celebrated Inigo Jones was appointed to the work. But it was not attempted till the year 1633, when Laud laid the first stone, and Inigo the fourth. That great architect begun with a most notorious impropriety, giving to the west end a portico of the Corinthian order, beautiful indeed, to this ancient Gothic pile; and to the ends of the two transepts Gothic fronts in a most horrible style. The great fire made way for the restoring of this magnificent pile in its present noble form by Sir Christopher Wren, an architect worthy of so great a design.\n\nIt is built of fine Portland stone, in form of a cross. On the outside are two ranges of pilasters, consisting of a hundred and twenty each; the lower range of the Corinthian order, and the upper of the composite. The spaces between the arches of the windows and the entablature of the lower order, are filled with a great variety of curious enrichments, as are also those above. On the north side is a portico, the ascent to which is by twelve steps of black marble, and its dome supported by six very large columns. Over the dome is a pediment, the face of which is engraved with the royal arms, regalia, and other ornaments. On the south is a portico, the ascent to which is by twenty-five steps, and its dome supported by six columns corresponding with those on the north side. The west front is graced with a most magnificent portico, supported by twelve lofty Corinthian columns; over these are eight columns of the composite order, which support a noble pediment, crowned with its acroteria, and in this pediment is the history of St Paul's conversion, boldly carved in bas relief. The ascent to this portico is by a flight of steps of black marble, extending the whole length of the portico; and over each corner of the west front is a beautiful turret. A vast dome, or cupola, rises in the centre of the building. Twenty feet above the roof of the church is a circular range of thirty-two columns with niches, placed exactly against others within. These are terminated by their entablature, which supports a handsome gallery, adorned with a stone balustrade. Above the columns last mentioned is a range of pilasters, with windows between them; and from the entablature of these, the diameter of the dome gradually decreases. On the summit of the dome is an elegant balcony, from the centre of which runs a beautiful lanthorn, adorned with Corinthian columns. The whole is crowned with a copper ball, supporting a cross, both finely gilt. Within, the cupola stands on eight stupendous pillars, curiously adorned; the roof of the choir is supported by five pillars, and that of the church by two ranges, consisting of twenty more. The roof of the church and choir is adorned with arches and spacious peripheries of enrichments, admirably carved in stone. Quite round the inside of the cupola, there is a whispering iron balcony, or gallery, the top of which is richly painted by Sir James Thornhill.\n\nThe first stone of this superb edifice was laid on June 27, 1675; and the building was completed in 1710; but the whole decorations were not finished till 1723. It was a most singular circumstance, that notwithstanding it was 35 years in building, it was begun and finished by one architect, and under one prelate, Henry Compton bishop of London. The church of St Peter's was 135 years in building, in the reigns of 19 popes, and went through the hands of twelve architects. It is not, as often mistaken, built after the model of that famous temple: it is the entire conception of our great countryman, and has been preferred in some respects, by a judicious writer, to even the Roman Basilica. Its dimensions are less. The comparative view is given in the Parentalia, and copied in London and its Environs. The height of St Peter's, to the top of the cross, is 437 feet and an half; that of St Paul's 340 feet; so that, from its situation, it is lofty enough to be seen from the sea. The length of the first is 720 feet; of the latter, 500. The greatest breadth of St Peter's is 364; of St Paul's, 180.\n\nIn the reigns of James I. and Charles I. the body of this cathedral was the common resort of the politicians, the news-mongers, and idle in general. It was called Paul's walk; and is mentioned in the old plays and other books of the times.\n\nNotwithstanding the magnificence of this noble pile, however, it is remarked to have many defects. Its situation is such, that it cannot be viewed at a distance. The division of the porticos, and the whole structure, into two stories on the outside, certainly indicates a like division within, which is acknowledged to be a fault. The dome, it has also been observed, bears too great a proportion to the rest of the pile, and ought to have been raised exactly in the centre of the building; besides that, there ought to have been two steeples at the east end, to correspond with those at the west. On entering this church, we instantly perceive an obvious deficiency, not only of elevation but length, to afflit the perspective; and the columns are heavy and clumsy, rather encumbering the prospect than enriching it.\n\nSt Paul's occupies an area of six acres, and is raised all round with iron balustrades, each about five feet and a half high, fixed on a dwarf wall of hewn stone. In the west end of this area is a marble statue of Queen Anne, holding a sceptre in one hand, and a globe\n\ncandle, and all necessaries. And notice was given by the bishop of London, to the preacher appointed by him, of the place he was to repair to.\n\nWe hear of this being in use as early as the year 1259. It was used, as Mr Pennant observes, not only for the instruction of mankind by the doctrine of the preacher, but for every purpose political or ecclesiastical; for giving force to oaths, for promulgating of laws, or rather the royal pleasure, for the emission of papal bulls, for anathematizing sinners, for benedictions, for exposing of penitents under censure of the church, for recantations, for the private ends of the ambitious, and for the delaminating of those who had incurred the displeasure of crowned heads.\n\nIt was demolished in 1643 by order of parliament, executed by the willing hands of Isaac Pennington the fanatical lord mayor of that year, who died in the Tower a convicted regicide.\nLondon globe in the other, surrounded with four emblematical figures representing Great Britain, France, Ireland, and America.\n\nBesides very large contributions for carrying on this edifice, the parliament granted a duty on sea-coal, which, at a medium, produced £5000 a-year; and the whole expense of the building is said to have amounted to £36,752l. 2s. 3d.\n\nOn the east side of the cathedral is St Paul's School, founded in 1509 by Dr John Collet dean of this church, who endowed it for a principal master, an under-master, a chaplain, and 153 scholars.\n\nIn Warwick-lane, in the same ward, stands the College of Physicians, erected in 1682 by Sir Christopher Wren. It is built of brick, and has a spacious stone frontispiece. Near the south extremity of the Old Bailey, on the east side, is the hall of the Company of Surgeons, with a theatre for dissection.\n\nAdjoining to Christ-church in Newgate-street is Christ's Hospital, which, before the dissolution of monasteries by Henry VIII., was a house of Gray-friars. The hospital was founded by King Edward VI. for supporting and educating the fatherless children of poor freemen of this city; of whom 1000 of both sexes are generally maintained in the house or out at nurse, and are likewise clothed and educated. In 1673, a mathematical school was founded here by Charles II., endowed with £300 a-year; and a writing school was added in 1694 by Sir John Moor, an alderman of the city. After the boys have been seven or eight years on the foundation, some are sent to the university and others to sea; while the rest, at a proper age, are put apprentices to trades at the charge of the hospital. At first their habit was a rufflet cotton, but was soon after changed for blue, which has ever since continued to be their colour; and on this account the foundation is frequently called the Blue-coat hospital. The affairs of this charity are managed by a president and about 300 governors, besides the lord mayor and aldermen. The fabric, which is partly Gothic and partly modern, was much damaged by the fire of 1666, but was soon repaired, and has been since increased with several additions. The principal buildings, which form the four sides of an area, have a piazza round them with Gothic arches, and the walls are supported by abutments. The front is more modern, and has Doric pilasters supported on pedestals.\n\nIn Cattle-Baynard ward is a large structure called Doctors Commons. It consists of several handsome paved courts, in which the judges of the court of admiralty, those of the court of delegates, of the court of arches, and the prerogative court, with the doctors that plead causes, and the proctors of the place, all live in a collegiate way; and from commoning together, as in other colleges, the name of Doctors Commons is derived. Here courts are kept for the trial of civil and ecclesiastical causes under the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London. The college has an excellent library, every bishop at his consecration giving £2l. or £5l. towards purchasing books for it.\n\nNear Doctors Commons, on St Benner's Hill, is the College of Heralds, who were incorporated by King Richard III. Besides the chief officer, who is the earl-marshal of England, here are three kings at arms, viz. Garter, Clarenceux, and Norroy, with six heralds, four pursuivants, and eight proctors. Garter attends the installments of knights of that order, carries the garter to foreign princes, regulates the ceremonies at coronations, and the funerals of the royal family and nobility: Clarenceux directs the funeral ceremonies of those under the degree of peers south of Trent; and Norroy performs the like office for those north of Trent. This building was originally the house of the earl of Derby. It is a spacious quadrangle, built of brick, and has convenient apartments. Here are kept records of the coats of arms of all the families and names in England, with an account when they were granted, and on what occasion.\n\nIn Farringdon ward without, is a large building called Bridewell, from a spring formerly known by the name of St Bridget's or St Bride's Well. It was originally a royal palace, and occupied all the ground from Fleet-ditch on the east to Water-lane on the west. That part of it now called Salisbury-court was given to the bishops of Salisbury for their town residence; and the east part, which was rebuilt by King Henry VIII., is the present Bridewell. It was granted to the city by Edward VI. as an hospital; and he endowed it for the lodging of poor travellers, and for the correction of vagabonds, strumpets, and idle persons, as well as for finding them work. In one part of the building 20 artificers have houses; and about 150 boys, distinguished by white hats and blue doublets, are put apprentices to glovers, flaxdressers, weavers, &c., and when they have served their time are entitled to the freedom of the city, with £1l. towards carrying on their respective trades. The other part of Bridewell is a receptacle for disorderly persons, who are kept at beating hemp and other hard labour.\n\nNear Bridewell is St Bride's Church, a lately fabric 111 feet long, 57 broad, and 41 high, with a beautiful spire 234 feet in altitude, and has a ring of 12 bells in its tower.\n\nOpposite to Fleet-ditch, over this part of the river, stands Blackfriars Bridge; a most elegant structure, built after the design of Mr Robert Mylne. The situation of the ground on the two shores obliged the architect to employ elliptical arches; which, however, have a very fine effect. The number of arches is nine; of which the centre one is 100 feet wide. The whole length is 995 feet; the breadth of the carriage-way is 28 ft.; and that of the two footways 7 each. Over each pier is a recess; an apology for the beautiful Ionic pillars which support them, and which have a most beautiful effect from the river. This bridge was begun in 1760; and finished in 1768, at the expense of £12,840l. to be discharged by a toll upon the passengers. It is situated almost at an equal distance between those of Westminster and London, commands a view of the Thames from the latter to Whitehall, and discovers the majesty of St Paul's in a very striking manner.\n\nWest Smithfield. In this ward is an area containing three acres of ground, called in old records Smithfield-Pond or Horse-Pool, it having been formerly a watering place for horses. It was in ancient times the common place of execution; and at the south-west corner there was a gallows called the Elms, from a number of elm trees.\ntrees that grew in the neighbourhood. It was likewise the scene of public julls and tournaments, and has been a market-place for cattle above 500 years.\n\nOn the south side of this area, and contiguous to Chiril's hospital, is St Bartholomew's Hospital. It was originally founded soon after the accession of Henry I. by Robert the king's jester, as an infirmary for the priory of St Bartholomew the Great, which then stood near the spot. But upon the dissolution of religious houses, Henry VIII. refounded it, and endowed it with 500 marks a-year, on condition that the citizens should pay the same sum annually for the relief of 100 lame and infirm patients. The endowments of this charity have since been so much enlarged, that it now receives the distress of all denominations. In 1792, a beautiful frontispiece was erected towards Smithfield, adorned with pilasters, entablature, and a pediment of the Ionic order, with a statue of King Henry VIII. standing in a niche in full proportion, and those of two cripples on the top of the pediment over it. In 1720, a plan was formed for rebuilding the rest of this hospital, in consequence of which a magnificent edifice has been erected.\n\nAmong many other privileges granted by Henry I. to the prior and canons of the monastery of St Bartholomew the Great, and to the poor of the infirmary, was that of keeping a fair in Smithfield on the eve, day, and morrow, of St Bartholomew. This fair, called Bartholomew-fair, has been held annually ever since: and by the indulgence of the magistrates of London, to whom the privilege of keeping it devolved upon the dissolution of the priory, it used to continue a fortnight. A great number of booths was erected in it by the actors of the theatres, for the exhibition of dramatic performances of various kinds; and it became at length a scene of so much licentiousness and riot, that Sir John Barnard when lord mayor of London reduced the time of the fair to its original duration of three days. This laudable example has been followed ever since; and the magistrates have likewise prohibited all public exhibitions which had been formerly accompanied with so much disorder.\n\nIn a street in this ward, called the Old Bailey, is a hall named Justice hall, or the Seffion's house, where a court is held eight times a-year by the king's commission of oyer and terminer for the trial of criminals for offences committed within the city of London and county of Middlesex. The judges of this court are the lord mayor, those of the aldermen that have served that office, and the recorder; who are attended by the sheriffs and by one or more of the national judges.\n\nIn this street is also the great criminal prison, lately built in a much more convenient situation, and on a more enlarged plan, than the former prison, called Newgate: by which name it is still distinguished. Here the unfortunate debtor will no longer be annoyed by the dreadful rattle of chains, or by the more horrid sounds issuing from the lips of those wretched beings who let defiance to all laws divine and human; and here also, the offender, whose crime is not capital, may enjoy all the benefits of a free open air.\n\nIn this ward is likewise a prison called the Fleet Prison, from a small river named the Fleet which formerly ran by it: this building is large, and reckoned the best in the city for good rooms and other conveniences. It has the benefit of a large yard, which is enclosed with a very high wall. This prison is as ancient as the reign of Richard I. and belongs to the court of chancery, &c.\n\nIn Chancery-lane, in this ward, is an office consisting of a house and chapel, called the office and chapel of the Rolls, from being the great repository of the modern public rolls and records of the kingdom. This building was originally the house of an eminent Jew; but being forfeited to the crown, King Henry III. in the year 1223 converted it into a hospital for the reception and accommodation of Jewish and other professytes. In 1377, Edward III. granted this hospital and its chapel to William Burfall master of the rolls, to whose successors in that office it has ever since belonged. Round this office there is a small district consisting of about 200 houses, called the Liberty of the Rolls, over which the magistrates of London have no authority, it being under the government of the master of the rolls.\n\nIn this ward are several Inns of court and chancery, particularly the Inner and Middle Temple, Serjeants Inn, Clifford's Inn, Barnard's Inn, Staple's Inn, and Furnival's Inn.\n\nThe Temple received its name from being originally founded by the Knights Templars, who settled here in 1185. It was at first called the New Temple, to distinguish it from the former house of the Knights Templars, which stood in Holborn near Chancery lane.\n\nThe original building was divided into three parts; the Inner, the Middle, and the Outer Temple. The Inner and the Outer Temple were so called, because one was within and the other was without the Bar; and the Middle derived its name from being situated between them. Upon the dissolution of the order of Knights Templars, the New Temple devolved to the Knights Hospitallers of St John of Jerusalem, who granted a lease of it to the jurists of the common law, and converted that part of it called Inner and Middle Temple into two inns of court for the study and practice of the common law. The Outer Temple became a house for the earl of Essex.\n\nThe buildings of the Temple escaped the fire in 1666, but were most of them destroyed by subsequent fires, and have since been rebuilt. The two Temples are each divided into several courts, and have pleasant gardens on the banks of the Thames. They are appropriated to distinct societies, and have separate halls, where the members dine in common during term-time. The Inner Temple hall is said to have been built in the reign of Edward III. and the middle Temple hall, which is a magnificent edifice, was rebuilt in 1572 in form of a college hall. The Middle Temple gate, Mr Pennant informs us, was erected by Sir Amias Powlet on a singular occasion. It seems that Sir Amias, about the year 1501 thought fit to put Cardinal Wolsey, then parson of Lymington, into the stocks. In 1515, being sent for to London by the cardinal on account of that ancient grudge, he was commanded not to quit town till farther orders. In consequence, he lodged five or six years in this gateway, which he rebuilt; and to pacify his eminence, adorned the front with the cardinal's cap, badges, cognizance, and other devices of this butcher's son; so low were the great men\nLondon. men obliged to stoop to that meteor of the times!\n\nEach temple has a good library, adorned with paintings, and well furnished with books. An assembly, called a parliament, in which the affairs of the society of the Inner Temple are managed, is held there every term. Both Temples have one church, first founded in 1185, by the Knights Templars; but the present edifice is supposed to have been built in 1420. It is supported by neat slender pillars of Suffolk marble, and is one of the most beautiful Gothic structures in England. In this church are many monuments, particularly of nine Knights Templars cut in marble in full proportion, some of them seven feet and a half long; six are crofs-legged, and therefore supposed to have been engaged in the crusades. The minister of this church, who is usually called the master of the Temple, is appointed by the benchers or senior members of both societies, and presented by a patent from the crown.\n\nShakespeare (whether from tradition or history) makes the Temple garden the place in which the badge of the white and red rose originated; the distinctive badge of the houses of York and Lancaster, under which the respective partizans of each arranged themselves in the fatal quartel which caused such torrents of English blood to flow.\n\nNear the Temple bar is the Devil's Tavern, so called from its sign of St Dunstan seizing the evil spirit by the nose with a pair of hot tongs. Ben Jonson has immortalized it by his Leges Convivales, which he wrote for the regulation of a club of wits held in a room he dedicated to Apollo; over the chimney-piece of which they are preserved. The tavern was in his days kept by Simon Wadloe; whom, in a copy of verses over the door of the Apollo, he dignified with the title of King of Skinters.\n\nSerjeants Inn is a small inn in Chancery-lane, where the judges and serjeants have chambers, but not houses, as they had in another inn of this name in Fleet-street, which they abandoned in 1730; but in each of them there is a hall and a chapel. Clifford's Inn is an inn of chancery belonging to the Inner Temple. It was originally a house granted by Edward II. to the family of the Cliffords, from which it derived its name; but was afterwards let upon lease to the students of the law, and in the reign of Edward III. sold to the members of this society. Bernard's Inn is likewise an inn of chancery belonging to Gray's Inn. It stands in Holborn, and was the house of John Mackworth, dean of Lincoln, who gave it to the professors of the law. Staple's Inn belongs also to Gray's Inn, and is situated in Holborn. It was once a hall for the merchants of the staple for wool, whence it derives its name; but it was purchased by the benchers of Gray's Inn, and has been an inn of chancery since the year 1415. Furnival's Inn is an inn of chancery belonging to Lincoln's Inn, and was once the house of the family of the Furnivals, by whom it was let out to the professors of the law.\n\nIt is a large old building, with a hall and a pleasant garden.\n\nIn Coleman-street ward, on the south side of a large square called Moorfields, stood Bethleham Hospital, founded in 1675 by the lord mayor and citizens of London for the reception and cure of poor lunatics. It was a noble edifice, built with brick and stone, and adorned with pilasters, entablatures, and sculpture; particularly with the figures of two lunatics over the grand gate, which are well executed. This building was 540 feet long and 40 broad, exclusive of two wings of a later erection, intended for the reception of such lunatics as were deemed incurable. This hospital contained a great number of convenient cells or apartments, where the patients were maintained and received all medical assistance without any other expense to their friends than that of bedding. The structure was divided into two stories, through each of which ran a long gallery from one end of the house to the other. On the south side were the cells, and on the north the windows that gave light to the galleries, which were divided in the middle by handsome iron gates, to keep the men and women separate. This hospital being pulled down, it is intended to erect another building for the use of the same charity, at a short distance from the metropolis. A new road is to be opened from the site of the old hospital to the Royal Exchange.\n\nOpposite to Bethlehem hospital stood that of St Luke's Luke, a long plain building, till of late appropriated to Hospital: the same purpose, but wholly independent of the former. It was founded on the humane consideration that Bethlehem was incapable of receiving all the miserable objects which were offered. Of late years the patients were removed from the old hospital to a new one erected under the same name in Old-street, on the plan of the former, extending in front 492 feet. The old hospital is now pulled down, and replaced by a handsome row of houses. Uncured patients may be taken in again, by a very liberal regulation, on the payment of five shillings a week; so that their friends may, if they choose, try a second time the force of medicine on their unhappy relations or acquaintances.\n\nBesides the three markets already mentioned at Different Smithfield for cattle and hay, at Leadenhall for butchers meat, wool, hides, and Colchester baize, and at Billingsgate for fish; there are in this city the following other markets, which are all very considerable, viz. Honey-lane, Newgate, and Fleet-market, chiefly for flesh, though with separate divisions for fish, butter, eggs, poultry, herbs, and fruit; and the Three-Cranes market, for apples and other fruit. The principal corn-market is held in a neat exchange situated in Market-lane, and that for flour at Queenhithe. In Thames-street, near Billingsgate, there is an exchange for dealers in coals and matters of vessels in that trade to transact their business.\n\nII. The Borough of Southwark. It was called by 2. Borough of Southwark, or the \"South work,\" in reference to some fort or fortification bearing that aspect from juridic London. It was also called the Borough, or Burg, ion, &c., probably from the same reason. It was long independent of the city of London; but, in consideration of the inconveniences arising from the escape of malefactors from the great capital into this place, it was in 1327 granted by Edward III. to the city, on payment of 10l. annually. It was then called the village of Southwark; it was afterwards styled the bailiwick of Southwark, and the mayor and commonalty of London appointed the bailiff. This power, however, not being sufficient to remedy the evil, a more intimate connexion was thought necessary; and in the reign of Edward VI. on a valuable consideration paid to the crown, it was formed into a 26th ward, by the title of Bridge Ward Without; with a reservation of certain privileges.\nLondon privileges enjoyed there by the archbishop of Canterbury and some other ecclesiastics. In consequence of this, it was subjected to the lord mayor of London, with the steward and bailiff. But Southwark being divided into two parts, this is to be understood of the division called the Borough Liberty, which consists of three of the parishes belonging to the town, with the greater part of a fourth parish. For the city division, the lord mayor by his steward holds a court of record every Monday at the sessions-house on St Margaret's Hill in this borough for all debts, damages, and trespasses within the limits of his jurisdiction. The other division is called the Clink, or the Manor of Southwark, and is subdivided into the Great Liberty, the Guildhall, and the King's Manor; for each of which subdivisions a court-leet is held, where the constables, ale-conners, and flesh-tasters, are chosen, and other business of this kind transacted. A court-house, called Union Hall, has lately been built in the new street called Union-street, which leads in a direct line from the high-street in the Borough to Great Surry-street Blackfriars road. The Clink liberty is under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Winchester, who, besides a court-leet, keeps here a court of record on the Bankside near St Saviour's church by his steward or bailiff, for pleas of debt, damages, and trespasses. Court-leets are also kept at Lambeth, Bermondsey, and Rochester, three small districts adjoining to the Borough.\n\nThere is a compter for the imprisonment of offenders in the bailiwick, and another for the Clink liberty; to which may be added the Surry workhouse for vagrants. Besides these, there is the Marshalsea-prison, which is the county gaol for felons, and the admiralty gaol for pirates (c); in which is a court first erected for trials of causes between the king's domestics or menial servants, of which the knight-marshals are president, and his steward judge, to whom belong four counsellors and six attorneys; and the court is held every Friday by him or his deputy, for debt, damages, and trespasses, in causes for ten miles round Whitehall, excepting London. In this quarter is also the King's Bench prison, the rules of which are above two miles in circuit, and comprise the greatest part of St George's Fields. Here was committed Henry prince of Wales, afterwards King Henry V., by the spirited and honest Judge Galcognie, for striking or insulting him on the bench. In this prison the allowance is somewhat better than that of the common prisons; for which reason, many debtors remove themselves hither by habeas corpus. It is properly a place of confinement in all cases triable in the King's Bench court.—The first time that Southwark is mentioned in history is on occasion of Earl Goodwin's sailing up the river to attack the royal navy of 50 ships lying before the palace of Westminster: this was in 1352, when we are told he went ad Sudworce, and staid till there the return of the tide.\n\nSouthwark consists of the parishes of St Olave, St Saviour, St George, and St Thomas; the parish of London, Christchurch, though contiguous to the borough, is in the county of Surrey.\n\nThe principal church in Southwark is that of St Saviour, which was formerly a priory of regular canons. Being dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and situated near the bank of the Thames, it was called St Mary Over Rea, or Overy, by which appellation it is commonly known. This church is built in the manner of a cathedral, with three aisles from east to west, and a cross aisle. It is reckoned the largest parish church in England, the three aisles first mentioned measuring 269 feet in length, and the cross aisle 109 feet. The height within is 47 feet, and it has a tower with four spires 150 feet high.\n\nNot far from St George's church stood the magnificent palace of Charles Brandon duke of Suffolk, the beloved favourite of Henry VIII. After his death, in 1545, it came into the king's hands, who established here a royal mint. At that time was called Southwark Place, and in great measure preserved its dignity. Edward VI., once dined in it. His sister and successor presented it to Heath archbishop of York, as an inn or residence for him and his successors whenever they repaired to London. As to the Mint, it became a sanctuary for insolvent debtors; but at length becoming the pest of the neighbourhood, by giving shelter to villains of every species, that awakened the attention of parliament; which by the statutes 8 and 9 Will. III., 9 George I., and 11 George I., entirely took away its abusive privileges.\n\nIn the parish of Christchurch, near the water on Ancient Bankside, stood Paris-garden, one of the ancient play-places of diverses of our metropolis. Ben Jonson is reproached by one Decker, an envious critic, with his ill success on the stage, and in particular with having performed the part of Zuliman at Paris-garden. It seems to have been much frequented on Sundays. This profession (Mr Pennant observes) was at length fully punished by the dire accident which befell the spectators in 1582, when the scaffolding suddenly fell, and multitudes of people were killed or miserably maimed. The omen seems to have been accepted; for in the next century the manor of Paris-garden was erected into a parish, and a church founded under the name of Christ's.\n\nBeyond this place of amusement were the Bear-garden and place for baiting of bulls, the Britishe circl; \"Herein (says Stow) were kept beares, bulls, and other beasts to be bayted; as also martives in several kennels nourished to bayt them. These beares and other beasts are there kept in plots of ground scaffolded about for the beholders to stand safe.\" This was then an amusement for persons of the first rank: our great, if not good, Elizabeth caused the French ambassadors to be carried to this theatre, to divert them with these bloody spectacles.\n\nNot far from these scenes of cruel pastime was the The Stews, Bordello.\n\n(g) In 1377 this prison was broken open by a mob of sailors, who murdered a gentleman confined in it for killing one of their comrades, and who had been pardoned by the court. It was again broken open by Wat Tyler and his followers in 1381. It escaped in the infamous riots of 1780, while the King's Bench, the Borough Prison, and the Clink Prison, were nearly at the same instant sacrificed to their fury.\nLondon. Bordello or Steus, permitted and openly licensed by government, under certain laws or regulations. They were farmed out. Even a lord mayor did not disdain to own them; but rented them to the Froes, that is, \"the hawsds,\" of Flanders. Among other singular regulations, no stewardholder was to admit married women; nor were they to keep open their houses on Sundays; nor were they to admit any women who had on them the perilous infirmity of burning. These infamous houses were very properly suppressed in the reign of Henry VIII.\n\nThe bishop of Winchester had formerly a palace here with a park (the same that is now called Southwark-park), which is since converted into warehouses and tenements, held by lease from the bishops of that fee.\n\nBesides several almshouses, there are here St Thomas's Hospital and Guy's Hospitals, two of the noblest endowments in England. The former was first erected in 1215 by Peter de Rupibus bishop of Winchester, who endowed it with land to the amount of £343.1.a.year; from which time it was held of the abbots of Bermondsey, one of whom in 1428 granted a right to the master of the hospital to hold all the lands it was then in possession of belonging to the said abbot and convent, the whole revenue of which did not exceed £661.17s.6d. per annum. In the year 1551, after the citizens of London had purchased of Edward VI. the manor of Southwark and its appurtenances, of which this hospital was a part, they expended £1100. in repairing and enlarging the edifice, and immediately received into it 260 patients; upon which the king in 1553 incorporated this hospital with those of Christ-church and Bridewell in the city of London. The building being much decayed, three beautiful squares adorned with colonnades were erected by voluntary subscription in 1693, to which in 1732 the governors added a magnificent building, consisting of several wards with proper offices. The annual disbursements of this hospital have for many years amounted to £8000l. The house is divided into 19 wards, and is said to contain 474 beds.\n\nAdjoining to St Thomas's stand Guy's Hospital, perhaps the most extensive charitable foundation that ever was established by one man in private life. The founder of this hospital was Thomas Guy, a bookseller in Lombard-street, London, who lived to see the edifice roofed in; and at his death, in 1724, left £28,292l. 16s. including the expense of the building, to finish and endow it. This hospital consists of two capacious squares, containing 12 wards and 435 beds. It was incorporated by charter from parliament, and the first governors were appointed in 1725.\n\nIn St George's Fields, westward of the King's Bench prison, is the Magdalen Hospital for the reception of penitent prostitutes; a little farther is situated the Asylum for orphan girls; and not far distant is the Westminster Living-in Hospital: Institutions, of which the following feeling and animated account is given by Mr Pennant.\n\n\"The Asylum is an institution of a most heavenly nature, calculated to save from perdition of soul and body the brighter part of the creation; such on whom Providence hath bestowed angelic faces and elegant forms, designed as blessings to mankind, but too often debased to the vilest uses. The hazard that these innocents constantly are liable to from a thousand temptations, from poverty, from death of parents, from the diabolical procures, and often from the stupidous wickedness of parents themselves, who have been known to sell their beauteous girls for the purpose of prostitution, induced a worthy band to found in the year 1758 the Asylum or House of Refuge. Long may it flourish, and eternal be the reward of those into whose minds so amiable a conception entered!\n\n\"To afford means of salvation to those unhappy beings who had the ill fortune to lose the benefits of this divine institution, the Magdalen Hospital was instituted for the reception of the penitent prostitutes. To save from vice, is one great merit. To reclaim and restore to the dignity of honest rank in life, is certainly not less meritorious. The joy at the return of one sinner to repentance is esteemed by the highest authority worthy of the heavenly host. That ecstasy, I trust, this institution has often occasioned. Since its foundation in the same year with the former, to December 25, 1756, not fewer than 2471 have been admitted. Of these (it is not to be wondered that long and evil habits are often incurable) 300 have been discharged, uneasy under constraint; 45 proved lunatics, and afflicted with incurable fits; 60 have died; 52 never returned from hospitals they were sent to; 338 discharged for faults and irregularities. How to be dreaded is the entrance into the bounds of vice, since the retreat from its paths is so difficult! Finally, 1608 prodigals have been returned to their rejoicing parents; or placed in reputable services, or to honest trades, banes to idleness and securities against a future relapse.\" Into this charity, every woman who has been seduced (and is not pregnant or diseased), whether recommended or not, may apply for admission to the committee, who meet for that purpose on the first Tuesday in every month.\n\nAkin to those charities is that of the Living-in Hospital: which is not intended merely for the reception of the honest matron who can deposit her burden with the confidencials of lawful love; but also for the unhappy wretches whom some villain in the unguarded moment has seduced, and then left a prey to the defilement of friends, to poverty, want, and guilt.—Let such be driven to despair by such complicated misery, and be tempted to destroy themselves and murder their infants,' here was founded in 1765 this humane preventive, the Westminster New Living-in Hospital, in which every assistance and accommodation requisite in such situations are provided in the most attentive and liberal manner. To obviate all objection to its being an encouragement to vice, no one is taken in a second time; but this most excellent charity is open to the worthy distressed matron as often as necessity requires. None are rejected who have friends to recommend. And of both descriptions upwards of 4000 have experienced its salutary effect.\"\n\nSt George's Fields are now almost covered with new erected buildings, from the ditch at the end of Great Fields, Surry-street, or Burrow's Buildings, to the Fishmongers almshouses, in one direction; and from the Marshall's prison to the Dog and Duck, in the other direction; with several irregular indentations in its circumference: And where the principal roads meet, an obelisk has been erected, pointing out the distance it stands\nfrom different parts of London, Westminster, and Blackfriars bridges. Among the buildings which serve to embellish and improve this entrance to London, Chatham-square and Bridge-street-Blackfriars may be particularly specified.\n\nAt Lambeth, the archbishops of Canterbury have had a palace. According to Mr Pennant, it was in the earlier times a manor, possibly a royal one; for the great Hardiknut died here in 1042, in the midst of the jollity of a wedding dinner; and here, without any formality, the usurper Harold is said to have snatched the crown and placed it on his own head. At that period it was part of the estate of Goda, wife to Walter earl of Mantes, and Euilace earl of Boulogne; who presented it to the church of Rochester, but referred to herelf the patronage of the church. It became in 1197 the property of the see of Canterbury, by exchange transferred between Glanville bishop of Rochester and the archbishop Hubert Walter. The building was improved by Langton the successor of Walter; but it was afterwards neglected and became ruinous. \"No pious zeal (says Mr Pennant) restored the place, but the madness of pietistic pride. Boniface, a wrathful and turbulent primate, elected in 1244, took it into his head to become a visitor of the priory of St Bartholomew, to which he had no right. The monks met him with reverential respect, but assured him the office did not belong to the bishop. The meek prelate rushed on the sub-prior, knocked him down, kicked, beat, and buffeted him, tore the cope off his back, and stamped on it like one possessed, while his attendants paid the same compliments to all the poor monks. The people enraged at his unpriestly conduct would have torn him to pieces; when he retired to Lambeth, and, by way of expiation, rebuilt it with great magnificence. At a subsequent period it was very highly improved by the munificent Henry Chicheley, who enjoyed the primacy from 1414 to 1443. I lament to find worthy a man to have been the founder of a building so reproachful to his memory as the Lollards tower, at the expense of near 280l. Neither Protestants or Catholics should omit visiting this tower, the cruel prison of the unhappy followers of Wickliffe. The vast staples and rings to which they were chained before they were brought to the stake, ought to make Protestants blest the hour which freed them from so bloody a religion.\" During the civil wars of the last century, this palace suffered greatly; but at the Restoration, the whole was repaired by Archbishop Juxton.\n\nThe parish church of Lambeth (H), which is at a small distance from the palace, has a plain tower; and the architecture is of the Gothic of the time of Edward IV. It has very little remarkable in it, except the figure of a pedlar and his dog, painted in one of the windows; and tradition says, that the parish was obliged to this man for the bequest of a piece of land, which bears the name of the Pedlar's Acre. In the churchyard is the tomb of old Tradecant. Both father and son were great travellers; and the former is supposed to have visited Russia and most parts of Europe, Turkey, Greece, many of the eastern countries, Egypt, and Barbary; out of which he introduced multitudes of plants and flowers, unknown before in our gardens. The monument is an altar tomb; embellished with emblematical sculptures; and bearing the following inscription, which is both singular and historical:\n\nKnow, stranger, ere thou pas, beneath this stone\nLye John Tradecant, grand sire, father, son;\nThe last dy'd in his spring; the other two\nLiv'd till they had travell'd Art and Nature through,\nAs by their choice collections may appear,\nOf what is rare, in land, in sea, in air;\nWhilst they (as Homer's Iliad in a nut)\nA world of wonders in one closet shut:\nThese famous Antiquarians, that had been\nBoth gardeners to the Rose and Lily Queen,\nTransplanted now themselves, sleep here; and when\nAngels shall with their trumpets waken men,\nAnd fire shall purge the world, these hence shall rise,\nAnd change this garden for a paradise.\n\nFrom Lambeth, eastward along the river side, Lambeth was once a long tract of dreary marsh, and still Marsh in parts called Lambeth Marsh; about the year 1560, there was not a house on it from Lambeth palace as far as Southwark. In a street called Nar-Great Marrow-wall (from one of the ancient embankments) is a manufactory. Mrs Conde's noted manufactory of artificial stone (I): And at a small distance, Messrs Beaufoy's (K) great work\n\n(H) In describing this church, Mr Pennant takes occasion to mention the sad example of fallen majesty in the person of Mary d'Este, the unhappy queen of James II.; who, flying with her infant prince from the ruin impending over their house, after crossing the Thames from the abdicated Whitehall, took shelter beneath the ancient walls of this church a whole hour, from the rain of the inclement night of December 6, 1688. Here she waited with aggravated misery, till a common coach, procured from the next inn, arrived, and conveyed her to Gravesend, from whence she sailed, and bade an eternal adieu to these kingdoms.\n\n(I) Her repository consists of several very large rooms filled with every ornament, which can be used in architecture. The statue, the vase, the urn, the rich chimney pieces, and in a few words, everything which could be produced out of natural stone or marble by the most elegant chisel, is here to be obtained at an easy rate.\n\n(K) \"Where (says Mr Pennant) the foreign wines are most admirably mimicked. Such is the prodigality and luxury of the age, that the demand for many sorts exceeds in a great degree the produce of the native vineyards. We have skilful fabricators, who kindly supply our wants. It has been estimated, that half of the port, and five-sixths of the white wines consumed in our capital, have been the produce of our home wine presses. The product of duty to the state from a single house was in one year, from July 5, 1785 to July 5, 1786, not less than 7363l. 8s. 8½d. The genial banks of the Thames opposite to our capital, yield almost every species of white wine; and, by a wondrous magic, Messrs Beaufoy pour forth the materials for the rich Frontiniac,\nLondon work for making wines, and that for making vinegar (1).\n\nThis ground, so profitable to the proprietors, and so productive of revenue to the state, was within memory the scene of loud distillation. Here stood Cuper's garden, noted for its fireworks, and the great resort of the profligate of both sexes. This place was ornamented with several of the mutilated statues belonging to Thomas earl of Arundel, which had been for that purpose begged from his lordship by one Boyder Cuper, a gardener in the family. The great timber yards beneath which these antiquities were found, are very well worthy of a visit. One would fear that the forests of Norway and the Baltic would be exhausted, to supply the wants of our overgrown capital, were we not assured that the resources will successively be increased equal to the demand of succeeding ages.—In this parish are also vast distilleries, formerly the property of Sir Joseph Mawhey; where are seldom less than 2000 hogs, which are fed entirely on grains.\n\nIII. City and Liberties of Westminster. The city of Westminster derives its name from a minster, or abbey, and welf, on account of its situation with respect to St Paul's cathedral, which was formerly called Eastminster. In ancient times this district stood upwards of a mile from the city of London, and contained only two parishes, which were those of St Margaret and St John, with two chapels of ease; but at present it has seven other parochial churches, viz. St Clement's Danes, St Paul's Covent garden, St Mary's le Strand, St Martin's in the Fields, St Anne's, St James's, and St George's Hanover-square.\n\nWestminster was anciently called Thorny Island, from its having been covered with thorn bushes, and encompassed by a branch of the Thames, which is said to have run through the ground now called St James's Park, from west to east, and to have rejoined the river at Whitehall.\n\nTill the general dissolution of religious houses, Westminster was subject to the arbitrary rule of its abbot and monks; but in 1541, upon the surrender of William Benson the last abbot, Henry VIII. not only turned it into an honour, but created it the see of a bishop, and appointed for a diocese the whole county of Middlesex, except Fulham, which belonged to the bishop of London. This bishopric, however, soon after its institution, was dissolved by Edward VI.\n\nThe city of Westminster is governed by a high steward, an office of great dignity, who is usually one of the first peers in the realm; and is chosen for life by the dean and chapter of the collegiate church of St Peter. There is also a deputy steward and a high bailiff, who also hold their offices for life; being nominated by the dean and chapter, and confirmed by the high steward.\n\nThe dean and chapter are invested with an ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction within the liberties of Westminster, St Martin's le Grand, near Cheapside, in the city of London, and some towns in Essex, which are exempted from the jurisdiction of the bishop of London and the archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nSt Margaret's Church was founded by Edward the Confessor, since which time it has been frequently rebuilt. In the east end of this church is a window curiously painted, with the history of the crucifixion, and with the figures of several apostles and saints finely executed. It formerly belonged to a private chapel at Copt-hall, near Epping in Essex, and was purchased by the officers of this parish, some years ago for 400 guineas. In this church the house of commons attends divine service on state holidays.\n\nThe church of St John the Evangelist was erected in 1728, and having sunk considerably whilst it was building, occasioned an alteration of the plan. On the north and south sides are magnificent porticoes, supported by vast stone pillars, as is also the roof of the church; at each of the four corners is a beautiful stone tower and pinnacle, which were added with the view of making the whole structure sink equally. The parts of this building are held together by iron bars, which run across even the aisles.\n\nThe most remarkable structure in Westminster is the Westminster-abbey-church of St Peter. On its site stood once after Abbey, temple of Apollo, which according to tradition was thrown down by an earthquake in the time of Antoninus Pius; and from the ruins of which Sebert king of the West Saxons raised a Christian church, which was ruined by the Danes. It was repaired by Edward the Confessor, and given to a few monks; and this spot he chose for his burial-place. Henry III. 160 years after, took down this fabric of Edward's, and erected a new church, which was 50 years in building. It suffered much by fire in 1274, but was repaired by Edward I., Edward II. and the abbots. In 1700 this church being much decayed, the parliament granted money for repairing it, and has frequently repeated the bounty since that time. The form of the abbey is that of a long croft:\n\nFrontiniac, to the more elegant tables; the Madeira, the Calcavella, and the Lisbon, into every part of the kingdom.\"\n\n(1) \"There is a magnificence of business (our author remarks) in this ocean of sweets and sours that cannot fail exciting the greatest admiration; whether we consider the number of vessels or their size. The boasted tun at Heidelberg does not surpass them. On first entering the yard, two rise before you, covered at the top with a thatched dome; between them is a circular turret, including a winding staircase, which brings you to their summits, which are above 24 feet in diameter. One of these conservatories is full of sweet wine, and contains 58,199 gallons, or 181 barrels of Winchester measure. Its superb allocato is full of vinegar, to the amount of 56,799 gallons, or 1774 barrels of the same standard as the former. The famous German vessel yields even to the last by the quantity of 40 barrels.—Besides these, is an avenue of lesser vessels, which hold from 32,500 to 16,974 gallons each. After quitting this Brobdignazian scene, we pass to the acres covered with common barrels: we cannot diminish our ideas so suddenly, but at first we imagine we could quaff them off as easily as Gulliver did the little hogheads of the kingdom of Lilliput.\"\nLondon. crofs: its greatest length is 489 feet, and the breadth of the west front 66 feet; the length of the crofs aisle is 189 feet, and the height of the roof 92 feet. At the west end are two towers: the nave and crofs aisle are supported by 50 slender pillars of Suffex marble, exclusive of pilasters. In the upper and lower ranges there are 94 windows, all which, with the arches, roofs, and doors, are in the Gothic taste. The inside of this church is much better executed than the outside: and the perspective is good, particularly that of the grand aisle. The choir, from which there is an ascent by several steps to a fine altar-piece, is paved with black and white marble; having 28 stalls on the north, the same number on the south, and eight at the west end. The altar is made of a beautiful piece of marble, the gift of Queen Anne, enclosed by a curious balustrade, and upon a pavement of porphyry, jasper, Lydian, and serpentine stones, laid in the mosaic style, at the expense of Abbot Ware, A.D. 1272; and is said to be one of the most beautiful of its kind in the world.\n\nOn each side of this altar a door opens into St Edward's chapel; round which are 10 other chapels, ranging from the north to the south crofs aisles, and are dedicated, 1. To St Andrew. 2. To St Michael. 3. To St John Evangelist. 4. Ilip's chapel. 5. To St John Baptist. 6. To St Paul. 7. Henry V.'s chapel. 8. To St Nicholas. 9. To St Edmund. 10. To St Benedict.\n\nIn St Edward's chapel are still to be seen the remains of his throne; which, though now in obscurity, and robbed of all its riches and luster, was once esteemed the glory of England, so far as art and riches could make it. Here are the tombs of King Edward I. and several other kings and queens of England; and here also is shown the famous chair in which the kings of Scotland used to be crowned at Scone. Henry V.'s chapel is divided from St Edward's by an iron screen, on each side of which are statues as big as life.—St Andrew's chapel, which is next the north crofs, and the others which surround the choir, are crowded with the monuments of noble personages, worthy the attention of the curious.—At the corner of St Benedict's chapel, an iron gate opens into the south crofs aisle; which from the number of monuments erected therein to celebrated English poets, has obtained the name of the Poets corner: though here we find a most magnificent monument erected at the south end in memory of the late John duke of Argyle and Greenwich; another to William Camden the antiquarian; and others to the celebrated divine Dr Isaac Barrow, to Thomas Parr who died at the age of 152 years, &c.—The south aisle is adorned with 19 curious monuments of the pious, the brave, and the learned; and turning northward from the west door, we view a great number more.\n\nOn the east of the abbey, and which, though separate from the other chapels in the choir, seems to be one and the same building with the abbey, stands the chapel of King Henry VII., which that king founded in the year 1502, and was at that time styled the wonder of the world, and is now one of the most expensive remains of the ancient English taste and magnificence. There is no looking upon it without admiration: it conveys an idea of the fine taste of Gothic architecture in that age; and the inside is so noble, majestic, and of such curious workmanship, that it would take a volume to describe each part with justice and propriety.\n\nIts original intention was to be a dormitory for the royal blood: and so far the will of the founder has been observed, that none have been interred therein but such as have traced their descent from ancient kings. The tomb of King Henry VII. is most magnificent, enclosed with a screen of cast brass, most admirably designed, and as well executed. Within the rails are the figures of that king and his royal consort, in their robes of state, on a tomb of black marble; and at the head of this tomb lie the remains of Edward VI. In different parts of this chapel are the monuments of Lewis Stuart duke of Richmond, George Villars duke of Buckingham, John Sheffield duke of Buckingham, Charles Montague marquis of Halifax, Edward V. and his brother Richard; the vault of James I. and his queen Anne and daughter Mary, on which is a small tomb adorned with the figure of a child; a lofty monument of Queen Elizabeth, and another of Mary queen of Scots; the monuments for Margaret Douglas daughter of Margaret queen of Scots, Margaret countess of Richmond mother to Henry VII. the vault of King Charles II. and William III. Queen Mary his consort, Queen Anne, and Prince George. Over these royal personages are their effigies (except that of Prince George) in wainscot prelacies, made of wax to resemble life, and dressed in their coronation robes. And at the corner of the great east window, in another wainscot press, stands the effigy of Mary duchess of Richmond, daughter to James duke of Richmond and Lenox, dressed in the very robes she wore at the coronation of Queen Anne. On leaving the aisle, you are shown another press, containing the effigy of General Monk, who, on account of his loyalty, and the part he took in the restoration of King Charles II. had a vault appropriated to him and his family amongst the royal blood.\n\nIn a fine vault under Henry the VII.'s chapel, is the burying place of the present royal family, erected by his late majesty King George II. Adjoining to the abbey are the cloisters, built in a quadrangular form, with piazzas towards the court, where several of the prebendaries have their houses.\n\nNear the abbey church is the King's school, usually called Westminster school. It was originally founded after School. 1072, and a second time by Queen Elizabeth in 1560, whence it is sometimes called the Queen's College; and is at present one of the greatest schools in the kingdom. The learned antiquary Mr Camden was once master of it, and Ben Jonson one of his scholars. Dr Buxby, who was master upwards of 50 years, greatly contributed to keep up its reputation, formed its museum, and improved both the master's and his prebendal house.—This school, instead of one master and one usher as at first, has now an upper and under master, and five others, who have about 400 youths under their tuition. A plan was set on foot when the present archbishop of York was master, for building a college for the use of the students, but this did not succeed.\n\nOn the north-east side of the abbey is an old Go-Westminster building called Westminster-hall, first built by William Rufus as an addition to a royal palace, and afterwards\nLondon. wards rebuilt by Richard II. in the year 1397. It is reckoned one of the largest rooms in Europe, being 200 feet long, 70 broad, and 90 high, supported only by buttresses. The roof is of timber, and was some years ago slated, the old covering of lead being reckoned too heavy. It is paved with stone. In this spacious room the kings of England have generally held their coronation and other solemn feasts; and it is used for the trial of peers. Since the reign of Henry III. the three great courts of Chancery, King's Bench, and Common Pleas, have been held in separate apartments of this hall; and the court of Exchequer above stairs.\n\nAdjoining to the south-east angle of Westminster-hall is a building formerly called St Stephen's Chapel, from its having been dedicated to that saint. It was founded by King Stephen; and in 1347 was rebuilt by King Edward III., who converted it to a collegiate church; but since it was surrendered to Edward VI., it has been used for the assembly of the representatives of the commons of England, and is now generally called the House of Commons. The benches, which ascend behind one another as in a theatre, are covered with green cloth; the floor is matted; and round the room are wainscot galleries, supported by cantilevers adorned with carved work, in which strangers are often permitted to sit and hear the debates.\n\nOn the south side of the hall is the House of Lords, so called from being the place where the peers of Great Britain assemble in parliament. It is an oblong room, not quite so large as the house of commons; and is hung with fine old tapestry, representing the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. The design was drawn by Cornelius Vroom, and the tapestry executed by Francis Spiering. It was not put up till the year 1650, two years after the extinction of monarchy, when the house of lords was used as a committee-room for the house of commons. The heads of the naval heroes who commanded on the glorious day form a matchless border round the work, animating posterity to emulate their illustrious example. Here is a throne for the king, with seats on the right and left for such peers of the realm as are of the blood royal. Before the throne are three broad seats; on the first of which, next the throne, sits the lord chancellor, or keeper of the great seal, who is speaker of the house of peers; and on the other two sit the judges, the master of the rolls, or the masters in chancery, who attend occasionally to give their opinions on points of law. The two archbishops sit at some distance from the throne on the right hand, and the other bishops in a row under them. All the benches are covered with red cloth stuffed with wool. Here likewise, by order of the house, a gallery for strangers has been erected.\n\nAdjoining to the house of lords is the Prince's Chamber, where the king is robed when he comes to the parliament. On the other side is the Painted Chamber, which is said to have been Edward the Confessor's bedchamber, and the room in which the parliaments were anciently opened. Here conferences are often held between the two houses, or their committees. Contiguous to these is an apartment called the Court of Requests, where such as have business in either house may attend.\n\nNear these buildings is a bridge over the Thames, called Westminster Bridge, accounted one of the most complete and elegant structures of the kind in the world. It is built entirely of stone, and extends over the river at a place where it is 123 feet broad: which is above 380 feet broader than at London bridge. On each side is a fine balustrade of stone, with places of shelter from the rain. The width of the bridge is 44 feet, having on each side a fine footway for passengers. It consists of 14 piers, and 13 large and two small arches, all semicircular, that in the centre being 76 feet wide, and the rest decreasing four feet each from the other, so that the two least arches of the 13 great ones are each 52 feet. It is computed that the value of 40,000l. in stone and other materials is always under water. This magnificent structure was begun in 1739, and finished in 1750, at the expense of 389,000l., defrayed by the parliament. It was built after the design of M. Labrye, an ingenious architect, a native of France.\n\nOn the bank of the Thames, at the east confines of Whitehall, St Margaret's parish, was a palace called Whitehall, originally built by Hubert de Burgh earl of Kent, before the middle of the 13th century. It afterwards devolved to the archbishop of York, whence it received the name of York Place, and continued to be the city residence of the archbishops till it was purchased by Henry VIII. of Cardinal Wolsey in 1530. At this period it became the residence of the court; but in 1697 was destroyed by accidental fire, all except the Banqueting-house, which had been added to the palace of Whitehall by James I., according to a design of Inigo Jones. This is an elegant and magnificent structure of hewn stone, adorned with an upper and lower range of pillars, of the Ionic and Composite orders; the capitals are enriched with fruit and foliages, and between the columns of the windows. The roof is covered with lead, and surrounded with a balustrade. The building chiefly consists of one room of an oblong form 40 feet high, and a proportionable length and breadth. The ceiling is painted by the celebrated Sir Peter Paul Rubens. It is now used only as a chapel-royal, and the other part of the house is occupied with state offices.\n\nOpposite to the Banqueting-house stands the Horse Guards, so called from being the station where that part of his majesty's troops usually do duty. It is a strong building, of hewn stone, consisting of a centre and two wings. In the former is an arched passage into St James's Park; and over it, in the middle, rises a cupola. In a part of the building is the War Office. Near the Horse-guards is the Treasury; a large building, which fronts the Parade in St James's park; and where the board of treasury is kept.\n\nEastward of the Horse Guards is the Admiralty Office, a large pile, built with brick and stone. The front towards Whitehall has two deep wings, and a lofty portico supported by four large stone pillars. A piazza, consisting of beautiful columns, runs almost from one end to the other. The wall before the court has been lately built in an elegant manner, and each side of the gate is ornamented with naval emblems. Besides a hall, and other public apartments, here are spacious houses for seven commissioners of the admiralty. At a little distance from the Admiralty, where three capital...\ncapital streets terminate, is a large opening called Charing-cross, from one of the crosses which King Edward I. caused to be erected in memory of his queen Eleanor, and Charing the name of a village in which it was built. The cross remained till the civil wars in the reign of Charles I., when it was destroyed by the fanatics, as a monument of popish superstition; but after the Restoration, an equestrian statue of Charles I. was set up in its stead. This, which is of brass, and finely executed, continues to be an ornament to the place. It was made in 1633, at the expense of the Howard-Arundel family. The parliament sold it to a brazier in Holborn, with strict orders to break it to pieces; but he concealed it under ground till the Restoration, when it was set up in 1678.\n\nAt the west end of the Mall, in St James's park, which begins near Charing-cross, stands the Queen's Palace. It was originally known by the name of Arlington House; but being purchased by the late duke of Buckingham's father, who rebuilt it from the ground in 1703, it was called Buckingham House, till the year 1762, when it was purchased by his majesty for a royal residence. It is built of brick and stone, having in the front two ranges of pilasters of the Corinthian and Tuscan orders. It has a spacious court yard, enclosed with iron rails, fronting St James's park, with offices on each side, with two pavilions, separated from the mansion house by colonnades of the Tuscan, Doric, and Ionic orders. His majesty has here built a fine library, in an octagonal form, besides several other additions.\n\nEastwards of the queen's palace stands St James's, an old building, which, till the former was purchased by the crown, had been the town residence of the royal family since the burning of Whitehall in 1697. This palace was built by Henry VIII., and obtained its name from an hospital which formerly stood on the spot. It is an irregular building, of a mean appearance without, but contains several magnificent apartments. Here the court and levees are still kept, and most of the persons belonging to the household have their residence. The chapel of the hospital was converted to the use of the royal family, as it now remains, and is a royal peculiar, exempted from all episcopal jurisdiction. When this palace was built, it abutted in the south-west upon an uncultivated swampy tract of ground, which the king enclosed and converted into a park, called from the palace St James's park. He also laid it out into walks, and collected the water into one body. It was afterwards much enlarged and improved by King Charles II., who planted it with lime trees, and formed a beautiful vista, near half a mile in length, called the Mall, from its being adapted to a play at bowls distinguished by that name. He also formed the water into a canal 100 feet broad and 280 feet long; and furnished the park with a decoy, and other ponds for water-fowl; but these have lately been destroyed, on account of the unwholesome vapours which they excited.\n\nIn a line with St James's palace, on the east side, is Marlborough-house, which belongs to the duke of Marlborough, and is a large brick edifice, ornamented with stone.\n\nEastward from Charing-cross, runs that fine street the Strand, which terminates at Temple-bar. In the year 1353 the whole of it was an open highway, with London gardens to the water-side. In that year it was so ruinous, that Edward III. by an ordinance directed a tax to be raised upon wool, leather, wine, and goods carried to the staple at Westminster, from Temple-bar to Westminster abbey, for the repair of the road; and that all owners of houses adjacent to the highway should repair as much as lay before their doors. Before the above period, it entirely cut off Westminster from London; nothing intervened except the scattered houses, and a village which afterwards gave name to the whole; and St Martin's flood literally in the fields. But about the year 1562 a street was formed, loosely built; for all the houses on the south side had great gardens to the river, were called by their owners names, and in after-times gave name to the several streets that succeeded them, pointing down to the Thames; each of them had stairs for the convenience of taking boat, of which many to this day bear the names of the houses. As the court was for centuries either at the palace of Westminster or Whitehall, a boat was the customary conveyance of the great to the presence of their sovereign. The north side was a mere line of houses from Charing-cross to Temple-bar; all beyond was country. The gardens which occupied part of the site of Covent-garden were bounded by fields, and St Giles's was a distant country village. Our capital found itself secure in the vigorous government of Queen Elizabeth, that, by the year 1600, most considerable additions were made to the north of the long line of street just described. St Martin's-lane was built on both sides. St Giles's church was still insulated; but Broad-street and Holborn were completely formed into streets with houses all the way to Snow-hill. Covent-garden and Lincoln's-inn-fields were built, but in an irregular manner. Drury-lane, Clare-street, and Long-acre, arose in the same period.\n\nAlmost contiguous to Charing-cross, and upon the North-south side of the Strand, is that noble palace called Northumberland House, which stands on the site of the hospital of St Mary Runcieval. Henry VIII. granted it to Sir Thomas Caverden. It was afterwards transferred to Henry Howard earl of Northampton; who, in the time of James I., built here a house, and called it after his own name. He left it to his kinsman the earl of Suffolk, lord treasurer; and by the marriage of Algernon Percy earl of Northumberland, with Elizabeth daughter of Theophilus earl of Suffolk, it passed into the house of the present noble owner. The greater part of the house was built by Bernard Jenyns, an architect in the reign of James I. The front next the street was begun by Algernon in 1748, and finished by the present duke, who married his daughter. Two additional wings to the front next the Thames, and a variety of other improvements both in building and furniture, have contributed to render this house the largest and most magnificent in London. It contains a gallery of 106 feet long by 26 wide, most superbly furnished.\n\nA short way eastward, on the same side, stood Durham Yard, which took its name from a palace built originally by the illustrious Thomas de Hatfield, elected bishop of Durham in 1345; designed by him for the town residence of him and his successors. At this place,\nLondon, in 1540, was held a most magnificent feast, given by the challengers of England, who had caused to be proclaimed, in France, Flanders, Scotland, and Spain, a great and triumphant jousting to be held at Westminster, for all comers that would undertake them. But both the challengers and defendants were English. After the gallant sports of each day, the challengers rode into this Durham-house where they kept open household, and feasted the king and queen (Anne of Cleves) with her ladies, and all the court. In the reign of Edward VI. the Mint was established in this house, under the management of Sir William Sherrington, and the influence of the aspiring Thomas Seymour, lord admiral. Durham-house was reckoned one of the royal palaces belonging to Queen Elizabeth; who gave the use of it to the great Sir Walter Raleigh.\n\nDurham-yard is now filled with a most magnificent mass of building, called the Adelphi, in honour of two brothers, the ingenious Adams, its architects. Besides its fine lodgings, it is celebrated for its enchanting prospect, the utility of its wharfs, and its subterraneous apartments answering a variety of purposes of general benefit.\n\nFarther on stand the ruins of the Savoy. Henry III. had granted to Peter of Savoy, uncle to his queen Eleanor, daughter of Beringer of Provence, all the houses upon the Thames where this building now stands, to hold to him and his heirs, yielding yearly at the Exchequer three barbed arrows for all services. This prince founded the Savoy, and bestowed it on the foreign hospital of Montjoy. Queen Eleanor purchased it, and bestowed it on her son Edmund earl of Lancaster. It was rebuilt in a most magnificent manner by his son Henry. It was made the place of confinement of John king of France in 1356, after he was taken prisoner at the battle of Poitiers. In 1381 it was entirely destroyed by Wat Tyler, out of spleen to the great owner John of Gaunt. Henry VII. began to rebuild it, with a design of forming it into an hospital for a hundred distrefted people, and Henry VIII. completed the design. The revenues, at the suppression by Edward VI., amounted to above 500l. a-year. Queen Mary restored it; and her maids of honour, with exemplary piety, furnished it with all necessaries. It was again turretted by Queen Elizabeth; and at present part serves as lodgings for private people, for barracks, and a scandalous infectious prison for the soldiery and for transport convicts.\n\nA little to the eastward stood Somerset House, a palace built by Somerset the protector in the time of Edward VI.; and to make way for which he demolished a great number of buildings without making any recompense to the owners. Part of the church of St John of Jerusalem and the Tower were blown up for the sake of the materials; and the cloisters on the north side of St Paul's, with the channel-house and chapel, underwent the same fate; the tombs being destroyed, and the bones thrown into Finchley fields. This happened in 1549; but it is probable that he did not live to inhabit the palace he built, as he was executed in the year 1552. After his death the palace fell to the crown; and it became an occasional place of residence, first to Queen Elizabeth, and afterwards to Catherine queen to King Charles II. It was built in a style of architecture compounded of the Grecian and Gothic; London and the back, front, and water gate, were done from a design of Inigo Jones, about the year 1623. A chapel was begun the same year by that architect, and finished some time after. The whole of this structure was demolished in 1775, in consequence of an act of parliament; and a most magnificent edifice, from a design by Sir William Chambers, has been erected for the accommodation of all the public offices—those of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, the Admiralty, the War, and the Excise, excepted. The Royal Society, and the Society of Antiquarians, hold their meetings here, in apartments which have been allotted to them by royal munificence; and here also are annually exhibited the works of the British painters and sculptors. The terrace on the south side is a walk bounded by the Thames, and unparalleled for grandeur and beauty of view.\n\nThe church of St Martin is distinguished by the name of St Martin's in the Fields, from its situation, which was formerly a field, with only a few scattered houses. The church being decayed, was rebuilt by Henry VIII. and again by James I. but not being large enough to accommodate the inhabitants of the parish, it was augmented in 1607, at the charge of Prince Henry, eldest son of James I. and several of the nobility. After many expensive reparations, however, it was entirely taken down in 1720, and a new church begun, which was finished in 1726. This is an elegant edifice, built of stone. On the west front is a noble portico of Corinthian columns, supporting a pediment, in which are represented the royal arms in bas relief. The ascent to the portico is by a flight of very long steps. The length of this church is about 140 feet, the breadth 60, and height 45. It has a fine arched roof sustained by stone columns of the Corinthian order. The steeple has a beautiful spire, and one of the best rings of bells in London.\n\nSt James's Church was built in the reign of Charles II. at the expense of Henry earl of St Albans's, and other neighbouring inhabitants. The building is of brick and stone, about 85 feet long, 60 broad, and 45 feet high, with a handsome steeple 150 feet in height.\n\nSt George's Church, near Hanover-square, is a beautiful structure. This was one of the fifty new churches erected within the reign of Queen Anne. The ground for the edifice was given by the late Lieutenant-general Stewart, who also left 4000l. to the parish, towards erecting and endowing a charity school; which, by additional benefactions and subscriptions, is become very considerable.\n\nThe greater part of the parish of St Paul's Covent-garden, was anciently a garden, belonging to the abbot and convent of Westminster, and was then called Convent-garden, a name corrupted into Covent, and more generally Common-garden. In 1552, Edward VI. Covent gave it to the earl of Bedford, with an adjoining field, formerly called the Seven Acres, but now, being turned into a long street, called Long-acre. The church of St Paul's, Covent-garden, was built by Inigo Jones, and was esteemed one of the most simple and perfect pieces of architecture in England. It was burnt by accident a few years ago; but has since been rebuilt in a very plain style. In the area before the church, of about three\nLondon, three acres of ground, is Covent garden market, which is the best in England for herbs, fruit, and flowers. On the north, and part of the east side, is a magnificent piazza, designed by Inigo Jones.\n\nNext to the parish of St Paul, Covent-garden, is that of St Mary le Strand. This is also one of the fifty new churches built in the reign of Queen Anne, and is a handsome piece of architecture, though not very extensive. At the entrance, on the west side, is an ascent by a flight of steps, in a circular form, which leads to a similarly shaped portico of Ionic columns, covered with a dome, that is crowned with a vase. The columns are continued along the body of the church, with pilasters of the same order at the corners; and in the intercolumniations are niches handsomely ornamented. Over the dome is a pediment supported by Corinthian columns, which are also continued round the body of the structure, over those of the Ionic order. A handsome balustrade is carried round the top of the church, and adorned with vases.\n\nA little eastward from the preceding church is that of St Clement's Danes, situated likewise in the Strand. A church is said to have stood in this place since about the year 700; but the present structure was begun in 1685, designed by Sir Christopher Wren. It is built of stone, with two rows of windows, the lower plain, but the upper ornamented; and the termination is by an attic, the pilasters of which are covered with vases. On the south side is a portico, covered with a dome supported by Ionic columns; and opposite to this is another. The steeple is beautiful, and of a great height.\n\nThe church of St George, Bloomsbury, is also one of the fifty new churches erected by act of parliament. It is distinguished from all the rest by standing south and north, and by the statue of King George I. at the top of its pyramidal steeple.\n\nIn Lamb's Conduit-fields, on the north side of the town, is a large and commodious structure called the Foundling Hospital, for the reception of exposed and deserted children. This laudable charity was projected by several eminent merchants in the reign of Queen Anne; but was not carried into execution till many years afterwards, when a charter for its establishment was obtained, through the indefatigable affluence of Mr Thomas Coram, the commander of a merchant vessel, who spent the remainder of his life in promoting this design. From the time of its institution, the parliament has occasionally granted considerable sums for its support; and in some years upwards of 6000 infants have been received.\n\nNot far from hence is an Hospital for the Smallpox; and in different parts of the town there are others, either for the sick of all kinds, or those in particular circumstances. Of the latter are several Lying-in hospitals, and the Lock Hospital for female patients in the venereal disease. Of the former are St George's and Middlesex Hospitals, besides several infirmaries.\n\nGray's Inn is one of the four principal inns of court; which, though situated within the limits of the parish of St Andrew, Holborn, is yet without the liberties of the city of London. It took its name from an ancient family of the name of Gray, which formerly resided here, and in the reign of Edward III. demised it to some students in the law; but it is said to have been afterwards conveyed to the monks of Shene, near Richmond in Surrey, who leased it to the society of the Inn. It was held by this tenure till the dissolution of the monasteries, when Henry VIII. granted it to the society in fee-farm. This inn consists chiefly of two quadrangles, and has an old hall well built of timber, with a chapel in the Gothic style. Here is also a good library, and the inn is accommodated with a spacious garden.\n\nLincoln's Inn, another of the four principal inns of Lincoln's court, was originally the palace of Ralph Neville bishop of Chichester, and chancellor of England about the year 1226. It afterwards devolved to the earl of Lincoln, who converted it into a court for the students of law about the year 1310. From him it received the name of Lincoln's Inn, and consisted only of what is now called the old square, which is entered from Chancery-lane. At present this square contains, besides buildings for the lawyers, a large hall where the lord chancellor hears causes in the fittings after term. To this inn belongs likewise a fine garden, which has lately been diminished by the building of some large and commodious offices, for the use of the five clerks in the court of chancery, &c.\n\nIn the parish of St James, Clerkenwell, is an hospital called the Charter-house, which is a corruption of house, the word chartreux, a name formerly used for a convent or priory of the Carthusians, which this place formerly was. After the dissolution of monasteries it fell to the earl of Suffolk, who disposed of it to Thomas Sutton, Esq., a citizen of London, in the time of King James I. for £3,000. The purchaser intending it for an hospital, applied to the king for a patent, which he obtained in 1611, and the grant was confirmed by parliament in 1623. Mr Sutton having expended £7000 in fitting up the buildings, gave it the name of King James's Hospital, and endowed it with lands to the amount of near £4000 a-year, for the maintenance of 80 gentlemen, merchants or soldiers, who should be reduced to indigent circumstances; and 40 boys, to be instructed in classical learning. The men are provided with handsome apartments, and all the necessaries of life except clothes; instead of which each of them is allowed a gown, and 7l. a-year. Of the boys, 29 are at a proper time sent to the university, where each has an allowance of 20l. a-year for eight years. Others, who are judged more fit for trade, are put out apprentices, and the sum of 40l. is given with each of them. As a farther encouragement to the scholars, there are nine ecclesiastical prebendaries in the gift of the governors. It is also by the recommendation of the latter that all pensioners and youths are received into the hospital. They consist of 16, of which number the king is always one, and the others are generally noblemen of the first rank. To this hospital belong a master, a preacher, two schoolmasters, a physician, a registrar, a receiver, a treasurer, a steward, an auditor, and other officers; and the annual revenues of it being now increased to upwards of £6000, five men and four boys have been added to the original number.\n\nIn the parish of St Luke stands the Haberdashers' Almshouse, or Alke's Hospital, so called from having been erected by the company of haberdashers, pursuant to the will of Robert Alke, Esq.; one of their members,\nLondon, here, who left £30,000 for the building and the relief of 20 poor members of the company; besides the maintenance and education of 20 boys, sons of decayed freemen of the same company. This is a large edifice of brick and stone, 400 feet long, with a piazza in front 310 feet in length, consisting of stone columns of the Tuscan order. In the middle of the building is a chapel, adorned with columns, entablatures and pediment, of the Ionic order; under the pediment is a niche with a statue of the founder. In the same parish is the Ironmongers hospital, likewise a large building.\n\nIn the parish of St Mary, Whitechapel, stands the London Hospital, for the reception of the sick. It is a large building, and was erected a few years since by voluntary contribution. Here are also some considerable almshouses.\n\nWithin the precincts of Westminster are several stately houses belonging to the nobility, some of which have been already mentioned. Of the others, the most remarkable at present are, Burlington-house, Devonshire-house, Egremont-house, and Bedford-house; Carlton-house, the magnificent abode of the prince of Wales; and the superb residence erected by the duke of York between the Treasury and the Horse-guards.\n\nTo these may be added, Montagu-house (now the British Museum); which was built on a French plan by the first duke of Montagu, who had been ambassador in France. The staircases and ceilings were painted by Rousseau and La Fosse: the apotheosis of Iris, and the assembly of the gods, are by the last. It was purchased of the duke's heirs by parliament, for uniting together the Royal, Cottonian, Harleian, Sloanian, and other collections of books, MSS., coins, antiquities, subjects in natural history, &c. &c. for the public use, for which it is excellently adapted. The first of these libraries contains the books and MSS. of our princes from Henry VII. to Charles II.; the second the MSS. collected by Sir John Cotton, his son, and grandson Sir John, which last gave it to the public by act 12 and 13 William III. c. 7. The Harlean collection of MSS. was formed by Edward earl of Oxford, and purchased by government in 1753, at the same time with the library, MSS. and natural curiosities, of Sir Hans Sloane. This last cost Sir Hans £50,000; and he left it by will, to the use of the public, on condition that the parliament would pay £20,000 to his executors. It comprehends an amazing number of curiosities: among which are, the library, including books of drawings, MSS., and prints, amounting to about 50,000 volumes; medals and coins, ancient and modern, 20,000; cameos and intaglios, about 700; seals, 268; vellums, &c. of agate, jasper, &c. 542; antiquities, 1125; precious stones, agates, jaspers, &c. 2256; metals, minerals, ores, &c. 2725; crystal, spars, &c. 1864; fossils, flints, stones, 1275; earths, sands, salts, 1025; bitumens, sulphur, ambers, &c. 399; tales, mice, &c. 388; corals, sponges, &c. 1427; shellace, or shells, &c. 5843; echinii, echinids, &c. 659; afteria, trochi, entrochi, &c. 241; crustacea, crabs, lobsters, &c. 363; stellae marine, star-fishes, &c. 173; fish, and their parts, &c. 1555; birds, and their parts, eggs, and nests of different species, 1172; quadrupeds, &c. 1886; vipers, serpents, &c. 521; insects, &c. 3439; vegetables, 12,566; hortus ficus or volumes of dried plants, 334; humani, as calculi, London anatomical preparations, 756; miscellaneous things, natural, 2098; mathematical instruments, 55. A catalogue of all the above is written in a number of large volumes. It is a large and magnificent building; and has behind it a garden, consisting nearly of nine acres.\n\nThe British Museum has of late been very much enriched by an accession of Egyptian curiosities, chiefly taken from General Menou at Alexandria. In the meantime they are laid in the court-yard, but will soon be deposited in a building which is to be erected for that particular purpose.\n\nBesides a great number of spacious streets, which principal are daily increasing, this part of the metropolis is ornamented with several magnificent squares, viz. Grosvenor-square, Berkeley-square, Portland-square, Cavendish-square, Hanover-square, St James's-square, Soho-square, Bloomsbury-square, Queen's-square, Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, Leicester-square, Red-Lion-square, some of which have been particularly described; not to mention others that are at present building. In general, the new buildings in the liberty of Westminster have increased to a prodigious degree; insomuch that they reach as far as Marybone to the north, Piccadilly to the south, and Hyde-Park wall to the west.\n\nBefore the conflagration in 1666, London (which like most other great cities, had arisen from small ancient beginnings) was totally inelegant, inconvenient, and unhealthy, of which latter misfortune many melancholy healthy proofs are authenticated in history, and which, without doubt, proceeded from the narrowness of the streets, and the unaccountable projections of the buildings, that confined the putrid air, and joined with other circumstances, such as the want of water, rendered the city seldom free from pestilential deviation. The fire which consumed the greatest part of the city, dreadful as it was to the inhabitants at that time, was productive of consequences which made ample amends for the losses sustained by individuals; a new city arose on the ruins of the old; but, though more regular, open, convenient, and healthful, than the former, yet it by no means answered to the characters of magnificence or elegance, in many particulars; and it is ever to be lamented (such was the infatuation of those times), that the magnificent, elegant, and useful plan of the great Sir Christopher Wren, was totally disregarded, and sacrificed to the mean and selfish views of private property; views which did irreparable injury to the citizens themselves and to the nation in general: for had that great architect's plan been followed, what has often been asserted must have been the result; the metropolis of this kingdom would incontestably have been the most magnificent and elegant city in the universe; and of consequence must, from the prodigious resort of foreigners of distinction and taste who would have visited it, have become an inexhaustible fund of riches to this nation. But as the deplorable blindness of that age has deprived us of so valuable an acquisition, it is become absolutely necessary that some efforts should be made to render the present plan in a greater degree answerable to the character of the richest and most powerful people in the world.\n\nThe plan of London, in its present state, will in its plan still many instances appear to very moderate judges to be defective.\n\nDd 2\nLondon, as injudicious a disposition as can easily be conceived for a city of trade and commerce, on the borders of so noble a river as the Thames. The wharfs and quays on its banks are extremely mean and inconvenient; and the want of regularity and uniformity in the streets of the city of London, and the mean avenues to many parts of it, are also circumstances that greatly lessen the grandeur of its appearance. Many of the churches and other public buildings are likewise thrust up in corners, in such a manner as might tempt foreigners to believe that they were designed to be concealed. The improvements of the city of London for some years past have, however, been very great; and the new streets, which are numerous, are in general more spacious, and built with greater regularity and elegance.\n\nThe very elegant and necessary method of paving and enlightening the streets is also felt in the most sensible manner by all ranks and degrees of people. The roads are continued for several miles around upon the same model; and, exclusive of lamps regularly placed on each side, at short distances, are rendered more secure by watchmen stationed within call of each other. Nothing can appear more brilliant than those lights when viewed at a distance, especially where the roads run across; and even the principal streets, such as Pall-Mall, New Bond-street, Oxford street, &c., convey an idea of elegance and grandeur.\n\nLondon, then, in its large sense, including Westminster, Southwark, and part of Middlesex, forms one great metropolis, of vast extent and of prodigious wealth. When considered with all its advantages, it is now what ancient Rome once was; the seat of liberty, the encourager of arts, and the admiration of the whole world. It is the centre of trade; has an intimate connexion with all the countries in the kingdom; and is the grand mart of the nation, to which all parts send their commodities, from whence they are again sent back into every town in the nation and to every part of the world. From hence innumerable carriages by land and water are constantly employed; and from hence arises that circulation in the national body which renders every part healthful, vigorous, and in a prosperous condition; a circulation that is equally beneficial to the head and the most distant members. Merchants are here as rich as noblemen; witness their incredible loans to government; and there is no place in the world where the shops of tradesmen make such a noble and elegant appearance, or are better stocked.\n\nThe Thames, on the banks of which London is situated, is a river which, though not the largest, is the richest and most commodious for commerce of any in the world. It is continually filled with fleets, failing to or from the most distant climates; and its banks, from London-bridge to Blackwall, form almost one continued great magazine of naval stores; containing numerous wet docks, dry docks, and yards for the building of ships, for the use of the merchants; besides the places allotted for the building of boats and lighters, and the king's yards lower down the river for the building of men of war.\n\nThe West India Docks are designed to receive all the ships trading to the West Indies, and will, when finished, justly claim a place among the curiosities of Great Britain. By virtue of an act of parliament they were undertaken in 1799, the entrances to which are by Blackwall and Limehouse-hole. The proprietors began with a capital of £500,000, with parliamentary authority to increase it to £600,000, if they should find it requisite, and they are to be indemnified by a tonnage of 6s. upon the burden of every ship entering the dock.\n\nThe docks at Wapping must be allowed to be an important improvement. The prodigious one which goes by the name of St George's dock, is capable of containing 200 ships, and Shadwell dock will contain about 50 vessels. The company projecting and carrying these into execution, possess a capital of £1,200,000, and the shares bear a premium. The foundation of the entrance basin was laid on the 26th of June, 1802, and at the same time the first stone of a tobacco warehouse, which is the largest in the world.\n\nAs the city is about 60 miles distant from the sea, it enjoys, by means of this beautiful river, all the benefits of navigation, without the danger of being surprised by foreign fleets, or of being annoyed by the moist vapours of the sea. It rises regularly from the water side, and, extending itself on both sides along its banks, reaches a prodigious length from east to west in a kind of amphitheatre towards the north, and is continued for near 20 miles on all sides, in a succession of magnificent villas and populous villages, the courts of gentlemen and tradesmen; whither the latter retire for the benefit of fresh air, and to relax their minds from the hurry of business. The regard paid by the legislature to the property of the subject, has hitherto prevented any bounds being fixed for its extension.\n\nThe irregular form of London makes it difficult to ascertain its extent. However, its length from east to west is generally allowed to be above seven miles from Hyde-park corner to Poplar; and its breadth in some places three, in others two, and in others again not much above half a mile. Hence the circumference of the whole is almost 18 miles; or, according to a later measurement, the extent of continued buildings is 35 miles two furlongs and 39 rods. But it is much easier to form an idea of the large extent of a city so irregularly built by the number of the people, who are computed to be near a million; and from the number of edifices devoted to the service of religion.\n\nOf these, beside St Paul's cathedral and the collegiate church at Westminster, there are 114 parish churches and 62 chapels, of the established religion; 17 foreign Protestant chapels; 11 chapels belonging to the Germans, Dutch, Danes, &c.; 26 Independent meetings; 34 Presbyterian meetings; 20 Baptist meetings; 11 Popish chapels, and meeting-houses for the use of foreign ambassadors and people of various sects; and 6 Jews synagogues. So that there are above 300 places devoted to religious worship in the compass of this vast pile of buildings, without reckoning the 21 out-parishes usually included in the bills of mortality, and a great number of Methodist tabernacles.\n\nThere are also in and near this city 100 almshouses, hospitals, about 20 hospitals and infirmaries, 3 colleges, 10 public schools, prisons, 15 flesh-markets; one market for live cattle; houses, &c., two other markets more particularly for herbs; and 23 other markets for corn, coals, hay, &c.; 15 inns of court;\nLondon court; 27 public squares, besides those within single buildings, as the Temple, &c. 3 bridges, 55 halls for companies, 8 public schools, called free-schools; and 13 charity-schools, which provide education for 1034 poor children; 207 inns, 447 taverns, 551 coffeehouses, 5975 alehouses; 1000 hackney-coaches; 400 ditto chairs; 7000 streets, lanes, courts, and alleys, and 150,000 dwelling houses, containing, as has been already observed, about 1,000,000 inhabitants; inhabitants who, according to a moderate estimate, are supposed to consume the following provisions weekly:\n\n| Item                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Cost |\n|-------------------------------|----------|------------|------------|\n| 1000 Bullocks, at 6l. a-piece |          |            | L. 6000    |\n| 6000 Sheep, at 12s. a-piece   |          |            | 3600       |\n| 2000 Calves, at 1l. 4s. a-piece|          |            | 2400       |\n| 3000 Lambs, at 8s. a-piece, for six months |          |            | 1200       |\n| 1500 Hogs in pork and bacon, at 20s. for five months |          |            | 1500       |\n| 2000 Pigs, at 2s. 6d. a-piece |          |            | 250        |\n| 1000 Turkeys, at 3s. 6d. a-piece for five months |          |            | 175        |\n| 1000 Geese, at 2s. 6d. a-piece, for five months |          |            | 125        |\n| 2000 Capons, at 1s. 8d. a-piece |          |            | 106        |\n| 500 Dozens of chickens, at 9s. per dozen |          |            | 225        |\n| 4300 Ducks at 9d. a-piece     |          |            | 161        |\n| 1500 Dozens of rabbits, at 7s. per dozen, for eight months |          |            | 525        |\n| 2000 Dozens of pigeons, at 2s. per dozen, for eight months |          |            | 200        |\n| 700 Dozens of wild fowl, of several sorts, for six months |          |            | 250        |\n| In salt and fresh fish, at 1d. a-day, for half a million of people for a week |          |            | 14,583     |\n| In bread of all sorts, white and brown at 1d. a-day, for one million of people for a week |          |            | 29,166     |\n| 300 Tons of wine, of all sorts, at 50l. a ton, one fort with another, for one week |          |            | 15,000     |\n| In milk, butter, cheese, &c. at 1d. a-day, for a million of people for a week |          |            | 29,166     |\n| In fruit of all sorts, at one farthing a-day, for a million of people for a week |          |            | 7291       |\n| In eggs of hens, ducks, geese, &c. at half a farthing a-day, for a million of people for a week |          |            | 3645       |\n| In beer and ale, strong and small, at 2d. a-day, for a million of people for a week |          |            | 58,333     |\n| In sugar, plums, and spice, and all sorts of grocery, at a halfpenny a-day, for a million of people for a week |          |            | 14,583     |\n| In wheat-flour, for pies and puddings, oat-meal and rice, &c. at half a farthing a-day, for a million of people for a week |          |            | 3645       |\n| In salt, oil, vinegar, capers, olives, and other sauces, at half a farthing a-day, for a million of people for a week |          |            | 3645       |\n\nIn roots and herbs of all sorts, both for food and physic, at half a farthing a-day, for a million of people for a week\n\nIn sea-coal, charcoal, candles, and fire wood, of all sorts, at td. a-day, for a million of people for a week\n\nIn paper of all sorts (a great quantity being used in printing) quills, pens, ink, and wax, at a farthing a-day, for a million of people for a week\n\nIn tobacco, pipes, and snuff, at half a farthing a-day, for a million of people for a week\n\nIn clothing, as linen and woollen, for men, women, and children, shoes, stockings, &c. at 3s. 6d. per week, for a million of people for a week\n\nExpences for horse meat, in hay, oats, beans, 1000 load of hay a-week, at 40s. a load, comes to 2000l. in oats and beans the like value, 2000l. which is in all, for one week\n\nCyder, rum, brandy, strong waters, coffee, chocolate, tea, &c. at 1d. a-day, for a million of people for one week\n\nThe common firing is pit coal, commonly called sea firing, coal, of which there are consumed upwards of 766,880 porter, &c. chaldrons every year. The annual consumption of oil in London and Westminster for lamps, amounts to 400,000l. In 1787, the quantity of porter brewed in London for home consumption and foreign exportation, amounted to 1,176,856 barrels. In 1805 it amounted to 1,200,000 barrels of 36 gallons each.\n\nThe above was the weekly consumption of the articles specified a few years ago. The following is the annual consumption of some of them estimated since the year 1800. Bullocks 110,000; sheep and lambs 776,000; calves 210,000; hogs 210,000; sucking pigs 60,000; milk in gallons 6,980,000; for which the inhabitants pay 481,666l. and this is the produce of 8,500 cows; vegetables and fruit 3,000,000l.; spirituous liquors and compounds 11,146,782 gallons; wine 32,500 tons; butter 16,600,000 pounds; cheese 21,100,000 pounds.\n\nThis great and populous city is happily supplied with abundance of fresh water from the Thames and water the New River; which is not only of inconceivable service to every family, but by means of fire plugs everywhere dispersed, the keys of which are deposited with the parish officers, the city is in a great measure secured from the spreading of fire; for these plugs are no sooner opened, than there are vast quantities of water to supply the engines. This plenty of water has been attended with another advantage, it has given rise to several companies, who ensure houses and companies goods from fire; an advantage that is not to be met with in any other nation on earth: the premium is small; and the recovery in case of loss is easy and certain.\nLondon. Every one of these offices keeps a set of men in pay, who are ready at all hours to give their affluence in case of fire; and who are on all occasions extremely bold, dextrous, and diligent: but though all their labours should prove unsuccessful, the person who suffers by this devouring element has the comfort that must arise from a certainty of being paid the value (upon oath) of what he has endured.\n\nThe places for diversion are, Vauxhall, Ranelagh-gardens, the two play-houses, the Pantheon, and the little theatre in the Hay Market, with Sadler's-wells, Hughes's Circus, and Astley's Royal-Grove, &c. The finest repositories of rarities and natural history, are Sir Hans Sloane's, in the British Museum, already described; and another collected by Sir Ashton Lever, afterwards the private property of Mr Parkington, and deposited in apartments for public inspection, near the south end of Blackfriars bridge, was sold in 1806.\n\nThe Royal Institution owed its origin to a number of noblemen and gentlemen, who held meetings for the avowed purpose of ameliorating the condition of the poor. They first projected the plan of its foundation, which was matured by the exertions and talents of the indefatigable Count Rumford. The meetings began in 1800, shortly before which his majesty granted the proprietors a charter of incorporation by the name of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, for the purpose of facilitating the general introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for teaching, by courses of philosophical lectures and experiments, the application of science to the common purposes of life.\n\nThe government of the society consists of the president, 15 managers, and the secretary, chosen by and from among the proprietors. Of the 15 managers, one-third is elected annually, on the first of May. The house is situated in Albemarle-street, is extremely spacious, and well adapted to the purposes to which it is applied.\n\nThe London Institution was formed in the autumn of 1805, by the indefatigable exertions of a few spirited individuals. The house in the mean time is in the Old Jewry, till the managers can procure a more suitable place. The design of it is to promote the diffusion of science, literature, and the arts: its view at present being confined to three objects, viz., the acquisition of a valuable and extensive library; the diffusion of useful knowledge by the means of lectures and experiments; and the establishment of a reading room, where the foreign and domestic journals are provided for the use of the proprietors and subscribers. The government of the institution is vested in a president, four vice-presidents, twenty managers, and the secretary. The number of proprietors is limited to 1000, each of whom paid 75 guineas for a share, and the life subscribers pay 25 guineas.\n\nLONDONDERRY, or COLERAINE, a county of Ireland, in the province of Ulster. It is bounded on the south and south-west by the county of Tyrone; by Antrim on the east, from which it is parted by the river Bann; by Donegal on the west; and that county and the Deucalonian ocean on the north. Its greatest length is about 36 miles, its breadth 30, containing about 251,510 acres. The bogs and heaths of this county are manured with sea-shells, as those of Donegal. Like that, too, it is pretty champaign, and not unfruitful. It is particularly noted for a very clear river called the Bann, abounding with salmon, a fish said to delight in limpid streams. This river, to distinguish it from a lesser of the same name, is called the Greater or Lower Bann. In order to cultivate, settle, and civilize this county, King James I. granted it, by letters-patent, to a society, by the name of the Governor and Assistants at London of the new plantation of Ulster in the realm of Ireland. It contains six baronies; and, besides the two knights of the shire, sends to parliament two members for the city of Londonderry, and two each for Coleraine and Newton-Limavady or Lannevady.\n\nLONDONDERRY, or Derry, the capital of the county, and the see of a bishop, stands at the bottom of Lough Foyle. This city has a very good port, to which ships of the greatest burden have access, and a considerable trade. It will be ever famous for the gallantry and perseverance with which it defended itself in three memorable sieges, in defiance of the greatest hardships and discouragements, namely, 11th, In 1641, when the rebels could not reduce it either by fraud or force. 2ndly, In 1649, when it was besieged by the lord Ardes, and reduced almost to extremity by famine, till at last relieved by troops sent from England. 3rdly, When it held out against the French and Irish from the 7th of December 1688 to the last day of July 1689, though it was neither well fortified nor provided with a garrison or stores of provision and ammunition, and hardly any attempt made to relieve it during so long a time. Though the city is 20 miles up the river, yet very large ships can come up to the quay, where there are four or five fathoms of water. It is now well fortified with a strong wall, besides outworks; and along the banks of the river are several castles and a fort. This city is of no great antiquity, having been built and planted in the reign of James I. by a colony sent by the society above mentioned. The trade of the town is very considerable, having not only a large share in the herring fishery, but sending ships also to the West Indies, New England, and Newfoundland, for which they are so advantageously situated, that a vessel bound from thence to America often arrives there before a London ship can get clear of the soundings, or arrive in the latitude of Londonderry. Though there are a great many shallows in Lough Foyle, which serves it instead of a road; yet they are easily avoided, as there are deep channels between them. These points called Emifone, Rufferhull or Caldy head, which lie a little to the west of the mouth of the harbour, are counted the most northerly of Ireland. The inhabitants of this city are almost all Protestants. It gave title of earl and baron to a branch of the family of Pitt, which became extinct in 1764; but part of the title was revived in Robert Stewart, who was created Baron Londonderry in 1789. A late traveller says, \"Derry is, perhaps, the cleanest, best built, and most beautifully situated town in Ireland; and excepting Cork, as convenient as any for commerce, foreign and domestic.\" The lake almost surrounds it; and the whole ground-plot both of it and its liberties belongs to the 12 great companies of London. Great quantities of salmon, salted and barrelled, are exported from hence to America. It contains 10,000 inhabitants, and\nand has a wooden bridge 1668 feet long, which was erected in 1791.

See BOAT.\n\nLONG, Roger, D.D. master of Pembroke-hall in Cambridge, Lowndes's professor of astronomy in that university, rector of Cherryhinton in Huntingdonshire, and of Bradwell juxta mare in Essex, was author of a well-known and much approved treatise of astronomy, and the inventor of a remarkably curious astronomical machine, thus described by himself. \"I have, in a room lately built in Pembroke-hall, erected a sphere of 18 feet diameter, wherein above 30 persons may fit conveniently; the entrance into it is over the south pole by six steps; the frame of the sphere consists of a number of iron meridians, not complete semicircles, the northern ends of which are screwed to a large round plate of brass, with a hole in the centre of it; through this hole, from a beam in the ceiling, comes the north pole, a round iron rod, about three inches long, and supports the upper parts of the sphere to its proper elevation for the latitude of Cambridge; the lower part of the sphere, so much of it as is invisible in England, is cut off; and the lower or southern ends of the meridians, or truncated semicircles, terminate on, and are screwed down to, a strong circle of oak, of about 13 feet diameter; which, when the sphere is put into motion, runs upon large rollers of lignum vitae, in the manner that the tops of some windmills are made to turn round. Upon the iron meridians is fixed a zodiac of tin painted blue, whereon the ecliptic and heliocentric orbits of the planets are drawn, and the constellations and stars traced: the Great and Little Bear and Draco are already painted in their places round the north pole; the rest of the constellations are proposed to follow; the whole is turned round with a small winch, with as little labour as it takes to wind up a jack, though the weight of the iron, tin, and wooden circle, is about 1000 pounds. When it is made use of, a planetarium will be placed in the middle thereof. The whole, with the floor, is well supported by a frame of large timber.\" Thus far Dr Long, before this curious piece of mechanism was perfected. Since the above was written, the sphere has been completely finished; all the constellations and stars of the northern hemisphere, visible at Cambridge, are painted in their proper places upon plates of iron joined together, which form one concave surface. Dr Long published a Commencement Sermon 1728; and an answer to Dr Galley's pamphlet on Greek Accents; and died December 16th 1770, at the age of 91. As the materials for this article are scanty, we shall subjoin, from the Gentleman's Magazine *, a few traits of him, as delineated in 1769 by Mr Jones. \"He is now in the 88th year of his age, and for his years vegetate and active. He was lately (in October) put in nomination for the office of vice-chancellor. He executed that trust once before, I think in the year 1737; a very ingenious person, and sometimes very facetious. At the public commencement in the year 1713, Dr Greene (master of Bennet college, and afterwards bishop of Ely) being then vice-chancellor, Mr Long was pitched upon for the tripso-performance; it was witty and humorous, and has palled through divers editions. Some that remembered the delivery of it, told me, that in addressing the vice-chancellor (whom the university wags usually styled Miss Greene), the tripso-orator, being a native of Norfolk, and assuming the Norfolk dialect, instead of saying, Domine Vice-Cancellarie, did very archly pronounce the words thus, Domina Vice-Cancellaria; which occasioned a general smile in that great auditory. His friend the late Mr Bonfoy of Ripon told me this little incident, 'That he and Dr Long walking together in Cambridge in a dusky evening, and coming to a short post fixed in the pavement, which Mr B. in the midst of chat and inattention, took to be a boy standing in his way, he said in a hurry, 'Get out of my way, boy.' 'That boy, Sir,' said the doctor very calmly and filly, is a poltboy, who turns out of his way for nobody.'—I could recollect several other ingenious repartees if there were occasion. One thing is remarkable, he never was a hale and hearty man, always of a tender and delicate constitution, yet took great care of it. His common drink water. He always dines with the fellows in the hall. Of late years he has left off eating flesh-meats; in the room thereof, puddings, vegetables, &c. sometimes a glafs or two of wine.\"\n\nLONGEVITY, length of life.\n\nFrom the different longevities of men in the beginning of the world, after the flood, and in these ages, Mr Derham draws an argument for the interposition of a divine Providence.\n\nImmediately after the creation, when the world was to be peopled by one man and one woman, the ordinary age was 900 and upwards.—Immediately after the flood, when there were three persons to stock the world, their age was cut shorter, and none of those patriarchs, but Shem, arrived at 500. In the second century we find none that reached 240: in the third, none but Terah that came to 200 years; the world, at least a part of it, by that time being so well peopled, that they had built cities, and were cantoned out into distant nations.—By degrees, as the number of people increased, their longevity dwindled, till it came down at length to 70 or 80 years: and there it stood, and has continued to stand ever since the time of Moses.—This is found a good medium, and by means hereof the world is neither overstocked, nor kept too thin; but life and death keep a pretty equal pace.\n\nThat the common duration of man's life has been the same in all ages since the above period, is plain both from sacred and profane history. To pass by others, Plato lived to 81, and was accounted an old man: and the instances of longevity produced by Pliny, lib. vii. c. 48. as very extraordinary, may most of them be matched in modern histories.—In the following Tables are collected into one point of view the most memorable instances of long-lived persons of whose age we have any authentic records. The first and second are extracted from Mr Whitehurst's Inquiry into the Origin and Strata of the Earth, with some additions by Dr Fothergill; who inserted them, accompanied by a third, together with a number of useful observations, in the first volume of the Memoirs of the Manchester Literary Society.\n| Names of the Persons | Age | Places of Abode | Living or Dead |\n|----------------------|-----|----------------|---------------|\n| Thomas Parre         | 152 | Shropshire     | Died November 16, 1635. |\n| Henry Jenkins        | 169 | Yorkshire      | Phil.

Lord Bacon observes that the year of our Lord 76, in the reign of Vespasian, was memorable; for in that year was a taxing which afforded the most authentic method of knowing the ages of men. From it, there were found in that part of Italy lying between the Apennine mountains and the river Po, 124 persons who either equalled or exceeded 100 years of age, namely—\n\n54 persons of 100 years each.\n\n| Age | Persons |\n|-----|---------|\n| 57  | 110     |\n| 2   | 125     |\n\n4 persons of 130 years.\n\n| Age | Persons |\n|-----|---------|\n| 4   | 136     |\n| 3   | 140     |\n| In Parma | 120 |\n| 3   | 130     |\n| In Bruffels | 125 |\n| In Placentia | 131 |\n| In Faventia | 132 |\n| 6   | 110     |\n| 4   | 120     |\n| In Rimino | 150 years, viz.

Besides Brown, the Cornish beggar, who lived to 120, and one Polezow to 130 years of age, he remembered the decease of four persons in his own parish, the sum of whose years, taken collectively, amounted to 340. Now, although longevity evidently prevails more in certain districts than in others, yet Longevity it is by no means confined to any particular nation or climate; nor are there wanting instances of it in almost every quarter of the globe, as appears from the preceding as well as the subsequent Table; which might have been considerably enlarged, had it appeared necessary; but we have only added, in the last, three recent instances that are peculiarly remarkable.\n\n| Names of the Persons | Age | Places of Abode | Where recorded |\n|----------------------|-----|----------------|---------------|\n| Hippocrates, Physician | 104 | Iland of Cos | Lynche on Health, chap. 3. |\n| Democritus, Philosopher | 109 | Abdera | Bacon's History, 1095. |\n| Galen, Physician | 140 | Pergamus | Voll.

In the early part of his life, he was a servant in the family of the prince de Beaufremont. His memory continued good to the last day of his life; and the principal inconveniences which he felt from his great age were, that his sight was weakened, and the natural heat of his body was so diminished, that he shivered with cold in the middle of the dog-days if he was not fitting by a good fire. This old man was received in the body of the house by the national assembly, indulged with a chair, and directed to keep on his hat lest he should catch cold if he was, to fit uncovered. A collection was made for him by the members, which exceeded 500l. sterling; but he lived not to return to Mount Jura. He was buried on Saturday the 31st of January 1792, with great funeral pomp, in the parish-church of St Enface at Paris.\n\n(s) He served as a private at the taking of Gibraltar in 1704.\n\n(t) Memoirs of the Life and gallant Exploits of the Old Highlander Serjeant Donald Macleod, &c. published 1791, in the 103d year of his age.—This old gentleman, for it appears that he really is a gentleman both by birth and by behaviour, was born in the year of the Revolution, in the parish of Bracadill, in the isle of Sky and county of Inverness, North Britain. He is a cadet of the family of Ulinish in Sky; and descended, through his mother, from Macdonald of Slate, the ancestor of the present Lord Macdonald. The earlier part of his life coincided with the famine of seven years in Scotland; which was so great as to suggest, even to the patriotic Mr Fletcher, the idea of the people felling themselves as slaves for immediate subsistence. He\nA certain author mentions a list collected by himself of 107 persons, who all died at the age of 120 and upwards. Two of them attained the age of 150, three of 152, one of 154, one of 169, and another 175. In 1763 there were found in Sweden 988 females above 90 years of age. We have seen a list of 104 persons, none of whom died under 120 years of age, and one of them, it is said, lived to the prodigious age of 180. Forty-one of them belonged to England, 16 to Scotland, and 24 to Ireland.\n\nThe antediluvians are purposely omitted, as bearing too little reference to the present race of mortals, to afford any satisfactory conclusions; and as they have been already taken notice of in a separate article; (see Antediluvians). As the improbable stories of some persons who have almost rivalled them in modern times, border too much upon the marvellous to find a place in these tables, the present examples are abundantly sufficient to prove, that longevity does not depend, so much as has been supposed, on any particular climate, situation, or occupation in life: for we see, that it often prevails in places where all these are extremely dissimilar; and it would, moreover, be very difficult, in the histories of the several persons above mentioned, to find any circumstance common to them all, except, perhaps, that of being born of healthy parents, and of being insured to daily labour, temperance, and simplicity of diet. Among the inferior ranks of mankind, therefore, rather than among the sons of ease and luxury, shall we find the most numerous instances of longevity; even frequently, when other external circumstances seem extremely unfavourable; as in the case of the poor sexton at Peterborough, who, notwithstanding his unpromising occupation among dead bodies, lived long enough to bury two crowned heads, and to survive two complete generations. The livelihood of Henry Jenkins and old Longevity Parre is said to have consisted chiefly of the coarsest fare, as they depended on precarious alms. To which may be added the remarkable influence of Agnes Milbourne, who, after bringing forth a numerous offspring, and being obliged, through extreme indigence, to pass the latter part of her life in St Luke's workhouse, yet reached her 106th year in that forlorn and unfriendly situation. The plain diet and invigorating employments of a country life are acknowledged on all hands to be highly conducive to health and longevity, while the luxury and refinements of large cities are allowed to be equally destructive to the human species; and this consideration alone, perhaps, more than counterbalances all the boasted privileges of superior elegance and civilization resulting from a city life.\n\nFrom country villages, and not from crowded cities, have the preceding instances of longevity been chiefly supplied. Accordingly it appears, from the London bills of mortality, during a period of 30 years, viz. from the year 1728 to 1758, the sum of the deaths amounted to 750,322, and that, in all this prodigious number, only 242 persons survived the 100th year of their age! This overgrown metropolis is computed by Dr Price to contain a ninth part of the inhabitants of England, and to consume annually 7000 persons, who remove into it from the country every year, without increasing it. He moreover observes, that the number of inhabitants in England and Wales has diminished about one-fourth part since the Revolution; and so rapidly of late, that in 11 years, near 200,000 of our common people have been lost. If the calculation be just, however alarming it may appear in a national view, there is this consolation, when considered in a philosophical light, that without partial evil, there can be no general good; and\n\nwas bred in the midst of want and hardships, cold, hunger, and for the years of his apprenticeship with a mason and stone-cutter in Inverness, in incessant fatigue. He enlisted, when a boy, in the Scottish service, in the town of Perth in the last year of the reign of King William. The regiment into which he enlisted was the Scots Royals, commanded by the earl of Orkney. That old military corps, at that time, used bows and arrows as well as swords, and wore fleecy caps. He served in Germany and Flanders under the duke of Marlborough; under the duke of Argyle, in the rebellion 1715; in the Highland Watch, or companies raised for enforcing the laws in the Highlands; in the same companies when, under the name of the 42d regiment, they were sent abroad to Flanders, to join the army under the duke of Cumberland; in the same regiment in Ireland, and on the breaking out of the French war, 1757, in America. From the 42d he was draughted to act as a drill sergeant in the 73d regiment, in which he served at the reduction of Louisburg and Quebec: After this he became an out-pensioner of Chelsea Hospital. But such was the spirit of this brave and hardy veteran, that he served in 1761 as a volunteer in Germany under the marquis of Granby; and offered his services in the American war to Sir Henry Clinton; who, though he declined to employ the old man in the fatigues and dangers of war, treated him with great kindness, allowed him a liberal weekly pension out of his own pocket, and sent him home in a ship charged with despatches to government.—The sergeant, “as his memory, according to the observation of his biographer, is impaired, does not pretend to make an exact enumeration of all his offspring: but he knows of 16 sons now living, 14 of whom are in the army and navy, besides daughters; the eldest of whom by his present wife is a mantuamaker at Newcastle.—His eldest son is now 83 years old, and the youngest only nine. Nor, in all probability, would this lad close the rear of his immediate progeny, if his present wife, the boy’s mother, had not attained to the 49th year of her age.”—In his prime, he did not exceed five feet and seven inches. He is now inclined through age to five feet five inches. He has an interesting physiognomy, expressive of sincerity, sensibility, and manly courage. His biographer very properly submits it to the consideration of the Polygraphic Society, whether they might not do a thing worthy of themselves and their ingenious art, if they should multiply likenesses of this living antiquity, and circulate them at an easy rate throughout Britain and Europe. They would thus gratify a very general curiosity; a curiosity not confined to the present age.\nLongevity, and that what a nation loses in the scale of population at one period, it gains at another; and thus probably, the average number of inhabitants on the surface of the globe continues at all times nearly the same. By this medium, the world is neither overcrowded with inhabitants nor kept too thin, but life and death keep a tolerably equal pace. The inhabitants of this island, comparatively speaking, are but as the dust of the balance; yet instead, of being diminished, we are assured by other writers, that within these 30 years they are greatly increased.\n\nThe desire of self-preservation, and of protracting the short span of life, is so intimately interwoven with our constitution, that it is justly esteemed one of the first principles of our nature, and, in spite even of pain and misery, seldom quits us to the last moments of our existence. It seems, therefore, to be no less our duty than our interest, to examine minutely into the various means that have been considered as conducive to health and long life; and, if possible, to distinguish such circumstances as are essential to that great end from those which are merely accidental. But here it is much to be regretted, that an accurate history of the lives of all the remarkable persons in the above table, so far as relates to the diet, regimen, and the use of the non-naturals, has not been faithfully handed down to us; without which it is impossible to draw the necessary inferences. Is it not then a matter of astonishment, that historians and philosophers have hitherto paid so little attention to longevity? If the present imperfect list should excite others, of more leisure and better abilities, to undertake a full investigation of so interesting a subject, the inquiry might prove not only curious but highly useful to mankind. In order to furnish materials for a future history of longevity, the bills of mortality throughout the kingdom ought first to be revised, and put on a better footing, agreeable to the scheme of which Manchester and Chester have already given a specimen highly worthy of imitation. The plan, however, might be further improved with very little trouble, by adding a particular account of the diet and regimen of every person who dies at 80 years of age or upwards; and mentioning whether his parents were healthy, long-lived people, &c. An accurate register, thus established throughout the British dominions, would be productive of many important advantages to society, not only in a medical and philosophical, but also in a political and moral view.\n\nAll the circumstances that are most essentially necessary to life, may be comprised under the five following heads: 1. Air and climate; 2. Meat and drink; 3. Motion and rest; 4. The secretions and excretions; 5. Sleep and watching; 6. Affections of the mind.\n\nThese, though all perfectly natural to the constitution, have by writers been styled the non-naturals, by a strange perversion of language; and have been all copiously handled under that improper term. However, it may not be amiss to offer a few short observations on each, as they are so immediately connected with the present subject.\n\n1. Air, &c. It has long been known that fresh air is more immediately necessary to life than food; for a man may live two or three days without the latter, but not many minutes without the former. The vivifying principle contained in the atmosphere, so essential to longevity, the support of flame, as well as animal life, concerning which authors have proposed so many conjectures, appears now to be nothing else but that pure dephtilicated fluid lately discovered by that ingenious philosopher Dr Priestley. The common atmosphere may well be supposed to be more or less healthy in proportion as it abounds with this animating principle. As this exhales in copious streams from the green leaves of all kinds of vegetables, even from those of the most poisonous kinds, may we not, in some measure account why instances of longevity are so much more frequent in the country than in large cities; where the air, instead of partaking so largely of this salutary impregnation, is daily contaminated with noxious animal effluvia and phlogiston?\n\nWith respect to climate, various observations conspire to prove, that those regions which lie within the temperate zones are best calculated to promote long life. Hence, perhaps, may be explained, why Italy has produced so many long lives, and why islands in general are more salutary than continents; of which Bermudas and some others afford examples. And it is a pleasing circumstance that our own island appears from the above table (notwithstanding the sudden vicissitudes to which it is liable) to contain far more instances of longevity than could well be imagined. The ingenious Mr Whitehurst affirms us, from certain facts, that Englishmen are in general longer lived than North Americans; and that a British constitution will last longer, even in that climate, than a native one. But it must be allowed in general, that the human constitution is adapted to the peculiar state and temperature of each respective climate, so that no part of the habitable globe can be pronounced too hot or too cold for its inhabitants. Yet, in order to promote a friendly intercourse between the most remote regions, the Author of nature has wisely enabled the inhabitants to endure great and surprising changes of temperature with impunity.\n\n2. Foods and drink. Though foods and drink of the most simple kinds are allowed to be the best calculated for supporting the body in health, yet it can hardly be doubted but variety may be safely indulged occasionally, provided men would restrain their appetites within the bounds of temperance: for bountiful Nature cannot be supposed to have poured forth such a rich profusion of provisions, merely to tantalize the human species, without attributing to her the part of a cruel stepdame, instead of that of the kind and indulgent parent. Besides, we find, that by the wonderful powers of the digestive organs, a variety of animal and vegetable substances, of very discordant principles, are happily assimilated into one bland homogeneous chyle; therefore it seems natural to distrust those cynical writers, who would rigidly confine mankind to one simple dish, and their drink to the mere water of the brook. Nature, it is true, has pointed out that mild insipid fluid as the universal diluent, and therefore most admirably adapted for our daily beverage. But experience has equally proved, that vinous and spirituous liquors, on certain occasions, are no less salutary and beneficial, whether it be to support strength against sickness or bodily fatigue, or to exhilarate the mind under the pressure of heavy misfortunes. But, alas!\nLongitude, what Nature meant for innocent and useful cordials, to be used only occasionally, and according to the direction of reason, custom and caprice have by degrees rendered habitual to the human frame, and liable to the most enormous and destructive abuses. Hence it may be justly doubted, whether gluttony and intemperance have not depopulated the world more than even the sword, pestilence, and famine. True, therefore, is the old maxim, \"Modus utendi ex veneno facit medicamentum, ex medicamento venenum.\"\n\n3. and 4. Motion and rest, sleep and watching. It is allowed on all hands, that alternate motion and rest, and sleep and watching, are necessary conditions to health and longevity; and that they ought to be adapted to age, temperament, constitution, temperature of the climate, &c.; but the errors which mankind daily commit in these respects become a fruitful source of diseases. While some are bloated and relaxed with ease and indolence, others are emaciated, and become rigid through hard labour, watching, and fatigue.\n\n5. Secretions and evacuations. Where the animal functions are duly performed, the secretions go on regularly; and the different evacuations so exactly correspond to the quantity of aliment taken in, in a given time, that the body is found to return daily to nearly the same weight. If any particular evacuation happen to be preternaturally diminished, some other evacuation is proportionally augmented, and the equilibrium is commonly preserved; but continued irregularities, in these important functions, cannot but terminate in disease.\n\n6. Affections of the mind. The due regulation of the passions, perhaps, contributes more to health and longevity than that of any other of the non-naturals. The animating passions, such as joy, hope, love, &c., when kept within proper bounds, gently excite the nervous influence, promote an equable circulation, and are highly conducive to health; while the depraving affections, such as fear, grief, and despair, produce the contrary effect, and lay the foundation of the most formidable diseases.\n\nFrom the light which history affords us, as well as from some instances in the above table, there is great reason to believe, that longevity is in a great measure hereditary; and that healthy long-lived parents would commonly transmit the same to their children, were it not for the frequent errors in the non-naturals, which so evidently tend to the abbreviation of human life.\n\nWhere is it, but from these causes, and the unnatural modes of living, that, of all the children which are born in the capital cities of Europe, nearly one half die in early infancy? To what else can we attribute this extraordinary mortality? Such an amazing proportion of premature deaths is a circumstance unheard of among savage nations, or among the young of other animals! In the earliest ages, we are informed, that human life was protracted to a very extraordinary length; yet how few persons, in these latter times, arrive at that period which nature seems to have designed! Man is by nature a field animal, and seems destined to rise with the sun, and to spend a large portion of his time in the open air, to insure his body to robust exercises and the inclemency of the seasons, and to make a plain homely repast only when hunger dictates. But art has studiously defeated the kind intentions of nature; and by enslaving him to all the blandishments of sense, has left him, alas! an easy victim to folly and caprice. To enumerate the various abuses which take place from the earliest infancy, and which are continued through the succeeding stages of modish life, would carry us far beyond our present intention. Suffice it to observe, that they prevail more particularly among people who are the most highly polished and refined. To compare their artificial mode of life with that of nature, or even with the long-livers in the list, would probably afford a very striking contrast; and at the same time supply an additional reason why, in the very large cities, instances of longevity are so very rare.\n\nLONGFORD, a county of Ireland, in the province of Leinster, bounded by the counties of Leitrim and Cavan on the north, Meath on the east and south, and Roscommon on the west. It contains 143,700 Irish plantation acres, 24 parishes, 6 baronies, and 4 boroughs; and returns 10 members to parliament. It is small, and much encumbered with bog, intermixed with a tolerable good soil; and is about 25 miles long and 15 broad.\n\nLONGFORD, a town of Ireland, situated on the river Cromlin, in the county of Longford and province of Leinster, 64 miles from Dublin; which river falls a few miles below this place into the Shannon. It is a borough, post, market, and fair town; and returns two members to parliament; patron, Lord Longford. It gave title of earl to the family of Augier; of viscount, to the family of Micklethwaite; and now gives that of baron to the family of Packenham. Within a mile and a half of the town is a charter-school for above 40 children. This place has a barrack for a troop of horse. It is large and well built; and in a very early age an abbey was founded here, of which St Idus, one of St Patrick's disciples, was abbot. In the year 1400, a fine monastery was founded to the honour of the Virgin Mary, for Dominican friars, by O'Teirral prince of Annaly. This monastery being destroyed by fire, Pope Martin V. by a bull in the year 1429, granted an indulgence to all who should contribute to the rebuilding of it. In 1433, Pope Eugene IV. granted a bull to the same purpose; and in 1438 he granted another to the like effect. The church of this friary, now the parish church, is in the diocese of Ardagh. The fairs are four in the year.\n\nLONG-ISLAND, is an island of North America, belonging to the state of New-York, which is separated from the continent by a narrow channel. It extends from the city of New-York east 140 miles, terminating with Montauk point; and is not more than 10 miles in breadth on a medium. It is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Suffolk. The south side of the island is flat land, of a light sandy soil, bordered on the sea-coast with large tracts of salt meadow, extending from the west point of the island to Southampton. This soil, however, is well calculated for raising grain, especially Indian corn. The north side of the island is hilly, and of a strong soil, adapted to the culture of grain, hay, and fruit. A ridge of hills extends from Jamaica to South-hold. Large herds of cattle feed upon Hampstead plain and on the salt marshes upon the south side of the island. Hampstead plain in Queen's county is a curiosity. It\nLongime- is 16 miles in length, east and west, and 7 or 8 miles wide. The soil is black and to appearance rich, and yet it was never known to have any natural growth, but a kind of wild grass and a few shrubs. It is frequently well on some parts of the plain. The most of it lies common for cattle, horses, and sheep. As there is nothing to impede the prospect in the whole length of this plain, it has a curious and tiresome effect upon the eye, not unlike that of the ocean. The island contains 32,863 inhabitants.\n\nLONGIMETRY, the art of measuring lengths, both accessible and inaccessible. See GEOMETRY and TRIGONOMETRY.\n\nLONGING, is a preternatural appetite in pregnant women, and in some sick persons when about to recover. It is called pica, from the bird of that name, which is said to be subject to the same disorder. The disorder consists of both a desire of unusual things to eat and drink, and in being soon tired of one and wanting another. It is called malacia, from μαλακος, \"weakness.\" In pregnant women it is somewhat relieved by bleeding, and in about the fourth month of their pregnancy it leaves them. Chlorotic girls, and men who labour under suppressed hemorrhoids, are very subject to this complaint, and are relieved by promoting the respective evacuations. In general, whether this disorder is observed in pregnant women, in persons recovering from an acute fever, or those who labour under obstructions of the natural evacuations, this craving of the appetite should be indulged.\n\nLONGINICO, a town of Turkey in Europe, in the Morea, anciently called Olympia, famous for being the place where the Olympic games were celebrated, and for the temple of Jupiter Olympus, about a mile distant. It is now but a small place, seated on the river Alpheus, 10 miles from its mouth, and 50 south of Lepanto. E. Long. 22°. N. Lat. 37°. 30'.\n\nLONGINUS, Dionysius, a celebrated Greek critic of the third century, was probably an Athenian. His father's name is unknown, but by his mother he was allied to the celebrated Plutarch. His youth was spent in travelling with his parents, which gave him an opportunity to increase his knowledge, and improve his mind. After his travels, he fixed his residence at Athens, and with the greatest fidelity applied to study. Here he published his Treatise on the Sublime; which raised his reputation to such a height, and gave the Athenians such an opinion of his judgement and taste, that they made him sovereign judge of all authors, and every thing was received and rejected by the public according to his decisions. He seems to have lived at Athens a long time; here he taught the academic philosophy, and among others had the famous Porphyry for his pupil. But it was at length his fortune to be drawn from Athens, and to mix in more active scenes; to train up young princes to virtue and glory; to guide the busy passions of the great to noble objects; to struggle for, and at last to die in, the cause of liberty. Zenobia, queen of the East, prevailed on him to undertake the education of her sons; and he soon gained an uncommon share in her esteem: she spent the vacant hours of her life in his conversation, and modelled her sentiments and conduct by his instructions. That princess was at war with Aurelian; and being defeated by him near Antioch, was compelled to shut herself up in Palmyra, her capital city. The emperor wrote her a letter, in which he ordered her to surrender; to which she returned an answer, drawn up by Longinus, which filled him with resentment. The emperor laid siege to the city; and the Palmyrians were at length obliged to open their gates and receive the conqueror. The queen and Longinus endeavoured to fly into Persia; but were unhappily overtaken and made prisoners when they were on the point of crossing the Euphrates. The queen, intimidated, weakly laid the blame of vindicating the liberty of her country on its true author; and the brave Longinus, to the disgrace of the conqueror, was carried way to immediate execution. The writings of Longinus were numerous, some on philosophical, but the greater part on critical subjects. Dr. Pearce has collected the titles of 25 treatises, none of which, excepting that on the Sublime, have escaped the depredations of time and barbarians. On this imperfect piece the great fame of Longinus is raised, who, as Pope expresses it—\"is himself the great sublime he draws.\" The best edition of his works is that by Tollius, printed at Utrecht in 1694, cum notis variorum. It has been translated into English by Mr. Smith.\n\nLONGISSIMUS DORSI. See ANATOMY, Table of the Muscles.\n\nLONGITUDE, in Geography and Navigation, is the distance of any place from another eastward or westward, counted in degrees upon the equator: but when the distance is reckoned by leagues or miles and not in degrees, or in degrees on the meridian, and not of the parallel of latitude, in which case it includes both latitude and longitude, it is called departure.\n\nTo find the longitude at sea, is a problem to which the attention of navigators and mathematicians has been drawn ever since navigation began to be improved.—The importance of this problem soon became so well known, that, in 1598, Philip III. of Spain offered a reward of 1000 crowns for the solution; and his example was soon followed by the States General, who offered 10,000 florins. In 1714 an act was passed in the British parliament, empowering certain commissioners to make out a bill for a sum not exceeding 2000l. for defraying the necessary expenses of experiments for ascertaining this point; and likewise granting a reward to the person who made any progress in the solution, proportionable to the degree of accuracy with which the solution was performed: 10,000l. was granted if the longitude should be determined to one degree of a great circle, or 60 geographical miles; 15,000l. if to two thirds of that distance; and 20,000l. if to half the distance.\n\nIn consequence of these proffered rewards, innumerable attempts were made to discover this important secret. The first was that of John Morin professor of mathematics at Paris, who proposed it to Cardinal Richelieu; and though it was judged insufficient on account of the imperfection of the lunar tables, a pension of 2000 livres per annum was procured for him in 1645 by Cardinal Mazarine. Gemma Frisius had indeed, in 1532, projected a method of finding the longitude by means of watches, which at that time were newly invented: but the structure of these machines was then by far too imperfect to admit of any attempt; nor even\nin 1631, when Metius made an attempt to this purpose, were they advanced in any considerable degree. About the year 1664, Dr Hooke and Mr Huygens made a very great improvement in watchmaking, by the application of the pendulum spring. Dr Hooke having quarrelled with the ministry, no experiment was made with any of his machines; but many were made with those of Mr Huygens. One experiment particularly, made by Major Holmes, in a voyage from the coast of Guinea in 1665, answered so well, that Mr Huygens was encouraged to improve the structure of his watches; but it was found that the variations of heat and cold produced such alterations in the rate of going of the watch, that unless this could be remedied, the watches could be of little use in determining the longitude.\n\nIn 1714 Henry Sully, an Englishman, printed a small tract at Vienna upon the subject of watchmaking. Having afterwards removed to Paris, he applied himself to the improvement of time-keepers for the discovery of the longitude. He taught the famous Julian de Roy; and this gentleman, with his son, and M. Berthoud, are the only persons who since the days of Sully, have turned their thoughts this way. But though experiments have been made at sea with some of their watches, it does not appear that they have been able to accomplish anything of importance with regard to the main point. The first who succeeded in any considerable degree was Mr John Harrison; who, in 1726, produced a watch which went so exactly, that for ten years together it did not err above one second in a month. In 1736 it was tried in a voyage to Lisbon and back again, on board one of his majesty's ships; during which it corrected an error of a degree and a half in the computation of the ship's reckoning. In consequence of this he received public encouragement to go on; and by the year 1761 had finished three time-keepers, each of them more accurate than the former. The last turned out so much to his satisfaction, that he now applied to the commissioners of longitude for leave to make an experiment with his watch in a voyage to the West Indies. Permission being granted, his son Mr William Harrison set out in his majesty's ship the Deptford for Jamaica in the month of November 1761. This trial was attended with all imaginable success. The longitude of the island, as determined by the time-keeper, differed from that found by astronomical observations only one minute and a quarter of the equator; the longitudes of places seen by the way being also determined with great exactness. On the ship's return to England, it was found to have erred no more during the whole voyage than $1' 54''$ in time, which is little more than 28 miles in distance; which being within the limits prescribed by the act, the inventor claimed the whole 20,000l. offered by government. Objections to this, however, were soon started. Doubts were pretended about the real longitude of Jamaica, as well as the manner in which the time had been found both there and at Portsmouth. It was alleged also, that although the time-keeper happened to be right at Jamaica, and after its return to England, this was by no means a proof that it had always been so in the intermediate times; in consequence of which allegations, another trial was appointed in a voyage to Barbadoes. Precautions were now taken to obviate as many of these objections as possible. The commissioners sent out proper persons to make astronomical observations at that island; which, when compared with others in England, would ascertain beyond a doubt its true situation. In 1764 then, Mr Harrison junior set sail for Barbadoes; and the result of the experiment was, that the difference of longitude between Portsmouth and Barbadoes was shown by the time-keeper to be $3h. 55' 3''$; and by astronomical observations to be $3h. 54' 20''$; the error being now only $43''$ of time, or $10' 45''$ of longitude. In consequence of this and the former trials, Mr Harrison received one half of the reward promised, upon making a discovery of the principles upon which his time-keepers were constructed. He was likewise promised the other half of the reward as soon as time-keepers should be constructed by other artists which should answer the purpose as well as those of Mr Harrison himself. At this time he delivered up all his time-keepers, the last of which was sent to Greenwich to be tried by Mr Nevil Maskelyne, the astronomer-royal. On trial, however, it was found to go with much less regularity than had been expected; but Mr Harrison attributed this to his having made some experiments with it which he had not time to finish when he was ordered to deliver up the watch. Soon after this, an agreement was made by the commissioners with Mr Kendall to construct a watch upon Mr Harrison's principles; and this upon trial was found to answer the purpose even better than any that Harrison himself had constructed. This watch was sent out with Captain Cook in 1772; and during all the time of his voyage round the world in 1772, 1773, 1774, and 1775, never erred quite $14\\frac{1}{2}$ seconds per day; in consequence of which, the house of commons, in 1774, ordered the other 10,000l. to be paid to Mr Harrison. Still greater accuracy, however, has been attained. A watch was lately constructed by Mr Arnold, which, during a trial of 13 months, from February 1779 to February 1780, varied no more than $6.69''$ during any two days; and the greatest difference between its rates of going on any day and the next to it was $4.11''$. The greatest error it would have committed therefore in the longitude during any single day would have been very little more than one minute of longitude; and thus might the longitude be determined with as great exactness as the latitude generally can.—This watch, however, has not yet been tried at sea.\n\nThus the method of constructing time-keepers for discovering the longitude seems to be brought to as great a degree of perfection as can well be expected. Still, however, as these watches are subject to accidents, and may thus alter the rate of their going without any possibility of a discovery, it is necessary that some other method should be fallen upon, in order to correct from time to time those errors which may arise either from the natural going of the watch, or from any accident which may happen to it. Methods of this kind are all founded upon celestial observations of some kind or other; and for these methods, or even for an improvement in time-keepers, rewards are still held out by government. After the discoveries made by Mr Harrison, the act concerning the longitude was repealed, excepting so much of it as related to the constructing, printing, publishing, &c. of nautical almanacs and other useful tables. It was enacted also,\nLongitude, that any person who shall discover a method for finding the longitude by means of a time-keeper, the principles of which have not hitherto been made public, shall be entitled to a reward of £5000. If, after certain trials made by the commissioners, the said method shall enable a ship to keep her longitude during a voyage of six months, within 60 geographical miles, or a degree of a great circle. If the ship keeps her longitude within 40 geographical miles for that time, the inventor is entitled to a reward of £3000, and to £10,000, if the longitude is kept within half a degree. If the method is by improved astronomical tables, the author is entitled to £5000, when they show the distance of the moon from the sun and stars within 15 seconds of a degree, answering to about 7 minutes of longitude, after allowing half a degree for errors of observation and under certain restrictions, and after comparison with astronomical observations for a period of 18½ years, during which the lunar irregularities are supposed to be completed. The same rewards are offered to the person who shall with the like accuracy discover any other method of finding the longitude.\n\nThese methods require celestial observations; and any of the phenomena, such as the different apparent places of stars with regard to the moon, the beginning and ending of eclipses, &c., will answer the purpose: only it is absolutely necessary that some variation should be perceptible in the phenomenon in the space of two minutes; for even this short space of time will produce an error of 30 miles in longitude. The most proper phenomena therefore for determining the longitude in this manner are the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. Tables of their motions have been constructed, and carefully corrected from time to time, as the mutual attractions of these bodies are found greatly to disturb the regularity of their motions. The difficulty here, however, is to observe these eclipses at sea; and this difficulty has been found so great, that no person seems able to surmount it. The difficulty arises from the violent agitation of a ship in the ocean, for which no adequate remedy has ever yet been found, nor probably will ever be found. Mr. Christopher Irwin indeed invented a machine which he called a marine chair, with a view to prevent the effects of this agitation; but on trying it in a voyage to Barbadoes, it was found to be totally useless.\n\nA whimsical method of finding the longitude was proposed by Messrs. Whitton and Ditton from the report and flaw of great guns. The motion of sound is known to be nearly equable, from whatever body it proceeds or whatever be the medium. Supposing therefore a mortar to be fired at any place the longitude of which is known, the difference between the moment that the flash is seen and the report heard will give the distances between the two places; whence, if we know the latitudes of these places, their longitudes must also be known. If the exact time of the explosion be known at the place where it happens, the difference of time at the place where it is heard will likewise give the difference of longitude. Let us next suppose the mortar to be loaded with an iron shell filled with combustible matter, and fired perpendicularly upward into the air, the shell will be carried to the height of a mile, and will be seen at the distance of near 100; whence, supposing neither the flash of the Longitude mortar should be seen nor the report heard, still the longitude might be determined by the altitude of the shell above the horizon.\n\nAccording to this plan, mortars were to be fired at certain times and at proper stations along all frequented coasts for the direction of mariners. This indeed might be of use, and in stormy weather might be a kind of improvement in lighthouses, or a proper addition to them; but with regard to the determination of longitudes, is evidently ridiculous.\n\nWe shall now proceed to give some practical directions for finding the longitude at sea by proper celestial observations; exclusive of those from Jupiter's satellites, which, for reasons just mentioned, cannot be practised at sea. In the first place, however, it will be necessary to point out some of those difficulties which stand in the way, and which render even this method of finding the longitude precarious and uncertain. These lie principally in the reduction of the observations of the heavenly bodies made on the surface of the earth to similar observations supposed to be made at the centre; which is the only place where the celestial bodies appear in their proper situation. It is also very difficult to make proper allowances for the refraction of the atmosphere, by which all objects appear higher than they really are; and another difficulty arises from their parallaxes, which make them, particularly the moon, appear lower than they would otherwise do, excepting when they are in the very zenith. It is also well known, that the nearer the horizon any celestial body is, the greater its parallax will be; and as the parallax and refraction act in opposite ways to one another, the former depressing and the latter raising the object, it is plain, that great difficulties must arise from this circumstance. The sun, for instance, whose parallax is less than the refraction, must always appear higher than he really is; but the moon, whose parallax is greater than her refraction, must always appear lower.\n\nTo render observations of the celestial bodies more easy, the commissioners of longitude have caused an Ephemeris or Nautical Almanack to be published annually, containing every requisite for solving this important problem which can be put into the form of tables. But whatever may be done in this way, it will be necessary to make the necessary preparations concerning the dip of the horizon, the refraction, semidiameters, parallax, &c., in order to reduce the apparent to the true altitudes and distances; for which we shall here subjoin two general rules.\n\nThe principal observation for finding the longitude at sea is that of the moon from the sun, or from some remarkable star near the zodiac. To do this, the operator must be furnished with a watch which can be depended upon for keeping time within a minute for six hours; and with a good Hadley's quadrant, or, which is preferable, a sextant; and this last instrument will still be more fit for the purpose if it be furnished with a screw for moving the index gradually; likewise an additional dark glass, but not so dark as the common kind, for taking off the glare of the moon's light in observing her distance from a star. A small telescope, which may magnify three or four times, is also necessary to render the contact of a star with the moon's limb more discernible. A magnifying glass of\nLongitude, one and a half or two inches focus will likewise assist the operator in reading off his observations with the greater facility.\n\n1. To make the observation. Having examined and adjusted his instrument as well as possible, the observer is next to proceed in the following manner: If the distance of the moon from the sun is to be observed, turn down one of the screens; look at the moon directly through the transparent part of the horizon-glass; and keeping her in view, gently move the index till the sun's image be brought into the silvered part of that glass. Bring the nearest limbs of both objects into contact, and let the quadrant librate a little on the lunar ray; by which means the sun will appear to rise and fall by the side of the moon; in which motion the nearest limbs must be made to touch one another exactly by moving the index. The observation is then made; and the division coinciding with that on the Vernier scale, will show the distance of the nearest limbs of the objects.\n\nWhen the distance of the moon from a star is to be observed when the moon is very bright, turn down the lightest screen, or use a dark glass lighter than the screens, and designed for this particular purpose; look at the star directly through the transparent part of the horizon-glass; and keeping it there, move the index till the moon's image is brought into the silvered part of the same glass. Make the quadrant librate gently on the star's ray, and the moon will appear to rise and fall by the star; move the index between the librations, until the moon's enlightened limb is exactly touched by the star, and then the observation is made. In these operations, the plane of the quadrant must always pass through the two objects, the distance of which is to be observed; and for this purpose it must be placed in various positions according to the situation of the objects, which will soon be rendered easy by practice.\n\nThe observation being made, somebody at the very instant that the operator calls must observe by the watch the exact hour, minute, and quarter minute, if there be no second hand, in order to find the apparent time; and at the same instant, or as quick as possible, two assistants must take the altitudes of those objects the distance of which is observed; after which, the observations necessary for finding the longitude are completed.\n\nThe Ephemeris shows the moon's distance from the sun, and likewise from proper stars, to every three hours of apparent time for the meridian of Greenwich; and that the greater number of opportunities of observing this luminary may be given, her distance is generally set down from at least one object on each side of her. Her distance from the sun is let down while it is between 40 and 120 degrees; so that, by means of a sextant, it may be observed for two or three days after her first and before her last quarter. When the moon is between 40 and 90 degrees from the sun, her distance is set down both from the sun and from a star on the contrary side; and, lastly, when the distance is above 120 degrees, the distance is set down from two stars, one on each side of her. The distance of the moon from objects on the east side of her is found in the Ephemeris in the 8th and 9th pages of the month; and her distance from objects on the west is found in the 10th Longitude and 11th pages of the month.\n\nWhen the Ephemeris is used, the distance of the moon must only be observed from those stars the distance of which is set down there; and these afford a ready means of knowing the star from which her distance ought to be observed. The observer has then nothing more to do than to let his index to the distance roughly computed at the apparent time, estimated nearly for the meridian at Greenwich; after which he is to look to the east or west of the moon, according as the distance of the star is found in the 8th or 9th, or in the 10th or 11th, pages of the month; and having found the moon upon the horizon-glass, the star will easily be found by sweeping with the quadrant to the right or left, provided the air be clear and the star be in the line of the moon's shortest axis produced. The time at Greenwich is estimated by turning into time the supposed longitude from that place, and adding it to the apparent time at the ship, or subtracting it from it as occasion requires. The distance of the moon from the sun, or a star, is roughly found at this time, by saying, As 180 minutes (the number contained in three hours) is to the difference in minutes between this nearly estimated time and the next preceding time set down in the Ephemeris; so is the difference in minutes between the distance in the Ephemeris for the next preceding and next following times, to a number of minutes; which being added to the next preceding distance, or subtracted from it, according as it is increasing or decreasing, will give the distance nearly at the time the observation is to be made, and to which the index must be set.\n\nAn easier method of finding the angular distance is by bringing the objects nearly into contact in the common way, and then fixing the index tight to a certain degree and minute; waiting until the objects are nearly in contact, giving notice to the assistants to get ready with the altitudes, and when the objects are exactly in contact to call for the altitudes and the exact time by the watch. The observer may then prepare for taking another distance, by setting his index three or four minutes backwards or forwards, as the objects happen to be receding from or approaching to each other; thus proceeding to take the distance, altitudes, and time by the watch, as before. Thus the observer may take as many distances as he thinks proper; but four at the distance of three minutes, or three at the distance of four minutes, will at all times be sufficient. Thus not only the eye of the observer will be less fatigued, but he will likewise be enabled to manage his instrument with much greater facility in every direction, a vertical one only excepted. If in taking the distances the middle one can be taken at any even division on the arch, such as a degree, or a degree and 20 or 40 minutes, that distance will be independent of the Nonius division, and consequently free of those errors which frequently arise from the inequality of that division in several parts of the graduated arch. The observation ought always to be made about two hours before or after noon; and the true time may be found by the altitude of the sun taken at the precise time of the distance. If three distances are taken, then\nLongitude; then find the time by the altitude corresponding with the middle distance; and thus the observation will be secured from any error arising from the irregularity of the going of the watch. As the time, however, found by the altitude of a star cannot be depended upon, because of the uncertainty of the horizon in the night, the best way of determining the time for a night observation will be by two altitudes of the sun; one taken on the preceding afternoon, before he is within six degrees of the horizon; and the other on the next morning, when he is more than six degrees high. It must be observed, however, that in order to follow these directions, it is necessary that the atmosphere should be pretty free from clouds; otherwise the observer must take the observations at such times as he can best obtain them.\n\n2. To reduce the observed Distance of the Sun or a Star from the Moon to the true Distance. 1. Turn the longitude into time, and add it to the time at the ship if the longitude be west, but subtract it if it be east, which will give the supposed time at Greenwich; and this we may call reduced time. 2. Find the nearest noon or midnight both before and after the reduced time in the seventh page of the month in the Ephemeris. 3. Take out the moon's semidiameter and horizontal parallaxes corresponding to these noons and midnights, and find their differences. Then say, As 12 hours is to the moon's semidiameter in 12 hours, so is the reduced time to a number of seconds; which, either added to or subtracted from the moon's semidiameter at the noon or midnight just mentioned, according as it is increasing or decreasing, will give her apparent semidiameter; to which add the correction from Table VIII. of the Ephemeris, and the sum will be her true semidiameter at the reduced time. And as 12 hours is to the difference of the moon's horizontal parallax in 12 hours, so is the reduced time to a fourth number; which, being added to or subtracted from the moon's horizontal parallax at the noon or midnight before the reduced time, according as it is increasing or decreasing, the sum or difference will be the moon's horizontal parallax at the reduced time. 4. If the reduced time be nearly any even part of 12 hours, viz., 6th, 3rd, etc., these parts of the difference may be taken, and either added or subtracted according to the directions already given, without being at the trouble of working by the rule of proportion. 5. To the observed altitude of the sun's lower limb add the difference between his semidiameter and dip; and that sum will be his apparent altitude. 6. From the sun's refraction take his parallax in altitude, and the remainder will be the correction of the sun's altitude. 7. From the star's observed altitude take the dip of the horizon, and the remainder will be the apparent altitude. 8. The refraction of a star will be the correction of its altitude. 9. Take the difference between the moon's semidiameter and dip, and add it to the observed altitude if her lower limb was taken, or subtract it if her upper limb was taken; and the sum or difference will be the apparent altitude of her centre. 10. From the proportional logarithm of the moon's horizontal parallax, taken out of the nautical almanack (increasing its index by 10), take the logarithmic cosine of the moon's apparent altitude, the remainder will be the proportional logarithm of her parallax in altitude; from which take her refraction, and the remainder will be the correction of the moon's altitude. 11. To the observed distance of the moon from a star add her semidiameter if the nearest limb be taken, but subtract it if the farthest limb was taken, and the sum or difference will be the apparent distance. 12. To the observed distance of the sun and moon add both their semidiameters, and the sum will be the apparent distance of their centres.\n\n3. To find the true Distance of the Objects, having their apparent Altitudes and Distances. 1. To the proportional logarithm of the correction of the sun or star's altitude, add the logarithmic cosine of the sun or star's apparent altitude; the logarithmic sine of the apparent distance of the moon from the sun or star; and the logarithmic cotangent of the moon's apparent altitude. The sum of these, rejecting 30 from the index, will be the proportional logarithm of the first angle. 2. To the proportional logarithm of the correction of the sun or star's altitude, add the logarithmic cotangent of the sun or star's apparent altitude, and the logarithmic tangent of the apparent distance of the moon from the sun or star. The sum of these, rejecting 20 in the index, will be the proportional logarithm of the second angle. 3. Take the difference between the first and second angles, adding it to the apparent distance if it be less than 90, and the first angle be greater than the second; but subtracting it if the second be greater than the first. If the distance be greater than 90, the sum of the angles must be added to the apparent distance, which will give the distance corrected for the refraction of the sun or star. 4. To the proportional logarithm of the correction of the moon's altitude add the logarithmic cosine of her apparent altitude; the logarithmic sine of the distance corrected for the sun or star's refraction and the logarithmic cotangent of the sun's or star's apparent altitude. The sum, rejecting 30 in the index, will be the proportional logarithm of the third angle. 5. To the proportional logarithm of the correction of the moon's apparent altitude, add the logarithmic cotangent of her apparent altitude, and the tangent of the distance corrected for the sun or star's refraction; their sum, rejecting 20 in the index, will be the proportional logarithm of the fourth angle. 6. Take the difference between the third and fourth angles, and subtract it from the distance corrected for the sun or star's refraction if less than 90, and the third angle be greater than the fourth; or add it to the distance if the fourth angle be greater than the third: but if the distance be more than 90, the sum of the angles must be subtracted from it, to give the distance corrected for the sun or star's refraction, and the principal effects of the moon's parallax. 7. In Table XX. of the Ephemeris, look for the distance corrected for the sun and star's refraction, and the moon's parallax in the top column, and the correction of her altitude in the left-hand side column; take out the number of seconds that stand under the former, and opposite to the latter. Look again in the same table for the corrected distance in the top column, and the principal effects of the moon's parallax in the left-hand side column, and take out the number of seconds. The difference between these two numbers...\nLongitude numbers must be added to the corrected distance if less than 90, but subtracted from it if greater; and the sum or difference will be the true distance.\n\n4. To determine the Longitude after having obtained the true Distance. Look in the Ephemeris among the distances of the objects for the computed distance betwixt the moon and the other object observed on the given day. If it be found there, the time at Greenwich will be at the top of the column; but if it falls between two distances in the Ephemeris which stand immediately before and after it, and also the difference between the distance standing before and the computed distance; then take the proportional logarithms of the first and second differences, and the difference between these two logarithms will be the proportional logarithm of a number of hours, minutes, and seconds; which being added to the time standing over the first distance, will give the true time at Greenwich. Or it may be found by saying, As the first difference is to three hours, so is the second difference to a proportional part of time; which being added as above directed, will give the time at Greenwich. The difference between Greenwich time and that at the ship, turned into longitude, will be that at the time the observations were made; and will be east if the time at the ship is greatest, but west if it is least.\n\nHaving given these general directions, we shall next proceed to show some particular examples of finding the longitude at sea by all the different methods in which it is usually tried.\n\n1. To find the Longitude by Computation from the Ship's Course.—Were it possible to keep an accurate account of the distance the ship has run, and to measure it exactly by the log* or any other means, then both latitude and longitude would easily be found by settling the ship's account to that time. For the course and distance being known, the difference of latitude and departure is readily found by the Traverse Table: and the difference of longitude being known, the true longitude and latitude will also be known. A variety of causes, however, concur to render this computation inaccurate; particularly the ship's continual deflection from the course set by her playing to the right and left round her centre of gravity; the unequal care of those at the helm, and the distance supposed to be sailed being erroneous, on account of stormy seas, unsteady winds, currents, &c., for which it seems impossible to make any allowance. The place of the ship, however, is judged of by finding the latitude every day, if possible, by observations; and if the latitude found by observation agrees with that by the reckoning, it is presumed that the ship's place is properly determined; but if they disagree, it is concluded that the account of the longitude stands in need of correction, as the latitude by observation is always to be depended upon.\n\nCurrents very often occasion errors in the computation of a ship's place. The causes of these in the great depths of the ocean are not well known, though many of the motions near the shore can be accounted for. It is supposed that some of those in the great oceans are owing to the tide following the moon, and a certain libration of the waters arising from thence; likewise that the unsettled nature of these currents may be owing to the changes in the moon's declination. In the torrid zone, however, a considerable current is occasioned by the trade winds, the motion being constantly to the west, at the rate of eight or ten miles per day. At the extremities of the trade winds or near the 30th degree of north or south latitude, the currents are probably compounded of this motion to the westward, and of one towards the equator; whence all ships sailing within these limits ought to allow a course each day for the current.\n\nWhen the error is supposed to have been occasioned by a current, it ought if possible to be tried whether the case is so or not; or we must make a reasonable estimate of its drift and course. Then with the setting and drift, as a course and distance, find the difference of latitude and departure; with which the dead reckoning is to be increased or diminished; and if the latitude thus corrected agrees with that by observation, the departure thus corrected may be safely taken as true, and thus the ship's place with regard to the longitude determined.\n\nExam. Suppose a ship in 24 hours finds, by her dead reckoning, that she has made 96 miles of difference of latitude north and 38 miles of departure west; but by observation finds her difference of latitude 112, and on trial that there is a current which in 24 hours makes a difference of 16 miles latitude north and 10 miles of departure east: Required the ship's departure.\n\n| Miles | Departure by account | Miles |\n|-------|----------------------|-------|\n| Diff. lat. by account | 96 N. | Departure by current | 38 W. |\n| Diff. lat. by current | 16 N. | Departure by current | 10 |\n| True diff. lat. | 112 | Departure by current | 28 W. |\n\nHere the dead reckoning corrected by the current gives the difference of latitude 112 miles, which is the same as that found by observation; whence the departure 28 is taken as the true one.\n\nWhen the error is supposed to arise from the courses and distances, we must observe, that if the difference of latitude is much more than the departure, or the direct course has been within three points of the meridian, the error is most probably in the distance. But if the departure be much greater than the difference of latitude, or the direct course be within three points of the parallel, or more than five points from the meridian, the error is probably to be ascribed to the course. But if the courses in general are near the middle of the quadrant, the error may be either in the course, or in the distance, or both. This method admits of three cases.\n\n1. When, by the dead reckoning, the difference of latitude is more than once and a half the departure; or when the course is less than three points: Find the course to the difference of latitude and departure. With this course and the meridional difference of latitude by observation, find the difference of longitude.\n\n2. When the dead reckoning is more than once and a half the difference of latitude; or when the course is more than five points: Find the course and distance, with the difference of latitude by observation, and departure by account; then with the co-middle latitude by observation, and departure by account, find the difference of longitude.\n\n3. When...\n3. When the difference of latitude and departure by account is nearly equal, or the direct course is between three and five points of the meridian: Find the course with the difference of latitude and departure by account since the last observation. With this course and the difference of latitude by observation find another departure. Take half the sum of these departures for the true one. With the true departure and difference of latitude by observation find the true course; then with the true course and meridional difference of latitude find the difference of longitude.\n\n2. To find the Longitude at Sea by a Variation chart.—Dr Halley having collected a great number of observations on the variation of the needle in many parts of the world; by that means was enabled to draw certain lines on Mercator's chart, shewing the variation in all the places over which they passed in the year 1709, at which time he first published the chart; whence the longitude of those places might be found by the chart, provided its latitude and variation were given. The rule is, Draw a parallel of latitude on the chart through the latitude found by observation; and the point where it cuts the curved line marked with the variation that was observed will be the ship's place.\n\nExam. A ship finds by observation the latitude to be $18^\\circ 20'$ north, and the variation of the compass to be $4^\\circ$ west. Required the ship's place.—Lay a ruler over $18^\\circ 20'$ north parallel to the equator; and the point where its edge cuts the curve of $4^\\circ$ west variation gives the ship's place, which will be found in about $27^\\circ 10'$ west from London.\n\nThis method of finding the longitude, however, is attended with two inconveniences. 1. That when the variation lines run east or west, or nearly so, it cannot be applied; though as this happens only in certain parts of the world, a variation chart may be of great use for the rest. Even in those places indeed where the variation curves do run east or west, they may be of considerable use in correcting the latitude when meridian observations cannot be had; which frequently happens on the northern coasts of America, the Western ocean, and about Newfoundland; for if the variation can be found exactly, the east and west curve answering to it will show the latitude. But, 2. The variation itself is subject to continual change; whence a chart, though ever so perfect at first, must in time become totally useless; and hence the charts constructed by Dr Halley, though of great utility at their first publication, became at length almost entirely useless. A new one was published in 1746 by Messrs Montague and Dodson, which was so well received, that in 1756 they again drew variation lines for that year, and published a third chart the year following. They also presented to the Royal Society a curious paper concerning the variation of the magnetic needle, with a set of tables annexed, containing the result of more than 50,000 observations, in five periodical reviews from the year 1700 to 1756 inclusive, adapted to every five degrees of latitude and longitude in the more frequented oceans; all of which were published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1757.\n\n3. To find the Longitude by the Sun's Declination.—Having made such observations on the sun as may enable us to find his declination at the place, take the difference between this computed declination and that shown at London by the Ephemeris; from which take also the daily difference of declination at that time; then say, as the daily difference of declination is to the above found difference, so is 360 degrees to the difference of longitude. In this method, however, a small error in the declination will make a great one in the longitude.\n\n4. To find the Longitude by the Moon's culminating.—Seek in the Ephemeris for the time of her coming to the meridian on the given day and on the day following, and take their difference; also take the difference between the times of culminating on the same day as found in the ephemeris and as observed; then say, as the daily difference in the ephemeris is to the difference between the ephemeris and observation; so is 360 degrees to the difference of longitude. In this method also a small difference in the culmination will occasion a great one in the longitude.\n\n5. By Eclipses of the Moon.—This is done much in the same manner as by the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites: For if, in two or more distant places where an eclipse of the moon is visible, we carefully observe the times of the beginning and ending, the number of digits eclipsed, or the time when the shadow touches some remarkable spot, or when it leaves any particular spot on the moon, the difference of the times when the observations were made will give the difference of longitude. Phenomena of this kind, however, occur too seldom to be of much use.\n\n6. In the 76th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, Mr Edward Pigot gives a very particular account of his method of determining the longitude and latitude of York; in which he also recommends the method of determining the longitude of places by observations of the moon's transit over the meridian. The instruments used in his observations were a gridiron pendulum clock, a two feet and a half reflector, an eighteen inch quadrant made by Mr Bird, and a transit instrument made by Mr Sisson.\n\nBy these instruments an observation was made, on the 10th of September 1783, of the occultation of a star of the ninth magnitude by the moon, during an eclipse of that planet, at York and Paris. Besides this, there were observations made of the immersions of $\\phi$ Aquarii and $\\beta$ Piscium; the result of all which was, that between Greenwich and York the difference of meridians was $4' 27''$.\n\nIn 1783, Mr Pigot informs us, that he thought of finding the difference of meridians by observing the meridian right ascensions of the moon's limb. This he thought had been quite original: but he found it afterwards in the Nautical Almanack for 1769, and in 1784 read a pamphlet on the same subject by the abbe Toaldo; but still found that the great exactness of this method was not suspected; though he is convinced that it must soon be universally adopted in preference to that from the first satellite of Jupiter.\n\nAfter giving a number of observations on the satellites of Jupiter, he concludes, that the exactness expected from observations, even on the first satellite, is much overrated. \"Among the various objections (says he), there is one I have often experienced, and which proceeds solely from the disposition of the eye, that of seeing more distinctly at one time than another. It may not be improper also to mention, that the obser-\nLongitude I should have relied on as the best, that of August 30, 1785, marked excellent, is one of those most distant from the truth.\"\n\nAfter giving a number of observations on the eclipse of the moon September 10, 1783, our author concludes, that the eclipses of the moon's spots are in general too much neglected, and that it might be relied upon much more were the following circumstances attended to:\n\n1. To be particular in specifying the clearness of the sky.\n2. To choose such spots as are well defined, and leave no hesitation as to the part eclipsed.\n3. That every observer should use, as far as possible, telescopes equally powerful, or at least let the magnifying powers be the same.\n4. A principal objection (says he) may still be urged, viz., the difficulty of distinguishing the true shadow from the penumbra. Was this obviated, I believe the results would be more exact than from Jupiter's first satellite: Undoubtedly the shadow appears better defined if magnified little; but I am much inclined to think, that, with high magnifying powers, there is greater certainty of choosing the same part of the shadow, which perhaps is more than a sufficient compensation for the loss of distinctness.\n\nThe following rule for meridian observations of the moon's limb is next laid down: \"The increase of the moon's right ascension in twelve hours (or any given time found by computation), is to 12 hours as the increase of the moon's right ascension between two places found by observation is to the difference of meridians.\n\nExample.\nNovember 30, 1782.\n\n| h | m | s | Meridian transit of moon's second limb | By clock at Greenwich |\n|---|---|---|--------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| 13 | 12 | 57.62 | Ditto of a yr. | 31.46 Difference of right ascension |\n\n| h | m | s | Meridian transit of moon's second limb | By clock at York |\n|---|---|---|--------------------------------------|------------------|\n| 13 | 14 | 8.05 | Ditto of a yr. | 32.08 Difference at York |\n| 13 | 14 | 30.13 | Ditto of a yr. | 31.46 Difference at Greenwich |\n\n9.38 Increase of the moon's apparent right ascension between Greenwich and York, by observation.\n\n141\" in seconds of a degree, ditto, ditto, ditto.\n\nThe increase of the moon's right ascension for 12 hours, by computation, is 23,340 seconds; and 12 hours reduced into seconds is 43,200. Therefore, according to the rule stated above,\n\n\\[ \\frac{23,340}{43,200} = \\text{diff. of merid.} = 261\" \\]\n\n\"These easy observations and short reduction (says Mr Pigot) are the whole of the business. Instead of computing the moon's right ascension for 12 hours, I have constantly taken it from the Nautical Almanacs, which give it sufficiently exact, provided some attention be paid to the increase or decrease of the moon's motion. Were the following circumstances attended to, the results would be undoubtedly much more exact.\n\n1. Compare the observations with the same made in several other places.\n2. Let several and the same stars be observed at these places.\n3. Such stars as are nearest in right ascension and declination to the moon are infinitely preferable.\n4. It cannot be too strongly urged, to get, as near as possible, an equal number of observations of each limb, to take a mean of each set, and then a mean of both means. This will in a great measure correct the error of telescopes and light.\n5. The adjustment of the telescopes to the eye of the observer before the observation is also very necessary, as the light is subject to vary.\n6. A principal error proceeds from the observation of the moon's limb, which may be considerably lessened, if certain little round spots near each limb were also observed in settled observatories; in which case the libration of the moon will perhaps be a consideration.\n7. When the difference of meridians, or of the latitudes of places, is very considerable, the change of the moon's diameter becomes an equation.\n\nThough such are the requisites to use this method with advantage, only one or two of them have been employed in the observations that I have reduced. Two thirds of these observations had not even the same stars observed at Greenwich and York; and yet none of the results, except a doubtful one, differ 15\" from the mean; therefore I think we may expect a still greater exactness, perhaps within 10\", if the above particulars be attended to.\n\nWhen the same stars are not observed, it is necessary for the observers at both places to compute their right ascension from tables, in order to get the apparent right ascension of the moon's limb. Though this is not so satisfactory as by actual observation, still the difference will be trifling, provided the star's right ascensions are accurately settled. I am also of opinion, that the same method can be put in practice by travellers with little trouble, and a transit instrument, constructed so as to fix up with facility in any place. It is not necessary, perhaps, that the instrument should be perfectly in the meridian for a few seconds of time, provided stars, nearly in the same parallel of declination with the moon, are observed; nay, I am inclined to think, that if the instrument deviates even a quarter or half a degree, or more, sufficient exactness can be attained; as a table might be computed, showing the moon's parallax and motion for such deviation; which last may easily be found, by the well-known method of observing stars whose difference of declination is considerable.\n\nAs travellers very seldom meet with situations to observe stars near the pole, or find a proper object for determining the error of the line of collimation, I shall recommend the following method as original.—Having computed the apparent right ascension of four, six, or more stars, which have nearly the same parallel of declination, observe half of them with the instrument inverted, and the other half when in its right position. If the difference of right ascensions between each set by observation agrees with the computation, there is no error; but if they disagree, half that disagreement is the error of the line of collimation. The same observations may also serve to determine,\nLongitude, mine, whether the distances of the corresponding wires are equal. In case of necessity, each limb of the sun might be observed in the same manner, though probably with less precision. By a single trial I made above two years ago, the result was much more exact than I expected. Mayer's catalogue of stars will prove of great use to those who adopt the above method.—I am rather surprised that the immersions of known stars of the fifth and seventh magnitude, behind the dark limb of the moon, are not constantly observed in fixed observatories, as they would frequently be of great use.\n\nThe annexed rule for finding the ship's place, with the miscellaneous observations on different methods, were drawn up by Mr John McLean of Edinburgh.\n\n1. With regard to determining the ship's place by the help of the course and distance failed, the following rule may be applied.—It will be found as expeditious as any of the common methods by the middle latitude or meridional parts; and is in some respects preferable, as the common tables of sines and tangents only are requisite in applying it.—Let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be the distances of two places from the same pole in degrees, or their complete latitude; \\(c\\) the angle which a meridian makes with the rhumb line passing through the places; and \\(L\\) the angle formed by their meridians, or the difference of longitude in minutes: then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) being the logarithmic tangents of \\(\\frac{a}{S}\\) and \\(\\frac{b}{S}\\), \\(S\\) the sine of \\(C\\), and \\(S\\) the sine of \\((C + r)\\), we shall have the following equation:\n\n\\[\nL = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{S - S'}, (A).\n\\]\n\nAlso, from a well-known property of the rhumb line, we have the following equation:\n\n\\[\nS + E = R + D, \\text{ where } S \\text{ is the logarithmic cosine of } C, E \\text{ the logarithm of the length of the rhumb line, or distance, } D \\text{ the logarithm of the minute's difference of latitude, and } R \\text{ the logarithm of the radius.}\n\\]\n\nBy the help of these two equations, we shall have an easy solution of the several cases to which the middle latitude, or meridional parts, are commonly applied.\n\nExam. A ship from a port in latitude \\(56^\\circ N\\) sails \\(S.W.\\) by \\(W.\\) till she arrives at the latitude of \\(48^\\circ N\\): Required the difference of longitude?\n\nHere \\(a = 34^\\circ\\), \\(b = 50^\\circ\\), \\(c = 56^\\circ 15'\\), \\(A = 9.48534\\), \\(B = 9.56107\\), \\(S = 9.9199308\\), \\(S' = 9.9198464\\); therefore,\n\n\\[\nL = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{S - S'} = \\frac{757300}{844} = 897 \\text{ the minutes difference of longitude.}\n\\]\n\nAlso, \\(S = 9.74474\\), \\(D = 2.98227\\); therefore \\(E = R + D - S = 3.23753\\), to which the natural number is 1728, the miles in the rhumb line failed over.\n\n2. The common method of finding the difference of longitude made good upon several courses and distances, by means of the difference of latitude and departure made good upon the several courses, is not accurately true.\n\nFor example: If a ship should fail due south 600 miles, from a port in \\(60^\\circ\\) north latitude, and then due west 600 miles, the difference of longitude found by the common methods of solution would be 1053; whereas Longitude, the true difference of longitude is only 933, less than the former by 120 miles, which is more than one eighth of the whole. Indeed, every considerable alteration in the course will produce a very sensible error in the difference of longitude. Though, when the several rhumb lines failed over are nearly in the same direction, the error in longitude will be but small.\n\nThe reason of this will easily appear from the annexed figure, in which the ship is supposed to sail from \\(Z\\) to \\(A\\), along the rhumb lines \\(ZB\\), \\(BA\\); for if the meridians \\(PZ\\), \\(PK\\), \\(BL\\) be drawn; and very near the latter other two meridians \\(PD\\), \\(PM\\); and likewise the parallels of latitude \\(Bn\\), \\(De\\), \\(mo\\), \\(hk\\); then it is plain that \\(De\\) is greater than \\(hk\\) (for \\(De\\) is to \\(hk\\) as the fine of \\(DP\\) to the fine of \\(hP\\)): and since this is the case everywhere, the departure corresponding to the distance \\(BZ\\) and course \\(BZC\\), will be greater than the departure to the distance \\(oZ\\) and course \\(oZC\\). And in the same manner, we prove that \\(nB\\) is greater than \\(mo\\); and consequently, the departure corresponding to the distance \\(AB\\), and course \\(ABL\\), is greater than the departure to the distance \\(Ao\\), and course \\(AoL\\). Wherefore, the sum of the two departures corresponding to the courses \\(ABL\\) and \\(BZC\\), and to the distances \\(AB\\) and \\(BZ\\), is greater than the departure corresponding to the distance \\(AZ\\) and course \\(AZC\\); therefore the course answering to this sum as a departure, and \\(CZ\\) as a difference of latitude, (\\(AC\\) being the parallel of latitudes passing through \\(A\\)), will be greater than the true course \\(AZC\\) made good upon the whole. And hence the difference of longitude found by the common rules will be greater than the true difference of longitudes; and the error will be greater or less according as \\(BA\\) deviates more or less from the direction of \\(BZ\\).\n\n3. Of determining the ship's longitude by lunar observations.\n\nSeveral rules for this purpose have been lately published, the principal object of which seems to have been\n\n(A) \\(A \\cdot B\\) signifies the difference between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\nLongitude, to abbreviate the computations requisite for determining the true distance of the sun or star from the moon's centre. This, however, should have certainly been less attended to than the investigation of a solution, in which considerable errors in the data may produce a small error in the required distance. When either of the luminaries has a small elevation, its altitude will be affected by the variations of the atmosphere; likewise the altitude, as given by the quadrant, will be affected by the inaccuracy of the instrument, and the uncertainty necessarily attending all observations made at sea. The sum of these errors, when they all tend the same way, may be supposed to amount to at least one minute in altitude; which, in many cases, according to the common rules for computing the true distance, will produce an error of about 30 minutes in the longitude. Thus, in the example given by Mons. Callet, in the Tables Portatives, if we suppose an error of one minute in the sun's altitude, or call it $6^\\circ 26' 34''$, instead of $6^\\circ 27' 34''$; we shall find the alteration in distance according to his rule to be $54''$, producing an error of about 27 minutes in the longitude; for the angle at the sun will be found, in the spherical triangle whose sides are the complement of the sun's altitude, complement of the moon's altitude, and observed distance, to be about $26^\\circ$; and as radius is to the cosine of $26^\\circ$, so is 16 the supposed error in altitude, to $54''$ the alteration in distance. Perhaps the only method of determining the distance, so as not to be affected by the errors of altitude, is that by first finding the angles at the sun and moon, and by the help of them the corrections of distance for parallax and refraction. The rule is as follows:\n\nAdd together the complement of the moon's apparent altitude, the complement of the sun's apparent altitude, and the apparent distance of centres; from half the sum of these subtract the complement of the sun's altitude, and add together the logarithmic cofactor of the complement of the moon's altitude, the logarithmic cofactor of the apparent distance of centres, the logarithmic sine of the half sum, and the logarithmic sine of the remainder; and half the sum of these four logarithms, after rejecting 20 from the index,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Cofec.} & = 0.02512 \\\\\n\\text{D's co. alt.} & = 70^\\circ 42' \\\\\n\\text{Cofec.} & = 0.11479 \\\\\n\\text{Obs. dist.} & = 50^\\circ 9' \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Sine} & = 9.98950 \\\\\n\\text{Rem.} & = 6^\\circ 45' \\\\\n\\text{Sine} & = 9.83688 \\\\\n\\text{Rem.} & = 43^\\circ 23' \\\\\n\\text{Cofec.} & = 9.98314 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Rad.} : \\text{Cofec.} & = 117^\\circ 48' : \\text{D's diff. parall. & refract.} \\\\\n\\text{Rad.} : \\text{Cofec.} & = 31^\\circ 48' : \\text{Star's refract.} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere\nHere the first correction of distance is additive, since the angle at the moon is obtuse; and the second correction is also additive, since the angle at the star is acute: therefore their sum $92^\\circ + 138'' = 1061'' = 17' 41''$, being added to $50^\\circ 8' 41''$, the apparent distance of the star from the moon's centre, gives $50^\\circ 26' 29''$ for the true distance of centres nearly; and $2 \\times L (d+S) - L (2L R+L 2+L D) = L 8''$, which, being added to the distance twice corrected, gives $50^\\circ 26' 29''$ for the true distance. By comparing this distance with the computed distances in the ephemeris, the time at Greenwich corresponding to that of observing the distance will be known; and the difference of those times being converted into degrees and minutes, at the rate of 15 degrees to the hour, will give the longitude of the place of observation; which will be east if the time at the place be greater than that at Greenwich, but west if it be less.\n\n**LONGITUDINAL**, in general, denotes something placed lengthwise: thus some of the fibres in the vessels of the human body are placed longitudinally, others transversely or across.\n\n**LONGOBARDI.** See Lombards.\n\n**LONGOMONTANUS, Christian,** a learned astronomer, born in a village of Denmark in 1562. He was the son of a ploughman; and was obliged to suffer during his studies all the hardships to which he could be exposed, dividing his time, like the philosopher Cænætes, between the cultivation of the earth and the lessons he received from the minister of the place. At last, when he was 15, he stole away from his family, and went to Wiburg, where there was a college, in which he spent 11 years; and though he was obliged to earn a livelihood, he applied himself to study with such ardour, that among other sciences he learned the mathematics in great perfection. He afterwards went to Copenhagen; where the professors of that university in a short time conceived so high an opinion of him, that they recommended him to the celebrated Tycho Brahe. Longomontanus lived eight years with that famous astronomer, and was of great service to him in his observations and calculations. At length, being extremely desirous of obtaining a professor's chair in Denmark, Tycho Brahe consented, though with some difficulty, to deprive himself of his service; gave him a discharge, filled with the highest testimonies of his esteem; and furnished him with money for the expense of his long journey. He obtained a professorship of mathematics in the university of Copenhagen in 1605; and discharged the duty of it worthily till his death, which happened in 1647. He wrote many learned works; amused himself with endeavouring to square the circle, and pretended that he had made that discovery; but Dr John Pell, an English mathematician, attacked him warmly on that subject, and proved that he was mistaken.\n\n**LONGTOWN,** a town of Cumberland, on the Scots borders, near the confluence of the Esk and Kirkhope, 10 miles from Carlisle, and 313 miles from London; it has a market on Thursday, and a charity school for 60 children, with two fairs in the year.\n\n**LONGUEVILLE,** a town of France, in the department of Lower Seine, and in the territory of Caen, situated on the small river Lee, 17 miles north of Rouen.\n\nIt has the title of a duchy.

This last was built and fortified by Louis XIV. It is seated on an eminence. It was taken by the king of Prussia in 1792, but retaken two months after. E. Long. 5° 58'. N. Lat. 49° 32'.\n\n**LONGUS,** a Greek sophist, author of a book entitled *Παράνυξ*, or *Pastorals*, or a romance containing the loves of Daphnis and Chloe. Huetius, bishop of Avranches, speaks very advantageously of this work; but he censures the obscene touches with which it is interspersed. None of the ancient authors mention him, so that the time when he lived cannot be certainly fixed. There is an English translation of this author, which is ascribed to Mr J. Craggs, once secretary of state.\n\n**LONICERA, Honeysuckle,** a genus of plants belonging to the pentandra clas. See Botany Index.\n\n**LONSDALE,** or Kirkby Lonsdale, a town of Westmorland, seated on the river Lon, in a pleasant and rich valley of the same name. It is a large well-built town, has a handsome church, and a fine stone bridge over the river. It is well inhabited; and is the best town in the county except Kendal. It gives title of earl to the Lowther family. W. Long. 2° 27'. N.

It is principally used in navigation when there is a probability of danger from the real or supposed proximity of land, rocks, enemies, and, in short, whatever peril she may encounter through inattention, which might otherwise have been avoided by a prudent and necessary vigilance.\n\nThere is always a look-out kept on a ship's forecastle at sea, to watch for any dangerous objects lying near her track, and to which she makes a gradual approach as she advances: the mate of the watch accordingly calls often from the quarter-deck, \"Look out afore there!\" to the persons appointed for this service.\n\n**LOOKING-GLASSES,** are nothing but plain mirrors of glass; which, being impervious to the light, reflect the images of things placed before them.

The usual method is, to break off the loop of about three quarters of a hundred weight. This loop they take up with their slinging-tongs, and beat it with iron sledges upon an iron plate near the fire, so that it may not fall to pieces, but be in a condition to be carried under the hammer. It is then placed under the hammer, and a little water being drawn to make the hammer move but softly, it is beat very gently, and by this means the dross or foulness are forced off; and after this they draw more and more water by degrees, and beat it more and more till they bring it to a four-square mass, of about two feet long, which they call a bloom.\n\nLOOPING, in Metallurgy, a word used by the miners of some counties of England, to express the running together of the matter of an ore into a mass, in the roasting or first burning, intended only to calcine it so far as to make it fit for powdering. This accident, which gives the miners some trouble, is generally owing to the continuing the fire too long in this process.\n\nLOOSE-strife. See Lysimachia, Botany Index.\n\nLOPEZ DE VEGA. See VEGA.\n\nLOPEZ, or Indian Root, in the Materia Medica.\n\nThe plant to which this article belongs is unknown. Neither the woody nor cortical part of the root has any remarkable sensible quality. A slight bitterness is perceptible; and it is recommended, like sarsaparilla, in diarrhoea even of the colligative kind, in half-dram doses four times a day. Little of this root has been brought to Europe; but some of those who have had an opportunity of employing it, speak in very high terms of the effects obtained from it.\n\nLOPHIUS, FISHING-FROG, Toad fish, or Sea-devil; a genus of the branchiostegous order of fishes.

See Botany Index.\n\nLORARI, among the Romans, officers whose business it was, with whips and scourges, to compel the gladiators to engage. The lorarii also punished slaves who disobeyed their masters.\n\nLORD, a title of honour given to those who are noble either by birth or creation. In this sense, it amounts to much the same as peer of the realm, or lord of parliament. The title is by courtesy also given to all the sons of dukes and marquises, and to the eldest sons of earls; and it is also a title of honour bestowed on those who are honourable by their employments; as lord advocate, lord chancellor, lord chancellor, &c. The word is Saxon, but abbreviated from two syllables into one; for it was originally Hlaford, which by dropping the aspiration became Hlaford, and afterwards by contraction Lord. \"The etymology of the word (says J. Coates) is well worth observing; for it was composed of hlaf \"a loaf of bread,\" and ford \"to give or afford;\" so that Hlaford, now Lord, implies \"a giver of bread;\" because, in those ages, such great men kept extraordinary houses, and fed all the poor; for which reason they were called givers of bread, a thing now much out of date, great men being fond of retaining the title, but few regarding the practice for which it was first given. See LADY.\n\nHouse of Lords, one of the three estates of parliament, and composed of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal.\n\n1. The Spiritual Lords consist of two archbishops and 24 bishops; and, at the dissolution of monasteries by Henry VIII., consisted likewise of 26 mitred abbots and two priors; a very considerable body, and in those times equal in number to the temporal nobility. All these hold, or are supposed to hold, certain ancient baronies under the king: for William the Conqueror thought proper to change the spiritual tenor of frankalmoin or free alms, under which the bishops held their lands during the Saxon government, into the feudal or Norman tenure by barony; which subjected their estates to all civil charges and assessments, from which they were before exempt; and in right of succession to those baronies, which were unalienable from their respective dignities, the bishops and abbots were allowed their seats in the house of lords. But though these lords spiritual are in the eye of the law a distinct estate from the lords temporal, and are so distinguished in most of our acts of parliament; yet in practice they are usually blended together under the name of the lords: they intermix in their votes, and the majority of such intermixture joins both estates. And from this want of a separate assembly, and separate negative of the prelates, some writers have argued very cogently, that the lords spiritual and temporal are now in reality only one estate; which is unquestionably true in every effectual sense, though the ancient distinction between them still nominally continues. For if a bill should pass their house, there is no doubt of its validity, though every lord spiritual should vote against it; of which Selden and Sir Edward Coke give many instances: as, on the other hand, doubts it would be equally good, if the lords temporal present were inferior to the bishops in number, and every one of those temporal lords gave his vote to reject the bill; though this Sir Edward Coke seems to doubt of.\n\n2. The Temporal Lords consist of all the peers of the realm (the bishops not being in strictness held to be such, but merely lords of parliament), by whatever title of nobility distinguished; dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts or barons*. Some of these sit by descent, see Note as do all ancient peers; some by creation, as do all new\nLord new made ones; others, since the union with Scotland, by election, which is the case of the 16 peers who represent the body of the Scots nobility. Their number is indefinite, and may be increased at will by the power of the crown: and once, in the reign of Queen Anne, there was an instance of creating no less than 12 together; in contemplation of which, in the reign of King George I., a bill passed the house of lords, and was countenanced by the then ministry, for limiting the number of the peerage. This was thought by some to promise a great acquisition to the constitution, by restraining the prerogative from gaining the ascendant in that august assembly, by pouring in at pleasure an unlimited number of new-created lords. But the bill was ill relished, and miscarried in the house of commons, whose leading members were then desirous to keep the avenues to the other house as open and easy as possible.\n\nThe distinction of ranks and honours is necessary in every well governed state: in order to reward such as are eminent for their services to the public, in a manner the most desirable to individuals, and yet without burden to the community; exciting thereby an ambitious yet laudable ardour and generous emulation in others. And emulation, or virtuous ambition, is a spring of action which, however dangerous or invidious in a mere republic or under a despotic sway, will certainly be attended with good effects under a free monarchy; where, without destroying its existence, its excesses may be continually restrained by that superior power from which all honour is derived. Such a spirit, when nationally diffused, gives life and vigour to the community; it sets all the wheels of government in motion, which, under a wise regulator, may be directed to any beneficial purpose; and thereby every individual may be made subservient to the public good, while he principally means to promote his own particular views.\n\nA body of nobility is also more particularly necessary in our mixed and complicated constitution, in order to support the rights of both the crown and the people, by forming a barrier to withstand the encroachments of both. It creates and preserves that gradual scale of dignity which proceeds from the peasant to the prince; rising like a pyramid from a broad foundation, and diminishing to a point as it rises. It is this ascending and contracting proportion that adds stability to any government; for when the departure is sudden from one extreme to another, we may pronounce that state to be precarious. The nobility therefore are the pillars, which are reared from among the people, more immediately to support the throne; and, if that falls, they must also be buried under its ruins. Accordingly, when in the last century the commons had determined to extirpate monarchy, they also voted the house of lords to be useless and dangerous. And since titles of nobility are thus expedient in the state, it is also expedient that their owners should form an independent and separate branch of the legislature. If they were confounded with the mass of the people, and like them had only a vote in electing representatives, their privileges would soon be borne down and overwhelmed by the popular torrent, which would effectually level all distinctions. It is therefore highly necessary that the body of nobles should have a distinct assembly, distinct deliberations, and distinct powers from the commons. See also King, Nobility, Parliament, Commons, and Commonalty.\n\nAs to the peculiar laws and customs relating to the house of lords: One very ancient privilege is that declared by the charter of the forest, confirmed in parliament 9 Hen. III.; viz. that every lord spiritual or temporal summoned to parliament, and passing through the king's forests, may, both in going and returning, kill one or two of the king's deer without warrant; in view of the forester if he be present, or on blowing a horn if he be absent; that he may not seem to take the king's venison by stealth.\n\nIn the next place, they have a right to be attended, and constantly are, by the judges of the court of king's bench and common pleas, and such of the barons of the exchequer as are of the degree of the coif, or have been made sergeants at law; as likewise by the king's learned counsel, being sergeants, and by the masters of the court of chancery; for their advice in point of law, and for the greater dignity of their proceedings. The secretaries of state, with the attorney and solicitor general, were also used to attend the house of peers, and have to this day (together with the judges, &c.) their regular writs of summons issued out at the beginning of every parliament, ad tractandum et confitendum impendendum, though not ad consentendum, but, whenever of late years they have been members of the house of commons, their attendance here hath fallen into disuse.\n\nAnother privilege is, that every peer, by license obtained from the king, may make another lord of parliament his proxy, to vote for him in his absence: A privilege, which a member of the other house can by no means have, as he is himself but a proxy for a multitude of other people.\n\nEach peer has also a right, by leave of the house, when a vote passes contrary to his sentiments, to enter his dissent on the journals of the house, with the reasons for such dissent; which is usually styled his protest.\n\nAll bills likewise, that may in their consequences any way affect the rights of the peerage, are by the custom of parliament to have their first rise and beginning in the house of peers, and to suffer no changes or amendments in the house of commons.\n\nThere is also one statute peculiarly relative to the house of lords; 6 Ann. c. 23., which regulates the election of the 16 representative peers of North Britain, in consequence of the 22d and 23d articles of the Union; and for that purpose prescribes the oaths, &c., to be taken by the electors; directs the mode of balloting; prohibits the peers electing from being attended in an unusual manner; and expressly provides, that no other matter shall be treated of in that assembly, save only the election, on pain of incurring a premiumire. See also the articles Nobility and Peers.\n\nLORDOSIS, (of λορδος, bent inwards), in the medical writings, a name given to a distempered state of the spine, in which it is bent inwards, or towards the anterior parts. It is used in opposition to gibbous, or hump-backed. See Surgery.\n\nLORETO, a town of Italy, in the Marche or Marche of Ancona, with a bishop's see. It is small but fortified; and contains the famous caja santa, or holy\nLoretto holy chapel, so much visited by pilgrims. This chapel, according to the legend, was originally a small house in Nazareth, inhabited by the virgin Mary, in which she was saluted by the angel, and where she bore our Saviour. After their deaths, it was held in great veneration by all believers in Jesus, and at length consecrated into a chapel, and dedicated to the Virgin; upon which occasion St Luke made that identical image, which is still preserved here, and dignified with the name of our Lady of Loretto. This sanctified edifice was allowed to fojourn in Galilee as long as that district was inhabited by Christians; but when infidels got possession of the country, a band of angels, to save it from pollution, took it in their arms, and conveyed it from Nazareth to a castle in Dalmatia. This fact might have been called in question by incredulous people, had it been performed in a secret manner; but, that it might be manifest to the most short-sighted spectator, and evident to all who were not perfectly deaf as well as blind, a blaze of celestial light, and a concert of divine music, accompanied it during the whole journey; besides, when the angels, to rest themselves, set it down in a little wood near the road, all the trees of the forest bowed their heads to the ground, and continued in that respectful posture as long as the sacred chapel remained among them. But not having been entertained with suitable respect at the castle above mentioned, the same indefatigable angels carried it over the sea, and placed it in a field belonging to a noble lady called Lauretta, from whom the chapel takes its name. This field happened unfortunately to be frequented at that time by highwaymen and murderers: a circumstance with which the angels undoubtedly were not acquainted when they placed it there. After they were better informed they removed it to the top of a hill belonging to two brothers, where they imagined it would be perfectly secure from the dangers of robbery or assassination; but the two brothers, the proprietors of the ground, being equally enamoured of their new visitor, became jealous of each other, quarrelled, fought, and fell by mutual wounds. After this fatal catastrophe, the angels in waiting finally moved the holy chapel to the eminence where it now stands, and has stood these 400 years, having lost all relish for travelling.\n\nThe sacred chapel stands due east and west, at the farther end of a large church of the most durable stone of Istria, which has been built around it. This may be considered as the external covering, or as a kind of great coat to the casa santa, which has a smaller coat of more precious materials and workmanship nearer its body. This internal covering or case is of the choicest marble, after a plan of San Savino's, and ornamented with basso relievo, the workmanship of the best sculptors which Italy could furnish in the reign of Leo X. The subject of these basso relievoes are the history of the Blest Virgin, and other parts of the Bible. The whole case is about 50 feet long, 30 in breadth, and the same in height: but the real house itself is no more than 32 feet in length, 14 in breadth, and at the sides about 18 feet in height; the centre of the roof is four or five feet higher. The walls of this little holy chapel are composed of pieces of a reddish substance, of an oblong square shape, laid one upon another, in the manner of brick. At first sight, on a superficial view, these red-coloured oblong substances appear to be nothing else than common Italian bricks; and, which is still more extraordinary, on a second and third view, with all possible attention, they still have the same appearance. Travellers, however, are assured with great earnestness, that there is not a single particle of brick in their whole composition, being entirely of a stone; which, though it cannot now be found in Palestine, was formerly very common, particularly in the neighbourhood of Nazareth.\n\nThe holy house is divided within into two unequal portions, by a kind of grate-work of silver. The division towards the west is about three fourths of the whole; that to the east is called the Sanctuary. In the larger division, which may be considered as the main body of the house, the walls are left bare, to show the true original fabric of Nazareth stone; for they must not be supposed to be bricks. At the lower or western wall there is a window, the same through which the angel Gabriel entered at the Annunciation. The architraves of this window are covered with silver. There are a great number of golden and silver lamps in this chapel: one of the former, a present from the republic of Venice, is said to weigh 37 pounds, and some of the silver lamps weigh from 120 to 130 pounds. At the upper end of the largest room is an altar, but so low, that from it you may see the famous image which stands over the chimney in the small room or sanctuary. Golden and silver angels, of considerable size, kneel around her, some offering hearts of gold, enriched with diamonds, and one an infant of pure gold. The wall of the sanctuary is plated with silver, and adorned with crucifixes, precious stones, and votive gifts of various kinds. The figure of the Virgin herself by no means corresponds with the fine furniture of her house: She is a little woman, about four feet in height, with the features and complexion of a negro. Of all the sculptors that ever existed, assuredly St Luke, by whom this figure is said to have been made, is the least of a flatterer; and nothing can be a stronger proof of the Blest Virgin's contempt for external beauty than her being satisfied with this representation of her. The figure of the infant Jesus, by St Luke, is of a piece with that of the Virgin: he holds a large golden globe in one hand, and the other is extended in the act of bleffing. Both figures have crowns on their heads, enriched with diamonds: these were presents from Ann of Austria, queen of France. Both arms of the Virgin are enclosed within her robes, and no part but her face is to be seen; her dress is most magnificent, but in a wretched bad taste: this is not surprising, for she has no female attendant. She has particular clothes for the different feasts held in honour of her, and, which is not quite so decent, is always dressed and undressed by the priests belonging to the chapel; her robes are ornamented with all kinds of precious flowers down to the hem of her garment.\n\nThere is a small place behind the sanctuary, in which are shown the chimney, and some other furniture, which they pretend belonged to the Virgin when she lived at Nazareth; particularly a little earthen porringer, out of which the infant used to eat. The pilgrims bring rosaries, little crucifixes, and agnus dei's, which the obliging priest flakcs for half a minute\nnute in this dish; after which it is believed they acquire the virtue of curing various diseases, and prove an excellent preventive of all temptations of Satan. The gown which the image had on when the chapel arrived from Nazareth is of red camlet, and carefully kept in a glass shrine.\n\nAbove 100 masses are daily said in this chapel, and in the church in which it stands. The jewels and riches to be seen at any one time in the holy chapel are of small value in comparison of those in the treasury, which is a large room adjoining to the vestry of the great church. In the presides of this room are kept those pretences which royal, noble, and rich bigots of all ranks, have, by oppressing their subjects and injuring their families, sent to this place. To enumerate every particular would fill volumes. They consist of various utensils and other things in silver and gold; as lamps, candelsticks, goblets, crowns, and crucifixes; lambs, eagles, saints, apostles, angels, virgins, and infants: then there are cameos, pearls, gems, and precious stones, of all kinds and in great numbers. What is valued above all the other jewels is, the miraculous pearl, wherein they assert that Nature has given a faithful delineation of the Virgin sitting on a cloud with the infant Jesus in her arms. There was not room in the presides of the treasury to hold all the silver pieces which had been presented to the Virgin. Several other presides in the vestry are completely full. It is said that those pieces are occasionally melted down by his holiness for the use of the state; and also that the most precious of the jewels are picked out and sold for the same purpose, false stones being substituted in their room.\n\nPilgrimages to Loretto are not so frequent with foreigners, or with Italians of fortune and distinction, as formerly; nineteen out of twenty of those who make this journey now are poor people, who depend for their maintenance on the charity they receive on the road. To those who are in such a rank in life as precludes them from availing themselves of the charitable institutions for the maintenance of pilgrims, such journeys are attended with expense and inconvenience; and fathers and husbands, in moderate or confined circumstances, are frequently brought to disagreeable dilemmas, by the rash vows of going to Loretto which their wives or daughters are apt to make on any supposed deliverance from danger. To refuse, is considered by the whole neighbourhood as cruel, and even impious; and to grant, is often highly distasteful, particularly to such husbands as, from affection or any other motives, do not choose that their wives should be long out of their sight. But the poor, who are maintained during their whole journey, and have nothing more than a bare maintenance to expect from their labour at home, to them a journey to Loretto is a party of pleasure as well as devotion, and by much the most agreeable road they can take to heaven. The greatest concourse of pilgrims is at the feasts of Easter and WhitSunday. The rich travel in their carriages; A greater number come on horseback or on mules; or, what is still more common, on asses. Great numbers of females come in this manner, with a male friend walking by them as their guide and protector; but the greatest number of both sexes are on foot. The pilgrims on foot, as soon as they enter the suburbs, begin a hymn in honour of the Virgin, which they continue till they reach the church. The poorer sort are received into a hospital, where they have bed and board for three days.\n\nThe only trade of Loretto consists of rosaries, crucifixes, little madonas, agnes dei's, and medals, which are manufactured here, and sold to pilgrims. There are great numbers of shops full of these commodities, some of them of a high price; but infinitely the greater part are adapted to the purses of the buyers, and sold for a mere trifle. The evident poverty of those manufacturers and traders, and of the inhabitants of this town in general, is a sufficient proof that the reputation of our Lady of Loretto is greatly on the decline.\n\nIn the great church which contains the holy chapel are confessional, where the penitents from every country of Europe may be confessed in their own language, priests being always in waiting for that purpose: each of them has a long white rod in his hand, with which he touches the heads of those to whom he thinks it proper to give absolution. They place themselves on their knees in groups around the confessional chair; and when the holy father has touched their heads with the expiatory rod, they retire, freed from the burden of their sins, and with renewed courage to begin a fresh account.\n\nIn the spacious area before this church there is an elegant marble fountain, supplied with water from an adjoining hill by an aqueduct. Few even of the most inconsiderable towns of Italy are without the useful ornament of a public fountain. The embellishments of sculpture and architecture are employed with great propriety on such works, which are continually in the people's view; the air is refreshed and the eye delighted by the streams of water they pour forth; a sight peculiarly agreeable in a warm climate. In this area there is also a statue of Sixtus V. in bronze. Over the portal of the church itself is a statue of the Virgin; and above the middle gate is a Latin inscription, importing that within is the house of the mother of God, in which the Word was made flesh. The gates of the church are likewise of bronze, embellished with bass reliefs of admirable workmanship: the subjects taken partly from the Old and partly from the New Testament, and divided into different compartments. As the gates of this church are shut at noon, the pilgrims who arrive after that time can get no nearer the fanta casa than the gates, which are by this means sometimes exposed to the first violence of that holy ardour which was designed for the chapel itself. All the sculpture upon the gates which is within reach of the mouths of those zealots, is in some degree effaced by their kisses.\n\nThere are also several paintings to be seen here, some of which are highly esteemed, particularly two in the treasury. The subject of one of these is the Virgin's Nativity, by Annibal Caracci; and of the other, a Holy Family by Raphael. There are some others of considerable merit which ornament the altars of the great church. These altars, or little chapels, of which this fabric contains a great number, are lined with marble and embellished by sculpture; but nothing within this church interests a traveller of sensibility so much as the iron grates before those chapels, which were\nLORICA was a cuirass, brigantine, or coat of mail, in use among the Roman soldiers. It was generally made of leather, and is supposed to be derived from lorum.—The loricae were fitted with plates of metal in various forms; sometimes in hooks or rings like a chain, sometimes like feathers, and sometimes like the scales of serpents or fishes, to which plates of gold were often added. There were other lighter cuirasses consisting only of many folds of linen cloth, or of flax made strong enough to resist weapons. Such soldiers as were rated under 1000 drachms, instead of the lorica now described, wore a pelteorale.—The Roman lorica was made like a shirt, and defended the wearer both before and behind, but was so contrived that the back part could be occasionally separated from the front. Some of the lorice were made of cords of hemp or flax, close set together; whence they are called thoraces, bicincti, triliceti, &c., from the number of the cords fixed one upon another; but these were used rather in hunting than in the field of battle.\n\nLORIS, in Zoology. See LEMUR, MAMMALIA Index.\n\nLORIMERS, one of the companies of London, that make bits for bridles, spurs, and such like small iron ware. They are mentioned in statute 1 Rich. II. c. 12.—The word seems derived from the Latin word lorum, “a thong.”\n\nLORME, PHILIBERT DE, one of the most celebrated architects in the 16th century, was born at Lyons. Queen Catherine de Medicis gave him the superintendence of buildings; and he had the direction of those of the Louvre, the Thulleries, the castle of St Anet, St Germain, and other edifices erected by her orders. He also wrote several books on architecture. He died about the year 1577.\n\nLORNE, a division of Argyllshire in Scotland, which gives the title of marquis to the duke of Argyll. It extends above 30 miles in length from north to south, and about nine at its utmost breadth; bounded on the east by Braidalbin; on the west by the islands; on the north, by Lochaber; and is divided from Knapdale on the south by Loch Etive, on the banks of which stands the castle of Bergomarn, wherein the courts of justice were anciently held. This district, abounding with lakes, is the most pleasant and fertile part of Argyllshire, producing plenty of oats and barley. It once belonged to the ancient family of Macdougal, still residing on the spot; but devolved to the lords of Argyll in consequence of a marriage with the heiress, at that time a branch of the Stuart family. The chief place of note in this district is the castle of Dunstaffnage, a seat of the Scottish kings previous to the conquest of the Picts in 843 by Kenneth II. In this place was long preserved the famous stone, the palladium of North Britain; brought, says legend, out of Spain, where it was first used as a seat of justice by Gathelus, coeval with Moses. It continued here as the coronation chair till the reign of Kenneth II, who removed it to Scone, in order to secure his reign; for, according to the inscription,\n\nNi fallat fatum, Scotti quoque locatum,\nInvenient lapidem, regnare teneantur ibidem.\n\nSome of the ancient regalia were preserved till the present century, when the keeper's servants, during his infirm years, embezzled them for the silver ornaments; and left only a battlement, nine feet long, of beautiful workmanship, and ornamented with silver.\n\nThe castle is square; the inside only 87 feet; partly ruinous, partly habitable. At three of the corners are round towers; one of them projects very little. The entrance is towards the sea at present by a staircase, in old times probably by a drawbridge, which fell from a little gateway. The masonry appears very ancient; the tops battlemented. This pile is seated on a rock at the mouth of Loch Etive, whose waters expand within to a beautiful bay, where ships may safely ride in all weather. Of this building, the founder of which is unknown, nothing remains except the outer walls, which, though roofless, are still in good order; and within which some buildings have been erected, which serve as the residence of the laird. The duke of Argyll is hereditary keeper under the crown.—At a small distance from the castle is a ruined chapel, once an elegant building; and at one end an enclosure, a family cemetery. Opposite to these is a high precipice, ending abrupt, and turning suddenly toward the south-east. A person concealed in the recesses of the rock, a little beyond the angle, surprises friends stationed at some distance beneath the precipice with a very remarkable echo of any word, or even sentence, he pronounces; which reaches the last distinct and unbroken. The repetition is single, but remarkably clear.\n\nIn 1307, this castle was possessed by Alexander Macdougal lord of Argyll, a friend to the English; but was that year reduced by Robert Bruce, when Macdougal sued for peace with that prince, and was received into favour.\n\nWe find, about the year 1455, this to have been a residence of the lords of the illes; for here James last earl of Douglas, after his defeat in Annandale, fled to Donald, the Regulus of the time, and prevailed on him to take arms and carry on a plundering war against his monarch James II.\n\nThe situation of this regal seat was calculated for pleasure as well as strength. The views of mountains, valleys, waters, and islands, are delightful. On the north side of Loch Etive stood the town of Beregonium, supposed to have been the capital of the West Highlands. It seems from certain mounds, excavations, and other appearances, to have been a strong fortress, to prevent invasion, or to secure a retreat, as occasions might require. On the bank of the same loch is the site of Ardchattan, a priory of monks of Vallficaulain in Burgundy, founded in 1230 by Donald Maccaul, ancestor of the Macdougalls of Lorne. Here Robert Bruce, who remained master of this country before he got entire possession of Scotland, held a parliament.\nLORRAIN, a sovereign state of Europe, bounded on the north by Luxemburg and the archbishopric of Trieres, on the east by Alsace and the duchy of Deux Ponts, on the south by Franche Comte, and on the west by Champagne and the duchy of Bar. It is about 100 miles in length, and 75 in breadth; and abounds in all sorts of corn, wine, hemp, flax, rape-seed, game and fish, with which it carries on some trade, and in general all the necessaries of life. There are fine meadows and large forests, with mines of iron, silver, and copper, as also salt pits. There are a great number of rivers; of which the principal are the Maëe or Meuse, the Moselle, the Seille, the Meur, and the Sarre. It is divided into three parts; the duchy of Lorraine, properly so called, which was heretofore a sovereign state; the duchy of Bar, which formerly belonged to the dukes of Lorraine, but afterwards came under the government of France; and the third comprehends the three bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, which have belonged to France ever since the year 1552. In 1733, the emperor of Germany being at war with France, this last got possession of the duchy of Lorraine; and when there was a peace made in 1735, it was agreed, that Stanislaus king of Poland, father-in-law to the king of France, should possess these duchies, and that after his death they should be united forever to the crown of France. It was also then agreed, that Francis Stephen, duke of Lorraine, and the emperor's son-in-law, should have the grand duchy of Tuscany as an equivalent for Lorraine. After the death of the great duke of Tuscany, in 1737, King Stanislaus and the duke of Lorraine took possession of their respective dominions, and the cession was confirmed and guaranteed by a treaty in 1738. The trade consists in corn and linen cloth. Nancy is the capital town.\n\nLORRAIN, Robert le, an eminent sculptor, born at Paris in 1666. From his infancy, he made so rapid a progress in the art of designing, that at the age of 18 the celebrated Girardon intrusted him with the care of teaching his children and correcting his disciples. He committed to him also, in conjunction with Noulifon, the execution of the famous tomb of Cardinal Richelieu in the Sorbonne, and his own tomb at St Landres in Paris. On his return from Rome, he finished several pieces at Marlyelles, which had been left imperfect by the death of M. Puget. He was received into the academy of sculpture in 1701. His chief d'œuvre is Galatea, a work universally admired. Lorrain afterwards made a Bacchus for the gardens at Versailles, a Faun for those of Marly; and several bronzes, among which is an Andromeda; all in an excellent taste. This artist succeeded chiefly in heads; and more particularly in that of young girls, which he performed with incomparable delicacy and truth.\n\nLORRAIN, Claude. See CLAUDE.\n\nLOTEN, John, a good landscape painter of the English school; though a native of Switzerland. His taste led him to solemn and dreary scenes, as landslides accompanied with showers of rain, &c., and he seldom omitted to introduce oak trees in his prospects; his landscapes are generally large; and he painted with nature, truth, and force. But the effect of his composition had been much greater if he had been less cold in his colouring: for the judicious eye is not pleased with the darkish tint that predominates in it. He died in London about 1681.\n\nLOTHIAN, a name given to three counties of Scotland; viz. Haddingtonshire, Edinburghshire, and Linlithgowshire; otherwise called East, Mid, and West Lothians.\n\n1. East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire, is bounded on the north-west by the frith of Forth; and on the east by the German sea; on the south-east by Berwickshire; and on the west by the county of Edinburgh. It extends about 25 miles from east to west, and where broadest, nearly 15 from north to south. The coast, advancing northward into the frith, forms an irregular curve.—This is one of the most fruitful counties in Scotland, producing great quantities of wheat and all sorts of grain, well watered, and plentifully supplied with fish, fowl, fuel, and all the necessaries of life. It abounds with towns, villages, and farms, interspersed with a great number of agreeable houses belonging to persons of rank and fortune. For cultivation, populousness, and fertility, this shire may vie with any tract of land in the island of Great Britain. Besides farming, which is successfully carried on, the people towards the sea-coast employ themselves in the fishery, salt-making, and in foreign trade; and some of the more inland inhabitants engage in the linen and woollen manufactures. Limestone and coal are found in most parts of the county, and great numbers of sheep are fed on the hills of Lammermuir.\n\n2. Edinburghshire, or Mid Lothian, is about 35 miles long, but varies in its breadth in different places from five to 16 miles. It is bounded on the east by Haddingtonshire; on the west by the shire of Linlithgow; on the south, by Tweeddale or Peeblesshire; and on the north, by part of West Lothian and the frith of Forth. The aspect of the country is in general level and pleasant, interspersed with a few hills, that help to exhibit agreeable prospects. It is well watered with rivers, and shaded with woods. It produces plenty of coal, limestone, a soft black marble, and some copper ore. The soil, of itself fertile, is finely cultivated, and yields as plentiful harvests of excellent wheat as are found in any part of Great Britain. The whole shire is interspersed with noble houses and plantations belonging to noblemen and gentlemen of fortune. The farmers, in general, are skilful and wealthy. The country is well inhabited, and presents us with a good number of towns and populous villages. Along the sea coast the common people subsist by fishing, and traffic in coals and salt, and some few carry on a smuggling commerce. Those in the inland are employed in farming, and some branches of the weaving manufacture. Edinburgh is a county within itself.\n\n3. The shire of Linlithgow, or West Lothian, is bounded on the north by the frith of Forth. The small river Almond divides it from Edinburghshire on the east. On the south-west it joins the county of Lanark; and on the west, it is parted from Stirlingshire by Avon, a small river. Its form, though irregular, approaches to a parallelogram. It measures from north-east to south-west, nearly 20 miles. Its breadth, except on the shore of the frith, does not exceed 12.—The country:\ntry is pleasant and fertile, abounding with corn and pastureage. Here is found plenty of coal, limestone, and lead ore; nay, in the reign of James VI. it produced a rich mine of silver.\n\nLOTION is, strictly speaking, such washing as concerns beautifying the skin, by cleansing it of those deformities which a distempered blood throws upon it. Medicines of this kind, however, are for the most part insignificant, and sometimes very dangerous; the only proper method of treating these disorders is, by administering such medicines as tend to correct the morbid state of the constitution from whence they arise.\n\nLOTION, in Pharmacy, denotes a preparation of medicines, by washing them in some liquid, either made very light, so as to take away only the dregs; or sharp, so as to penetrate them, in order to clear them of some salt, or corrosive spirit, as is done to antimony, precipitates, magisteries, &c. intended to take away some foulness or ill quality, or to communicate some good one.\n\nLOTOPHAGI, in Ancient Geography, a people of the Regio Syrtica (to called from their living on the lotus); inhabiting between the two Syrtes from the Cinythus to the Triton. The lotus was said to be a food so lascivious, as to make strangers forget their native country. A sweet wine was expressed from it, which did not keep above ten days, (Pliny).\n\nLOTOPHAGI of Homer. See MENIX.\n\nLOTTERY, a kind of public game at hazard, frequent in Britain, France, and Holland, in order to raise money for the service of the state; being appointed with us by the authority of parliament, and managed by commissioners appointed by the lords of the treasury for that purpose. It consists of several numbers of blanks and prizes, which are drawn out of wheels, one of which contains the numbers, and the other the corresponding blanks or prizes.\n\nThe Romans invented lotteries to enliven their Saturnalia. This festival began by the distribution of tickets which gained some prize. Augustus made lotteries which consisted of things of little value; but Nero established some for the people, in which 1000 tickets were distributed daily, and several of those who were favoured by Fortune got rich by them. Heliogabalus invented some very singular; the prizes were either of great value or of none at all; one gained a prize of six slaves, and another of six flies; some got valuable vases, and others vases of common earth. A lottery of this kind exhibited an excellent picture of the inequality with which Fortune distributes her favours.\n\nThe first English lottery we find mentioned in history was drawn A.D. 1569. It consisted of 40,000 lots, at 10s. each lot; the prizes were plate; and the profits were to go towards repairing the havens of this kingdom. It was drawn at the west door of St Paul's cathedral. The drawing began on the 11th of January 1569, and continued incessantly, day and night, till the 6th of May following; as Mathland, from Stowe, informs us in his history, vol. i. p. 257. There were then only three lottery offices in London. The proposals for this lottery were published in the years 1567 and 1568. It was at first intended to have been drawn at the house of Mr Dericke, her majesty's servant, i.e. her jeweller, but was afterwards drawn as above mentioned.\n\nDr Rawlinson showed the Antiquarian Society, 1748, \"A proposal for a very rich lottery, general without any blankes, containing a great number of good prizes, as well of redy money as of plate and certain sorts of merchandizes, having been valued and prised by the commandment of the queen's most excellent majesty's order, to the extent that such commodities as may chance to arise thereof after the charges borne may be converted towards the reparations of the havens and strength of the realm, and towards such other public good workes. The number of lotts shall be foure hundred thousand, and no more; and every lott shall be the sum of tenne shillings sterling, and no more. To be filled by the feate of St Bartholomew. The shew of prises are to be seen in Cheapside, at the signe of the Queene's Armes, the house of Mr Dericke, goldsmith, servant to the queene. Some other orders about it in 1567-8. Printed by Hen. Bynmeaman.\"\n\n\"In the year 1612, King James, in special favour for the present plantation of English colonies in Virginia, granted a lottery, to be held at the west end of St Paul's; whereof one Thomas Sharpies, a taylor of Loudon, had the chief prize, which was 4000 crowns in fair plate.\" Baker's Chronicle.\n\nIn the reign of Queen Anne, it was thought necessary to suppress lotteries, as nuisances to the public. Since that time, however, they have been licensed by an act of parliament, under various regulations. The act passed in 1778 restrains any person from keeping an office for the sale of tickets, shares, or chances, or for buying, selling, ensuring, or registering, without a licence; for which licence each office-keeper must pay 50l. to continue in force for one year, and the produce to be applied towards defraying the expenses of the lottery. And no person is allowed to sell any share or chance less than a sixteenth, on the penalty of 50l. All tickets divided into shares or chances are to be deposited in an office, to be established in London by the commissioners of the treasury, who are to appoint a person to conduct the business thereof; and all shares are to be stamped by the said officer, who is to give a receipt for every ticket deposited with him. The numbers of all tickets so deposited are to be entered in a book, with the names of the owners, and the number of shares into which they are divided; and twopence for each share is to be paid to the officer on depositing such tickets, who is therewith to pay all expenses incident to the office. All tickets deposited in the office are to remain there three days after the drawing. And any person keeping an office, or selling shares, or who shall publish any scheme for receiving moneys in consideration of any interest to be granted in any ticket in the said lottery, &c., without being in possession of such ticket, shall forfeit 500l. and suffer three months imprisonment. And no business is to be transacted at any of the offices after eight in the evening, except on the evening of the Saturday preceding the drawing. No person is to keep any office for the sale of tickets, &c., in Oxford or Cambridge, on penalty of 20l. Before this regulating statute took place, there were upwards of 400 lottery offices in and about London only; but the whole number afterwards, for all Britain, as appeared by the list published by authority, amounted to no more than 51.\n\nLOTUS, or BIRD'S-FOOT TREFOIL; a genus of plants\nplants belonging to the diadelphia clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 32d order, Papilionaceae.\n\nSee Botany Index.\n\nLotus of Homer. See Diospyros,\nEgyptian Lotus. See Nymphæa,\nLilium Lotus. See Rhamnus,\n\nLOVAGE. See Ligusticum,\n\nLOVE, in a large sense of the word, denotes all those affections of the pleasing kind which objects and incidents raise in us; thus we are said to love not only intelligent agents of morally good dispositions, but also sensual pleasures, riches, and honours. But\n\nLove, in its usual and more appropriate signification, may be defined, \"that affection which, being compounded of animal desire, esteem, and benevolence, becomes the bond of attachment and union between individuals of the different sexes; and makes them feel in the society of each other a species of happiness which they experience nowhere else.\" We call it an affection rather than a passion, because it involves a desire of the happiness of its object: And that its constituent parts are those which have been just enumerated, we shall first endeavour to prove, and then proceed to trace its rise and progress from a selfish appetite to a generous sentiment.\n\nAnimal desire is the actual energy of the sensual appetite: and that it is an essential part of the complex affection, which is properly called love, is apparent from this consideration, that though a man may have sentiments of esteem and benevolence towards women who are both old and ugly, he never supposes himself to be in love of any woman, to whom he feels not the sensual appetite to have a stronger tendency than to other individuals of her sex. On the other hand, that animal desire alone cannot be called the affection of love is evident; because he who gratifies such a desire without esteeming its object, and wishing to communicate at the same time that he receives enjoyment, loves not the woman, but himself. Mere animal desire has nothing in view but the species and the sex of its object; and before it make a selection, it must be combined with sentiments very different from itself. The first sentiment with which it is combined, and by which a man is induced to prefer one woman to another, seems to be that by which we are delighted with gracefulness of person, regularity of features, and beauty of complexion. It is not indeed to be denied that there is something irresistible in female beauty. The most fervent will not pretend that they do not feel an immediate prepossession in favour of a handsome woman: but this prepossession, even when combined with animal desire, does not constitute the whole of that affection which is called love. Savages feel the influence of the sensual appetite, and it is extremely probable that they have some ideas of beauty; but among savages the affection of love is seldom felt. Even among the lower orders in civil society it seems to be a very gross passion, and to have in it more of the selfishness of appetite than of the generosity of esteem. To these observations many exceptions will no doubt be found (a): but we speak of savages in general, and of the great body of the labouring poor, who in the choice of their mates do not study—who indeed are incapable of studying, that rectitude of mind, and those delicacies of sentiment, without which neither man nor woman can deserve to be esteemed.\n\nIn the savage state, and even in the first stages of refinement, the bond of union between the sexes seems to consist of nothing more than mere animal desire and instinctive tenderness for their infant progeny. The former impels them to unite for the propagation of the species; and the latter preserves the union, till the children, who are the fruit of it, be able to provide for their own subsistence. That in such unions, whether casual or permanent, there is no mutual esteem and benevolence, is apparent from the state of subjection in which women are held in rude and uncultivated nations, as well as from the manner in which marriages are in such nations contracted.\n\nSweetness of temper, a capital article with us in the female character, displays itself externally in mild looks and gentle manners, and is the first and perhaps the most powerful inducement to love in a cultivated mind. \"But such graces (says an ingenious writer *) Sketches are scarce discernible in a female savage; and even of the Hottentot, the most polished woman would not be perceived by a male savage. Among savages, strength and boldness are the only valuable qualities. In these, females are miserably deficient; for which reason they are contemned by the males as beings of an inferior order. The North American tribes glory in idleness; the drudgery of labour degrades a man in their opinion, and is proper for women only. To join young persons in marriage is accordingly the business of the parents; and it would be unpardonable meanness in the bridegroom to show any fondness for the bride. In Guiana a woman never eats with her husband, but after every meal attends him with water for washing; and in the Caribbee islands she is not even permitted to eat in the presence of her husband. Dampier observes in general, that among all the wild nations with which he was acquainted, the women carry the burdens, while the men walk before and carry nothing but their arms; and that women even of the highest rank are not better treated. In Siberia, and even in Russia, the capital excepted, men till very lately treated their wives in every respect like slaves. It might indeed be thought, that animal desire, were there nothing else, should have raised women to some degree of estimation among men; but male savages, utter strangers to decency and refinement, gratify animal desire with as little ceremony as they do hunger or thirst.\n\n\"Hence it was that in the early ages of society a man purchased a woman to be his wife, as one purchases an ox or a sheep to be food; and valued her only as she contributed to his sensual gratification. Initiates innumerable might be collected from every nation of which we are acquainted with the early history; but\n\n---\n\n(a) Such as the negroes whose story is so pathetically told by Addison in No. 215 of the Spectator; the two lovers who were killed by lightning at Staunton-Harcourt, August 9, 1718, (see Pope's Letters); and many others which will occur to every reader.\nwe shall content ourselves with mentioning a few. Abraham bought Rebekah and gave her to his son Isaac Gen. xxiv. for a wife. Jacob having nothing else to give, served Laban 14 years for two wives. To David, demanding Saul's daughter in marriage, it was said, 'The king defieth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.' In the Iliad Agamemnon offers his daughter to Achilles for a wife; and says that he would not demand for her any price. By the laws of Ethelbert king of England, a man who committed adultery with his neighbour's wife was obliged to pay the husband a fine, and to buy him another wife. But it is needless to multiply instances; the practice has prevailed universally among nations emerging from the savage state, or in the rudest stage of society: and wherever it prevailed, men could not possibly have for the fair sex any of that tender regard and esteem which constitute so essential a part of the complex affection of love.\n\nAccordingly we find the magnanimous Achilles an absolute stranger to that generous affection, though his heart was susceptible of the warmest and purest friendship. His attachment to Patroclus was so heroically disinterested, that he willingly sacrificed his own life to revenge the death of his friend; but when Agamemnon threatened to rob him of his favourite female captive, though he felt the insult offered to his pride, he never spoke of the woman but as a slave whom he was concerned to preserve in point of honour, and as a testimony of his glory. Hence it is that we never hear him mention her but as his spoil, the reward of war, or the gift which the Grecians gave him.\n\n\"And dar'lt thou threat to snatch my prize away,\nDue to the deeds of many a dreadful day?\nA prize as small, O tyrant! match'd with thine,\nAs thy own actions if compar'd with mine.\nThine in each conquest is the wealthy prey,\nTho' mine the sweat and danger of the day.\nSome trivial present to my ships I bear,\nOr barren praises pay the wounds of war.\"\n\nAnd again, after upbraiding the general with his tyranny and want of regard to merit, he adds, with the greatest indifference as to the charms of the woman,\n\n\"Seize on Briseis, whom the Grecians doom'd\nMy prize of war, yet tamely let refund;\nAnd seize secure; no more Achilles draws\nHis conquering sword in any woman's cause.\"\n\n\"The gods command me to forgive the past;\nBut let this first invasion be the last:\nFor know, thy blood, when next thou dar'lt invade,\nShall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade.\"\n\nPope has made the language of this rough warrior less inconsistent with the peculiar resentment natural to an injured lover than it is in the original (v); but from the last quoted passage, even as translated by him, it is apparent that Achilles would have been equally hurt had Agamemnon threatened to deprive him of any other part of his plunder. Accordingly he yields up Briseis, not in grief for a mistress whom he loses, but in fullnesses for an injury that is done him. Nor let it be imagined, that this coldness proceeded from the pride of the hero, which would not permit him to acknowledge his love of a captive. With the generous affection of love captives and princesses were equally incapable of inspiring him. He repeatedly affirmed indeed that he delighted in his fair Lyceanian slave, but it was only as an instrument of sensual gratification; for as to every thing else in a woman, he was so totally indifferent, that he declared he would not, when he should be disposed to marry, give himself the trouble to make a choice, but leave the whole matter to his father.\n\n\"If heav'n restore me to my realms with life,\nThe rev'rend Peleus shall elect my wife.\"\n\nEven Agamemnon, of whom Pope and Madame Dacier think more favourably as a lover, speaks the very same language when mentioning his favourite captive Chryseis. In his furious debate with Achilles he calls her indeed—\n\n\"A maid, unmatch'd in manners as in face,\nSkill'd in each art, and crown'd with ev'ry grace.\"\n\nAnd adds,\n\n\"Not half so dear were Clytemnestra's charms,\nWhen first her blooming beauties blest my arms.\"\n\nBut this was said merely to enhance the value of the prize, which for the public good he was about to resign; for that she was dear to him only as ministering to his pleasure, is past dispute from the language which he had previously held with his father, as well as from his requiring grateful Greece to pay a just equivalent, and to repair his private loss. A man who really loved would have thought nothing an equivalent for the object of his love; much less would he have intimated to her father\n\n---\n\n(b) The original passages are:\n\nκαὶ ἐν τῷ γερές αὐτὸς ἀπομονωθῆναι αὐτὸς ἔχει\nΩ ἐπὶ πολὺ μαρτυρεῖ, δοκεῖ δὲ μεν εἶναι Ἀχιλλεῖ.\nΟὐ μεν τοι πολὺ ἐνεχὼ ἐξ ὑμῶν, ὅστις Ἀχιλλεῖ\nΤρόμῳ ἐπιστρέψεις εὐαγγελοῦντος πολεμίου.\nΑλλὰ τοῦ μεν πάντων πολεμικῶν πολεμίου\nΧιρεῖς γενοί διεστεύσης ἀπὸ τοῦ πολεμικοῦ ἰδίου,\nΣοὶ τοῦ γερές παλιν μελέων ἐν ὁλίγῳ τῷ φύλῳ τῷ\nΕξοχῇ ἐχὼν τοῦ πολεμικοῦ πολεμικοῦ πολεμίου.\nIliad, lib. i.\n\nAnd, Αλλὰ δὲ τοῦ ἐρών, τοῦ δὲ εἰς Ῥητή βαλλόμενον\nΧιρεῖς μεν οὐτὶ ἐγὼ μελέων μαχητοῦ, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῦ\n\nIn this latter passage the hero says expressly, \"I will not fight with you or with any other man for the sake of a girl; but you shall not rob me of any other part of my property,\" which is surely the language of a man to whose heart love must have been an utter stranger.\nLove, father a possibility of his dismissing from his embrace a woman whom he esteemed, when time should have robbed her of every youthful grace.\n\nSince then, it is so apparent, that in the heroic age of Greece even princes and kings were strangers to the generous affection of love; it needs not occasion much surprise that the same affection has very little influence upon mankind in the lowest ranks of the most polished societies of modern Europe. That this is actually the case, that among the generality of uneducated men and women there is no other bond of attachment than the sensual appetite, every year furnishes multiplied proofs. We daily see youths, rejected by their mistresses, paying their addresses without delay to girls who, in looks, temper, and disposition, are diametrically opposite to those whom so lately they pretended to love: We daily see maidens, flighted by their lovers, receiving the addresses of men, who, in nothing but their sex, resemble the female to whom a week before they wished to be married: and we believe it is not very uncommon to find a girl entertaining several lovers together, that if one or more of them should prove false, she may still have a chance not to be totally deserted. Did esteem and benevolence, placed on manners and character, constitute any part of vulgar love, these people would act very differently; for they would find it impossible to change their lovers and their mistresses with the same ease that they change their clothes.\n\nTo this account of love, as it appears in savage nations, some one may perhaps oppose the paintings of the softer passion in the poems of Ossian. That bard describes the female character as commanding respect and esteem, and the Caledonian heroes as cherishing for their mistresses a flame so pure and elevated as never was surpassed, and has seldom been equalled, in those ages which we commonly call most enlightened. This is indeed true: and it is one of the many reasons which have induced Johnson and others to pronounce the whole a modern fiction. Into that debate we do not enter. We may admit the authenticity of the poems, without acknowledging that they furnish any exception to our general theory. They furnish indeed in the manners which they describe a wonderful anomaly in the general history of man. All other nations of which we read were in the hunter state savage and cruel. The Caledonians, as exhibited by Ossian, are gentle and magnanimous. The heroes of Homer fought for plunder, and felt no clemency for a vanquished foe. The heroes of Ossian fought for fame; and when their enemies were subdued, they took them to their bosoms. The first of Greeks committed a mean insult on the dead body of the first of Trojans. Among the Caledonians insults offered to the dead, as well as cruelty to the living, were condemned as infamous. The heroes of Ossian appear in no instance as savages. How they came to be polished and refined before they were acquainted with agriculture and the most useful arts of life, it is not our business to inquire; but since they unquestionably were so, their treatment of the female sex, instead of opposing, confirms our theory; for we never conceived rich clothes, superb houses, highly-dressed food, or even the knowledge of foreign tongues, to be necessary to the acquisition of a generous sentiment. Luxury indeed appears to be as inimical to love as barbarism: and we believe, that in modern nations, the tender and exalted affection which deserves that name is as little known among the highest orders of life as among the lowest. Perhaps the Caledonian ladies of Ossian resembled in their manners the German ladies of Tacitus, who accompanied their husbands to the chase, fought by their sides in battle, and partook with them of every danger. If so, they could not fail to be respected by a race of heroes among whom courage took place of all other virtues: and this single circumstance, from whatever cause it might proceed, will sufficiently account for the estimation of the female character among the ancient Germans and Caledonians, so different from that in which it has been held in almost every other barbarous nation.\n\nBut if among savages and the vulgar, love be unknown, it cannot possibly be an instinctive affection: and therefore it may be asked, How it gets possession of the human heart; and by what means we can judge whether in any particular instance it be real or imaginary? These questions are of importance, and deserve to be fully answered; though many circumstances conspire to render it no easy task to give to them such answers as shall be perfectly satisfactory. Love can subsist only between individuals of the different sexes. A man can hardly love two women at the same time; and we believe that a woman is still less capable of loving at once more than one man. Love, therefore, has a natural tendency to make men and women pair, or, in other words, it is the source of marriage: but in polished society, where alone this affection has any place, so many things besides mutual attachment are necessary to make the married life comfortable, that we rarely see young persons uniting from the impulse of love, and have therefore but few opportunities of tracing the rise, progress, and consequences of the affection. We shall, however, throw together such reflections as have occurred to us on the subject, not without indulging a hope, that they may be useful to the younger part of our readers when forming the most important connexion in life.\n\nWe have said, that the perception of beauty, combined with animal desire, is the first inducement which a man can have to prefer one woman to another. It may be added, that elegance of figure, a placid masculine countenance, with a person which indicates strength and agility, are the qualities which first tend to attach any woman to a particular man. Beauty has been defined*, \"That particular form, which is the most common of all particular forms to be met with in the same species of beings.\" Let us apply this definition to our own species, and try, by means Sir Joshua Reynolds, to ascertain what constitutes the beauty of the human face. It is evident, that of countenances we find a number almost infinite of different forms, of which forms one only constitutes beauty, whilst the rest, however numerous, constitute what is not beauty, but deformity or ugliness. To an attentive observer, however, it is evident, that of the numerous particular forms of ugliness, there is not one which includes so many faces as are formed after that particular cast which constitutes beauty. Every particular species of the animal as well as of the vegetable creation, may be said to have a fixed or determinate form, to which, as to a centre, nature is continually inclining. Or it may\nLove be compared to pendulums vibrating in different directions over one central point; and as they all cross the centre, though only one passes through any other point; so it will be found that perfect beauty is oftenest produced by nature than deformity: we do not mean than deformity in general, but than any one kind and degree of deformity. To instance in a particular part of a human feature: the line which forms the ridge of the nose is deemed beautiful when it is straight; but this is likewise the central form, which is oftenest found than any one particular degree of concave, convex, or any other irregular form that shall be proposed. As we are then more accustomed to beauty than deformity, we may conclude that to be the reason why we approve and admire it, just as we approve and admire fashions of dress for no other reason than that we are used to them. The same thing may be said of colour as of form: it is custom alone which determines our preference of the colour of the Europeans to that of the Ethiopians, and which makes them prefer their own colour to ours; so that though habit and custom cannot be the cause of beauty (see BEAUTY), they are certainly the cause of our liking it.\n\nThat we do like it cannot be denied. Every one is conscious of a pleasing emotion when contemplating beauty either in man or woman; and when that pleasure is combined with the gratification of the sensual appetite, it is obvious that the sum of enjoyment must be greatly increased. The perception of beauty, therefore, necessarily directs the energy of the sensual appetite to a particular object; but still this combination is a mere selfish feeling, which regards its object only as the best of many similar instruments of pleasure. Before it can deserve the name of love, it must be combined with esteem, which is never bestowed but upon moral character and internal worth; for let a woman be ever so beautiful, and of course ever so desirable as an instrument of sensual gratification, if she be not possessed of the virtues and dispositions which are peculiar to her sex, she will inspire no man with a generous affection. With regard to the outlines, indeed, whether of internal disposition or of external form, men and women are the same; but nature, intending them for mates, has given them dispositions, which though concordant, are, however, different, so as to produce together delicious harmony. \"The man, more robust, is fitted for severe labour, and for field exercises; the woman, more delicate, is fitted for sedentary occupations, and particularly for nursing children. The man, bold and vigorous, is qualified for being a protector*; the woman, delicate and timid, requires protection. Hence it is, that a man never admires a woman for possessing bodily strength or personal courage; and women always despise men who are totally destitute of these qualities. The man, as a protector, is directed by nature to govern; the woman, conscious of inferiority, is disposed to obey. Their intellectual powers correspond to the destination of nature. Men have penetration and solid judgement to fit them for governing; women have sufficient understanding to make a decent figure under good government: a greater proportion would excite dangerous rivalry between the sexes, which nature has avoided by giving them different talents. Women have more imagination and sensibility than men, which make all their enjoyments more exquisite; at the same time that they are better qualified to communicate enjoyment. Add another capital difference of disposition: the gentle and infatuated manners of the female sex tend to soften the roughness of the other sex; and wherever women are indulged with any freedom, they polish sooner than men.\n\nThese are not the only particulars that distinguish the sexes. With respect to the ultimate end of love, it is the privilege of the male, as superior and protector, to make a choice: the female, preferred, has no privilege but barely to consent or to refuse. Whether this distinction be the immediate result of the originally different dispositions of the sexes, or only the effect of associations inevitably formed, may be questioned; but among all nations it is the practice for men to court, and for women to be courted: and were the most beautiful woman on earth to invert this practice, she would forfeit the esteem, however by her external grace she might excite the desire, of the man whom she addressed. The great moral virtues which may be comprehended under the general term integrity, are all absolutely necessary to make either men or women estimable; but to procure esteem to the female character, the modesty peculiar to their sex is a very essential circumstance. Nature hath provided them with it as a defence against the artful solicitations of the other sex before marriage, and also as a support of conjugal fidelity.\n\nA woman, therefore, whose dispositions are gentle, delicate, and rather timid than bold, who is polished of a large share of sensibility and modesty, and whose manners are soft and infatuated, must, upon moral principles (see MORAL PHILOSOPHY), command the esteem and benevolence of every individual of the other sex who is possessed of sound understanding; but if her person be deformed, or not such as to excite some degree of animal desire, she will attract no man's love. In like manner, a man whose moral character is good, whose understanding is acute, and whose conversation is instructive, must command the esteem of every sensible and virtuous woman; but if his figure be disagreeable, his manner unpolished, his habits slovenly, and above all, if he be deficient in personal courage, he will hardly excite desire in the female breast. It is only when the qualities which command esteem are, in the same person, united with those which excite desire, that the individual so accomplished can be an object of love to one of the other sex; but when these qualities are thus united, each of them increases the other in the imagination of the lover. The beauty of his mistress gives her, in his apprehension, a greater share of gentleness, modesty, and everything which adorns the female character, than perhaps she really possesses; whilst his persuasion of her internal worth makes him, on the other hand, apprehend her beauty to be absolutely unrivalled.\n\nTo this theory an objection readily offers itself, which it is incumbent upon us to obviate. Men and women sometimes fall in love at first sight, and very often before they have opportunities of forming a just estimate of each other's moral character: How is this circumstance to be reconciled with the progressive generation of love? We answer, By an association of ideas which is formed upon principles of physiognomy.\nmy. Every passion and habitual disposition of mind gives a particular cast to the countenance, and is apt to discover itself in some feature of the face. This we learn by experience; and in time, without any effort of our own, the idea of each particular cast of countenance comes to be so closely associated in our minds with the internal disposition which it indicates, that the one can never afterwards be presented to our view without instantly suggesting the other to the imagination. (See Metaphysics and Physiognomy.) Hence it is that every man, who has been accustomed to make observations, naturally forms to himself, from the features and lineaments of a stranger's face, some opinion of his character and fortune. We are no sooner presented to a person for the first time, than we are immediately impressed with the idea of a proud, a reserved, an affable, or a good-natured man; and upon our going into a company of absolute strangers, our benevolence or aversion, our awe or contempt, rises instantly towards particular persons, before we have heard them speak a word, or know so much as their names or designations. The same thing happens when we are presented to the fair sex. If a woman, seen for the first time, have that particular cast of countenance, and that expression of features, to which we have associated notions of gentleness, modesty, and other female virtues, the instantly commands our esteem; and if she have likewise so much beauty as to make her an object of particular desire, esteem and desire become suddenly combined; and that combination constitutes the affection of love. Such, too, is the nature of all mental associations, that each part of which they are composed adds strength and vividness to the other parts; so that, in the present instance, desire makes us imagine virtues in the woman which her countenance perhaps does not indicate; and the virtues which are there actually visible, make us apprehend her beauty as more perfect than it is.\n\nThe affection thus generated is more or less pure, and will be more or less permanent, according as the one or the other part of which it is compounded predominates. \"Where desire of possession prevails over our esteem of the person and merits of the desirable object, love loses its benevolent character; the appetite for gratification becomes ungovernable, and tends violently to its end, regardless of the misery that must follow. In that state love is no longer a sweet agreeable affection; it becomes a selfish, painful passion, which, like hunger and thirst, produceth no happiness but in the instant of fruition; and when fruition is over, disgust and aversion generally succeed to desire. On the other hand, where esteem, founded on a virtuous character and gentle manners, prevails over animal desire, the lover would not for the world gratify his appetite at the expense of his mistress's honour or peace of mind. He wishes, indeed, for enjoyment; and to him enjoyment is more exquisite than to the mere sensual lover, because it unites sentiment with the gratification of sense; at the same time that, so far from being succeeded by disgust or aversion, it increases his benevolence to the woman, whose character and manners he esteems, and who has contributed so much to his pleasure. Benevolence to an individual, having a general end, admits of acts without number, and is seldom fully accomplished. Hence mutual love, which is composed chiefly of esteem and benevolence, can hardly be of a shorter duration than its objects. Frequent enjoyment endears such lovers to each other, and makes constancy a pleasure; and when the days of sensual enjoyment are over, esteem and benevolence will remain in the mind, making sweet, even in old age, the society of that pair, in whom are collected the affections of husband, wife, lover, friend, the tenderest affections of human nature.\"\n\nFrom the whole of this investigation, we think it appears, that the affection between the sexes which deserves the name of love, is inseparably connected with virtue and delicacy; that a man of loose morals cannot be a faithful or generous lover; that in the breast of him who has ranged from woman to woman for the mere gratification of his sensual appetite, desire must have effaced all esteem for the female character; and that, therefore, the maxim too generally received, \"that a reformed rake makes the best husband,\" has very seldom a chance to be true. We think it may likewise be inferred, that thousands fancy themselves in love who know not what love is, or how it is generated in the human breast; and therefore we beg leave to advise such of our readers as may imagine themselves to be in that state, to examine their own minds, with a view to discover, whether, if the objects of their love were old or ugly, they would still esteem them for the virtues of their character, and the propriety of their manners. This is a question which deserves to be well weighed by the young and the amorous, who, in forming the matrimonial connexion, are too often blindly impelled by the mere animal desire inflamed by beauty. \"It may indeed happen, after the pleasure of gratifying that desire is gone (and if not refined by esteem and benevolence, go it must with a swift pace), that a new bond of attachment may be formed upon more dignified and more lasting principles; but this is a dangerous experiment. Even supposing good sense, good temper, and internal worth of every sort, yet a new attachment upon such qualifications is rarely formed; because it commonly or rather always happens, that such qualifications, the only solid foundation of an indissoluble connexion, if they did not originally make esteem predominate over animal desire, are afterwards rendered altogether invisible by satiety of enjoyment creating disgust.\"\n\nLove, in Medicine. The symptoms produced by this passion as a disease, according to medical writers, are as follows: The eyelids often twinkle; the eyes are hollow, and yet appear as if full with pleasure; the pulse is not peculiar to the passion, but the same with that which attends solicitude and care. When the object of this affection is thought of, particularly if the idea is sudden, the spirits are confused, the pulse changes, and its force and time are very variable: in some instances, the person is sad and watchful; in others, the person, not being conscious of his state, pines away, is slothful, and regardless of food; though the wiser, when they find themselves in love, seek pleasant company and active entertainments. As the force of love prevails, sighs grow deeper; a tremor affects the heart and pulse; the countenance is alternately pale and red; the voice is suppressed in the faucets; the eyes grow dim; cold sweats break out; sleep abandons itself, at least until the morning; the secretions become...\nbecome disturbed; and a loss of appetite, a hectic fever, melancholy, or perhaps madness, if not death, constitutes the fatal catastrophe. On this subject the curious may consult Ægineta, lib. iii. cap. 17. Oribat. Synopsis, lib. viii. cap. 9. or a treatise professedly written on love, as it is a distemper, by James Ferrard, Oxford, printed 1640.\n\nThe manners of the Greeks and Romans were similar to each other in the affairs of love. They generally made a discovery of their passion by writing upon trees, walls, doors, &c. the name of their beloved. They usually decked the door of their dwelling with flowers and garlands, made libations of wine before their houses, sprinkling the posts with the same liquor, as if the object of their affection was a real goddess. For a man's garland to be untied, and for a woman to compose a garland, were held to be indubitable indications of their love.\n\nWhen their love was without success, they used several arts to excite affection in the object of their desire. They had recourse to enchantments, of whom the Thebanian were in the highest estimation. The means made use of were most commonly philtres or love potions, the operation of which was violent and dangerous, and frequently deprived such as drank them of their reason. Some of the most remarkable ingredients of which they were composed were: the hippocampus, the jynx, insects bred from putrefaction, the fish remora, the lizard, brains of a calf, the hairs on the tip of a wolf's tail, his secret parts, the bones of the left side of a toad eaten with ants, the blood of doves, bones of snakes, feathers of forest-owls, twisted cords of wool in which a person had hanged himself, rags, torches, relics, a nest of swallows buried and fastened in the earth, bones snatched from hungry bitches, the marrow of a boy fastened in the midst of plenty, dried human liver; to these may be added several herbs growing out of putrid substances. Such were the ingredients that entered into the composition of that infernal draught a love potion.\n\nBut, besides the philtres, various other arts were used to excite love, in which the application of certain substances was to have a magical influence on the person against whom they levelled their skill. A hyena's udder worn under the left arm, they fancied would draw the affections of whatever woman they fixed their eyes upon. That species of olives called παλαικα, and barley-bran made up into a paste, and thrown into the fire, they thought would excite the flame of love. Flour was used with the same intention. Burning laurel, and melted wax, were supposed to have the like effect. When one heart was to be hardened, and another mollified, clay and wax were exposed to the same fire together. Images of wax were frequently used, representing the persons on whom they wished to make an impression; and whatever was done to the substitute of wax, they imagined was felt by the person represented. Enchanted medicaments were often sprinkled on some part of the house where the person resided. Love pledges were supposed to be of singular use and efficacy; they were placed under their threshold, to preserve the affections of the owner from wandering. Love-knots were of singular power, and the number three was particularly observed in all they did. But no good effect was expected, if the use of these things was not attended with charms or magical verses and forms of words. See MAGIC.\n\nHaving mentioned their arts of exciting love, it may not be amiss to take notice, that the ancients imagined, that love excited by magic may be allayed by more powerful spells and medicaments, or by applying to demons more powerful than those who had been concerned in raising that passion. But love inspired without magic had no cure; Apollo himself could find no remedy, but cried out\n\n*Hei mihi quod nullis amor est medicabilis herbis.*\n\nThe antidotes against love were generally *agnum caulis*, which has the power of weakening the generative faculty; sprinkling the dust in which a mule had rolled herself; tying toads in the hide of a beast newly slain; applying amulets of minerals or herbs, which were supposed of great efficacy in other cases; and invoking the affluence of the inferior deities. Another cure for love was bathing in the waters of the river Scelennus; to which we may add the lover's leap, or jumping down from the Lecadian promontory.\n\n**Love-Apple.** See Solanum, Botany Index.\n\n**LOVENTINUM**, or **Luentinum**, in Ancient Geography, a town of the Demeta in Britain, near the mouth of the Tuerobs or Tivy. Supposed to have been afterwards swallowed up by an earthquake, and to have flood where is now the lake called Llyn Sarnau in Brecknockshire.\n\n**LOUGHBOROUGH**, a town of Leicestershire in England, 110 miles from London. It is the second town in the county, and was in the Saxons time a royal village. Its market is on Thursday; and its fairs are on April 25th, May 28th, August 11th, and November 21st. It has a large church, and a free school; besides a charity school for 80 boys, and another for 20 girls. It has been very much reduced by fires; but is still a very agreeable town, with rich meadow-ground, on the soke, which runs here almost parallel with the river Soar. The new canal has made the coal trade here very extensive.\n\n**LOUGHBRICKLAND**, a town of Ireland, situated in the county of Down, and province of Ulster, 58 miles from Dublin. The name signifies the lake of the speckled trout; and it was to be called from a lake near it, which abounds with those fish. It consists of one broad street, at the end of which is the parish church, said to have been built by Dr Taylor when bishop of Dromore, soon after the Restoration. The linen manufacture is carried on here very extensively; and the town is a great thoroughfare, the turnpike road from Dublin to Belfast passing near it.\n\n**LOUGH-DREG**, anciently *Derg-abhan*, i.e. \"the river of the woody morass,\" from a river which issues out of this lake. This lough is situated in the county of Donegal and province of Ulster in Ireland, and is famous for having in it the island that contains St Patrick's purgatory, which is a narrow little cell, hewn out of the solid rock, in which a man could scarce stand upright. There is also a lake of this name situated between the counties of Galway and Tipperary.\n\n**LOUGH-NEAGH**, a loch or lake of Ireland, situated in the counties of Armagh, Down, Derry, and Antrim, and province of Ulster. It is the largest in Europe,\nEurope, those of Ladoga and Onega in Russia, and that of Geneva in Switzerland, excepted; being 20 miles long and 15 broad. The area of this lake is computed to be 100,000 acres. It is remarkable for a healing virtue; and likewise for petrifying wood, which is not only found in the water but in the adjacent soil at a considerable depth. On its shores several beautiful gems have been discovered. Its ancient name was Loch Eacha, or Loch-Neach, from loch, \"a lake,\" and Neach, \"wonderful, divine, or eminent.\" Its petrifying powers are not instantaneous, as several of the ancients have supposed, but require a long series of ages to bring them to perfection, and appear to be occasioned by a fine mud or sand, which infuses itself into the pores of the wood, and which in process of time becomes hard like stone. On the borders of this lake is Shane's castle, the elegant seat of Lord O'Neil. Dr Smyth seems to doubt whether the healing quality in this lake is not to be confined to one side of it, called the fishing-bank; and he informs us, that this virtue was discovered in the reign of Charles II. in the instance of the son of one Mr Cunningham, who had an evil which run on him in eight or ten places; and notwithstanding all applications, seemed incurable: at length he was perfectly healed, after bathing in this lough about eight days. Hence that writer gives us another derivation of the name Loch-Neach, which (he says) seems to hint to hint at this quality; Neagh or Near, in Irish, signifying a sore or ulcer, which might not improbably be corrupted into Neagh; hence he apprehends, this lake was remarked at a much earlier period for its healing property. As to its petrifying power, it is mentioned by Nenius, a writer of the 9th century, who says, \"Est alud flagrum quod facit ligna durere in lapides. Homines autem findunt ligna, et postquam formaverunt, proiectum in flagrum, et manent in eo ulque ad caput anni, et in capite anni laps inventur; et vocatur flagrum Loch-Echach.\" Lough-Neach gives title of Baron to the family of Skeffington.\n\nLOUGH-STRANGFORD, a lake of Ireland, situated in the county of Down and province of Ulster. It takes its present name from a small port-town called Strangford, seated on the west side of the narrow entrance into the sea. It was formerly known by the name of Lough-Cone or Lough-Coyne. It is a deep bay or inlet of the sea, about 17 miles long and four or five broad; it goes west as far as Downpatrick, and north as far as Comber and Newton, and by computation covers 23,775 acres, Irish plantation measure. It abounds with excellent fish, particularly smelts; and off the bar there is a periodical herring fishery in or about August. The bar or entrance into this lough is about three miles below Strangford. There is a long rock at the entrance in the middle of the passage, dangerous to strangers on account of the current; yet there is a broad passage on either side, and deep water. The current here is very strong and rapid, running at the rate of six or seven miles an hour. There are but few vessels that go higher up than Strangford. A good many vessels bound up the Channel put in here, if the wind is unfavourable to their passage. The islands in this lake are numerous; Doctor Boat enumerates them at 260. But from an actual survey, made at the time Dr Smyth wrote his history of that county, it appears, there are 54 islands small and great, known by particular names, and many others nameless; the contents of these 54 islands added together amount to 954 acres and a half. The great and profitable manufacture carried on in these islands, and the flat stony coasts surrounding the lake, is the burning of sea-weed into kelp, which employs a number of hands, and has been computed to produce to the several proprietors a neat profit of 1000l. per annum and upwards. Four of the islands here are called Swan islands from the number of swans that frequent them.\n\nLOUIS, or St Louis, Knights of, the name of a military order in France, instituted by Louis XIV. in 1693. Their colours were of a flame colour, and palls from left to right; the king was their grand master. There were in it eight great crosses, and 24 commanders; the number of knights was not limited. At the time of their institution, the king charged his revenue with a fund of 900,000 livres for the pensions of the commanders and knights.\n\nLOUIS, Lewis, Louis d'or, or Louvidore, a French coin, first struck in 1640, under the reign of Louis XIII., and which has now a considerable currency. See Money-Table.\n\nLOUISIANA, formerly a Spanish province of N. America, now belonging to the United States, is bounded on the east by the Mississippi, on the south by the gulf of Mexico, on the west by New Mexico, and on the north by boundaries which have not been defined. It is intersected by a number of fine rivers, and the greater part of the inhabitants are said to be Roman Catholics. They are chiefly the descendants of the French and Canadians; but in different settlements of this extensive country there are likewise to be met with the descendants of people from Germany, as well as numbers of Acadians and Americans. The population in 1785, when a census was taken, amounted to more than 50,000 souls; but different authors are of opinion that this is much below the proper estimate, notwithstanding the population bears no proportion to the extent of the country. According to another estimate there are 89,970. The inhabitants have often attempted to cultivate the sugar cane, but they found the climate rather unfavourable to the culture of that plant. They chiefly export indigo, cotton, rice, beans, myrtle, wax, and lumber. But if the climate is unfriendly to the sugar-cane, it is said to be favourable to the health of the people, and to the culture of fruits and garden vegetables. The total value of the exports from Louisiana in 1802 is said to have amounted to 2,158,000 dollars, and of the imports to about 3,42,000 dollars above that sum.\n\nThere are but few domestic manufactures of any importance in Louisiana, but such of the inhabitants as are denominated Acadians, manufacture some cotton into quilts and cottonades; and in the remote parts of the province, those planters who are poor, are in the habit of spinning cloth mixed with wool for the use of the negroes. In the parish of Iberville there is a machine for spinning cotton, and another in the Opelousas, but neither of them very extensive; a considerable manufacture of cordage, twelve distilleries for making tafia, and a sugar refinery which manufactures about 200,000 lbs. of loaf sugar annually. The trade by sea is considerable, for in the year 1802 there entered\nLouisiana, the river Mississippi 268 vessels of all descriptions, one of which belonged to France, 97 to Spain, and 170 to America; and 265 sailed from the Mississippi in the same year, three of which belonged to France, 104 to Spain, and 158 to America. The coaling trade is also considerable from Pensacola, Mobile, and the creeks and rivers falling into Lake Pontchartrain, from whence ship timber, charcoal, lime, pitch and tar, are conveyed to New Orleans, in which about 500 sloops and schooners from eight to 30 tons are frequently employed.\n\nA return of the militia of Louisiana was made by the baron of Carondelet to the court of Spain, which made them amount to 19,340 men; but in this estimate were included several companies of volunteers, negroes, and even companies of privileged horse, or cavalry. There are not above 930 native Indians in this vast country, some of whom are employed by the settlers as boatmen on the Red river, and much esteemed for their friendship to the whites, for their bravery and generosity.\n\nThe fortifications which have been erected in Louisiana scarcely merit our attention. Fort St Louis is commanded by a lieutenant-colonel, with a handful of troops; Baton Rouge is extremely ill constructed, and contains about 50 men; Fort Plaquemines, about 12 leagues from the sea, is an irregular work built of bricks, and badly constructed, on the east side of the river Mississippi, having a ditch in front of the river, and defended on the lower side by a deep creek. It is defenseless behind, as those by whom it was erected had placed too much confidence in the swamplands of the ground, which is every day growing harder. It would be no difficult matter to take it by escalade, for by the negligence of the people it is fast falling into ruins. The small redoubt called Fort Bourbon, is generally under the command of a sergeant, with a very small company. Should a vessel attempt to pass without sending a boat on shore, she would be instantly fired upon.\n\nWhen Louisiana was first ceded to Spain, it preserved many of the regulations peculiar to France; but the province afterwards came to be governed by the laws of Spain, and the ordinances formed expressly for the colony. The governor's court has a civil and military jurisdiction throughout the province. That of the lieutenant-governor has the same extent in civil cases only. There are two alcaldes, whose jurisdiction, civil and criminal, extends through the city of New Orleans and five leagues around it, where the parties have no fuero militar, or military privilege; those who have can transfer their causes to the governor. The tribunal of the alcade provincial has cognizance of criminal causes, where offences are committed in the country, or when the criminal takes refuge there, and in other specified cases. The ecclesiastical tribunal has jurisdiction in all matters respecting the church.\n\nThere are no colleges in Louisiana, and but one public school, which is at New Orleans, the masters of which receive their salary from the king. They teach nothing but the Spanish language, and there are a few private schools for the benefit of children. It is remarkable that not more than one-half of the inhabitants are supposed qualified to read and write, and of these it is said that not above 200 are capable of doing it well.\n\nThe clergy consist of a bishop, who does not reside in the province, and whose salary of 4000 dollars is charged on the revenue of certain bishoprics in Mexico and Cuba; two canons have each a salary of 600 dollars; and 25 curates, five for the city of New Orleans, and 20 for as many country parishes, who receive about 400 dollars each. These salaries, exclusive of that of the bishop, are paid by the treasury at New Orleans, and their annual amount has been estimated at 13,000 dollars.\n\nInstead of paying local taxes, each inhabitant is bound to make and repair roads, bridges, and embankments through his own land. A duty of six per cent. is payable at the customhouse, on the transfer of shipping. It is ascertained upon the sum the buyer and seller declare to be the real consideration. As no oath is required from either, they seldom report more than half the price. Two per cent. is payable on legacies and inheritances, coming from collaterals, and exceeding 2000 dollars; four per cent. on legacies given to persons who are not relatives of the testator. A tax on civil employments, if their salaries exceed 300 dollars. A tax is levied of 40 dollars per annum for licenses to sell liquors, and five per cent. on all imports and exports, which amounts to about 120,000 dollars, while the amount of all the other taxes does not exceed 6000 dollars.\n\nThe expenses of the government of Louisiana are paid to amount to 650,000 dollars, to pay which there are 400,000 dollars sent annually from Vera Cruz, in consequence of which deficiency the debt is said at present to amount to 450,000 dollars, bearing no interest, and depreciated 30 per cent.\n\nSoon after Louisiana was ceded to the United States, there were two societies established for the promotion of science and literature, one of them at New Orleans, and another at Natchez. The former designs to publish a monthly magazine for the purpose of diffusing a knowledge of the country, and to amuse the readers of it with a variety of useful subjects. The latter, which was established in 1803, called the Mississippi Society for the Acquisition and Dissemination of Useful Knowledge, consists of near 40 members, and has correspondents in various parts of the United States.

It is a town corporate; and one of the handsomest and gayest in the county, there being in it not only frequent assemblies, concerts, &c., but even masquerades. Here are several handsome houses. From hence there is a canal to the sea at Tilney, about eight miles. Besides a charity school for 40 children, it has a free school founded by Edward VI. with a large church, and a fine steeple, which some think is as high as Grantham spire, which is 288 feet.\n\nLOUTH, a county in the eastern part of Ireland, which extends in the form of a bow or half-moon, on the side of the ocean, being much longer than it is broad; it is bounded on the south and south-west by the county of East Meath, on the north-west by Monaghan, on the north by Armagh, and on the north-east\nLouth, east by the bay of Carlingford, which parts it from the county of Down; it is watered by several small rivers which fall into the sea; and its south frontiers are watered by the river Boyne. Its chief towns are Dundalk and Carlingford; unless we include Drogheda, a part whereof is in this county. It is the smallest county in the kingdom; but very fertile and pleasant, and abounding with many remains of antiquities, of which Mr Wright, in his Louthiana, has given a very ample description. It contains 111,180 Irish plantation acres, 50 parishes, five baronies, and five boroughs; and formerly returned 10 members to parliament: it is about 22 miles long, and 14 broad.\n\nLouth, a town in the above county, having a yearly fair.\n\nLOUVAIN, a city in the Austrian Netherlands, in the province of Brabant, pleasantly seated on the river Dyle, in a plentiful and agreeable country. The walls are about eight or nine miles in circumference; but they include several fields and vineyards. The castle stands on a high hill, surrounded with fine gardens, and has a charming prospect all over the country. This town contains nine market places, 14 water-mills, 126 streets, 16 stone bridges, and several handsome palaces. The townhouse is a venerable old building, adorned with statues on the outside; and the churches are very handsome, particularly the collegiate church of St Peter; but the principal ornament is the university, founded only in 1426 by John IV, duke of Brabant, with the concurrence of Pope Martin V. It contains about 40 colleges, four of which are called Pedagogia. There is in the number also an English college of friars-preachers, which owes its establishment to the liberality of Cardinal Philip Howard, brother to the duke of Norfolk, who, before he was raised to the purple, had been private chaplain to Queen Catherine, comfort to Charles II. The Irish have likewise a seminary, erected in part under the care of Eugenius Matheus, titular archbishop of Dublin, anno 1623, which receives its appointments from the Propaganda at Rome. Besides the above, there are two convents for the Irish, one of Recollets and the other of Dominicans, where divinity and the matheis are taught. In the last century the number of scholars exceeded 4000; but in the year 1744 the inhabitants amounted to 12,000, including 2000 students only.—At the beginning of the 14th century, under John III, it flourished considerably in the manufacture of woollen cloth: 400 houses were then occupied by substantial clothiers, who gave employment to an incredible number of weavers, so great, it is said, that a bell was rung to prevent any injuries which the children in the street might receive from the crowd and hurry on their returning from work. In 1382, these weavers, however, took up arms, and rebelled against their sovereign Prince Wenceslaus, throwing from the windows of the town hall 17 of the aldermen and counsellors, and afterwards proceeded to lay waste great part of Brabant; but being besieged and reduced to great extremities, they submissively implored his clemency; which was granted after the execution of some of the principal ringleaders. The weavers, the chief instigators to this revolt, were banished, the greater part of whom took refuge in England; where they first introduced, or at least augmented very much, the woollen manufacture. The town, by this circumstance, being almost depopulated, the university was established to supply in some measure the loss of the rebellious clothiers. Since that time the manufacture gradually declined, no cloth of any account being made there at present. This impolitic step of the duke Wenceslaus sent treasures to England, through the hands of those exiled people: an important lesson to governors, that they should deal with great precaution respecting such useful members of the community. Upon the ruins of these looms was formed the cloth manufacture of Limbourg, which is carried on with good advantage to this day. There is yet standing at Louvain part of the old drapers' hall, now converted into four public schools, where lectures in divinity, philosophy, law, and physic, are given, and the public acts are made. Adjoining to the schools is the university library, which altogether compose a large pile of building. Over the door of the chief entrance we read these words, Sapientia adfascit fibidum. The principal church is collegiate, dedicated to St Peter, which had formerly three very large towers with elevated spires, one considerably higher than the two collaterals; these were blown down in the year recorded by this chronogram, oMnIa CaDVnt. From the name of this church the burghers have acquired the nickname of Petermen, whose ancestors having clothed the back by a noble woollen manufacture, the modern Petermen now compose an ignoble mixture for the belly, called after them Peterman beer, a sort of whitish muddy ale, which they notwithstanding send in large quantities to all parts of the country, as well as to Holland, by the canals. Louvain was anciently the capital of the province, long before Brussels had any claim to that title. It was taken by the French in 1792, afterwards lost, and retaken in 1794. E. Long. 4° 40'. N. Lat. 51° 12'.\n\nLOUYS, or Louis, John, an engraver of considerable eminence, who flourished about the middle of the 16th century. According to Basan he was a native of Flanders. He learned the art of engraving from Peter Soutman, at the time that Snyderhoef studied under the same master; and his usual style of engraving bears some resemblance to that of his master's. One of his best prints is Diana, with her nymphs, reposting after the chase; a middling-sized plate, length-wise, from Rubens.\n\nLOW-BELL, in birding, a name given to a bell, by means of which they take birds in the night, in open champaign countries, and among stubble, in October. The method is to go out about nine o'clock at night in a still evening, when the air is mild and the moon does not shine. The low-bell should be of a deep and hollow sound, and of such a size that a man may conveniently carry it in one hand. The person who carries it is to make it toll all the way he goes, as nearly as may be, in that manner in which the bell on the neck of a sheep tolls as it goes on and feeds. There must also be a box made like a large lanthorn, about a foot square, and lined with tin, but with one side open. Two or three great lights are to be set in this; and the box is to be fixed to the person's breast, with the open side forwards, so that the light may be cast forward to a great distance. It will spread as it goes out of the box; and will distinctly show to the person that carries it whatever there is in the large space of...\nof ground over which it extends, and consequently all\nthe birds that roost upon the ground. Two persons\nmust follow him who carries the box and bell; one\non each side, so as not to be within the reach of the light\nto show themselves. Each of these is to have a hand-\nnet of about three or four feet square, fastened to a long\nstick or pole; and on whichever side any bird is seen\nat roost, the person who is nearest is to lay his net\nover it, and take it with as little noise as possible.\nWhen the net is over the bird, the person who laid it\nis not to be in a hurry to take the bird, but must stay\ntill he who carries the light is got beyond it, that the\nmovements may not be discovered. The blaze of the\nlight and the noise of the bell terrify and amaze the\nbirds in such a manner that they remain still to be\ntaken; but the people who are about the work must\nkeep the greatest quiet and stillness that may be.\n\nSome people are fond of going on this scheme\nalone. The person then fixes the light box to his\nbreast, and carries the bell in one hand and the net\nin the other; the net in this case may be somewhat\nsmaller, and the handle shorter. When more than\none are out at a time, it is always proper to carry a\ngun; as it is no uncommon thing to spy a hare when\non this expedition.\n\nLOW, EAST, a town of Cornwall in England,\n231 miles from London, in the post road from Ply-\nmouth. It is an ancient borough by prescription,\nmade a corporation by charter of Queen Elizabeth,\nconsisting of nine burgesses (one of whom is yearly\nchosen mayor), a recorder, aldermen, &c.; and\nthe mayor, magistrates, and freemen, who are about 68,\nchoose the members of parliament. This being a ma-\nnor of the duchy of Cornwall, was settled by King\nWilliam on Lord Somers, and is now held by the cor-\nporation at the fee-farm rent of 20s. a-year. It is feat-\nured pretty commodiously on a creek of the sea, over\nwhich there is a large stone bridge, supported by 15\narches, which leads to West Low, standing between\ntwo hills. The chief benefit which the inhabitants\nhave is in their fishery. Here is a battery of four\nguns and a small chapel.\n\nLow, West, called also Port Pigham, a town of\nCornwall, divided from East Low by a stone bridge\nof 15 arches over the river Low, from whence both\ntowns receive their name, as the river does from the\ntowns of its current between its high banks. The\ncorporation, by charter of Queen Elizabeth, consists\nof 12 burgesses, one of whom is annually chosen\nmayor, and, with the other burgesses, has power to\nchoose a steward. Its members, whom it has sent to\nparliament ever since the 6th of Edward VI., are elect-\ned by the corporation and freemen, who are about\n60. There was a chapel of ease here in the reign of\nHenry VIII., which was afterwards converted into a\ntown-hall; and the town lying in the parish of Tal-\nland, the people go thither to church. There is a\npretty little harbour here; near the mouth of which\nis a small island called St George's, which abounds\nwith sea pies. The river here is navigable for vessels\nof 100 tons.\n\nLOWER, RICHARD, an eminent English physician\nin the 17th century, was born in Cornwall, and edu-\ncated at Westminster school and Oxford. He entered\non the physic line; and practised under Dr Thomas\nWillis, whom he instructed in some parts of anatomy,\nespecially when the latter was writing his Cerebri Ana-\ntomie. He, with Dr Willis, in 1674, discovered the\nmedicinal waters at Athop in Northamptonshire;\nwhich, upon their recommendation, became very much\nfrequented. In 1666 he followed Dr Willis to Lon-\ndon; practised physic under him; and became fellow\nof the Royal Society, and of the College of Physicians.\nIn 1669 he published his Tractatus de Cordis; and, af-\nter the death of Dr Willis in 1675, he was esteemed\nthe most eminent physician in London. Upon the\nbreaking out of the Popish plot in 1678, says Mr\nWood in his Athenæ Oxonienses, he clouted with the\nWhigs, supposing that party would carry all before\nthem; but, being mistaken, he lost his credit and\npractice. He died in 1691.\n\nLOWERING, among distillers, a term used to\nexpress the debasing the strength of any spirituous\nliquor, by mixing water with it. The standard and\nmarketable price of these liquors is fixed in regard to\na certain strength in them called proof; this is that\nstrength which makes them, when shaken in a phial or\npoured from on high into a glass, retain a froth or\ncrown of bubbles for some time. In this state, spirits\nconsist of about half pure or totally inflammable spirit,\nand half water; and if any foreign or home spirits are\nto be exposed to sale, and are found to have that\nproof wanting, scarce any body will buy it till it has\nbeen distilled again and brought to that strength; and\nif it is above that strength, the proprietor usually adds\nwater to it to bring it down to that standard. See the\narticle PROOF.\n\nThere is another kind of lowering among the re-\ntailers of spirituous liquors to the vulgar, by reducing\nit under the standard proof. Whoever has the art of\ndoing this without destroying the bubble proof, which\nis easily done by means of some addition that gives a\ngreater tenacity to the parts of the spirits, will de-\nceive all that judge by this proof alone. In this case,\nthe best way to judge of liquors is by the eye and\ntongue, and especially by the instrument called Hy-\ndrometer.\n\nLOWTH, WILLIAM, D.D., a learned divine, born\nat London in 1661, was the son of an apothecary, and\ntook his degrees at Oxford. His eminent worth and\nlearning recommended him to Dr Mew bishop of Win-\nchester, who made him his chaplain, gave him\ntwo livings in Hampshire, and conferred on him a\nprebend in the cathedral of Winchester. He acquired\nan unusual share of critical learning. Thus situated\nin life, the labours of Mr Lowth appear to have been\nstrictly confined within the limits of his own province,\nand applied solely to the peculiar duties of his func-\ntion; yet, in order that he might acquit himself the\nbetter in theology, he had pursued his studies with a\nmore general and extensive view. Few were more\ndeeply versed in critical learning; there being scarcely\nany ancient author, Greek or Latin, profane or eccle-\nsiastical, especially the latter, but what he had read\nwith accuracy, constantly accompanying his reading\nwith critical and philological remarks. Of his col-\nlections in this way he was upon all occasions very\ncommunicative. Hence his notes on Clemens Alexan-\ndrinus, which are to be met with in Potter's edition\nof that father. Hence his remarks on Josephus, com-\nmunicated\nLowth communicated to Hudson for his edition, and acknowledged in the preface; as also those larger and more numerous annotations on the Ecclesiastical Historians, inserted in Reading's edition of them at Cambridge. The author of Bibliotheca Biblica was indebted to him for the same kind of assistance. Chandler, late bishop of Durham, while engaged in his \"Defence of Christianity, from the Prophecies of the Old Testament, against the Discourse of the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion,\" and in his \"Vindication of the Defence, in answer to The Scheme of Literal Prophecy considered,\" held a constant correspondence with him, and consulted him upon many difficulties that occurred in the course of that work. The most valuable part of his character was that which least appeared in the eyes of the world, the private and retired part, that of the good Christian and the useful parish priest. His piety, his diligence, his hospitality and beneficence, rendered his life highly exemplary, and greatly enforced his public exhortations. He married Margaret, daughter of Robert Pitt, Esq., of Blandford, by whom he had two sons and three daughters. (See the next article.) He died in 1732, and was buried by his own orders in the churchyard at Buriton. He published, 1. A Vindication of the Divine Authority and Inspiration of the Old and New Testaments; 2. Directions for the profitable reading of the Holy Scriptures; 3. Commentaries on the Prophets; and other works.\n\nLowth, Robert, D.D. second son of the preceding Dr William Lowth, and bishop successively of St David's, Oxford, and London, was born on the 29th of November 1710, probably at Buriton in the county of Hants. He received the rudiments of his education at Winchester college, where his school exercises were distinguished by uncommon elegance; and having resided the requisite number of years in that seminary, in 1730 he succeeded on the foundation at New College, Oxford. He took the degree of M.A. June 8, 1737. Though his abilities must have been known to those with whom he was connected, he was not forward to appear before the world as a writer. At Oxford he continued many years improving his talents, with little notice from the great, and with preferment so small as to have at present escaped the distinct recollection of some of his contemporaries.\n\nHe was not, however, suffered to languish for ever in obscurity. His genius and his learning forced themselves upon the notice of the illustrious society of which he was a member; and he was placed in a station where he was eminently qualified to shine. In 1741 he was elected by the university to the professorship of poetry, re-elected in 1743, and whilst he held that office he read his admirable lectures De sacra poesia Hebræorum. In 1744 Bishop Hoadley collated him to the rectory of Ovington in the county of Hants; added to it, nine years afterwards, the rectory of East Wealdon in the same county; and in the interim raised him to the dignity of archdeacon of Winchester. These repeated favours he some years afterwards acknowledged in the following manly and respectful terms of gratitude: \"This address, My Lord, is not more necessary on account of the subject, than it is in respect of the author. Your Lordship, unloved and unasked, called him from one of those colleges to a station of the first dignity in your diocese, and took the earliest opportunity of accumulating your favour upon him, and of adding to that dignity a suitable support. These obligations he is now the more ready thus publicly to acknowledge, as he is removed out of the reach of further favours of the like kind. And though he hath relinquished the advantages so generously conferred on him, yet he shall always esteem himself highly honoured in having once enjoyed the patronage of the great advocate of civil and religious liberty.\"\n\nOn the 8th of July 1754 the university of Oxford conferred upon him the degree of D.D. by diploma; an honour which, as it is never granted but to distinguished merit, was probably conferred on Mr Lowth in consequence of his prelections on the Hebrew poetry, which had then been lately published. Having in 1749 travelled with Lord George and Lord Frederick Cavendish, he had a claim upon the patronage of the Devonshire family; and in 1755, the late duke being then lord lieutenant of Ireland, Dr Lowth went to that kingdom as his grace's first chaplain. Soon after this appointment he was offered the bishopric of Limerick; but preferring a less dignified station in his own country, he exchanged it with Dr Leake, prebendary of Durham and rector of Sedgefield, for these preferments. In November 1765 he was chosen F.R.S. In June 1766 he was, on the death of Dr Squire, preferred to the bishopric of St David's; which, in the October following, he resigned for that of Oxford, vacant by the translation of Bishop Hume to Salisbury. In April 1777, he was translated to the see of London, vacant by the death of Bishop Terrick; and in 1783 he declined the offer of the primacy of all England.\n\nHaving been long afflicted with the stone, and having long borne the severest sufferings of pain and sickness with the most exemplary fortitude and resignation, this great and good man died at Fulham, Nov. 3, 1787; and on the 12th his remains were privately interred in a vault at Fulham church, near those of his predecessor. He had married in 1752, Mary, the daughter of Laurence Jackson of Christ-church, Hants, Esq., by whom he had two sons and five daughters. His lady and two children only survived him.\n\nHis literary character may be estimated from the value and the importance of his works; in the account of which we may begin with his Prelections on the Hebrew Poetry. The choice of so interesting a subject naturally attracted general attention; and the work has been read with equal applause abroad and at home. In these prelections the author has acquitted himself in the most masterly manner, as a poet, a critic, and a divine; and such is the classic purity of his Latin style, that though we have read the work with the closest attention, and with no other view than to discover, if possible, an Anglicism in the composition, we never found a single phrase to which, we believe, a critic of the Augustan age could possibly have objected. This is an excellence to which neither Milton nor Johnson has attained; to which indeed no other English writer of Latin with whom we are acquainted has attained, unless perhaps Atterbury must be excepted. To the prelections was subjoined a short confutation of Bishop Hare's system of Hebrew metre; which occasioned a Latin letter from Dr Edwards of Clarendon.\nLowth, Clare-hall, Cambridge, to Dr Lowth, in vindication of the Harian metre. To this the author of the prelusions replied in a larger confutation, in which Bishop Hare's system is completely overthrown, and the fallacy upon which it was built accurately investigated. After much attentive consideration, Bishop Lowth has pronounced the metre of the Hebrews to be perfectly irrecoverable.\n\nIn 1753 he published *The life of William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester*, with a dedication to Bishop Hoadley; which involved him in a dispute concerning a decision which that bishop had lately made respecting the wardenship of Winchester college. This controversy was on both sides carried on with such abilities, that, though relating to a private concern, it may yet be read, if not with pleasure, at least with improvement. The life of Wykeham is drawn from the most authentic sources; and affords much information concerning the manners, and some of the public transactions, of the period in which Wykeham lived, whilst it displays some private intelligence respecting the two literary societies of which he was the founder. In these two societies Dr Lowth was educated, and he gratefully expresses his obligations to them.\n\nIn 1762 was first published his *Short Introduction to English Grammar*, which has since gone through many editions. It was originally designed only for private and domestic use; but its judicious remarks being too valuable to be confined to a few, the book was given to the world; and the excellence of its method, which teaches what is right by showing what is wrong, has insured public approbation and very general use. In 1765 Dr Lowth was engaged with Bishop Warburton in a controversy, which made much noise at the time, which attracted the notice even of royalty, and of which the memory is still recent. If we do not wish to dwell on the particulars of this controversy, it is because violent literary contention is an evil, which, though like other war it may sometimes be unavoidable, is yet always to be regretted; and because the characters of learned, ingenious, and amiable men, never appear to less advantage than under the form which that state of hostility obliges them to assume. The two combatants indeed engaged with erudition and ingenuity such as is seldom brought into conflict; but it appears that, in the opinion of Dr Johnson, Warburton had the most scholastic learning, and that Lowth was the most correct scholar; that, in their contest with each other, neither of them had much argument, and that both were extremely abusive. We have heard, and we hope it is true, that they were afterwards reconciled, and expressed mutual regret for the violence of their past conduct.\n\nIn 1778 Bishop Lowth published his last great work, *A Translation of Isaiah*. To his literary and theological abilities, the translator joined the most critical knowledge of the character and spirit of the eastern poetry; and, accordingly, the prophecies of Isaiah (which, though almost always sublime or elegant, are yet sometimes obscure) were translated in a manner adequate to the highest expectations of the public. Several occasional discourses, which the bishop, by his station, was at different times called upon to deliver, were of course published, and are all worthy of their excellent author; but there is one on the kingdom of God, on the extension and progressive improvement of Christ's religion, and on the means of promoting these by the advancement of religious knowledge, by freedom of inquiry, by toleration, and mutual charity, which may be distinguished above the rest, as exhibiting a most comprehensive view of the successive states of the Christian church, and containing the truest principles of Christianity.\n\nOf the bishop's poetical pieces, none display greater merit than Verses on the Genealogy of Christ, and the Choice of Hercules, both written very early in his life. He wrote a spirited Imitation of an Ode of Horace, applied to the alarming situation of this country in 1745; and likewise some Verses on the death of Frederic prince of Wales, with a few smaller poems. The following inscription on the tomb of his daughter, beautifully displays his paternal affection and classic taste. As it is short, and, in our opinion, has all the merit of the ancient epitaph, the reader will probably be pleased with such a specimen of his lordship's Latinity.\n\n*Cara, vale, ingenio praefatus, pietate, pudore,\nEt plagi quam natae nomine cara, vale.*\n*Cara Maria, vale. At venet felicius ævum,\nQuando iterum tecum, fum modo dignus, ero.*\n*Cara, redi, leeta tum dicam voce, paternos;\nEja, age in amplexu, cara Maria, redi.*\n\nLearning and taste, however, did not constitute Bishop Lowth's highest excellence. Eulogium itself can scarcely ascend to extravagance when speaking of him either as a private man or as a pastor of the church of Christ. His amiable manners rendered him an ornament to his high station, whilst they endeared him to all with whom he conversed; and his zeal for the interests of true religion made him eager to promote to places of trust and dignity such clergymen as he knew were best qualified to fill them. Of his modesty, gentleness, and pleasing conversation, we have the testimony of one whose decision will hardly be disputed.—\"It would answer no end (says Bishop Warburton) to tell you what I thought of the author of Hebrew poetry, before I saw him. But this I may say, I was never more surprized, when I did see him, than to find him of such amiable and gentle manners, of so modest, sensible, and disengaged a deportment.\" He united, indeed, in an eminent degree, the qualities of the gentleman with those of the scholar: he conversed with elegance, as he wrote with accuracy. As a husband, a father, or the master of a family, he was as nearly faultless as the imperfections of humanity will easily permit. His temper, when roused by what he thought improper conduct was indeed susceptible of considerable warmth; but if he could be highly offended, upon a slight conception he could likewise forgive. His heart was tender and sympathetic. He possessed a mind which felt its own strength, and decided on whatever came before it with promptitude and firmness. In those trials where affliction was to be suffered or subdued, he behaved as a man and a Christian. His piety had no tincture of moroseness; his charity no leaven of ostentation. To his whole diocese he was endeared by his laudable discretion and his useful zeal. To the world he was a benefit by his exemplary life and his splendid abilities. And whilst virtue and learning are reverenced...\nreverenced among men, the memory of Lowth will be respected and admired.\n\n**LOXIA**, a genus of birds of the order of passerines. See Ornithology Index.\n\n**LOYOLA, IGNATIUS.** See Ignatius.\n\n**LOZENGE,** in Heraldry, a four-cornered figure, resembling a pane of glass in old caements. See Heraldry. Though all heralds agree, that single ladies are to place their arms on lozenges, yet they differ with respect to the caule that gave rise to it. Plutarch says, in the life of Theseus, that in Megara, an ancient town of Greece, the tomb-stones, under which the bodies of the Amazons lay, were shaped after that form; which some conjecture to be the caule why ladies have their arms on lozenges. S. Petra Sancta will have this shield to represent a cybion, whereupon women used to fit and spin, or do other housework. Sir J. Ferne thinks it is formed from the shield called teffera, which the Romans finding unfit for war, did allow to women to place their ensigns upon, with one of its angles always uppermost.\n\nLozenges, among jewellers, are common to brilliant and rose diamonds. In brilliants, they are formed by the meeting of the skill and star facets on the bezel; in the latter, by the meeting of the facets in the horizontal ribs of the crown. See Facets.\n\nLozenge is also a form of medicine, made into small pieces, to be held or chewed in the mouth till they are melted there: the same with what are otherwise called trochisci, \"troches.\"\n\n**LUBEC,** a city and port-town of Germany, in the circle of Lower Saxony and duchy of Holstein, in E. Long. 10° 35'. N. Lat. 54° 20'. It stands at the confluence of several rivers, the largest of which is the Trave, 12 miles from the Baltic, where it has a fine harbour, and 40 north-east of Hamburg. By the Steckenitz, another of those rivers, it has a communication with the Elbe, and consequently with the German ocean. The city lies on the side of a hill, with the Trave, increased by the Steckenitz on the one side, and the Wakenitz on the other; and is strongly fortified with battions, moats, walls, and ramparts; the last of which are planted with trees, and form an agreeable walk. Lubeck being formerly the chief of the Hanse towns, was very powerful in consequence of the vast trade it carried on; but a great part of that trade is now transferred to Hamburg; however, it is still said to employ 150 of its own ships, and has a great share of the Baltic trade. It is about two miles in length, and more than one in breadth. The houses are all of stone, but old fashioned. Several of the streets have on each side rows of lime trees, with canals in the middle, like those of Holland. The public structures consist of the ancient cathedral of the bishopric of Lubeck, and several other Lutheran churches; a nunnery for 22 ladies, with an abbot and priors; a poor-house, an alms-house, and house of correction; an orphan-house, an hospital dedicated to the Holy Ghost; a house in which poor travellers are entertained three days, and then sent forward with a pass; but such as happen to be sick, are provided with all necessaries till they recover or die; the city armoury, a grammar school of seven classes, the Calvinist church, and the Popish chapel. The deputies of the Hanse towns used to meet here formerly in the townhouse.\n\nAn alliance still subsists between Lubeck, Hamburg, and Bremen; and these cities, under the name of Hanse towns, negotiate treaties with foreign powers. Here are divers manufactures, and the city's territory is about 60 miles in compass. In the diet of the empire Lubeck is poffelled of the third seat among the Rhinii imperial cities; and among those of the circle, has the first. In the matricula, its affefement is 480 florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar it pays 557 rix-dollars and 88 kruiters. The city is a republic within itself, and both makes and executes laws in regard to civil and criminal matters, &c. A father and son, or two brothers, cannot be in the regency at the same time. The famous league of the Hanse-towns was begun here in 1164. This city had its charter of privileges from the emperor Frederic II. Formerly it carried on wars, both offensive and defensive, for several years, not only against the dukes of Mecklenburg, but against the kings of Sweden and Denmark; particularly in 1428, when it fitted out 250 ships of force against Eric X. king of Denmark. There are about 20 churches in Lubeck, with lofty steeples or spires. The Trave brings ships of burden into the very heart of the city; but the largest unload at Travemunde, i.e. the mouth of the Trave, eight or ten miles distant. Formerly it is said to have employed no less than 600 ships. In the famous cellar here, it is said, there is wine 200 years old. The church of St Mary's, a noble lofty pile, is supported by tall pillars, all of one stone each, and has a high spire, covered with gilt lead. The town's garrison consists of about 700 or 800 men. The revenue of its Lutheran bishop, though he is a prince of the empire, is said not to exceed 3000l. Lubeck fell into the hands of the French in 1806, when Bonaparte overran the Prussian dominions; and many of the inhabitants were cruelly massacred and plundered.\n\n**LUBEN,** a town of Germany, in the marquisate of Lower Lusatia. It is situated on the river Spree, and is the capital of a small circle of the same name. It is the seat of the diets, and of the chief tribunals and offices; and has several churches, with a noble land-house and hospital. E. Long. 14° 25'. N.

His labours, however, were ineffectual; being himself persecuted by the Lutheran ministers, and banished from place to place; until at length he was banished out of the world, with his two daughters, by poison, his wife narrowly escaping, in 1675. We have of his writing A History of the Reformation in Poland; A Treatise on Comets; with other works, in Latin.\n\n**LUBIN, Eilhard,** was professor of poetry in the university of Rostock in 1595; and ten years afterwards was promoted to the professorship of divinity. He wrote notes on Anacreon, Juvenal, Persius, &c. and several other works; but that which made the most noise is a treatise on the nature and origin of evil, entitled Phosphorus de Causa prima et Nature Mali, printed at Rostock in 1596; in which we have a curious hypothesis to account for the origin of moral evil.\nHe supposed two co-eternal principles, not matter and vacuum, as Epicurus did; but God, and Nihilum or Nothing. This being published against by Graver, was defended by Lubin; but after all he is deemed better acquainted with polite literature than with divinity. He died in 1621.\n\nLUBLIN, a handsome and considerable town of Poland, capital of the palatinate of the same name, with a citadel, a bishop's see, an university, and a handsome Jewish synagogue.

Lucani, the people, descendants of the Samnites. Lucanus the epithet, (Horace). Lucae boves denoted elephants; first seen in Pyrrhus's wars in Lucania, whence the appellation (Pliny).\n\nLUCANUS, MARCUS ANNEUS, a Latin poet, born at Corduba in Spain, about A.C. 39. He was the son of Anneus Mela, the youngest brother of Seneca; and was conveyed to Rome from the place of his nativity at the age of eight months; a circumstance, as his more indulgent critics observe, which sufficiently refutes the censure of those who consider his language as provincial. At Rome he was educated under the Stoic Cornutus, so warmly celebrated by his disciple Persius the satirist, who was the intimate friend of our poet. In the close of his education, Lucan is said to have passed some time at Athens. On his return to Rome he rose to the office of quaestor, before he had attained the legal age. He was afterwards enrolled among the augurs; and married a lady of noble birth, and of a most amiable character. Lucan had for some time been admitted to familiarity with Nero, when the emperor chose to contend for poetical honours by the public recital of a poem he had composed on Niobe; and some verses of his imperial production are supposed to be preserved in the first satire of Persius. Lucan had the hardiness to repeat a poem on Orpheus, in competition with that of Nero; and, what is more remarkable, the judges of the contest were just and bold enough to decide against the emperor. From hence Nero became the persecutor of his successful rival, and forbade him to produce any poetry in public. The well-known conspiracy of Piso against the tyrant soon followed; and, Tacitus, with his usual sarcastic severity, concludes that Lucan engaged in the enterprise from the poetical injuries he had received: \"a remark (says Mr Hayley*, who has endeavoured to refute the imputation) which does little credit to the candour of the historian; who might have found a much nobler, and, I will add, a more probable motive for his conduct in the generous ardour of his character, and his passionate adoration of freedom. In the sequel of his narration, Tacitus alleges a charge against our poet, which, if it were true, must lead us to detest him as the most abject of mankind. The historian affirms, that Lucan, when accused of the conspiracy, for some time denied the charge; but corrupted at last by a promise of impunity, and furious to atone for the tardiness of his confession, accused his mother Attila as his accomplice. This circumstance is so improbable in itself, and so little consonant to the general character of Lucan, that some writers have treated it with contempt, as a calumny invented by Nero, to vilify the object of his envious abhorrence. But the name of Tacitus has given such an air of authority to the story, that it may seem to deserve a more serious discussion, particularly as there are two subsequent events related by the same historian, which have a tendency to invalidate the accusation so injurious to our poet. The events I mean are, the fate of Annius, and the escape of Attila, the two parents of Lucan. The former died in consequence of an accusation brought against him, after the death of his son, by Fabius Romanus, who had been an intimate with Lucan, and forged some letters in his name, with the design of proving his father concerned in the conspiracy. These letters were produced to Nero, who sent them to Annius, from an eager desire, says Tacitus, to get possession of his wealth. From this fact two inferences may be drawn, according to the different lights in which it may be considered:—If the accusation against Annius was just, it is clear that Lucan had not betrayed his father, and he appears the less likely to have endangered by his confession the life of a parent, to whom he owed a still tenderer regard.—If Annius was not involved in the conspiracy, and merely put to death by Nero for the sake of his treasure, we may the more readily believe, that the tyrant who murdered the father from avarice, might calumniate the son from envy. But the escape of Attila affords us the strongest reason to conclude that Lucan was perfectly innocent of the abject and unnatural treachery of which Tacitus has supposed him guilty. Had the poet really named his mother as an accomplice, would the vindictive and sanguinary Nero have spared the life of a woman whose family he detested, particularly when other females were put to death for their share in the conspiracy? That Attila was not in that number, the historian himself informs us in the following remarkable sentence, \"Atilla mater Annai Lucani, fine ablutione, fine supplicio, disfumata;\" thus translated by Gordon: \"The information against Attila, the mother of Lucan, was dissembled; and, without being cleared, she escaped unpunished.\"\n\nThe preceding remarks will, our author hopes, vindicate to every candid mind the honour of Lucan, whose firmness and intrepidity of character are indeed very forcibly displayed in that picture of his death which Tacitus himself has given us. He was condemned to have his veins cut, as his uncle Seneca had before him. Lucan, \"while his blood flowed in streams, perceiving his feet and hands to grow cold and stiffen, and life to retire by little and little from the extremities, while his heart was still beating with vital warmth, and his faculties nowise impaired, recollected some lines of his own, which described a wounded soldier expiring in a manner that resembled this. The lines themselves he rehearsed; and they were the last words he...\"\nLucanus, he ever uttered.\" The critics differ concerning the verses of the Pharsalia which the author quoted in so memorable a manner. The two passages he is supposed to have repeated are the following; of which Lupius contends for the latter.\n\nSanguis erant lachrymae: quaecunque foramina nova\nHumor, ab his largus manat crutor: ora redundant,\nEt patula nares: tudor rubet: omnia plenis\nMembra fluunt venis: totum est pro vulnere corpus.\n\nLib. ix. v. 814.\n\nNow the warm blood at once, from every part\nRan purple poison down, and drain'd the fainting heart.\nBlood falls for tears; and o'er his mournful face\nThe ruddy drops their tainted passage trace.\nWhere'er the liquid juices find a way,\nThere streams of blood, there crimson rivers stray,\nHis mouth and gushing nostrils pour a flood,\nAnd e'en the pores ooze out the trickling blood;\nIn the red deluge all the parts lie drowned,\nAnd the whole body seems one bleeding wound.\n\nScinditur avulfsus; nec ficut vulnere fanguis\nEmicuit lentus; ruptis cadit undique venis,\nDifcurufque animae, diversa in membra meantis,\nInterceptus aquis.\n\nLib. iii. v. 638.\n\nNo single wound the gaping rupture seems,\nWhere trickling crimson wells in flender streams;\nBut, from an op'ning horrible and wide,\nA thousand vessels pour the bursting tide:\n\nAt once the winding channel's course was broke,\nWhere wand'ring like her maze journey took;\nAt once the currents all forgot their way,\nAnd lost their purple in the azure sea.\n\nSuch was the death of Lucan before he had completed his 27th year.—His wife, Polla Argentaria, is said to have transcribed and corrected the three first books of the Pharsalia after his death. It is much to be regretted (Mr Hayley observes) that we possess not the poem which he wrote on the merits of this amiable and accomplished woman; but her name is immortalized by two surviving poets of that age. The veneration which he paid to the memory of her husband is recorded by Martial; and more poetically described in that pleasing and elegant little production of Statius, Genethliacaon Lucani, a poem said to have been written at the request of Argentaria. The author, after invoking the poetical deities to attend the ceremony, touches with great delicacy and spirit on the compositions of Lucan's childhood, which are lost, and the Pharsalia, the production of his early youth; he then pays a short compliment to the beauty and talents of Argentaria; laments the cruel fate which deprived her so immutably of domestic happiness; and concludes with an address to the shade of Lucan, which, with Mr Hayley's translation, we shall subjoin in a Note, as it seems to furnish a strong presumption of Lucan's innocence in regard to one of the accusations mentioned above (A). \"Had he been really guilty of basely endangering\n\n(Where mightier souls new life assume)\nAnd mock the confines of the tomb;\nOr whether in Elysium blest\nYou grace the groves of sacred rest,\nWhere the Pharsalian heroes dwell;\nAnd, as you strike your epic shell,\nThe Pompeys and the Catos throng\nTo catch the animating song;\nOf Tartarus the dread control\nBinds not your high and hallow'd soul:\nDiffant you hear that wailing coast,\nAnd see the guilty Nero's ghost\nGrow pale with anguish and affright,\nHis mother flashing on his sight.\nBe present to your Polla's vows,\nWhile to your honour'd name she bows!\nOne day let your entreaties gain\nFrom those who rule the shadowy train!\nTheir gates have op'd to blest a wife,\nAnd given a husband back to life.\nIn you the tender fair invites\nNo fancied god with frantic rites:\nYou are the object of her prayers,\nYou in her inmost heart she bears:\nAnd stampt on mimic gold, your head\nAdorns the faithful mourner's bed,\nAnd foots her eyes before they close,\nThe guardian of her chaste repose.\nAway with all funereal state!\nFrom hence his nobler life we date:\nLet mourning change the pang severe,\nTo fond devotion's grateful tear!\nAnd fatal grief, its anguish o'er,\nWhat it lamented, now adore!\"\nendangering the life of his mother (says Mr Hayley), it is not probable that his wife would have honoured his memory with such enthusiastic veneration; or that Statius, in verse, designed to do him honour, would have alluded to the mother of Nero. If his character as a man has been injured by the historian (continues Mr Hayley), his poetical reputation has been treated not less injuriously by the critics. Quintilian, by a frivolous distinction, disputes his title to be clasped among the poets; and Scaliger says, with a brutality of language disgraceful only to himself, that he seems rather to bark than to sing. But these insults may appear amply compensated, when we remember, that in the most polished nations of modern Europe, the most elevated and poetical spirits have been his warmest admirers; that in France he was idolized by Corneille, and in England translated by Rowe.—The severest censures on Lucan have proceeded \"from those who have unfairly compared his language to that of Virgil: but how unjust and absurd is such a comparison! it is comparing an uneven block of porphyry, taken rough from the quarry, to the most beautiful superficies of polished marble. How differently should we think of Virgil as a poet, if we possessed only the verses which he wrote at that period of life when Lucan composed his Pharsalia! In the disposition of his subject, in the propriety and elegance of diction, he is undoubtedly far inferior to Virgil; but if we attend to the bold originality of his design, and to the vigour of his sentiments; if we consider the Pharsalia as the rapid and uncorrected sketch of a young poet, executed in an age when the spirit of his countrymen was broken, and their taste in literature corrupted; it may justly be esteemed as one of the most noble and most wonderful productions of the human mind.\"—Lucan wrote several poems; but we have none remaining beside his Pharsalia, of which an excellent English version has been given by Mr Nicholas Rowe.\n\n**Lucanus**, the Stag-Beetle, a genus of insects of the order of coleoptera.

This wood, in which they found protection, was situated between the Tyber and the Via Salaria. The enemies from whom the Romans fled were the Gauls.—On this festival, Plutarch tells us, it was customary to pay the actors, and such as contributed to the public amusement, with the money arising from the felling of wood. This money was called lucar. It is obvious, from what has been observed, that lucar and lucaria are derived from lucus, a grove.\n\n**Lucas Jacobs**, an eminent artist, more generally known by the name of Lucas van Leyden, or Hugens, was born at Leyden in 1494. He received his first instructions in the art of painting from his father Hugues Jacobs; but completed his studies in the school of Cornelius Engelbrecht. He gained much money by his profession; and being of a generous turn of mind, he spent it freely, drested well, and lived in a superior style. It is said, that, a few years before his death, he made a tour into Zealand and Brabant; and during his journey, a painter of Flushing, envious of his great abilities, gave him poison as an entertainment; which, though very slow, was too fatal in its effect, and put an end to his life, after six years languishing under its cruel influence. Others, denying the story of the poison, attribute his death to his incessant industry. The superiority of this artist's genius manifested itself in his infancy: for his works, even from the age of nine, were so excellent as to excite the admiration of all contemporary artists; and when he was about 15, he painted a St Hubert, which gained him great applause. His tone of colouring (Mr Pilkington observes) is good; his attitudes (making a reasonable allowance for the stiff German taste) are well chosen; his figures have a considerable expression in their faces, and his pictures are very highly finished. He endeavoured to proportion the strength of his colouring to the different degrees of distance in which his objects were placed: for in that early time, the true principles of perspective were but little known, and the practice of it was much less observed. In the town hall at Leyden, the most capital picture of Lucas, the subject of which is the Last Judgement, is preserved with great care; the magistrates having refused very large sums which have been offered for it.\n\nThis artist painted not only in oil, but also in tempera and upon glass. Nor was he less eminent for his engraving than for his painting. He carried on a familiar and friendly correspondence with Albert Durer, who was his contemporary; and, it is said, that as regularly as Albert Durer published one print, Lucas published another, without the least jealousy on either side, or wish to depreciate each other's merit. And when Albert came into Holland upon his travels, he was received by Lucas in a most cordial and affectionate manner. His style of engraving, however, according to Mr Strutt, differed considerably from that of Albert Durer, \"and seems evidently to have been founded upon the works of Israel van Mechlen. His prints are very neat and clear, but without any powerful effect. The strokes are as fine and delicate upon the objects in the front, as upon those in the distances; and this want of variety, joined with the feebleness of the males of shadow, give his engravings, with all their neatness, an unfinished appearance, much unlike the firm substantial effect which we find in the works of Albert Durer. He was attentive to the minutiae of his art. Everything is carefully made out in his prints, and no part of them is neglected. He gave great character and expression to the heads of his figures; but on examination of his works, we find the same heads\nLucas heads too often repeated. The hands and feet are rather mannered than correct; and when he attempted to draw the naked figure, he succeded but very indifferently. He affected to make the folds of his draperies long and flowing; but his female figures are frequently so excellently loaded with girdles, bandages, and other ornamental trappings, that much of the elegance of the design is lost. He engraved on wood, as well as on copper; but his works on the former are by no means numerous. They are, however, very spirited; though not equal upon the whole, to those of his friend Albert. The prints of this master are pretty numerous, but very seldom met with complete; especially fine impressions of them. For though they are, generally speaking, executed with the graver only, yet, from the delicacy of the execution, they soon suffered in the printing. Of his engravings the few following may be mentioned as among the principal.\n\n1. Mahomet sleeping, with a priest murdered by his side, and another figure fleeting his sword, a middling-sized upright plate, dated 1508, said to be one of his most early productions.\n\n2. An ecco homo, a large plate, lengthwise, dated 1510.\n\n3. The crucifixion on Mount Calvary, the same.\n\n4. The wife men's offering, the same, dated 1513.\n\n5. Return of the prodigal son, a middling sized plate, lengthwise, dated 1518.\n\n6. A large print lengthwise, called the dance of Magdalen, dated 1519.\n\n7. His own portrait, a small upright plate, dated 1525.\n\n8. David playing before Saul, a middling-sized upright plate, dated—. This is a very fine print; the expression of Saul's countenance, in particular, is admirable.\n\n9. A print known by the name of Ueispiegle, which is the rarest of all the works of this master. It is in the collection of the king of France; and said by Marolles, and other authors, to be unique. But Bafan informs us, that M. Mariette had also an impression of this plate; and it has been since found in one or two other collections. It represents a travelling bagpiper with his family; himself playing as he goes along, and carrying two children in a basket at his back; his wife trudging by his side, supporting with one hand an infant on her shoulder, and with the other leading an ass loaded with two baskets, having two children in each; and another child going before, with a little dog, completes the singular group. This rare print is dated 1520, and is known to have been sold for 16 louis d'ors.—It is nearly 7½ inches high by 4½ broad; and has been twice copied. One of the copies is the reverse way; but the other is the same way with the original; and though not so well executed, might without a comparison be mistaken for it.\n\nLucas, Richard, D.D., a learned English divine, was born in 1648, and studied at Oxford; after which he entered into holy orders, and was for some time master of the free school at Abergavenny. Being esteemed an excellent preacher, he became vicar of St Stephen's, Coleman street, in London, and lecturer of St Olave's in Southwark. He was doctor of divinity; and in 1666 was installed prebendary of Westminster. His sight began to fail him in his youth; and he totally lost it in his middle age. He was greatly esteemed for his piety and learning; and published several works, particularly,\n\n1. Practical Christianity.\n2. An Inquiry after Happiness.\n3. Several sermons.\n4.

He died in 1715.\n\nLucca, a small republic of Italy on the coast of the Mediterranean, between the territory of Genoa on the west, Modena on the north, and Tuscany on the east. According to Keyler, it is only about 30 miles in circumference, but is exceeding fertile and populous. It contains, besides the city of Lucca, 150 villages. The number of inhabitants is computed at 120,000. The government is lodged in a gonfalonier, whose power is much the same with that of the doges of Venice and Genoa. He is assisted by nine counsellors; but the power of all the ten continues only for two months: during which time they live in the state palace, and at the public expense. They are chosen out of the great council, which consists of 240 nobles; but even this council is changed by a new election every two years. The revenues of the republic are about 400,000 scudi or crowns; out of which they maintain 500 men by way of regular force, and 70 Swiss as a guard to their acting magistrates. The city of Lucca is situated in a plain, terminating in most delightful eminences, adorned with villas, summer-houses, corn-fields, and plantations of every kind; so that nothing either for use or for pleasure is here wanting. The city, which is about three Italian miles in circumference, has regular well-lined fortifications; and its streets though irregular, are wide, well paved, and full of handsome houses. The number of its inhabitants is computed to be above 45,000; and they carry on large manufactures, especially of silk stuffs. Lucca has a bishop, who enjoys several extraordinary privileges; and its cathedral is Gothic. The city stands in E. Long. 11° 27'. N.

It holds the third place among the 13; and is the head of the Catholic cantons. Though less than Zurich, and consequently much less than Berne, it is, however, far more extensive than any of the rest, being 15 or 16 leagues long, and eight broad. The population is estimated at 100,000. Even the mountainous part is not barren, but abundant in wood and pasture, furnishing cattle, hides, cheese, and butter, for exportation. All the north part is fertile in grain, fruit, and hay; supplying sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants; but as the mountaineers of the little cantons come to their market for corn, the people of Lucerne purchase this commodity from other parts of Switzerland, but especially from Alsace and Swabia.\nLucerne. Suabia. Their manufactures are very inconsiderable; confining only in a little silk and cotton thread.—The government is oligarchical. The councils are chosen from among 500 citizens only. The great council of 64 members is the nominal sovereign; but in fact the power resides in the senate, or little council of 36, having for their chiefs the two avoyers.—The whole canton professes the Roman Catholic religion. The pope's nuncio, with the title of legate à latere, usually resides at Lucerne.—They threw off the Austrian yoke in 1332, and by entering into a perpetual alliance with the three ancient cantons, they gave such weight to the confederacy, as to enable it in 1386 to resist all the efforts of the enemy at the bloody battle of Sempach.\n\nThe town of Lucerne is situated at the extremity of a most beautiful lake of the same name, where the river Reuss issues from it. The buildings are ancient, and the streets narrow; nor is Lucerne populous in proportion to its extent, the inhabitants being only between 3000 and 4000. Since this is the great passage to Italy by Mount St Gotthard, and the merchandise which passes on mules, and is to be transported by the rivers Reuss, Aar, and Rhine, is all deposited here, it might have a flourishing trade if arts and manufactures were attended to. The Reuss separates the town into two unequal parts, which are connected by three bridges: one wide for carriages; and two narrow covered ones for foot passengers: besides these, there is a fourth over an arm of the lake, to pass to the cathedral. Three of these bridges have old bad paintings of the Dance of Death, and the History of the Bible, and of Switzerland. They make a commodious dry walk for the inhabitants.—Of religious edifices, the principal are the cathedral, or collegiate church of St Leger; the convent of Cordeliers; the college of the Jesuits; the convent of Capuchins, and two convents of nuns. Of the secular buildings, the hotel de ville is the principal. The arsenal is well furnished. The water tower is remarkable only for its position and antiquity; it is said to have been a pharos or lighthouse. What greatly attracts the notice of most strangers is, a plan in relief of part of the cantons of Lucerne, Zug, and Berne, and the whole of Switzerland, Uri, and Unterwald, executed by General Pfister on a large scale. He has completed about 60 square leagues; the plan is 12 feet long, and nine and a half broad: every mountain is accurately measured; and every object distinctly placed.\n\nThe lake of Lucerne exhibits greater variety and more picturesque scenery than any other of the Swiss lakes. It is seven leagues long in a right line, and three wide about Kufnacht; but the shape is very irregular. The whole south side is bordered by high mountains; but the north exhibits hills of no great height. The narrow gulf that extends towards the west, is bordered on the west and north-west by Mount Pilat, which is a single mountain rising boldly more than 6000 feet above the lake; and on the south by Mount Burgenerberg. Stanz Stadi, belonging to the canton of Unterwald, is on this side; and hereabouts the lake is deepest; Kufnacht is on the point of the other gulf, which extends towards the east, and is wider than the former. All the country to the west of these gulfs, and part of it to the north of the latter, belongs to the canton of Lucerne; but that which is to the south and north-east is dependant on the canton of Zug. All the mountains on the left shore of the lake belong to the canton of Unterwald; those on the right, partly to the canton of Uri, partly to that of Switzerland, partly to the little republic of Gerlau, but principally to the canton of Lucerne.\n\nLucerne, in Botany. See Medicago, Botany Index.—For the culture of this plant, see Agriculture Index.\n\nLUCIA, ST, one of the Caribbee islands in the West Indies, about 22 miles long, and 11 broad, the middle of it lying in N. Lat. 39.14. W. Long. 27.0. It was first settled by the French in 1650; but was reduced by the English in 1664, who evacuated it in 1666. The French immediately resettled the island, but were again driven away by the Caribbs. As soon as the savages were gone, the former inhabitants returned, but only for a short time; for being afraid of falling a prey to the first privateer that should visit their coasts, they removed either to other French settlements that were stronger, or which they might expect to be better defended. There was then no regular culture or colony at St Lucia; it was only frequented by the inhabitants of Martinico, who came thither to cut wood, and to build canoes, and who had considerable docks on the island. In 1718 it was again settled by the French; but four years after, it was given by the court of London to the duke of Montague, who was sent to take possession of it. This occasioned some disturbance between the two courts; which was settled, however, by an agreement made in 1731, that, till the respective claims should be finally adjusted, the island should be evacuated by both nations, but that both should wood and water there. This precarious agreement furnished an opportunity for private interest to exert itself. The English no longer molested the French in their habitations; but employed them as their assistants in carrying on with richer colonies a smuggling trade, which the subjects of both governments thought equally advantageous to them. This trade has been more or less considerable till the treaty of 1763, when the property of St Lucia was secured to the crown of France. After that time the colony flourished considerably. In the beginning of the year 1772, the number of white people amounted to 2018 souls, men, women, and children; that of the blacks to 663 free men, and 12,795 slaves. The cattle consisted of 928 mules or horses, 2070 head of horned cattle, and 3184 sheep or goats. There were 38 sugar plantations, which occupied 978 pieces of land; 5,159,589 coffee-trees; 1,321,600 cocoa plants; and 367 plots of cotton. There were 706 dwelling places. The annual revenue at that time was about 175,000l., which, according to the Abbé Raynal, must have increased one-eighth yearly for some time. It was taken by the British in 1778; restored to France in 1783. It fell again into the hands of the British in 1794, was evacuated in 1795, and was again retaken in 1796.\n\nThe soil of St Lucia is tolerably good, even at the sea side; and is much better the farther one advances into the country. The whole of it is capable of cultivation, except some high and craggy mountains which bear\nbear evident marks of old volcanoes. In one deep valley there are still eight or ten ponds, the water of which boils up in a dreadful manner, and retains some of its heat at the distance of 6000 toises from its reservoirs. The air in the inland parts, like that of all other uninhabited countries, is foul and unwholesome; but grows less noxious as the woods are cleared and the ground laid open. On some parts of the sea coast, the air is still more unhealthy, on account of some small rivers which spring from the foot of the mountains, and have not sufficient slope to wash down the sands with which the influx of the ocean stops up their mouths, by which means they spread themselves into unwholesome marshes on the neighbouring grounds.\n\nLUCIA, St., a high and mountainous island of Africa, and one of those of Cape Verde, is about nine leagues long, and lies in the latitude of 16° 18' N. according to the English geographers; but according to all others, it is a degree farther to the northward. On the east-south-east side is a harbour, with a bottom and shore of white sand; but its best road is opposite to St Vincent's to the south-west, where there are at least 20 fathoms of water. On the west side there is no water: it abounds with goats, sea and land fowl, tortoises, &c., but whether it hath any inhabitants is not certainly known.\n\nLUCIAN, a celebrated Greek author in the first century, was born at Samothrace, of obscure parents, in the reign of the emperor Trajan. He studied law, and practised some time as an advocate; but growing weary of the wrangling oratory of the bar, he commenced rhetoric. He lived to the time of Marcus Aurelius, who made him register of Alexandria in Egypt; and, according to Suidas, he was at last worried by dogs. Lucian was one of the finest wits in antiquity. His Dialogues, and other works, are written in Greek. In these he has joined the useful to the agreeable, instruction to satire, and erudition to elegance; and we everywhere meet with that fine and delicate raillery which characterizes the Attic taste. Those who censure him as an impious scoffer at religion, have reason on their side, if religion conflicted in the theology of the Pagan poets, or in the extravagant opinions of philosophers; for he perpetually throws such ridicule on the gods and philosophers, with their vices, as inspires hatred and contempt for them; but it cannot be said that he writes anywhere against an overruling providence.\n\nLUCIANISTS, or Lucanists, a religious sect, so called from Lucianus, or Lucanus, a heretic of the second century, being a disciple of Marcion, whose errors he followed, adding some new ones to them. Epiphanius says he abandoned Marcion; teaching that people ought not to marry, for fear of enriching the Creator: and yet other authors mention that he held this error in common with Marcion and other Gnostics. He denied the immortality of the soul; affirming it to be material.\n\nThere was another sect of Lucianists, who appeared some time after the Arians. They taught, that the Father had been a father always, and that he had the name even before he begot the Son; as having in him the power or faculty of generation; and in this manner they accounted for the eternity of the Son.\n\nLUCID INTERVALS, the fits of lunatics or maniacs, wherein the phrenzy leaves them in possession of their reason.\n\nLUCIFER, according to the poets, was the son of Jupiter and Aurora. In astronomy, Lucifer is the bright planet Venus, which either goes before the sun in the morning, for 290 days, and is our morning star; or in the evening follows the sun, during the same time, and then is called Hesperus or the evening star.\n\nLUCIFERA, in Mythology, a surname given to Diana, under which title she was invoked by the Greeks in childbirth. She was represented as covered with a large veil, interspersed with stars, bearing a crescent on her head, and holding in her hand a lighted flambeau.\n\nLUCIFERIANS, a religious sect, who adhered to the schism of Lucifer, bishop of Cagliari, in the fourth century, who was banished by the emperor Constantius, for having defended the Nicene doctrine concerning the three Persons in the Godhead.—St Augustine seems to intimate, that they believed the soul, which they considered as of a carnal nature, to be transmitted to the children from their fathers. Theodoret says, that Lucifer was the author of a new error. The Luciferians increased mightily in Gaul, Spain, Egypt, &c. The occasion of the schism was, that Lucifer would not allow any acts he had done to be abolished. There were but two Luciferian bishops, but a great number of priests and deacons. The Luciferians bore a peculiar aversion to the Arians.\n\nLUCILIUS, Caius, a Roman knight, and a Latin poet, was born at Suessa in Italy, about 140 B.C. He served under Scipio Africanus in the war with the Numantines; and was in great favour with that celebrated general, and with Laelius. He wrote 32 books of satires, in which he satirized several persons of quality very sharply. Some learned men ascribe the invention of satire to him; but M. Dacier has maintained, with great probability, that Lucilius only gave a better turn to that kind of poetry, and wrote it with more wit and humour than his predecessors Ennius and Pacuvius had done. His fragments have been carefully collected by Francis Douza at Leyden in 1599, with notes. But they require still to be better illustrated by some learned critic.\n\nLUCINA, a goddess among the Romans, who presided over women in labour. Some take her to be Diana, others Juno. She was called Lucina, because she brought children to the light; from the Latin word lux, \"light.\"\n\nLUCIUS, the specific name of the pike. See Esox, Ichthyology Index.\n\nLUCONIA. See Manilia.\n\nLUCRETIA, the famous Roman matron, wife of Collatinus, and the cause of the revolution in Rome from a monarchy to a republic: this lady being ravished by Sextus, the eldest son of Tarquin king of Rome, stabbed herself, 509 B.C. See the article Chastity. The bloody pontiff, with her dead body exposed to the senate, was the signal of Roman liberty; the expulsion of the Tarquins, and abolition of the regal dignity, was instantly resolved on, and carried into execution. See Rome.\n\nLUCRETIUS, or Titus Lucretius, Caius, one\nof the most celebrated of the Latin poets, was born of an ancient and noble Roman family, and studied at Athens, where he became one of Epicurus's feet. He acquired great reputation by his learning and eloquence; but in the flower of his age fell into a frenzy, occasioned by a philtre given him by his wife, who was distractedly fond of him. Lucretius, during the intervals of his madness, put Epicurus's doctrines into verse, and composed his six books De Rerum Natura, which are still extant. It is said that he killed himself in a fit of madness, in the 54th year before the Christian era, when 51 years old. The most correct edition of Lucretius is that of Simon de Coline. The cardinal de Polignac has refuted Lucretius's arguments, in his excellent Latin poem entitled Anti-Lucretius. His poem De Rerum Natura has been translated into English by Mr Creech.\n\nLUCRINUS LACUS, in Ancient Geography, a lake of Campania, between Baiae and Puteoli, famous for its oysters (Horace, Martial, Juvenal); Lucrinenses (Cicero), the people dwelling on it. Now a perfect bay since the earthquake in 1338.\n\nLUCULLUS, Lucius Lucinius, a Roman general celebrated for his eloquence, his victories, and his riches. In his youth he made a figure at the bar; and being afterwards made quaestor in Asia, and praetor in Africa, governed those provinces with great moderation and justice. Scarce was he known as a military man, when he twice beat the fleet of Hamilcar, and gained two great victories over him. His happy genius was greatly improved by study; for he employed his leisure in reading the best authors on military affairs. Being made consul with Aurelius Cotta, during the third war with Mithridates king of Pontus, he was sent against this prince; and this expedition was attended with a series of victories, which did him less honour than an act of generosity towards his colleague; who, willing to take advantage of his absence to signalize himself by some great exploit, hastened to fight Mithridates; but was defeated and shut up in Chalcedonia; where he must have perished, if Lucullus, sacrificing his resentment to the pleasure of saving a Roman citizen, had not flown to his assistance, and disengaged him. All Pontus then submitted to Lucullus; who being continued in his government of Asia, entered the territories of Tigranes, the most powerful king in Asia. That prince marched with a formidable army against Lucullus: who defeated him with a handful of men, and killed great numbers of his forces; took Tigranocertes, the capital of his kingdom; and was ready to put an end to the war, when the intrigues of a tribune got him deposed, and Pompey nominated in his room. Lucullus having brought home prodigious riches, now gave himself up to excessive luxury; and his table was served with a profusion till that time unknown. He brought from the East a great number of books, which he formed into a library, and gave admittance to all men of learning, who frequented it in great numbers. Toward the end of his life, he fell into a kind of madness; and Lucullus, his brother was appointed his guardian. He is said to have been the first who brought cherries into Europe, having brought the grafts from the kingdom of Pontus.\n\nLUCUS, in general, denotes a wood or grove sacred to a deity; so called à lucendo, because a great number of lights were usually burning in honour of the god (Isidorus); a practice common with idolaters, as we learn from Scripture: hence Homer's ἀγέλης ἀνάγκης.\n\nLUD, a British king mentioned in our old chronicles, and said to have reigned about the year of the world 3878. He is reported to have enlarged and walled about Troynovant, or New Troy, where he kept his court, and made it his capital. The name of London is hence derived from Lud's town; and Ludgate from his being buried near it; but this is only one among many other derivations of the name of London; which are at least equally probable. See LONDON.\n\nLUDAMAR, a Moorish kingdom in the interior part of Africa, the capital of which is situated in N. Lat. 15° 0', W. Long. 60° 50', which Mr Park considers as little superior to a desert. The Moors of Ludamar subsist chiefly on the flesh of their cattle.\n\nThe barrenness of the country is such, that it furnishes few materials for manufacture; but the inhabitants contrive to weave a strong cloth, with which their tents are covered; the thread is spun by the women from goats' hair, and with the hides of their cattle they furnish saddles, bridles, pouches, and other articles of leather. They can also convert the native iron procured from the negroes into spears, knives, and pots for boiling their food; but they purchase their fire-arms and other weapons of a similar nature from the Europeans, in exchange for slaves.\n\nTheir ideas of female perfection are truly singular, since a woman, to have the smallest pretensions to beauty, must be one who requires a slave under each arm to support her as she walks; and a perfect beauty, according to Mr Park, is a load for a camel.\n\nThe wealth of the Moors chiefly consists in their numerous herds of cattle, yet the majority of the people spend their days in a state of idleness. The tent of the king is the common place of rendezvous for the indolent, where they appear to enjoy an unlimited liberty of speech; yet in the praise of their sovereign they are wholly unanimous, singing songs to his honour, which never fail to be filled with the grossest adulation. The king sometimes eats out of the same basin with the driver of his camels, and during the heat of the day repose himself upon the same bed.\n\nCalvary constitute the chief military strength of Ludamar, which are well mounted, and are very expert in attacking by surprise. The horde of every folder is furnished by himself, as also his military implements, consisting of a large sabre, a double-barrelled gun, a red leather bag for holding his balls, and a powderhorn flung over his shoulder. He has no pay, and his only compensation arises from plunder.\n\nThey have no intercourse with civilized nations, yet they boast an advantage over the negroes, as they possess, though in a very limited degree, the knowledge of letters. They are esteemed the vainest, proudest, and most bigotted, ferocious, and intolerant of all the nations of the earth, blending in their character the blind superstition of the negro with the savage cruelty and treachery of the Arab. It was with the utmost difficulty that Mr Park made his escape from this cruel and inhospitable people.\n\nLUDI, a term used for shows and public representations.\nLudius, tations made by the Romans, for the entertainment Ludlow, of the people. See Games.\n\nFor an account of the particular games of Greece and Rome, as the Isthmian, Nemean, Olympic, &c. see Isthmian, &c.\n\nLUDIUS, a celebrated painter, lived in the reign of Augustus Caesar, and excelled in grand compositions. He was the first who painted the fronts of houses in the streets of Rome; which he beautified with great variety of landscapes, and many other different subjects.\n\nLUDLOW, EDMUND, son of Sir Henry Ludlow, was born at Maidenhead, and educated in Trinity college, Oxford. His father opposing the king's interest, Mr Ludlow joined with the same party, and was present at the battle of Edgehill as a volunteer under the earl of Essex. Upon the death of his father, he was chosen knight of the shire for Wilts, and obtained the command of a regiment of horse for the defence of that country. He was one of King Charles I.'s judges; after whose death he was sent by the parliament into Ireland, in quality of lieutenant-general of the horse; which employment he discharged with diligence and success till the death of the lord-deputy Ireton, when he acted for some time as general, though without that title; Cromwell, who knew him to be sincerely in the interest of the commonwealth, always finding out some pretext to hinder the conferring of that character upon him. The last stroke had been given by Ludlow to the Irish rebellion, if the usurpation of Cromwell had not prevented it. Under his power he never acted; and though Cromwell used his utmost efforts, he remained inflexible. After Cromwell's death, he endeavoured to restore the commonwealth; but Charles II. being recalled, he thought proper to conceal himself, and escaped into Switzerland, where he settled. After the revolution, he came over into England, in order to be employed in Ireland against King James; but appearing publicly in London, it gave great offence; and an address was presented by Sir Edward Seymour to King William III., for a proclamation in order to apprehend Colonel Ludlow, attainted for the murder of King Charles I. Upon this he returned to Switzerland, where he died. During his retirement in Switzerland he wrote his Memoirs.\n\nLUDLOW, a town of Shropshire in England, situated at the conflux of the Teme and Corve, 18 miles from Shrewsbury, and 138 from London. The president of the council of the marches, established by Henry VIII., generally kept his courts in it, by which the town was much benefited, these courts not having been abolished till the 1st of William and Mary. Its neighborhood to Wales makes it a great thoroughfare, and engages many of the Welsh to send their children of both sexes to it for education. It was incorporated by Edward IV. and among other privileges has that of trying and executing criminals within itself. It is one of the neatest towns in England, with walls and seven gates. It is divided into four wards; and is governed by 2 bailiffs, 12 aldermen, 25 common-councilmen, a recorder, a town-clerk, steward, chamberlain, coroner, &c. From the castle on the top of the hill on which the town stands is a most delightful prospect. In an apartment of the outer gatehouse Samuel Butler is said to have written the first part of Ludolph Hudibras. Of this castle, which was besieged and taken by King Stephen, some of the offices are fallen down, and great part of it turned into a bowling green; but part of the royal apartments and the sword of state are still left. The walls were at first a mile in compass, and there was a lawn before it for near two miles, of which much is now enclosed. The battlements are very high and thick, and adorned with towers. It has a neat chapel, where are the coats of arms of abundance of Welsh gentry, and over the stable-doors are the arms of Queen Elizabeth, the earls of Pembroke, &c. This castle was a palace of the prince of Wales, in right of his principality. The river Teme has a good bridge over it, several weirs across it, and turns a great many mills. Here is a large parochial church, which was formerly collegiate; in the choir whereof is an inscription relating to Prince Arthur, elder brother to King Henry VIII., who died here, and whose bowels were here deposited, though it is said his heart was taken up some time ago in a leaden box. In this choir is a closet, commonly called God's House, where the priests used to keep their consecrated utensils; and in the market-place is a conduit, with a long stone cross on it, and a niche wherein is the image of St Laurence, to whom the church was dedicated. On the north side of the town there was a rich priory, whereof there are few ruins to be seen except those of its church. Here are an almshouse for 30 poor people, and two charity-schools where 50 boys and 30 girls are both taught and clothed. It has a market on Monday, and three lesser ones on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. Its fairs are on the Tuesday Easter, Whit-Wednesday, August 21. Sept. 28. and Dec. 8. Provisions are very cheap here; and at the annual horse races there is the best of company. The country round is exceedingly pleasant, fruitful, and populous, especially that part called the Corveydale, being the vale on the banks of the river Corve. Ludlow sends two members to parliament.\n\nLUDOLPH, JOB, a very learned writer of the 17th century, was born at Erfurt in Thuringia. He travelled much, and was master of 25 languages, visited libraries, searched after natural curiosities and antiquities everywhere, and conversed with learned men of all nations. He published a History of Ethiopia, and other curious books.\n\nLUDOLPH, HENRY WILLIAM, nephew of Job above mentioned, was born at Erfurt in 1655. He came over to England as secretary to M. Lenthe, envoy from the court of Copenhagen to that of London; and being recommended to Prince George of Denmark, was received as his secretary. He enjoyed this office for some years, until he was incapacitated by a violent disorder; when he was discharged with a handsome pension; after he recovered, he travelled into Muscovy, where he was well received by the czar, and where his knowledge made the Muscovite priests suppose him to be a conjurer. On his return to London in 1694, he was cut for the stone; and as soon as his health would permit, in acknowledgement of the civilities he had received in Muscovy, he wrote a grammar of their language, that the natives might learn their own tongue in a regular method. He then travelled into the East, to inform himself of the state of the Christian church.\nLUGDUNUM in Ancient Geography, the capital of the Segusiavi in Gallia Celtica, situated at the confluence of the Arar and Rhodanus, on an eminence, as the Celtic term *dune* signifies; built by Manutius Plancus under Augustus, while commanding in that part of Gaul; and whither he led a colony. Now Lyons, capital of the Lyonnais.\n\nLUGDUNUM Batavorum, in Ancient Geography, a town of the Batavi in Gallia Belgica. Now Leyden in Holland.\n\nLUGDUNUM Converarum, in Ancient Geography, a town of Gaul in Aquitain, at the foot of the Pyrenees. Now S. Bertrand, in Gascony.\n\nLUGEUS LACUS, in Ancient Geography, a lake of Japydia, the westmost district of Illyricum, to the south of the Save, and near the head of the Arlha. Now commonly called the Zirichnits Lake, from a small adjoining town. It is locked on every side with mountains; from which scanty currents run down; the lefs in quantity their waters, because drank up by the earth; till at length they are swallowed up in rocky furrows, so formed as to resemble artificial. In these the water being so redundant as to refuse receiving any Luggerhall more, they regurgitate, and return the water with extraordinary celerity, which thus spreading itself, forms a lake, in most places 18 cubits deep. These waters afterwards retire with no less celerity than they came on, not only through the furrows, but pass through the whole of the bottom, as through a sieve; which when perceived by the inhabitants, they directly stop up the larger apertures, and thus take large quantities of fish: when the lake is dry, they cut down their harvest on the spot where they sowed, and sow again before the inundation comes on: and grafs floats so quick on it, that it may be cut down in three weeks time, (Lazius, Wernherus).\n\nLUGGERSHALL, a borough of Wiltshire, 12 miles north of Salisbury, and 75 north by west of London. It is an ancient borough by prescription, though but a small hamlet, near the forest of Clute, in a delightful country; and was the residence of several kings. It had formerly a castle. It is governed by a bailiff chosen yearly at the lord of the manor's court-leet. On the neighbouring downs there used to be horse-races.\n\nLUKE, St, the evangelist, and the disciple of the apostles, was originally of Antioch in Syria, and by profession a physician. He particularly attached himself to St Paul, and was his faithful companion in his travels and labours. He went with him to Troas in Macedonia about the year 51. He wrote his gospel in Achaea about the year 53; and ten years after, the acts of the Apostles, which contains a history of 30 years. Of all the inspired writers of the New Testament, his works are written in the most elegant Greek. It is believed that St Luke died at Rome, or in Achaea.\n\nGospel of St Luke, a canonical book of the New Testament. Some think that it was properly St Paul's Gospel; and that, when the apostle speaks of his Gospel, he means what is called St Luke's. Ireneus says, that St Luke digested into writing what St Paul preached to the Gentiles; and Gregory Nazianzen tells us, that St Luke wrote with the assistance of St Paul.\n\nSt Luke's the Evangelist's Day, a festival in the Christian church, observed on the 18th of October.\n\nLULA, a town of Swedish Lapland; seated at the mouth of the river Lula, on the west side of the gulf of Bothnia, 42 miles south-west of Tornia. E. Long. 21° 0' N. Lat. 64° 30'.\n\nLULA Lapmark, a province of Swedish Lapland; bounded by that of Tornia on the north, by the Bothnic gulf on the east, by Pithia Lapmark on the south, and Norway on the west.\n\nULLI, JOHN BAPTIST, the most celebrated and most excellent musician that has appeared in France since the revival of learning, was born at Florence. He was taken to France when very young by a person of quality; and he carried the art of playing on the viol in to the highest perfection. Louis XIV. made him superintendent of music. Some time after Perinna having introduced operas into France, and quarrelling with his company, he resigned his privilege to Lulli. Operas were then carried to the utmost perfection by this celebrated musician, and were attended with continual\nLULLY, Raymond, a writer on alchemy, surnamed the Enlightened Doctor, was born in the island of Majorca in 1225. He applied himself with indefatigable labour to the study of the Arabian philosophy, to chemistry, physic, and divinity; and acquired great reputation by his works. He at length went to preach the gospel in Africa; and was stoned to death in Mauritania, at the age of 80. He is honoured as a martyr at Majorca, whither his body was carried. He wrote many treatises on all the sciences, in which he shows much study and subtlety, but little judgement or solidity. A complete edition of his works has been printed at Mentz.—He ought not to be confounded with Raymond Lully of Terraca, surnamed Neophytus, who from being a Jew turned Dominican friar. This last Lully maintained several opinions that were condemned by Pope Gregory XI.\n\nLUMBAGO, a fixed pain in the small of the back. See Medicine Index.\n\nLUMBARIS, a name given to the arteries and veins which spread over the loins.\n\nLUMBICAL, a name given to four muscles of the fingers and to as many of the toes.\n\nLUMBRICUS, the Worm, a genus of animals belonging to the order of vermes intestinae. See Helminthology Index.\n\nLUMELLO, a village in Italy, which gives name to the Lumellini, a small district in the duchy of Milan, lying along the river Po, and of which Mortaria and Valenca are the principal places. It was ceded to the duke of Savoy in 1707, and confirmed by the treaty of Utrecht in 1713. E. Long. 8° 42'. N. Lat. 45° 5'.\n\nLUMINOUS, an epithet applied to any thing that shines or emits light.\n\nLuminous Emanations have been observed from human bodies, as also from those of brutes. The light arising from currying a horse, or from rubbing a cat's back, are known to most. Influences of a like kind have been known on combing a woman's head. Bartholin gives us an account, which he entitles mulier splendens, of a lady in Italy whose body would shine whenever slightly touched with a piece of linen. These effluvia of animal bodies have many properties in common with those produced from glass; such as their being lucid, their snapping, and their not being excited without some degree of friction; and are undoubtedly electrical, as a cat's back has been found strongly electrical when stroked.

Now Clugny in Burgundy.\n\nLuna, a town and port of Liguria, at the mouth of the Macra. The town was but small, but the port large and beautiful, according to Strabo. Now extinct, and its ruins called Luna Difluita. It was famous for its quarries of white marble, thence called Lunense; and for its cheese, remarkable rather for its size than goodness, each being a thousand weight.\n\nLuna, in Astronomy, the moon.

Commonly called el Cabo de Palafuget, in Catalonia, on the Mediterranean; or Cabo de Toja, on the same coast, and in Catalonia, 15 miles from the former, to the west.\n\nLunatic, a person affected with that species of madness termed lunacy. The word is indeed properly applied to one that hath lucid intervals; sometimes enjoying his senses, and sometimes not; and that frequently supposed to depend on the influence of the moon.\n\nLunatic, in Law. Under the general term of non compos mentis (which Sir Edward Coke says is the most legal name), are comprised not only lunatics, but persons under frenzies, or who lose their intellects by disease; those that grow deaf, dumb, and blind, not being born so; or such, in short, as are judged by the court of chancery incapable of conducting their own affairs. To these also, as well as idiots, the king is guardian, but to a very different purpose. For the law always imagines, that these accidental misfortunes may be removed; and therefore only constitutes the crown a trustee for the unfortunate persons, to protect their property, and to account to them for all profits received, if they recover, or after their decease to their representatives.\nLunatic tatives. And therefore it is declared by the statute 17 Edw. II. c. 10, that the king shall provide for the custody and furlentation of lunatics, and preserve their lands, and the profits of them, for their use when they come to their right mind; and the king shall take nothing to his own use: and if the parties die in such estate, the residue shall be distributed for their souls by the advice of the ordinary, and of course (by the subsequent amendments of the law of administrations) shall now go to their executors or administrators.\n\nOn the first attack of lunacy, or other occasional insanity, when there may be hopes of a speedy restitution of reason, it is usual to confine the unhappy objects in private custody, under the direction of their nearest friends and relations; and the legislature, to prevent all abuses incident to such private custody, hath thought proper to interpose its authority, by 14 Geo. III. c. 49, for regulating private mad-houses. But when the disorder is grown permanent, and the circumstances of the party will bear such additional expense, it is thought proper to apply to the royal authority to warrant a lasting confinement.\n\nThe method of proving a person non compos is very similar to that of proving him an idiot. The lord chancellor, to whom, by special authority from the king, the custody of idiots and lunatics is intrusted, upon petition or information, grants a commission in nature of the writ de idiota inquirendo, to inquire into the party's state of mind; and if he be found non compos, he usually commits the care of his person, with a suitable allowance for his maintenance, to some friend, who is then called his committee. However, to prevent sinister practices, the next heir is seldom permitted to be of this committee of the person; because it is his interest that the party should die. But it hath been said there lies not the same objection against his next of kin, provided he be not his heir; for it is his interest to preserve the lunatic's life, in order to increase the personal estate by savings, which he or his family may hereafter be entitled to enjoy. The heir is generally made the manager or committee of the estate, it being clearly his interest by good management to keep it in condition: accountable, however, to the court of chancery, and to the non compos himself, if he recovers; or otherwise, to his administrators. See IDIOTY.\n\nLUNATION, the period or space of time between one new moon and another; also called synodical month. See CYCLE and EPACT.\n\nLUNDEN, or LUND, a considerable town of Sweden, in Gothland; and capital of the territory of Schonen, with an archbishop's see and an university. It was ceded to the Swedes by the Danes in 1658. E. Long. 13° 25'. N. Lat. 55° 40'.\n\nLUNDY ISLAND, situated 50 miles in the sea, off the north-west coast of Devonshire, is five miles long and two broad, but so encompassed with inaccessible rocks, that it has but one entrance to it, so narrow that two men can scarcely go abreast. It is reckoned in the hundred of Brandon. It had once both a fort and a chapel. The south part of it is indifferent good soil, but the north part of it is barren, and has a high pyramidal rock called the Constable. Here are horses, kine, hogs, and goats, with great store of sheep and rabbits; but the chief commodity is fowl, with which it abounds much, their eggs being very thick on the ground at their season of breeding. No venomous creature will live in this island. In the reign of Henry VIII., one William Morifco, who had conspired to murder him at Woodstock, fled to this island, which he fortified, turned pirate, and did much damage to this coast; but was taken by surprise at length, with 16 of his accomplices, and put to death.\n\nLUNE, LUNULA, in Geometry, a plane in form of a crescent or half-moon, terminated by the circumference of two circles, that intersect each other within.\n\nLUNENBURG, or Lunenburg Zell, a principality of Germany, bounded to the south by that of Calenberg, the diocese of Hildesheim, and the duchy of Brunswic; to the north, by the duchy of Lunenburg and the Elbe, by the last of which it is separated from the territory of the imperial city of Hamburg; to the east, by the duchy of Brunswic, the Alte Mark, and the duchy of Mecklenburg; and to the west, by the duchies of Bremen and Verden, the county of Hoya, and the principality of Calenberg. The soil, except along the Elbe, Aller, and Jetz, is either sand, heath, or moor. In the more fruitful parts of it are produced wheat, rye, barley, oats, peas, buck-wheat, flax, hemp, hops, pulse, oak, beech, firs, pines, birch, and alder, together with black cattle and horses. The heaths abound with bees and honey, and a small kind of sheep whose wool is long and coarse. Lunenburg is well furnished with salt springs and limestone, and the forest of Gorde with venison. The rivers Elbe, Ilmenau and Aller, are navigable; and consequently very advantageous to the country, independent of the fish which they yield. The general diets of this principality are convened by the sovereign twice a-year, and held at Zell. They consist of the deputies of the nobility and the towns of Lunenburg, Uelzen, and Zell, who have the nomination of the members of the high colleges, and other officers, jointly with the sovereign. There are near 200 Lutheran churches in the country, under two general and 15 subordinate superintendents, several grammar-schools, two Calvinist churches at Zell, and an academy of exercises at Lunenburg. The manufactures are chiefly linen cloth, cottons, ribbons, flockings, hats, starch, bleached wax, refined sugar, gold and silver wires, all kinds of wooden wares, barges, boats, and ships. The exports of these to Hamburg, Lubec, and Altona, are considerable. The neighbourhood of these cities, with the facility of conveying goods and merchandise to them and other places, either by land or water, is very advantageous to this country, and contributes greatly to its subsistence. On account of this principality, the king of Great Britain has a seat and voice both in the college of the princes of the empire and of the circle of Lower Saxony. Its quota in the matricula is 23 horse and 123 foot, or 720 florins in lieu of them. The revenues of the principality arise chiefly from the demesnes, tolls on the Elbe, contributions, duties on cattle, beer, wine, brandy, and other commodities, which all together must be very considerable, some bailiwicks alone yielding upwards of 20,000 rix-dollars.\n\nLunenburg, the capital of the principality of the same name, is a pretty large town of Germany, on the river Elmen, or the Ilmenau, which is navigable from the town to the Elbe, at the distance of 13 miles. It is 27 miles from Hamburg, 43 from Zell, 65 from Brunswic,\nLunenburg, Brunswick, 76 from Bremen, 68 from Hanover; and Lunense stands in E. Long. 10° 40', N. Lat. 53° 28'. Its inhabitants are reckoned at between 8000 and 9000.\n\nFormerly this town was one of the Hanse, and an imperial city. Some derive its name from Lina, the ancient name of the Ilmenau; others from Luna, the moon, an image of which is said to have been worshipped by the inhabitants in the times of Paganism. Here were anciently several convents, viz. one of Minims, another of Premonstratensians, another of Benedictines, and a fourth of Minorites. Out of the revenues of the Benedictine monastery was founded an academy for the martial exercises, where young gentlemen of the principality of Lunenburg are maintained gratis, and taught French, fencing, riding, and dancing; but foreigners are educated at a certain fixed price. A Latin school was also founded, consisting of four classes, and well endowed out of their revenues. The superintendence and management of these, and the estates appropriated to their maintenance, belongs to the landchaft director, and the aufreiter, who are both chosen from among the Lunenburg nobility. The first came in place of the Popish abbot, and as such is head of the states of the principality, and president of the provincial college. He has the title of excellency; and in public instruments styles himself, by the grace of God landchaft director, and lord of the manor of St Michael in Lunenburg. The chief public edifices are three parish-churches, the ducal palace, three hospitals, the town-house, the salt-magazine, the anatomical theatre, the academy; the conventual church of St Michael, in which lie interred the ancient dukes, and in which is the famous table eight feet long, and four wide, plated over with chased gold, with a rim embellished with precious stones, of an immense value, which was taken from the Saracens by the emperor Otho, and presented to this church: but in 1668, a gang of thieves stripped it of 200 rubies and emeralds, together with a large diamond, and most of the gold, so that at present but a small part of it remains. Here are some very rich salt springs. Formerly, when there was a greater demand for the salt, upwards of 120,000 tons have been annually boiled here, and sold off; but since the commencement of the present century, the salt trade hath declined greatly. A fifth of the salt made here belongs to the king, but is farmed out. It is said to excel all the other salt made in Germany. This town is well fortified; and has a garrison, which is lodged in barracks. In the neighbourhood is a good limestone quarry; and along the Ilmenau are warehouses, in which are lodged goods brought from all parts of Germany, to be forwarded by the Ilmenau to Hamburg, or by the Elbe to Lubeck, from whence other goods are brought back the same way. The town itself carries on a considerable traffic in wax, honey, wool, flax, linen, salt, lime, and beer.\n\nLUNENSE MARJOR, in the natural history of the ancients, the name of that species of white marble now known among us by the name of the Carrara marble, and distinguished from the statuary kind by its greater hardness and less splendour. It was ever greatly esteemed in building and ornamental works, and is still used. It is of a very close and fine texture, of a very pure white, and much more transparent than any other of the white marbles. It has always been found in great quantities in Italy, and is so to this day. See LUNA.\n\nLUNETTE, in Fortification, an enveloped counterguard, or elevation of earth, made beyond the second ditch, opposite to the places of arms; differing from the ravelins only in their situation. Lunettes are usually made in ditches full of water, and serve to the same purpose as fautebrayes, to dispute the passage of the ditch. See Fortification.\n\nLUNETTE, in the manege, is a half horse-shoe, or such a shoe as wants the sponge, i.e. that part of the branch which runs towards the quarters of the foot.\n\nLUNETTE is also the name of two small pieces of felt, made round and hollow, to clap upon the eyes of a vicious horse that is apt to bite, and strike with his fore feet, or that will not suffer his rider to mount him.\n\nLUNGS, in Anatomy, a part of the human body, serving for respiration. See ANATOMY, No. 117.\n\nIn the Journal de Médecine for June 1789 is a description of an Instrument for Inflating the Lungs, invented by M. Gorcy, physician to the military hospital at Neufbrissack, which appears to be extremely well adapted to the purpose; whilst it may be used with the greatest ease and facility.\n\nThis instrument, which the inventor styles apodopic, that is, \"reforer of respiration,\" consists of a double pair of bellows, BCLM, fig. 1, the two different parts CCXCVIII, of which have no communication with each other. In the lower side BM, is an aperture A for a valve constructed on the principles of those of Mr Naime's air-pump. It consists of a rim of copper, closed at one end by a plate of the same metal, in which plate are seven small holes placed at equal distances. This plate is covered with pieces of silk coated with elastic gum, in which are fixed transverse incisions of two or three lines in length. Each incision is so made as to be situated between two of the holes, and at an equal distance from each: see D, fig. 2. The silk must be made very secure, by a thread passing several times round the rim. It is obvious, that a stream of air applied to that side of the plate which is opposite the silk, will pass through the holes, and, lifting up the silk, escape through the incisions. On the contrary, a stream of air applied to the other side will press the silk upon the plate, and thus close the holes, so that it will be impossible for it to pass through them. This valve opens internally, so as to admit the air from without. At B is another valve, on the same construction, but opening in a contrary direction, thus permitting the air to escape out of the lower part into the tube EF, but preventing its entrance. At C is another valve, opening internally to admit the air from the tube EF; and at D there is a fourth, opening externally to discharge the air from the upper part.\n\nThe flexible tube EF, screwed on at the end CB, being introduced into one of the nostrils, whilst the mouth and the other nostril are closed by an assistant, if we separate the two handles LM, which were close together at the introduction of the tube, it is evident, that the air in the lungs will rush into the upper part through the valve C, whilst the external air will fill the lower part through the valve A: the two handles being\nbeing again brought into contact, the atmospheric air will be forced into the lungs through the valve B, and at the same time the air in the upper part will be discharged at the valve D. Thus by the alternate play of the double bellows, the lungs will be alternately filled and emptied as in respiration. In using the instrument care should be taken not to be too violent; as the more perfectly the natural motion of respiration is imitated, the better.\n\nTo prevent any substances from without injuring the valves AD, fig. 1, the rim is made with a screw, B, fig. 3, in order to receive a cap AA, fig. 3, full of small holes. This screw has also another use. If air or oxygen gas be preferred, a bladder filled with it, fig. 4, may, by means of the screw A, be fastened to the valve A, fig. 1; and, to prevent waste, as this air may serve several times, a flexible tube may be screwed on the valve D, fig. 1, communicating with the bladder by means of the opening d, fig. 4; thus it may be employed as often as the operator thinks proper.\n\nThere is a handle K to the partition in the middle, in order that, if it be at any time necessary to use either of the divisions alone, the other may be confined from acting. c, b, fig. 5, represent the two valves to be applied at the end of the instrument C, B, fig. 1.; and fig. 6, is a section of the end CB, showing the valves in their proper places.\n\nIt is proper to add, that the capacity of the instrument should be proportioned to the quantity of air received into the lungs in inspiration, which Dr Goodwyn has ascertained to be twelve cubical inches or somewhat more. Each division of the instrument, therefore, should be capable of containing that quantity.\n\n**LUNGE-WORT.** See **PULMONARIA**, Botany Index.\n\n**LUNISOLAR YEAR,** in Chronology, the space of 532 common years; found by multiplying the cycle of the sun by that of the moon.\n\n**LUNULA.** See **LUNE.**\n\n**LUPERCALIA,** feasts instituted in ancient Rome, in honour of the god Pan. The word comes from Lupercal, the name of a place under the Palatine mountain, where the sacrifices were performed.\n\nThe Lupercalia were celebrated on the 15th of the kalends of March, that is, on the 15th of February, or, as Ovid observes, on the third day after the ides. They are supposed to have been established by Evander.\n\nOn the morning of this feast, the Luperci, or priests of Pan, ran naked through the streets of Rome, striking the married women they met on the hands and belly with a thong or strap of goats leather, which was held an omen promising them fecundity and happy deliveries. See **LUPERCI.**\n\nThis feast was abolished in the time of Augustus; but afterwards restored, and continued to the time of the emperor Anastasius.—Euroni says it was abolished by the pope in 496.\n\n**LUPERCI,** a name given to the priests of the god Pan. See **LUPERCALIA.**\n\nThe Luperci were the most ancient order of priests in Rome; they were divided into two colleges or companies, the one called Fabii and the other Quinctilii. To these Caesar added a third, which he called Iulii.\n\n**LUPINUS, LUPINE,** a genus of plants belonging to the diadelphia clas; and in the natural method rank-\n\ning under the 3rd order, Papilionaceae.

See Astronomy Index.\n\n**LURCHER,** a kind of hunting-dog, much like a mongrel greyhound with pricked ears, a flagged coat, and generally of a yellowish white colour: they are very swift runners, so that if they get between the burrows and the conies they seldom miss; and this is their common practice in hunting: yet they use other subtleties, as the tumbler does, some of them bringing in their game, and those are the best. It is also observable, that a lurcher will run down a hare at stretch.\n\n**LURE,** in falconry, a device of leather, in the shape of two wings, stuck with feathers, and baited with a piece of flesh, to call back a hawk when at considerable distance.\n\n**LURGAN,** a town in the county of Armagh and province of Ulster in Ireland, 67 miles from Dublin. It is a flourishing town, agreeably situated in the midst of a much improved country; and the inhabitants are extensively engaged in the linen manufacture. It stands on a gentle eminence, about two miles from Lough-Neagh, of which it commands a most beautiful and extensive prospect. N. Lat. 54° 35'. W.

See Botany, Natural Orders.\n\n**LUSATIA,** a marquisate of Germany, in Upper Saxony; bounded to the east by Silesia, to the west by Misnia, to the south by Bohemia, and to the north by the marquisate of Brandenburgh. Till towards the middle of the 13th century, the Upper Lusatia was called the Mark, i.e., the marquisate or the land of Budissin and Gorlitz; and the Lower only Lusatia, which it is said, in the Slavonic, signifies \"a woody or marshy country.\" The air of the Upper Lusatia, which is hilly or mountainous, is better than that of the Lower, a great part of which is moorish and boggy. Both abound in wood, especially the Lower, and turf for fuel. The healthy and mountainous tracts are generally barren; but the lower champaign and marsh lands are tolerably fertile, producing pasture, wheat, rye, oats, barley, buck-wheat, peas, lentils, beans, and millet; together with flax, hops, tobacco, some white and red wine, and what is called manna. Of several of these articles, however, considerable quantities are imported. In this country are found also quarries of stone, medicinal springs, bastard diamonds, agates, and jaspers, earths and clays for tobacco-pipes and all sorts of earthen ware, alum, good iron stone, vitriolic and copper water; nor is it deficient of cattle, fish, and venison. The rivers Spree, the Schwarze or Black Elster, and the Pulznitz, have their\nLusatia, their sources in the Lusatias, which are also watered by the Neisse and Queis. The ancient inhabitants of this country were the Saxons, who were succeeded by the Vandals, and these by the Sober-Wends, a Slavonian people. The present inhabitants, the descendants of the Wends, have an odd dress; and the language is so inarticulate and guttural, that it hath been said, it might be pronounced without lips, teeth, or tongues; but the towns are almost wholly peopled by Germans.\n\nIn the Upper Lusatia are six towns which appear at the land-diets, 16 smaller country towns, and four market towns. In the Lower are four diet towns, 13 country towns, and two market ones. Both marquises were formerly subject either to the kings of Bohemia, the archdukes of Austria, or electors of Brandenburg; but, in 1636, both were absolutely ceded to the elector of Saxony, in lieu of the 72 tons of gold which he expended in afflicting the emperor Ferdinand II. against the Bohemians.\n\nChristianity was first planted in Lusatia in the seventh century; but it was several centuries after that before Popery was fully established. In the 11th century many cloisters were erected in the country; but at the Reformation such numbers embraced Lutheranism, that it became the predominant religion, and still continues, though there are still several Roman Catholic foundations, churches, market-towns, and villages. The enthusiastic sect of Hembutters possesses a great influence and esteem here. There are considerable manufactures of woollen and linen stuffs in the Lusatias, especially the Upper. At Budissen, and in the adjacent country, prodigious quantities of stockings, spatterdashes, caps, and gloves are made. The linen manufactures also flourish here, chiefly in the Upper Lusatia, where all sorts of linen are made, printed, and dyed. Exclusive of these, there are considerable manufactures of hats, leather, paper, gunpowder, iron, glaigs, bleached wax, &c. Though the demand and exportation of these commodities, particularly linens and woollens, is not so great as formerly, yet it is still considerable, and more than overbalances their importations in wool, yarn, silk, wines, spices, corn, fresh and baked fruits, garden stuff, and hops. Disputes of many years standing have subsisted between the country artificers and linen manufacturers on the one side, and the diet towns on the other; the latter unjustly seeking to exclude the former from any share in the linen trade. The natives of this country are said to have quick natural parts, but to be fondly pellucidous. We are told they observe the Saxon laws much better than they did the Bohemian. Learning hath been much esteemed and encouraged in both marquises since the Reformation. The schools in the six diet towns of Upper Lusatia, particularly at Gorlitz, Budissen, and Zittau, greatly distinguish themselves, having handsome stipends. In Lower Lusatia also are some good schools, with stipends for the maintenance of students. Printing is said to be much followed, and brought to great perfection in this country.\n\nIn Upper Lusatia, the states consult, 1st, of those called state-lords; 2dly, of the prelates; 3dly, of the gentry and commonalty, under which are comprehended the counts, barons, nobles, and burgesses, possessors of fees and fief-estates; and, 4thly, of the representatives of the six principal towns. Without the Lusatia consent of these states no taxes can be imposed, nor anything of importance, that regards the public, tranacted. The diets are ordinary or extraordinary. The ordinary meet once in three years, and the extraordinary when summoned by the sovereign upon particular emergencies. As to ecclesiastical matters, the dean of Budissen and his consistory exercise all manner of episcopal jurisdiction; and among the Protestants, the jurisdiction belongs either to the superior, the upper-office, or the patrons. The revenues arising to the superior or sovereign, from Upper Lusatia, consist partly of the subsidies granted by the states, among which, at present, are reckoned capitation and estate-money; and partly of the beer-tax, excise, tolls, &c.—Upper Lusatia is divided into two great circles, viz. those of Budissen and Gorlitz, which are again divided into lesser circles.\n\nThe land states of Lower Lusatia consist, like those of the Upper, of prelates, lords, and knights, and the representatives of the state towns, which are Luckau, Gubben-Lubben, and Kalau. Two land diets are yearly held at Lubben, called voluntary-diets; but when the superior causes the states to be summoned together at his discretion, and propositions to be laid before them, by commissaries deputed for that purpose, such convention is called a great land diet. The marquise is divided into five circles, each of which holds a circle assembly in its circle town. The chief officers appointed either by the superior or the states are, the president of the upper office, the land captain, and the land judge. The principal tribunals are, the land court, and the upper office, to which lie appeals from the inferior judicatories. There are also officers for the several circles. Spiritual matters belong here to a consistory, created in 1668. The ordinary taxes are paid into the chest of the circle; and from thence consigned to the general chest, of which the upper tax-receiver is superintendent. By him an annual account of the receipts is made out, which is examined and passed by the deputies of the states.\n\nLUSITANIA, in Ancient Geography, one of the divisions of Spain, extending to the north of the Tagus, quite to the sea of Cantabria, at least to the Promontorium Celticum. But Augustus, by a new regulation, made the Anas its boundary to the south, the Durius to the north; and thus constituting only a part of the modern Portugal. Lusitani the people, (Diodorus, Stephanus).\n\nLUSTRAL, an epithet given by the ancients to the water used in their ceremonies to sprinkle and purify the people. From them the Romans have borrowed the holy water used in their churches.\n\nLustral Day (Dies Lustrius), that whereon the lustrations were performed for a child, and its name given; which was usually the ninth day from the birth of a boy, and the eighth from that of girl. Though others performed the ceremony on the last day of that week wherein the child was born, and others on the fifth day from its birth.\n\nOver this feast-day the goddess Nundina was supposed to preside; the midwives, nurses, and domestics handed the child backwards and forwards, around a fire burning on the altars of the gods, after which they sprinkled it with water; hence this feast had the name\nLustration of amphidromia. The old women mixed saliva and dust with the water. The whole ended with a sumptuous entertainment. The parents received gifts from their friends on this occasion. If the child was a male, their door was decked with an olive garland; if a female, with wool, denoting the work about which women were to be employed.\n\nLUSTRATION, in Antiquity, sacrifices or ceremonies by which the ancients purified their cities, fields, armies, or people, defiled by any crime or impurity. Some of these lustrations were public, others private. There were three species or manners of performing lustration, viz. by fire and sulphur, by water, and by air; which last was done by fanning and agitating the air round the thing to be purified. Some of these lustrations were necessary, i.e. could not be dispensed with; as lustrations of houses in time of a plague, or upon the death of any person; others again were done out of choice, and at pleasure. The public lustrations at Rome were celebrated every fifth year; in which they led a victim thrice round the place to be purified, and in the mean time burnt a great quantity of perfumes. Their country lustrations, which they called ambarvalia, were celebrated before they began to reap their corn: in those of the armies, which they called armilifexia, some chosen soldiers, crowned with laurel, led the victims, which were a cow, a sheep, and a bull, thrice round the army ranged in battle-array in the field of Mars, to which deity the victims were afterwards sacrificed, after pouring out many imprecations upon the enemies of the Romans. The lustrations of their flocks were performed in this manner: the shepherd sprinkled them with pure water, and thrice surrounded his flockfold with a composition of savin, laurel, and brimstone set on fire; and afterwards sacrificed to the goddess Pales an offering of milk boiled, wine, a cake, and millet. As for private houses, they were lustrated with water, a fumigation of laurel, juniper, olive tree, savin, and such like; and the victim commonly was a pig. Lustrations made for particular persons were commonly called expiations, and the victims piacula. There was also a kind of lustration used for infants, by which they were purified, girls the third, and boys the ninth, day after their birth; which ceremony was performed with pure water and spittle. See the article AMBARVALIA.—In their lustratory sacrifices, the Athenians sacrificed two men, one for the men of their city, and the other for the women. Divers of these expiations were austere: some fasted; others abstained from all sensual pleasures; and some, as the priests of Cybele, castrated themselves. The postures of the penitents were different according to the different sacrifices. The priests changed their habits according to the ceremony to be performed; white, purple, and black, were the most usual colours. They cast into the river, or at least out of the city, the animals or other things that had served for a lustration or sacrifice of atonement; and thought themselves threatened with some great misfortune when by chance they trod upon them. Part of these ceremonies were abolished by the emperor Constantine and his successors; the rest subsisted till the Gothic kings were masters of Rome; under whom they expired, excepting what the popes thought proper to adopt and bring into the church.\n\nFor the lustration, or rather expiation, of the ancient Jews, see EXPIATION.\n\nLUSTRE, the glo's or brightness appearing on anything, particularly on manufactures of silk, wool, or fluff. It is likewise used to denote the composition or manner of giving that glo's.\n\nThe lustre of silks is given them by washing in soap, then clear water, and dipping them in alum water cold. To give fluff's a beautiful lustre: For every eight pounds of stuff allow a quarter of a pound of linseed; boil it half an hour, and then strain it through a cloth, and let it stand till it is turned almost to a jelly; afterwards put an ounce and a half of gum to dissolve 24 hours; then mix the liquor, and put the cloth into this mixture; take it out, dry it in the shade, and press it. If once doing is not sufficient, repeat the operation.\n\nCurriers give a lustre to black leather first with juice of barberries, then with gum-arabic, ale, vinegar, and Flanders glue, boiled together. For coloured leather, they use the white of an egg beaten in water. Moroccoes have their lustre from juice of barberries, and lemon or orange. For hats, the lustre is frequently given with common water: sometimes a little black dye is added; the same lustre serves for furs, except that for very black furs they sometimes prepare a lustre of galls, copperas, Roman alum, ox's marrow, and other ingredients.\n\nLUSTRE, an appellation given to a branched candlestick, when made of glass. See BRANCH and JESSE.\n\nLUSTRINGS. A company was incorporated for making, dressing, and lustrating alamodes and lustrings in England, who were to have the sole benefit thereof, by stat. 4 and 5 William and Mary. And no foreign silks known by the name of lustrings or alamodes are to be imported but at the port of London, &c. Stat. 9 and 10 William III, c. 43. See SILK.\n\nLUSTRUM, in Roman antiquity, a general muster and review of all the citizens and their goods, which was performed by the censors every fifth year, who afterwards made a solemn lustration. See the article LUSTRATION.\n\nThis custom was first instituted by Servius Tullius, about 180 years after the foundation of Rome. In course of time the lustra were not celebrated so often; for we find the fifth lustrum celebrated at Rome only in the 574th year of that city.\n\nLUTE, or LUTING, among chemists, a mixed, tenacious, ductile substance, which grows solid by drying, and, being applied to the juncture of vessels, stops them up so as to prevent the air from getting either in or out.\n\nLute, is also a musical instrument with strings.—The lute consists of four parts, viz. the table, the body or belly, which has nine or ten sides; the neck, which has nine or ten stops or divisions, marked with strings; and the head or crots, where the screws for raising and lowering the strings to a proper pitch of tone are fixed. In the middle of the table there is a rote or passage for the sound; there is also a bridge that the strings are fastened to, and a piece of ivory between the head and the neck to which the other extremities of the strings are fitted. In playing, the strings are struck with the right hand, and with the left the flops are pressed. The lutes of Bologna are esteemed the best on account of the wood, which is said to have an uncommon disposition for producing a sweet sound.\n\nLUTETIA,\nLUTETIA PARISORUM, in Ancient Geography, a town of the Parifii, in Gallia Celtica, situated in an island in the Sequana or Seine. It received its name, as some suppose, from the quantity of clay, lutum, which is in its neighbourhood. J. Caesar fortified and embellished it, from which circumstance some authors call it Juli Civitas. Julian the apostate resided there for some time. It is now Paris, the capital of France; so called from its name Parys in the lower age.\n\nLUTHER, MARTIN, the celebrated author of the Reformation, was a native of Eisleben in Saxony, and born in 1483. Though his parents were poor, he received a learned education; during the progress of which, he gave many indications of uncommon vigour and acuteness of genius. As his mind was naturally susceptible of serious impressions, and tinged with somewhat of that religious melancholy which delights in the solitude and devotion of a monastic life, he retired into a convent of Augustinian friars; where he acquired great reputation, not only for piety, but for love of knowledge and unwearied application to study. The cause of this retirement is said to have been, that he was once struck by lightning, and his companion killed by his side by the same flash. He had been taught the scholastic philosophy which was in vogue in those days, and made considerable progress in it; but happening to find a copy of the Bible which lay neglected in the library of his monastery, he applied himself to the study of it with such eagerness and assiduity, as quite astonished the monks; and increased his reputation for sanctity so much, that he was chosen professor of first of philosophy, and afterwards of theology, at Wittenberg on the Elbe, where Frederic elector of Saxony had founded an university.\n\nWhile Luther continued to enjoy the highest reputation for sanctity and learning, Tetzl, a Dominican friar, came to Wittenberg in order to publish indulgences. Luther beheld his success with great concern; and having first inveighed against indulgences from the pulpit, he afterwards published 95 theses, containing his sentiments on that subject. These he proposed, not as points fully established, but as subjects of inquiry and disputation. He appointed a day on which the learned were invited to impugn them either in person or by writing; and to the whole he subjoined solemn protestations of his high respect for the apostolic see, and of his implicit submission to its authority. No opponent appeared at the time prefixed; the theses spread over Germany with astonishing rapidity, and were read with the greatest eagerness.\n\nThough Luther met with no opposition for some little time after he began to publish his new doctrines, it was not long before many zealous champions arose to defend those opinions with which the wealth and power of the clergy were so strictly connected. Their cause, however, was by no means promoted by these endeavours; the people began to call in question even the authority of the canon law and of the pope himself.—The court of Rome at first despised these new doctrines and disputes; but at last the attention of the pope being raised by the great success of the reformer, and the complaints of his adversaries, Luther was summoned in the month of July 1518, to appear at Rome, within 60 days, before the auditor of Luther's chamber. One of Luther's adversaries, named Prieries, who had written against him, was appointed to examine his doctrines, and to decide concerning them. The pope wrote at the same time to the elector of Saxony, beseeching him not to protect a man whose heretical and profane tenets were so shocking to pious ears; and enjoined the provincial of the Augustinians to check by his authority the rashness of an arrogant monk, which brought disgrace upon their order, and gave offence and disturbance to the whole church.\n\nFrom these letters, and the appointment of his open enemy Prieries to be his judge, Luther easily saw what sentence he might expect at Rome; and therefore discovered the utmost solicitude to have his cause tried in Germany, and before a less suspected tribunal. He wrote a submissive letter to the pope, in which he promised an unreserved obedience to his will, for as yet he entertained no doubt of the divine original of the pope's authority; and by the intercession of the other professors, Cajetan the pope's legate in Germany was appointed to hear and determine the cause. Luther appeared before him without hesitation; but Cajetan thought it below his dignity to dispute the point with a person so much his inferior in rank; and therefore required him by virtue of the apostolic powers with which he was clothed, to retract the errors which he had uttered with regard to indulgences and the nature of faith, and to abstain for the future from the publication of new and dangerous opinions; and at the last forbade him to appear in his presence, unless he proposed to comply with what had been required of him.\n\nThis haughty and violent manner of proceeding, together with some other circumstances, gave Luther's friends such strong reasons to suspect that even the imperial safe-conduct would not be able to protect him from the legate's power and resentment, that they prevailed on him secretly to withdraw from Augsburg, where he had attended the legate, and to return to his own country. But before his departure, according to a form of which there had been some examples, he prepared a solemn appeal from the pope, ill-informed at that time concerning his cause, to the pope, when he should receive more full intimation with respect to it.—Cajetan, enraged at Luther's abrupt retreat, and at the publication of his appeal, wrote to the elector of Saxony, complaining of both; and requiring him, as he regarded the peace of the church, or the authority of its head, either to send that factious monk a prisoner to Rome, or to banish him out of his territories. Frederic had hitherto, from political motives, protected Luther, as thinking he might be of use in checking the enormous power of the see of Rome; and though all Germany rejoiced with his fame, the elector had never yet admitted him into his presence. But upon this demand made by the cardinal, it became necessary to throw off somewhat of his former reserve. He had been at great expense and bestowed much attention on founding a new university, an object of considerable importance to every German prince; and foreseeing how fatal a blow the removal of Luther would be to its reputation,\nreputation, he not only declined complying with either of the pope's requests, but openly discovered great concern for Luther's safety.\n\nThe situation of our reformer, in the mean time, became daily more and more alarming. He knew very well what were the motives which induced the elector to afford him protection, and that he could by no means depend on a continuance of his friendship. If he should be obliged to quit Saxony, he had no other asylum, and must stand exposed to whatever punishment the rage or bigotry of his enemies could inflict; and so ready were his adversaries to condemn him, that he had been declared a heretic at Rome before the expiration of the 60 days allowed him in the citation for making his appearance. Notwithstanding all this, however, he discovered no symptoms of timidity or remissness; but continued to vindicate his own conduct and opinions, and to inveigh against those of his adversaries with more vehemence than ever. Being convinced, therefore, that the pope would soon proceed to the most violent measures against him, he appealed to a general council, which he affirmed to be the representative of the Catholic church, and superior in power to the pope, who being a fallible man, might err, as St Peter, the most perfect of his predecessors, had done.\n\nThe court of Rome were equally affiduous in the mean time to crush the author of these new doctrines which gave them so much uneasiness. A bull was issued by the pope, of a date prior to Luther's appeal, in which he magnified the virtues of indulgences, and subjected to the heaviest ecclesiastical censures all who presumed to teach a contrary doctrine. Such a clear decision of the sovereign pontiff against him might have been very fatal to Luther's cause, had not the death of the emperor Maximilian, which happened on January 17, 1519, contributed to give matters a different turn. Both the principles and interest of Maximilian had prompted him to support the authority of the see of Rome; but, in consequence of his death, the vicariate of that part of Germany which is governed by the Saxon laws devolved to the elector of Saxony; and, under the shelter of his friendly administration, Luther himself enjoyed tranquillity; and his opinions took such root in different places, that they could never afterwards be eradicated. At the same time, as the election of an emperor was a point more interesting to the pope (Leo X.) than a theological controversy which he did not understand, and of which he could not foresee the consequences, he was extremely solicitous not to irritate a prince of such considerable influence in the electoral college as Frederick, that he discovered a great unwillingness to pronounce the sentence of excommunication against Luther, which his adversaries continually demanded with the most clamorous importunity.\n\nFrom the reason just now given, and Leo's natural aversion to severe measures, a suspension of proceeding against Luther took place for 18 months, though perpetual negotiations were carried on during this interval in order to bring the matter to an amicable issue. The manner in which these were conducted having given our reformer many opportunities of observing the corruption of the court of Rome, its obstinacy in adhering to established errors, and its insensible about truth, however clearly proposed or strongly proved, he began, in 1520, to utter some doubts with regard to the divine original of the papal authority, which he publicly disputed with Ezechiel, one of his most learned and formidable antagonists. The dispute was indecisive, both parties claiming the victory; but it must have been very mortifying to the partizans of the Roman church to hear such an essential point of their doctrine publicly attacked.\n\nThe papal authority being once suspected, Luther proceeded to push on his inquiries and attacks from one doctrine to another, till at last he began to shake the firmest foundations on which the wealth and power of the church were established. Leo then began to perceive that there were no hopes of reclaiming such an incorrigible heretic; and therefore prepared to denounce the sentence of excommunication against him. The college of cardinals was often assembled, in order to prepare the sentence with due deliberation; and the ablest canonists were consulted how it might be expressed with unexceptionable formality. At last it was issued on the 15th of June 1520. Forty-one propositions, extracted out of Luther's works, were therein condemned as heretical, scandalous, and offensive to pious ears; all persons were forbidden to read his writings, upon pain of excommunication; such as had any of them in their custody were commanded to commit them to the flames; he himself, if he did not, within 60 days, publicly recant his errors, and burn his books, was pronounced an obstinate heretic, excommunicated, and delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh; and all secular princes were required, under pain of incurring the same censure, to seize his person, that he might be punished as his crimes deserved.\n\nLuther was not in the least disconcerted by this sentence, which he had for some time expected. He renewed his appeal to a general council; declared the pope to be that antichrist, or man of sin, whose appearance is foretold in the New Testament; declaimed against his tyranny with greater vehemence than ever; and at last, by way of retaliation, having assembled all the professors and students in the university of Wittemberg, with great pomp, and in the presence of a vast multitude of spectators, he cast the volumes of the canon law, together with the bull of excommunication, into the flames. The manner in which this action was justified gave still more offence than the action itself. Having collected from the canon law some of the most extravagant propositions with regard to the plenitude and omnipotence of the pope's power, as well as the subordination of all secular jurisdiction to his authority, he published these with a commentary, pointing out the impiety of such tenets, and their evident tendency to subvert all civil government.\n\nOn the accession of Charles V. to the empire, Luther found himself in a very dangerous situation. Charles, in order to secure the pope's friendship, had determined to treat him with great severity. His eagerness to gain this point, rendered him not averse to gratify the papal legates in Germany, who insisted, that without any delay or formal deliberation, the diet then sitting at Worms ought to condemn a man whom the pope had already excommunicated as an incorrigible heretic. Such an abrupt manner of proceeding, however, being deemed unprecedented and unjust by the members\nmembers of the diet, they made a point of Luther's appearing in person, and declaring whether he adhered or not to those opinions which had drawn upon him the censures of the church. Not only the emperor, but all the princes through whose territories he had to pass, granted him a safe-conduct; and Charles wrote to him at the same time, requiring his immediate attendance on the diet, and renewing his promises of protection from any injury or violence. Luther did not hesitate one moment about yielding obedience; and set out for Worms, attended by the herald who had brought the emperor's letter and safe-conduct. While on his journey, many of his friends, whom the fate of Hus, under similar circumstances, and notwithstanding the same security of an imperial safe-conduct, filled with solicitude, advised and entreated him not to rush wantonly into the midst of danger. But Luther, superior to such terrors, silenced them with this reply, \"I am lawfully called (said he) to appear in that city; and thither will I go in the name of the Lord, though as many devils as there are tiles on the houses were there combined against me.\"\n\nThe reception which he met with at Worms, was such as might have been reckoned a full reward of all his labours, if vanity and the love of applause had been the principles by which he was influenced. Greater crowds assembled to behold him than had appeared at the emperor's public entry; his apartments were daily filled with princes and personages of the highest rank; and he was treated with an homage more sincere, as well as more flattering, than any which pre-eminence in birth or condition can command. At his appearance before the diet, he behaved with great decency, and with equal firmness. He readily acknowledged an excess of acrimony and vehemence in his controversial writings; but refused to retract his opinions unless he were convinced of their falsehood, or to consent to their being tried by any other rule than the word of God. When neither threats nor intrigues could prevail on him to depart from this resolution, some of the ecclesiastics proposed to imitate the example of the council of Constance, and, by punishing the author of this pestilent heresy, who was now in their power, to deliver the church at once from such an evil. But the members of the diet refusing to expose the German integrity to fresh reproach by a second violation of public faith, and Charles being no less unwilling to bring a stain upon the beginning of his administration by such an ignominious action, Luther was permitted to depart in safety. A few days after he left the city, a severe edict was published in the emperor's name, and by authority of the diet, depriving him, as an obstinate and excommunicated criminal, of all the privileges which he enjoyed as a subject of the empire, forbidding any prince to harbour or protect him, and requiring all to seize his person as soon as the term specified in his protection should be expired.\n\nBut this rigorous decree had no considerable effect; the execution of it being prevented partly by the multiplicity of occupations which the commotions in Spain, together with the wars in Italy and the Low Countries, created to the emperor; and partly by a prudent precaution employed by the elector of Saxony, Luther's faithful patron. As Luther, on his return from Worms, was passing near Altenstein in Thuringia, a number of horsemen in masks rushed suddenly out of a wood, where the elector had appointed them to lie in wait for him, and surrounding his company, carried him, after dismissing all his attendants, to Wurtzburg, a strong castle not far distant. There the elector ordered him to be supplied with every thing necessary or agreeable; but the place of his retreat was carefully concealed, until the fury of the present storm against him began to abate, upon a change in the political system of Europe. In this solitude, where he remained nine months, and which he frequently called his Patmos, after the name of that island to which the apostle John was banished, he exerted his usual vigour and industry in defence of his doctrines, or in contradiction of his adversaries, publishing several treatises, which revived the spirit of his followers, astonished to a great degree and disheartened at the sudden disappearance of their leader.\n\nLuther, weary at length of his retirement, appeared publicly again at Wittenberg, upon the 6th of March 1522. He appeared indeed without the elector's leave; but immediately wrote him a letter to prevent his taking ill. The edict of Charles V., as severe as it was, had given little or no check to Luther's doctrine; for the emperor was no sooner gone to Flanders, than his edict was neglected and despised, and the doctrine seemed to spread even farther than before. Carolofadius, in Luther's absence, had pushed things on faster than his leader; and had attempted to abolish the use of mats, to remove images out of the churches, to set aside auricular confession, invocation of saints, the abstaining from meats; had allowed the monks to leave their monasteries, to neglect their vows, and to marry; in short, had quite changed the doctrine and discipline of the church at Wittenberg: all which, though not against Luther's sentiments, was yet blamed by him, as being rashly and unlawfully done. Lutheranism was still confined to Germany: it was not got to France; and Henry VIII. of England made the most rigorous acts to hinder it from invading his realm. Nay, he did something more: to show his zeal for religion and the holy see, and perhaps his skill in theological learning, he wrote a treatise Of the seven sacraments, against Luther's book Of the captivity of Babylon; which he presented to Leo X. in October 1521. The pope received it very favourably; and was so well pleased with the king of England, that he complimented him with the title of Defender of the Faith. Luther, however, paid no regard to his kingship: but answered him with great sharpness, treating both his person and performance in the most contemptuous manner. Henry complained of Luther's rude usage of him to the princes of Saxony; and Fisher, bishop of Rochester, replied to his answer, in behalf of Henry's treatise; but neither the king's complaint, nor the bishop's reply, was attended with any visible effects.\n\nLuther, though he had put a stop to the violent proceedings of Carolofadius, now made open war with the pope and bishops; and, that he might make the people despise their authority as much as possible, he wrote one book against the pope's bull, and another against the order falsely called the order of bishops. The same year, 1522, he wrote a letter, dated July the 29th to the assembly of the states of Bohemia;\nLuther in which he assured them that he was labouring to establish their doctrine in Germany, and exhorted them not to return to the communion of the church of Rome; and he published also this year, a translation of the New Testament in the German tongue, which was afterwards corrected by himself and Melancthon. This translation having been printed several times, and being in every body's hands, Ferdinand archduke of Austria, the emperor's brother, made a very severe edict, to hinder the farther publication of it; and forbade all the subjects of his imperial majesty to have any copies of it, or of Luther's other books. Some other princes followed his example; and Luther was so angry at it, that he wrote a treatise, Of the secular power, in which he accuses them of tyranny and impiety. The diet of the empire was held at Nuremberg, at the end of the year; to which Hadrian VI. sent his brief, dated November the 25th; for Leo X. died upon the 2d of December 1521, and Hadrian had been elected pope upon the 9th of January following. In this brief, among other things, he observes to the diet, how he had heard with grief, that Martin Luther, after the sentence of Leo X. which was ordered to be executed by the edict of Worms, continued to teach the same errors, and daily to publish books full of heresies; that it appeared strange to him, that so large and so religious a nation could be seduced by a wretched apostate friar; that nothing, however, could be more pernicious to Christendom; and that therefore he exhorts them to use their utmost endeavours to make Luther, and the authors of these tumults, return to their duty: or, if they refuse and continue obstinate, to proceed against them according to the laws of the empire, and the severity of the last edict.\n\nThe resolution of this diet was published in the form of an edict, upon the 6th of March 1523; but it had no effect in checking the Lutherans, who still went on in the same triumphant manner. This year Luther wrote a great many pieces: among the rest, one upon the dignity and office of the supreme magistrate; which Frederic elector of Saxony is said to have been highly pleased with. He sent, about the same time a writing in the German language to the Waldenses, or Pickards, in Bohemia and Moravia, who had applied to him \"about worshipping the body of Christ in the eucharist.\" He wrote also another book, which he dedicated to the senate and people of Prague, \"about the institution of ministers of the church.\" He drew up a form of saying mass. He wrote a piece, entitled, An example of popish doctrine and divinity; which Dupin calls a satire against nuns and those who profess a monastic life. He wrote also against the vows of virginity, in his preface to his commentary on 1 Cor. viii. And his exhortations here were, it seems, followed with effects; for soon after, nine nuns, among whom was Catharine de Bore, eloped from the nunnery at Nimptschen, and were brought, by the assistance of Leonard Coppen, a burgess of Torgau, to Wittenberg. Whatever offence this proceeding might give to the Papists, it was highly extolled by Luther; who, in a book written in the German language, compares the deliverance of these nuns from the slavery of a monastic life to that of the souls which Jesus Christ has delivered by his death. This year Luther had occasion to canonize two of his followers, who, as Melchior Adam relates, were burnt at Brussels in the beginning of July, and were the first who suffered martyrdom for his doctrine. He wrote also a consolatory epistle to three noble ladies at Meissen, who were banished from the duke of Saxony's court at Friburg, for reading his books.\n\nIn the beginning of the year 1524, Clement VII. sent a legate into Germany to the diet, which was to be held at Nuremburg. Hadrian VI. died in October 1523, and was succeeded by Clement upon the 19th of November. A little before his death he canonized Benno, who was bishop of Meissen in the time of Gregory VII. and one of the most zealous defenders of the holy see. Luther, imagining that this was done directly to oppose him, drew up a piece with this title, Against the New Idol and Old Devil set up at Meissen; in which he treats the memory of Gregory with great freedom, and does not spare even Hadrian. Clement VII.'s legate represented to the diet of Nuremburg the necessity of enforcing the execution of the edict of Worms, which had been strangely neglected by the princes of the empire; but, notwithstanding the legate's solicitations, which were very pressing, the decrees of that diet were thought so ineffectual, that they were condemned at Rome, and rejected by the emperor. It was in this year that the dispute between Luther and Erasmus, about free-will, began. Erasmus had been much courted by the Papists to write against Luther; but he was all along of opinion, that writing would not be found an effectual way to end the differences and establish the peace of the church. However, tired out at length with the importunities of the pope and the catholic princes, and desirous at the same time to clear himself from the suspicion of favouring a cause which he would not seem to favour, he resolved to write against Luther, though, as he tells Melanchthon, it was with some reluctance, and chose free-will for the subject. His book was intitled, A Diatribe, or Conference about Free-will; and was written with much moderation, and without personal reflections. He tells Luther in the preface, \"That he ought not to take his differing from him in opinion ill, because he had allowed himself the liberty of differing from the judgement of popes, councils, universities, and doctors of the church.\" Luther was some time before he answered Erasmus's book; but at last published a treatise De Servo Arbitrio, or Of the Servitude of Man's Will; and though Melanchthon had promised Erasmus, that Luther should answer him with civility and moderation, yet Luther had so little regard to Melanchthon's promise, that he never wrote anything sharper. He accused Erasmus of being careless about religion, and little solicitous what became of it, provided the world continued in peace; and that his notions were rather philosophical than Christian. Erasmus immediately replied to Luther, in a piece called Hyperaspistes; in the first part of which he answers his arguments, and in the second his personal reflections.\n\nIn October 1524, Luther threw off the monastic habit; which, though not premeditated and designed, was yet a very proper preparative to a step he took the year after; we mean, his marriage with Catharine de Bore. Catharine de Bore was a gentleman's daughter, who had been a nun, and was taken, as we have observed, out of the nunnery of Nimptschen, in the year\nLuther had a design, as Melchior Adam related, to marry her to Glacius, a minister of Orta-\nmunden; but she did not like Glacius; and so Luther married her himself upon the 13th of June 1525.\nThis conduct of his was blamed not only by the Ca-\ntholics, but, as Melanchthon says, by those of his own party. He was even for some time ashamed of it him-\nself; and owns, that his marriage had made him so\ndespicable, that he hoped his humiliation would rejoice\nthe angels, and vex the devils. Melanchthon found him\nso afflicted with what he had done, that he wrote some\nletters of consolation to him. It was not so much the\nmarriage, as the circumstances of the time, and the pre-\ncipitation with which it was done, that occasioned the\ncensures passed upon Luther. He married all of a sud-\nden, and at a time when Germany was groaning under\nthe miseries of a war which was said at least to be\nowing to Lutheranism. Then, again, it was thought\nan indecent thing in a man of 42 years of age, who\nwas then, as he pretended, restoring the Gospel, and\nreforming mankind, to involve himself in marriage with\na woman of 26, either through incontinence, or any\naccount whatever. But Luther, as soon as he had re-\ncovered himself a little from this abatement, assumed\nhis former air of intrepidity, and boldly supported what\nhe had done with reasons. \"I took a wife (says he),\nin obedience to my father's commands; and hastened\nthe consummation, in order to prevent impediments,\nand stop the tongues of slanderers.\" It appears from\nhis own confession, that this reformer was very fond\nof Mrs de Bore, and used to call her his Catharine,\nwhich made profane people think and say wicked\nthings of him: \"And therefore (says he) I mar-\nried of a sudden, not only that I might not be obliged\nto hear the clamours which I knew would be raised\nagainst me, but to stop the mouths of those who re-\nproached me with Catharine de Bore.\" Luther also\ngives us to understand, that he did it partly as con-\ncurring with his grand scheme of opposing the Catho-\nlics.\n\nLuther, notwithstanding, was not himself altogether\nsatisfied with these reasons. He did not think the step\nhe had taken could be sufficiently justified upon the\nprinciples of human prudence; and therefore we find\nhim, in other places, endeavouring to account for it\nfrom a supernatural impulse. But whether there was\nany thing divine in it or not, Luther found himself\nextremely happy in his new state, and especially after\nhis wife had brought him a son. \"My rib Kate (says\nhe in the joy of his heart) deserves her compliments to\nyou, and thanks you for the favour of your kind let-\nter. She is very well, through God's mercy. She is\nobedient and complying with me in all things; and\nmore agreeable, I thank God, than I could have ex-\npected; so that I would not change my poverty for\nthe wealth of Croesus.\" He was heard to say (Sack-\nendorf tells us,) that he would not exchange his wife\nfor the kingdom of France, nor for the riches of the\nVenetians; and that for three reasons: Because she had\nbeen given him by God, at the time when he implored\nthe alliance of the Holy Ghost in finding a good\nwife; secondly, Because, though she was not without\nfaults, yet she had fewer than other women; and,\nthirdly, Because she religiously observed the conjugal\nfidelity she owed him. There went at first a report,\nthat Catharine de Bore was brought to bed soon after\nher marriage with Luther; but Erasmus, who had\nwrote that news to his friends, acknowledged the\nfalsity of it a little after.\n\nHis marriage, however, did not retard his activity\nand diligence in the work of reformation. He revised\nthe Augsburg confession of faith, and apology for the\nProtestants, when the Protestant religion was first esta-\nblished on a firm basis. See Protestants and Re-\nformation.\n\nAfter this, Luther had little else to do than to sit\ndown and contemplate the mighty work he had fini-\nshed: for that a single monk should be able to give the\nchurch so rude a shock, that there needed but such an-\nother entirely to overthrow it, may very well seem a\nmighty work. He did indeed little else: for the re-\nmainder of his life was spent in exhorting princes,\nstates, and universities, to confirm the reformation\nwhich had been brought about through him; and pub-\nlishing from time to time such writings as might en-\ncourage, direct, and aid, them in doing it. The em-\nperor threatened temporal punishment with armies, and\nthe pope eternal with bulls and anathemas; but Luther\ncared for none of their threats. His friend and co-\nadjutor Melanchthon was not so indifferent; for Me-\nlanchton had a great deal of softness, moderation, and\ndiffidence in his make, which made him very uneasy,\nand even sorrowful, in the present disorders. Hence\nwe find many of Luther's letters written on purpose to\nsupport and comfort him under these several distresses\nand anxieties.\n\nIn the year 1533, Luther wrote a consolatory epistle\nto the citizens of Olchats, who had suffered some hardships for adhering to the Augsburg confes-\nsion of faith; in which, among other things, he says:\n\"The devil is the host, and the world is his inn; so\nthat wherever you come, you shall be sure to find this\nugly host.\" He had also about this time a terrible\ncontroversy with George duke of Saxony, who had\nsuch an aversion to Luther's doctrine, that he obliged\nhis subjects to take an oath that they would never em-\nbrace it. However, 60 or 70 citizens of Leipzig were\nfound to have deviated a little from the Catholic way\nin some point or other, and they were known previ-\nously to have consulted Luther about it; upon which\nGeorge complained to the elector John, that Luther\nhad not only abused his person, but also preached up\nrebellion among his subjects. The elector ordered Lu-\nther to be acquainted with this; and to be told at the\nsame time, that if he did not clear himself of the\ncharge, he could not possibly escape punishment. But\nLuther easily refuted the accusation, by proving, that\nhe had been so far from stirring up his subjects against\nhim, on the score of religion, that on the contrary, he\nhad exhorted them rather to undergo the greatest hard-\nships, and even suffer themselves to be banished.\n\nIn the year 1534, the Bible translated by him into\nGerman was first printed, as the old privilege, dated\nat Bibliopolis, under the elector's hand, shows: and\nit was published the year after. He also published\nthis year a book against males and the consecration of\npriests, in which he relates a conference he had with\nthe devil upon those points; for it is remarkable in\nLuther's whole history, that he never had any conflicts\nof any kind within, but the devil was always his anta-\ngonist.\nIn February 1537, an assembly was held at Smalkald about matters of religion, to which Luther and Melanchthon were called. At this meeting Luther was seized with so grievous an illness, that there were no hopes of his recovery. He was afflicted with the stone, and had a stoppage of urine for 11 days. In this terrible condition he would needs undertake to travel, notwithstanding all that his friends could say or do to prevent him; his resolution, however, was attended with a good effect; for the night after his departure he began to be better. As he was carried along, he made his will, in which he bequeathed his detestation of Popery to his friends and brethren; agreeably to what he often used to say: \"Povit eram vivus, mortiens ero mori tua, papa;\" that is, \"I was the plague of Popery in my life, and shall continue to be so in my death.\"\n\nThis year the pope and the court of Rome, finding it impossible to deal with the Protestants by force, began to have recourse to stratagem. They affected therefore to think, that though Luther had indeed carried things on with a high hand and to a violent extreme, yet what he had pleaded in defence of these measures was not entirely without foundation. They talked with a seeming show of moderation: and Pius III, who succeeded Clement VII, proposed a reformation first among themselves, and even went so far as to fix a place for a council to meet at for that purpose. But Luther treated this farce as it deserved to be treated; unmasked and detected it immediately; and, to ridicule it the more strongly, caused a picture to be drawn, in which was represented the pope seated on high upon a throne, some cardinals about him with foxes tails on, and seeming to evacuate upwards and downwards (sursum deorsum repurgare, as Melchior Adam expresses it). This was fixed over against the title-page, to let the reader see at once the scope and design of the book; which was, to expose that cunning and artifice with which those subtle politicians affected to cleanse and purify themselves from their errors and superstitions. Luther published about the same time A Confutation of the pretended Grant of Constantine to Sylvester Bishop of Rome; and also some letters of John Hus, written from his prison at Constance to the Bohemians.\n\nIn this manner was Luther employed till his death, which happened in the year 1546. That year, accompanied by Melanchthon, he paid a visit to his own country, which he had not seen for many years, and returned again in safety. But soon after he was called thither again by the earls of Mansfeldt, to compose some differences which had arisen about their boundaries. Luther had not been used to such matters; but because he was born at Eisleben, a town in the territory of Mansfeldt, he was willing to do his country whatever service he could, even in this way. Preaching his last sermon therefore at Wittemberg, upon the 17th of January, he set off on the 23rd; and at Hall in Saxony lodged with Jutus Jonas, with whom he staid three days, because the waters were out. Upon the 28th, he passed over the river with his three sons and Dr. Jonas; and being in some danger, he said to the Doctor, \"Do not you think it would rejoice the devil exceedingly, if I and you, and my three sons, should be drowned?\" When he entered the territories of the earls of Mansfeldt, he was received by 100 horsemen or more, and conducted in a very honourable manner; but was at the same time so very ill, that it was feared he would die. He said, that these fits of sickness often came upon him when he had any great business to undertake: of this, however, he did not recover; but died upon the 18th of February, in the 63rd year of his age. A little before he expired, he admonished those that were about him to pray to God for the propagation of the Gospel: \"because (said he) the council of Trent, which had sat once or twice, and the pope, would devise strange things against it.\" Soon after, his body was put into a leaden coffin, and carried with funereal pomp to the church at Eisleben, when Dr. Jonas preached a sermon upon the occasion. The earls of Mansfeldt desired that his body should be interred in their territories; but the elector of Saxony insisted upon his being brought back to Wittemberg; which was accordingly done; and there he was buried with the greatest pomp that perhaps ever happened to any private man. Princes, earls, nobles, and students without number, attended the procession; and Melanchthon made his funeral oration.\n\nA thousand lies were invented by the Papists about Luther's death. Some said that he died suddenly; others, that he killed himself; others, that the devil strangled him; others, that his corpse stunk so abominably, that they were forced to leave it in the way, as it was carried to be interred. Nay, lies were invented about his death, even while he was yet alive. Luther, however, to give the most effectual refutation of this account of his death, put forth an advertisement of his being alive; and, to be even with the Papists for the malice they had thrown in this lie, wrote a book at the same time to prove, that \"the papacy was founded by the devil.\"\n\nLuther's works were collected after his death, and printed at Wittemberg in 7 vols folio. Catharine de Bore survived her husband a few years; and continued the first year of her widowhood at Wittemberg, though Luther had advised her to seek another place of residence. She went from thence in the year 1547, when the town was surrendered to the emperor Charles V. Before her departure, she had received a present of 50 crowns from Christian III, king of Denmark; and the elector of Saxony, and the counts of Mansfeldt, gave her good tokens of their liberality. With these additions to what Luther had left her, she had whereunto maintain herself and her family handsomely. She returned to Wittemberg, when the town was restored to the elector; where she lived in a very devout and pious manner, till the plague obliged her to leave it again in the year 1552. She sold what she had at Wittemberg; and retired to Torgau, with a resolution to end her life there. An unfortunate mishap befell her in her journey thither, which proved fatal to her. The horses growing unruly, and attempting to run away, she leaped out of the vehicle she was conveyed in; and, by leaping, got a fall, of which she died about a quarter of a year after, at Torgau, upon the 20th of December 1552. She was buried there in the great church, where her tomb and epitaph are still to be seen; and the university of Wittemberg, which was then at Torgau because the plague raged at Wittemberg,\nLUTHERANISM, the sentiments of Martin Luther with regard to religion. See LUTHER.\n\nLutheranism has undergone some alterations since the time of its founder.—Luther rejected the epistle of St James as insufficient with the doctrine of St Paul, in relation to justification; he also set aside the Apocalypse: both which are now received as canonical in the Lutheran church.\n\nLuther reduced the number of sacraments to two, viz. baptism, and the eucharist: but he believed the impanation, or consubstantiation, that is, that the matter of the bread and wine remain with the body and blood of Christ; and it is in this article that the main difference between the Lutherans and English churches consists.\n\nLuther maintained the mass to be no sacrifice; exploded the adoration of the host, auricular confession, meritorious works, indulgences, purgatory, the worship of images, &c. which had been introduced in the corrupt times of the Romish church. He also opposed the doctrine of free will, maintained predestination, and affirmed our justification to be solely by the imputation of the merits and satisfaction of Christ. He also opposed the fastings in the Roman church, monastical vows, the celibate of the clergy, &c.\n\nLUTHERANS, the Christians who follow the opinions of Martin Luther, one of the principal reformers of the church in the 16th century. See LUTHER.\n\nThe Lutherans, of all Protestants, are those who differ least from the Romish church; as they affirm, that the body and blood of Christ are materially present in the sacrament of the Lord's supper, though in an incomprehensible manner; and likewise represent some religious rites and institutions, as the use of images in churches, the distinguishing veils of the clergy, the private confession of sins, the use of wafers in the administration of the Lord's supper, the form of exorcism in the celebration of baptism, and other ceremonies of the like nature, as tolerable, and some of them as useful. The Lutherans maintain, with regard to the divine decrees, that they respect the salvation or misery of men, in consequence of a previous knowledge of their sentiments and characters, and not as free and unconditional, and as founded on the mere will of God. Towards the close of the last century, the Lutherans began to entertain a greater liberality of sentiment than they had before adopted; though in many places they persevered longer in severe and despotic principles than other Protestant churches. Their public teachers now enjoy an unbounded liberty of dissenting from the decisions of those symbols or creeds which were once deemed almost infallible rules of faith and practice, and of declaring their dissent in the manner they judge the most expedient. Mohein attributes this change in their sentiments to the maxim which they generally adopted, that Christians were accountable to God alone for their religious opinions; and that no individual could be justly punished by the magistrate for his erroneous opinions, while he conducted himself like a virtuous and obedient subject, and made no attempts to disturb the peace and order of civil society.\n\nLUTHERN, in Architecture, a kind of window over the cornice, in the roof of a building; standing perpendicularly over the naked of a wall, and serving to illuminate the upper story.\n\nLutherns are of various forms; as square, semicircular, round, called bull's eyes, flat arches, &c.\n\nLUTRA, in Zoology. See MUSTELA, MAMMALIA Index.\n\nLUTTI, BENEDICTO, an eminent painter, born at Florence in 1666. He was the disciple of Antonio Dominico Gabiani, and his merit was judged equal to that of his master: he painted few beside etch pieces; and his works were much valued and sought for in England, France, and Germany. The emperor knighted him; and the elector of Mentz, together with his patent of knighthood, sent him a crols set with diamonds. Lutti was never satisfied in finishing his pictures; yet though he often retouched them, they never appeared laboured. He died in 1724.\n\nLUTZEN, a town of Upper Saxony in Germany; famous for a battle fought here in 1622, when Gustavus Adolphus king of Sweden was killed. It is situated on the river Elster, in E.

See SURGERY.\n\nLUXEMBURG, a city of the Austrian Netherlands, and capital of a duchy of the same name. It is seated partly on a hill, and partly on a plain; it is very strong both by art and nature. It is but indifferently built, though there are some good stone houses in it. There is nothing very remarkable among the structures but the Jesuits church; which is a handsome edifice, after the modern taste. It was taken by Louis XIV. in 1684; who so augmented the fortifications, that it is now one of the strongest towns in Europe. It was ceded to Spain by the treaty of Ryswick; but the French took it again in 1701, and gave it up to the house of Austria by the treaty of Utrecht. It is 25 miles south-west of Trèves, and 100 west of Mentz. E. Long. 6. 10. N. Lat. 49. 52.\n\nLUXEMBURG, the duchy of, is one of the 17 provinces of the Netherlands. It is bounded on the east by the archbishopric of Trèves; on the south by Lorraine; on the west, partly by Champagne, and partly by the bishopric of Liege, which likewise, with part of Limburg, bound it on the north. It lies in the forest of Ardennes, which is one of the most famous in Europe. In some places it is covered with mountains and woods, and in general it is fertile in corn and wine; and here are a great number of iron mines. The principal rivers are the Meuse, the Sour, the Ourte, and the Semoy. It belongs partly to the house of Austria, and partly to the French; and Thionville is the capital of the French part.\n\nLUXEMBURG, François Henry de Montmorenci, duke of, and marshal of France, a renowned general in the service of Louis XIV. was born in 1628. He was with the prince of Condé at the battle of Rocroy, in 1643; and in 1668 distinguished himself at the conquest of Franche Comté. In 1672, he commanded in chief the French army in Holland; when he defeated the enemy near Woerden and Bodegrave, and was universally admired for the fine retreat he made in 1673. He became marshal of France in 1675; gained the battle of Fleurs in 1690, that of Steenik in\nLUXURIOUS FLOES, \"a luxuriant or double flower;\" a flower, some of whose parts are increased in number, to the diminution or entire exclusion of others.\n\nThe parts that are augmented or multiplied in luxuriant flowers, are the flower-cup and petals, which Linnaeus considers as the teguments or covers of the flower; the parts that are diminished, or entirely excluded, are the stamens or chives, which the same author denominates the male organs of generation.\n\nLuxuriance in flowers is capable of the three following varieties.\n\n1. A flower is said to be multiplied (flor multiplicatus), when the increase of the petals is not such as to exclude all the stamens: in this sense, flowers are properly said to be double, triple, or quadruple, according to the number of multiplications of the petals.\n\n2. A flower is said to be full (flor plenus), when, by the multiplication of the petals, all the stamens are excluded. Such are most of the double flowers that engage the attention of florists.\n\n3. A flower is said to be prolific (flor prolifer), which produces flowers, and sometimes leaves, from its centre.\n\nFor a particular description of each of these kinds of luxuriance in flowers, see the articles Multiplicatus Flor, Plenus Flor, and Prolifer Flor.\n\nMany natural orders of plants do not in any circumstances produce luxuriant flowers. Of this kind are the mottled flowers of Tournefort, excepting calyx's snout; the rough-leaved, umbelliferous, starry plants, and such as flower at the joints, of Ray: some umbelliferous flowers, however, are prolific.\n\nThe pea-bloom, or butterfly-shaped flowers, are rarely rendered double; some instances, however, of luxuriance, are observed in a species of lady's finger, coromilla, and broom.\n\nAll luxuriant flowers are vegetable monsters. Such as are perfectly full, by which we mean the greatest degree of luxuriance, cannot be propagated by seeds; because these, for want of impregnation, can never ripen. Full flowers therefore are very properly denominated by Linnaeus cucullus. This highest degree of luxuriance is very common in carnation, lychinis, anemone, rock, Indian crests, rose, marigold, ranunculus, violet, peony, and narcissus.\n\nFlowers which do not exclude all the stamens, perfect their seeds. Of this kind are poppy, fennel-flower, campanula, and some others.\n\nSome flowers, as those of the water-lily, fig-mari-gold, and cactus, have many rows or series of petals, without the number of stamens being in the least diminished. Such flowers are by no means to be reckoned luxuriant, in the slightest degree.\n\nLuxuriance in flowers is generally owing to excess of nourishment.\n\nLUXURY; voluptuousness, or an extravagant indulgence in diet, dress, and equipage.\n\nLuxury, among the Romans, prevailed to such a degree, that several laws were made to suppress, or at least limit it. The extravagance of the table began about the time of the battle of Actium, and continued in great excess till the reign of Galba. Peacocks, cranes of Malta, nightingales, venison, wild turkey, and tame fowl, were considered as delicacies. A profusion of provisions was the reigning taste. Whole wild boars were often served up, and sometimes they were filled with various small animals, and birds of different kinds: this dish they called the Trojan horse, in allusion to the wooden horse filled with soldiers. Fowls and game of all sorts were served up in whole pyramids, piled up in dishes as broad as moderate tables. Lucullus had a particular name for each apartment; and in whatever room he ordered his servants to prepare the entertainment, they knew by the direction the expense to which they were to go. When he dined in the Apollo, the expense was fixed at 50,000 drachmas, that is 1250l. M. Antony provided eight boars for 12 guineas. Vitellius had a large silver platter, said to have cost a million of sesterces, called Minerva's buckler. In this he blended together the livers of gilt-heads, the brains of pheasants and peacocks, the tongues of phoenicopters, and the milts of lampreys. Caligula served up to his guests pearls of great value dissolved in vinegar; the same was done also by Clodius the son of Ælop the tragician. Apicius laid aside 90,000,000 of sesterces, besides a mighty revenue, for no other purpose but to be sacrificed to luxury; finding himself involved in debt, he looked over his accounts, and though he had the sum of 10,000,000 of sesterces still left, he poisoned himself for fear of being starved to death.\n\nThe Roman laws to restrain luxury were Lex Orchia, Fannia, Didia, Licinia, Cornelia, and many others: But all these were too little; for as riches increased amongst them, so did sensuality.\n\nWhat were the ideas of luxury entertained in England about two centuries ago, may be gathered from the following passage of Holinshed; who, in a discourse prefixed to his History, speaking of the increase of luxury, says, \"Neither do I speak this in reproach of any man, God is my judge; but to show, that I do rejoice rather to see how God has blessed us with his good gifts, and to behold how that in a time wherein all things are grown to the most exorbitant prices, we yet find means to obtain and achieve such furniture as heretofore was impossible. There are old men yet dwelling in the village where I remain, which have noted three things to be marvelously altered in England within their found remembrance. One is the multitude of chimneys lately erected; whereas in their young days there were not above two or three, if so many, in most uplandish towns of the realm (the religious houses, and manor places of their lords, always excepted, and peradventure some great personages), but each made his fire against a reredos [fireplace] in the hall where he dined his meat and dined.—The second is the great amendment of lodging; for, said they, our fathers and we ourselves have lain full oft upon straw pallets covered only with a sheet, under coverlets made of a dogswine or horharris (to use their own terms), and a good log under their head instead of a bolster.—If it were so that the father or goodman of the house had a matrass, or flock bed and sheets, a lack of chair to rest his head upon, he thought himself to be as well lodged as the lord of the town. So well were they contented, that pillows (said they) were thought meet only\nLuxury only for women in childbed; as for servants, if they had any sheet above them, it was well; for seldom had they any under their bodies to keep them from prickling straws, that ran oft through the canvas and their hardened hides.—The third thing they tell of, is the exchange of treene [wooden] platters into pewter, and wooden spoons into silver or tin; for so common were all sorts of treene vessels in old times, that a man should hardly find four pieces pewter (of which one was peradventure a falt) in a good farmer's house. Again, in times past, men were contented to dwell in houses builded of fallow, willow, &c., so that the use of oak was in a manner dedicated wholly unto churches, religious houses, princes palaces, navigation, &c. But now willow, &c., are rejected, and nothing but oak anywhere regarded; and yet see the change, for when our houses were builded of willow, then had we oaken men; but now that our houses are come to be made of oak, our men are not only become willow, but a great many altogether of straw, which is a sore alteration. In these the courage of the owner was a sufficient defense to keep the house in safety; but now the affluence of the timber must defend the men from robbing. Now have we many chimneys, and yet our tenderlings complain of rheums, catarrhs, and poves; then had we none but reredoes, and our heads did never ache. For as the smoke in those days were supposed to be a sufficient hardening for the timber of the house; so it was reputed a far better medicine to keep the goodman and his family from the quacks or poise; wherewith, as then, very few were acquainted. Again, Our pewterers in time past employed the use of pewter only upon dishes and pots, and a few other trifles for service; whereas now they are grown into such exquisite cunning, that they can in a manner imitate by infusion any form or fashion, of cup, dish, salt, bowl, or goblet, which is made by the goldsmith's craft, though they be ever so curious and very artificially forged. In some places beyond the sea, a garnish of good flat English pewter (I say flat, because dishes and platters in my time began to be made deep, and like basins, and are indeed more convenient both for sauce and keeping the meat warm) is esteemed so precious as the like number of vessels that are made of fine silver.\n\nParticular instances of luxury, in eating, however, might be adduced from an earlier period, surpassing even the extravagance of the Romans. Thus, in the 10th year of the reign of Edward IV. (1470), George Nevill, brother to the earl of Warwick, at his instalment into the archiepiscopal see of York, entertained most of the nobility and principal clergy, when his bill of fare was 300 quarters of wheat, 350 tons of ale, 104 tons of wine, a pipe of spiced wine, 80 fat oxen, six wild bulls, 1000 weathers, 300 hogs, 300 calves, 3000 geese, 3000 capons, 300 pigs, 100 peacocks, 200 cranes, 200 kids, 2000 chickens, 4000 pigeons, 4000 rabbits, 204 bitterns, 4000 ducks, 200 pheasants, 300 partridges, 200 woodcocks, 400 plovers, 100 curlews, 100 quails, 1000 egrets, 200 rees, 400 bucks, does, and roebucks, 1500 hot venison pasties, 4000 cold ditto, 1000 dishes of jelly parted, 4000 dishes of jelly plain, 4000 cold custards, 2000 hot custards, 300 pikes, 300 breams, eight feals, four porpoises, 400 tarts. At this feast the earl of Warwick waseward, the earl of Bedford treasurer, and Lord Hasting comptroller, with many more noble officers; 1000 servitors, 62 cooks, 515 menial apparitors in the kitchen.—But such was the fortune of the man, that after his extreme prodigality he died in the most abject but unpitied poverty, vincitus jacuit in summa inopia.\n\nAnd as to dress, luxury in that article seems to have attained a great height long before Holinshed's time: For in the reign of Edward III. we find no fewer than seven sumptuary laws passed in one session of parliament to restrain it. It was enacted, that men servants of lords, as also of tradesmen and artisans, shall be content with one meal of fish or flesh every day; and the other meals, daily, shall be of milk, cheese, butter, and the like. Neither shall they use any ornaments of gold, silk, or embroidery; nor their wives and daughters any veils above the price of twelvepence. Artisans and yeomen shall not wear cloth above 40s. the whole piece (the finest then being about 6l. per piece), nor the ornaments before named. Nor the women any veils of silk, but only those of thread made in England. Gentlemen under the degree of knights, not having 100l. yearly in land, shall not wear any cloth above 4½ marks the whole piece. Neither shall they or their females use cloth of gold, silver, or embroidery, &c. But esquires having 200l. per annum or upwards of rent, may wear cloths of five marks the whole piece of cloth; and they and their females may also wear stuff of silk, silver, ribbons, girdles, or furs. Merchants, citizens, burgurers, and artificers or tradesmen, as well of London as elsewhere, who have goods and chattels of the clear value of 500l. and their females, may wear as is allowed to gentlemen and esquires of 100l. per annum. And merchants, citizens, and burgesses, worth above 1000l. in goods and chattels, may (and their females) wear the same as gentlemen of 200l. per annum. Knights of 200 marks yearly may wear cloth of six marks the cloth, but no higher; but no cloth of gold, nor furred with ermine: but all knights and ladies having above 400 marks yearly, up to 1000l. per annum, may wear as they please, ermine excepted; and they may wear ornaments of pearl and precious stones for their heads only. Clerks having degrees in cathedrals, colleges, &c., may wear as knights and esquires of the same income. Plowmen, carters, shepherds, and such like, not having 40s. value in goods or chattels, shall wear no sort of cloth but blanket and russet lawn of 12d. and shall wear girdles and belts; and they shall only eat and drink suitable to their stations. And whoever uses other apparel than is prescribed by the above laws shall forfeit the same.\n\nConcerning the general utility of luxury to a state, there is much controversy among the political writers. Baron Montefoueu lays it down, that luxury is necessary in monarchies, as in France; but ruinous to democracies, as in Holland. With regard therefore to Britain, whose government is compounded of both species, it is held to be a dubious question, how far private luxury is a public evil; and, as such, cognizable by public laws. And indeed our legislators have several times changed their sentiments as to this point; for formerly there were a number of penal laws existing to restrain excess in apparel, chiefly made in the reigns of Edward III. IV. and Henry VIII.; a specimen of which we have inserted above. But all of them it appeared expedient to repeal at an after period. In fact, although\nLuxury will of necessity increase according to the influx of wealth; it may not be for the general benefit of commerce to impose, as in the above cited laws, an absolute prohibition of every degree of it: yet, for the good of the public, it may be necessary that such as go beyond proper bounds in eating, drinking, and wearing, what by no means is suitable to their station, should be taxed accordingly, could it be done without including those who have a better title to such indulgence. This is certainly, however, a point which should be maturely weighed before executed; and, in mercantile countries at least, such restraints may be found prejudicial, most likely impracticable, especially where true liberty is established. Sir William Temple observes, speaking of the trade and riches, and at the same time of the frugality of the Hollanders, \"That some of our maxims are not so certain as current in politics: as that encouragement of excess and luxury if employed in the consumption of native commodities, is of advantage to trade. It may be so to that which impoverishes, but not to that which enriches a country. It is indeed less prejudicial, if it lies in native than in foreign wares: but the humour of luxury and expense cannot stop at certain bounds; what begins in native will proceed to foreign commodities; and though the example arise among idle persons, yet the imitation will run into all degrees, even of those men by whose industry the nation subsists. And besides, the more of our own we spend, the less shall we have to send abroad; and so it will come to pass, that while we drive a vast trade, yet, by buying much more than we sell, we shall come to be poor at last.\"\n\nLYBIA, or Libya, a name anciently given to all that part of Africa lying between the border of Egypt and the river Triton; and comprehending Cyrenaica, Marmarica, and the Regio Syrtica. See these articles.\n\nLYCÆUM, Λυκεῖον, in antiquity, the name of a celebrated school or academy at Athens, where Aristotle explained his philosophy. The place was composed of porticoes and trees planted in the quincunx form, where the philosophers disputed walking. Hence philosophy of the Lyceum is used to signify the philosophy of Aristotle, or the Peripatetic philosophy. Suadas observes, that the Lyceum took its name from its having been originally a temple of Apollo Lyceus; or rather a portico or gallery built by Lycaeus son of Apollo; but others mention it to have been built by Pisistratus or Pericles.\n\nLYCÆUS, in Ancient Geography, a mountain of Arcadia, sacred to Jupiter; whence Jupiter Lycaeus (Pliny). Sacred also to Pan (Virgil); and hence Lyceæa, the rites performed to Pan on this mountain; which Evander carrying with him to Latium, were called Lupercalia (Virgil).\n\nLYCAON, in fabulous history, the first king of Arcadia, son of Pelasgus and Meliboea. He built a town called Lycofura, on the top of Mount Lyceus, in honour of Jupiter. He had many wives, by whom he had a daughter called Callisto, and 50 sons. He was succeeded on the throne by Nyctimus, the eldest of his sons. He lived about 1820 years before the Christian era.—Another king of Arcadia, celebrated for his cruelties. He was changed into a wolf by Jupiter, because he offered human victims on the altar of the god Pan. Some attribute this metamorphosis to another Lycaonia caule. The sins of mankind, as they relate, were become so enormous, that Jupiter visited the earth to punish wickedness and impiety. He came to Arcadia, where he was announced as a god, and the people began to pay proper adoration to his divinity. Lycaon, however, who used to sacrifice all strangers to his wanton cruelty, laughed at the pious prayers of his subjects; and to try the divinity of the god, he served up human flesh on his table. This impiety so irritated Jupiter, that he immediately destroyed the house of Lycaon, and changed him into a wolf.\n\nLYCAONIA, in Ancient Geography, a small country of the Hither Asia, contained between Pamphylia to the south, Cappadocia to the north, Phrygia to the west, and Armenia Minor to the east.

It was anciently called Mylasa and Tremile, from the Mylae, or Solymi, a people of Crete, who came to settle there. The country received the name of Lycia from Lycus the son of Pandon, who established himself there. The inhabitants have been greatly commended by all the ancients for their sobriety and justice. They were conquered by Croesus king of Lydia, and afterwards by Cyrus. Though they were subject to the power of Persia, yet they were governed by their own kings, and only paid a yearly tribute to the Persian monarch. They became part of the Macedonian empire when Alexander came into the east, and afterwards were ceded to the house of the Seleucidae. The country was reduced into a Roman province by the emperor Claudius.\n\nLYCIUM, a genus of plants belonging to the pentandra class; and in the natural method ranking under the 28th order, Luridae. See Botany Index.\n\nLYCODONTES, the petrified teeth of the lupus-fish, or wolf-fish, frequently found fossile. They are of different shapes; but the most common kind rise into a semicircular form, and are hollow within, somewhat resembling an acorn-cup; this hollow is found sometimes empty, and sometimes filled with the stratum in which it is immersed. Many of them have an outer circle, of a different colour from the rest.\n\nLYCOMEDES, in fabulous history, a king of Scyros, an island in the Aegean sea. He was son of Apollo and Parthenope. He was secretly intrusted with the care of young Achilles, whom his mother Thetis had disguised in woman's clothes, to remove him from the Trojan war, where she knew he must unavoidably perish. Lycomedes has rendered himself famous for his treachery to Theseus, who had implored his protection when\nLycoperdon when driven from his throne of Thebes by the usurper Meneleus. Lycomedes, as it is reported, either envious of the fame of his illustrious guest, or bribed by the eminences of Meneleus, led Theseus to an elevated place, on pretence to show him the extent of his dominions, and perditionly threw him down a precipice, where he was killed.\n\nLYCOPERDON, a genus of plants belonging to the cryptogamia class.

After the death of his brother Polydectes, who was king of Sparta, his widow offered the crown to Lycurgus, promising that she would make herself miscarry of the child of which she was pregnant, provided he would marry her; but Lycurgus nobly refused these advantageous offers, and afterwards contented himself with being tutor to his nephew Charillus, and restored to him the government when he came of age; but notwithstanding this regular and generous conduct, he was accused of a design to usurp the crown. This calumny obliged him to retire to the island of Crete, where he applied himself to the study of the laws and customs of nations. At his return to Lacedemon, he reformed the government; and, to prevent the disorders occasioned by luxury and the love of riches, he prohibited the use of gold and silver; placed all the citizens in a state of equality; and introduced the strictest temperance, the most exact discipline, and those admirable laws (which a few excepted) have been celebrated by all historians. It is said, that, to engage the Lacedemonians to observe them inviolably, he made them promise with an oath not to change any part of them till his return; and that he afterwards went to the island of Crete, where he killed himself, after having ordered that his ashes should be thrown into the sea, for fear lest if his body should be carried to Sparta the Lacedemonians would think themselves absolved from their oath. He flourished about 870 B.C.\n\nLYDD, a town of England, in Kent, two miles and a half south-west of Romney, of which town and port it is a member, and 71 miles from London. It is a populous town, and is incorporated by the name of a bailiff, jurats, and commonalty. In the beach near Stone-end, is a heap of stones, fancied to be the tomb of Crispin and Crispianus; and near the sea is a place called Holybone, consisting of beach and pebble-stones, which abounds with holm trees.\n\nLYDGATE, John, called the Monk of Bury; not, as Cibber conjectures, because he was a native of that place, for he was born about the year 1580, in the village of Lydgate; but because he was a monk of the Benedictine convent at St Edmund's-Bury. After studying some time in our English universities, he traveled to France and Italy; and, having acquired a competent knowledge of the languages of those countries, he returned to London, where he opened a school, in which he instructed the sons of the nobility in polite literature. At what time he retired to the convent of St Edmund's-Bury, does not appear; but he was certainly there in 1415. He was living in 1446, aged about 66; but in what year he died is not known. Lydgate, according to Pits, was an elegant poet, a persuasive rhetorician, an expert mathematician, an acute philosopher, and a tolerable divine. He was a voluminous writer; and, considering the age in which he lived, an excellent poet. His language is less obsolete, and his versification much more harmonious, than the language and versification of Chaucer, who wrote about half a century before him. He wrote, 1. History of the Theban war, printed at the end of Chaucer's works, 1561, 1602, 1687. 2. Poemation of good counsel; at the end of Chaucer's works. 3. The life of Hector; London 1594, folio, printed by Grofs, dedicated to Henry V. 4. Life of the Blest Virgin; printed by Caxton. 5. The proverbs of Lydgate upon the fall of princes; printed by Wink. Word. London, 4to. 6. Dilpute of the horse, the sheep, and the goose; printed in Caxton's Collect. 4to. 7. The temple of brafs; among the works of Chaucer. 8. London lickpenny; vide Stow's history, &c. &c. Besides an incredible number of other poems and translations preserved in various libraries, and of which the reader will find a catalogue in Bishop Tanner.\n\nLYDIA, in Ancient Geography, a celebrated kingdom of Asia Minor.—All the ancient writers tell us, that Lydia was first called Maeonia or Meonia, from Meon king of Phrygia and Lydia; and that it was known under no other denomination till the reign of Atys, when it began to be called Lydia from his son Lydus. Bochart finding in his learned collection of Phoenician words the verb luw, signifying \"to wind,\" and observing that the country we are speaking of is watered by the Maeander so famous for its windings, concludes that it was thence named Lydia, or Ludia.\nAs to the ancient name of Mæonia, he takes it to be a Greek translation of the Phoenician word *lud*; wherein he agrees in some measure with Stephanus, who derives the name of Mæonia from Maeon the ancient name of the Meander. Some take the word *maonia* to be a translation of a Hebrew word signifying \"metal,\" because that country, say they, was in former times enriched above any other with mines. Though Lydia and Mæonia are by most authors indifferently used for one and the same country, yet they are sometimes distinguished; that part where Mount Tmolus stood, watered by the Pactolus, being properly called Mæonia; and the other, lying on the coast, Lydia. This distinction is used by Homer, Callimachus, Dionysius, and other ancient writers. In after ages, when the Ionians, who had planted a colony on the coast of the Egean sea, began to make some figure, that part was called Ionia, and the name of Lydia given to the ancient Mæonia.—Lydia, according to Pliny, Ptolemy, and other ancient geographers, was bounded by Myria Major on the north, by Caria on the south, by Phrygia Major on the east, and Ionia on the west, lying between the 37th and 39th degrees of north latitude. What the ancients style the kingdom of Lydia was not confined within these narrow boundaries, but extended from Halys to the Egean sea. Pliny's description includes Æolia, lying between the Hermus and the Caicus.\n\nAs to the origin of the Lydians, Josephus, and after him all the ecclesiastical writers, derive them from Lud, Shem's fourth son; but this opinion has no other foundation than the similitude of names. Some of the ancients will have the Lydians to be a mixed colony of Phrygians, Myrians, and Carians. Others finding some conformity in religion and religious ceremonies between the Egyptians and Taurans who were a Lydian colony, conclude them, without any farther evidence, to be originally Egyptians. All we know for certain is, that the Lydians were a very ancient nation, as is manifest from their very fables; for Atys, Tantalus, Pelops, Niobe, and Arachne, are all said to have been the children of Lydus. And Zanthis in his *Lydiaca*, quoted by Stephanus, informs us, that the ancient city of Alcalon, one of the five fortresses of the Philistines, mentioned in the books of Joshua and the Judges, was built by one Alcalus a Lydian, whom Achiamus king of Lydia had appointed to command a body of troops which he sent, we know not on what occasion, into Syria. The Heraclidae, or kings of Lydia descended from Hercules, began to reign before the Trojan war; and had been preceded by a long series of sovereigns sprung from Atys, and hence styled Atyadae; a strong proof of the antiquity of that kingdom.\n\nThe Lydians began very early to be ruled by kings, whose government seems to have been truly despotic, and the crown hereditary. We read of three distinct races of kings reigning over Lydia, viz. the Atyadae, the Heraclidae, and the Mermadae.\n\nThe Atyadae were so called from Atys the son of Cotys, and grandson of Manes the first Lydian king. But the history of this family is obscure and fabulous.\n\nThe Atyadae were succeeded by the Heraclidae, or the descendants of Hercules. For Hercules being, by the direction of the oracle, sold as a slave to Omphale a queen of Lydia, to expiate the murder of Iphitus, had, during his captivity, by one of her slaves, a son named Cleostratus, whose grandson Argon was the first of the Heraclidae that ascended the throne of Lydia. This race is said to have reigned 505 years, the son succeeding the father for 22 generations. They began to reign about the time of the Trojan war. The last of the family was the unhappy Candaules, who lost both his life and kingdom by his imprudence: An event of which we have the following account by Herodotus. Candaules had a wife whom he passionately loved, and believed the most beautiful of her sex. He extolled her charms to Gyges his favourite, whom he used to intrust with his most important affairs; and the more to convince him of her beauty, resolved to show her to him quite naked: he accordingly placed him in the porch of her chamber where the queen used to undress when she went to bed, ordering him to retire after he should have seen her, and take all possible care not to be observed. But notwithstanding all the caution he could use, she plainly discovered him going out; and though she did not doubt but it was her husband's contrivance, yet she passed that night in a seeming tranquillity, suppressing her resentment till next morning, when she sent for Gyges, and resolutely told him that he must either by his death atone for the criminal action he had been guilty of, or put to death Candaules the contriver of it, and receive both her and the kingdom of Lydia for his reward. Gyges at first earnestly begged of her that she would not drive him to the necessity of such a choice. But finding that he could not prevail with her, and that he must either kill his master or die himself, he chose the former part of the alternative. Being led by the queen to the same place where her husband had posted him the night before, he stabbed the king while he was asleep, married the queen, and took possession of the kingdom, in which he was confirmed by the answer of the Delphic oracle. The Lydians having taken up arms to revenge the death of their prince, an agreement was made between them and the followers of Gyges, that if the oracle should declare him to be lawful king of Lydia, he should be permitted to reign; if not, he should resign the crown to the Heraclidae. The answer of the oracle proving favourable to Gyges, he was universally acknowledged for lawful king of Lydia. Candaules is said to have purchased a picture painted by Bularchas, representing a battle of the Magnetes, for its weight in gold; a circumstance which shows how early the art of painting began to be in request, for Candaules was contemporary with Romulus.\n\nGyges having thus possessed himself of the kingdom of Lydia, sent many rich and valuable presents to the oracle of Delphi, among others, six cups of gold weighing 30 talents, and greatly esteemed for the workmanship. He made war on Miletus and Smyrna, took the city of Colophon, and subdued the whole country of Troas. In his reign, and by his permission, the city of Abdyus was built by the Milesians. Plutarch and other writers relate his accession to the crown of Lydia in a quite different manner, and tells us, without making any mention of the queen, that Gyges rebelled against Candaules and slew him in an engagement. In Gyges began the third race\nrace called Mermnadie; who were also properly speaking, Heracidae, being descended from a son of Hercules by Omphale. Gyges reigned 38 years, and was succeeded by his son Ardyes.\n\nThis prince carried on the war against the Milesians which his father had begun, and possessed himself of Priene, in those days a strong city. In his reign the Cimmerians invaded and overran all Asia Minor; but what battles were fought between the Lydians and these invaders, and with what success, we find nowhere mentioned. Herodotus only informs us, that in the time of Ardyes they possessed themselves of Sardis, the metropolis of Lydia, but could never reduce the castle. Ardyes reigned 49 years, and was succeeded by his son Alyattes, who reigned 12 years, and waged most part of his reign with the Milesians.\n\nAfter him came his son Alyattes, who for the space of five years continued the war which his father had begun against the Milesians, ravaging their country, and about harvest time carrying away all their corn yearly, in order to oblige them, for want of provisions, to surrender their city, which he knew he could not reduce any other way, the Milesians being at that time matters of the sea. In the 12th year of this war the Lydians having set fire to the corn in the fields, the flames were carried by a violent wind, which happened to blow at that time, to the temple of Minerva at Aegaeus, and burnt it down to the ground. Not long after, Alyattes falling sick, sent to consult the oracle at Delphi; which refused to return any answer till such time as the king should rebuild the temple of Minerva at Aegaeus. Alyattes, thus warned, despatched ambassadors to Miletus, enjoining them to conclude a truce with the Milesians till the temple should be rebuilt. On the arrival of the ambassadors, Thrasybulus, then king of Miletus, commanded all the corn that was at that time in the city to be brought into the market-place, ordering the citizens to banquet in public, and revel as if the city were plentifully stored with all manner of provisions. This stratagem Thrasybulus practised, to the end that the ambassadors seeing such quantities of corn, and the people everywhere diverting themselves, might acquaint their master with their affluence, and divert him from pursuing the war. As Thrasybulus had designed, so it happened; for Alyattes, who believed the Milesians greatly disheartened for provisions, receiving a different account from his ambassadors, changed the truce into a lasting peace, and ever afterwards lived in amity and friendship with Thrasybulus and the Milesians. He was succeeded, after a reign of 57 years, by his son Croesus, whose uninterrupted prosperity, in the first years of his reign, far eclipsed the glory of all his predecessors. He was the first that made war on the Ephesians, whose city he besieged and took notwithstanding their consecrating it to Diana, and fastening the walls by a rope to her temple, which was seven stadia distant from the city. After the reduction of Ephesus he attacked, under various pretences, the Ionians and Aeolians, obliging them, and all the other Greek states of Asia, to pay him a yearly tribute. Having met with such extraordinary success by land, the Lydian prince determined to render his power equally conspicuous by sea. For this purpose he thought seriously of equipping a fleet; with which he purposed to invade and conquer the Grecian islands directly fronting his dominions. But this design, which, considering the slow progress in maritime power among the nations most diligent to attain it, would probably have failed of success, was prevented by the advice of a philosophical traveller conveyed in such a lively turn of wit, as easily changed the resolution of the king. Bias of Priene in Ionia, some say Pittacus of Mitylene in the isle of Lesbos, while he travelled after the Grecian custom, from curiosity and a love of knowledge, was presented to Croesus at the Lydian court; and being asked by that prince what news from Greece; he answered with a republican freedom, that the islanders had collected powerful squadrons of cavalry with an intention of invading Lydia. \"May the gods grant (said Croesus), that the Greeks, who are unacquainted with horsemanship, should attack the disciplined valour of the Lydian cavalry; there would soon be an end to the contest.\" \"In the same manner (replied Bias), as if the Lydians, who are totally unexperienced in naval affairs, should invade the Grecians by sea.\" Struck by the acuteness of this unexpected observation, Croesus desisted from his intended expedition against the islands, and instead of employing new means for extending his conquests, determined peaceably to enjoy the laurels which he had won, and to display the grandeur which he had attained. But his happiness was soon after allayed by the death of his favourite son Atys, who was unfortunately killed at the chase of a wild boar. For this loss he continued disconsolate for two years and in a state of inaction, till the conquests of Cyrus, and growing power of the Persians, rouled up his martial spirit, and diverted his mind to other thoughts. He apprehended that the success which attended Cyrus in all his undertakings, might at last prove dangerous to himself, and therefore resolved to put a stop, if possible, to his progress. In taking this resolution, which might probably be attended with the most important consequences, he was desirous to learn the will of heaven concerning the issue of the war. The principal oracles which he consulted were those of Branchis in Ionia, of Hammon in Libya, and of Delphi in Greece. Among these respected shrines, the oracle of Delphi maintained its ascendant, as the most faithful interpreter of fate. Croesus was fully persuaded of its veracity; and desirous generously to compensate for the trouble which he had already given, and still meant to give, the priests of Apollo, he sacrificed 3000 oxen to the god, and adorned his shrine with dedications equally valuable for the workmanship and for the materials; precious vessels of silver, ewers of iron beautifully inlaid and enamelled; various ornaments of pure gold, particularly a golden lion weighing ten talents, and a female figure three cubits or near five feet high. In return for these magnificent presents, the oracle, in ambiguous language, flattered Croesus with obtaining an easy victory over his enemies, and with enjoying a long life and a prosperous reign. The god at the same time enjoined him to contract an alliance with the most powerful of the Grecian states.\n\nElevated with these favourable predictions of Apollo, Croesus prepared to yield a ready obedience to the only condition required on his part for the accomplishment of his aspiring purpose. Not deeming himself sufficiently acquainted with the affairs of Greece,\nto know what particular republic was meant by the oracle, he made particular inquiry of those best informed concerning the state of Europe; and discovered, that among all the members of the Grecian confederacy, the Athenians and Lacedemonians were justly entitled to the pre-eminence. In order to learn which of these communities deserved the epithet of most powerful, it was necessary to send ambassadors into Greece.\n\nThe Lydians despatched with this important commission, soon discovered that the Athenians after having been long harassed by internal dissensions, were actually governed by the tyrant Pitilatus. The Spartans, on the other hand, though anciently the worst regulated of all the Grecian communities, had enjoyed domestic peace and foreign prosperity ever since they had adopted the wise institutions of Lycurgus. After that memorable period, they had repeatedly conquered the warlike Argives, triumphed over the hardy Arcadians; and notwithstanding the heroic exploits of Aristomenes, subdued and enslaved their unfortunate rivals of Melcene. To the Lydian ambassadors therefore, the Spartan republic appeared to be pointed out by the oracle as the community whose alliance they were enjoined to solicit. Having repaired accordingly to Sparta, they were introduced not only to the kings and senate, but, as the importance of the negotiation required, to the general assembly of the Lacedemonians, to whom they, in few words, declared the object of their commission; \"We are sent, O Lacedemonians! by Croesus, king of the Lydians and of many other nations, who being commanded by the oracle of Apollo to seek the friendship of the most powerful people of Greece, now summons you, who justly merit that epithet, to become his faithful allies, in obedience to the will of the god whose authority you acknowledge.\"\n\nThe Lacedemonians, pleased with the alliance of a warlike king, and still more with the fame of their valour, readily accepted the proposal. To the strict connexion of an offensive and defensive league, they joined the more respected ties of sacred hospitality. A few years before this transaction, they had sent to purchase gold at Sardis for making a statue of Apollo. Croesus had on that occasion gratuitously supplied their want. Remembering this generosity, they gave the Lydian ambassadors at their departure, as a present for their master, a vessel of brass containing 300 amphoras (above 12 hogsheads), and beautifully carved on the outside with various forms of animals.\n\nCroesus, having thus happily accomplished the design recommended by the oracle, was eager to set out upon his intended expedition. He had formerly entered into alliance with Amasis king of Egypt, and Labynetus king of Babylon. He had now obtained the friendship of the most warlike nation of Europe. The newly raised power of Cyrus and the Persians seemed incapable of resisting such a formidable confederacy.\n\nElevated with these flattering ideas of his own invincible greatness, Croesus waited not to attack the Persian dominions until he had collected the strength of his allies. The sanguine impetuosity of his temper, unexperienced in adversity, unfortunately precipitated him into measures no less ruinous than daring. Attended only by the arms of Lydia, and a numerous band of mercenaries, whom his immense wealth enabled him at any time to call into his service, he marched towards the river Halys; and having crossed with much difficulty that deep and broad stream, entered the province of Cappadocia, which formed the western frontier of the Median dominions. That unfortunate country soon experienced all the calamities of invasion. The Pterian plain, the most beautiful and the most fertile district of Cappadocia, was laid waste; the ports of the Euxine, as well as several inland cities, were plundered; and the inoffensive inhabitants were either put to the sword or dragged into captivity. Encouraged by the unchilling fortitude of the natives of those parts, Croesus was eager to push forwards; and if Cyrus did not previously meet him in the field, he had determined to proceed in triumph to the mountains of Persia. Against this dangerous resolution he was in vain exhorted by a Lydian named Sandanis; who, when asked his opinion of the war, declared it with that freedom which the princes of the east have in every age permitted, amidst all the pride and caprices of despotic power, to men distinguished by the gifts of nature or education. \"You are preparing, O king, to march against a people who lead a laborious and a miserable life; whose daily subsistence is often denied them, and is always scanty and precarious; who drink only water, and who are clothed with the skins of wild beasts. What can the Lydians gain by the conquest of Persia; they who enjoy all the advantages of which the Persians are deprived? For my part, I deem it a blessing of the gods, that they have not excited the warlike poverty of these miserable barbarians to invade and plunder the luxurious wealth of Lydia.\" The moderation of this advice was rejected by the fatal presumption of Croesus; who confounding the dictates of experienced wisdom with the mean suggestions of pusillanimity, dismissed the counsellor with contempt.\n\nMeanwhile, the approach of Cyrus, who was hot of a temper to permit his dominions to be ravaged with impunity, afforded the Lydian king an opportunity of bringing the war to a more speedy issue than by his intended expedition into Persia. The army of Cyrus gradually augmented on his march: the tributary princes cheerfully contributing with their united strength towards the assistance of a master whose valour and generosity they admired, and who now took arms to protect the safety of his subjects, as well as to support the grandeur of his throne. Such was the rapidity of his movement, especially after being informed of the destructive ravages of the enemy in Cappadocia, that he arrived from the shores of the Caopian to those of the Euxine sea before the army of Croesus had provided the necessaries for their journey. That prince, when apprised of the neighbourhood of the Persians, encamped on the Pterian plain; Cyrus likewise encamped at no great distance; frequent skirmishes happened between the light troops; and at length a general engagement was fought with equal fury and perseverance, and only terminated by the darkness of night. The loss on both sides hindered a renewal of the battle. The numbers, as well as the courage of the Persians, much exceeded the expectation of Croesus. As they discovered not any intention to harass his retreat, he determined to move back towards Sardis, to spend the winter in the amusements of his palace.\nlace; and after summoning his numerous allies to his standard, to take the field early in the spring with such increase of force as seemed sufficient to overpower the Persians.\n\nBut this design was defeated by the careful vigilance of Cyrus. That experienced leader allowed the enemy to retire without molestation; carefully informing himself of every step which they took, and of every measure which they seemed determined to pursue. Patiently watching the opportunity of a just revenge, he waited until Croesus had re-entered his capital, and had disbanded the foreign mercenaries, who composed the most numerous division of his army. It then seemed the proper time for Cyrus to put his Persians in motion; and such was his celerity, that he brought the first news of his own arrival in the plain of Sardis. Croesus, whose firmness might well have been shaken by the imminence of this unforeseen danger, was not wanting on the present occasion to the duties which he owed to his fame and the lustre of the Lydian throne. Though his mercenaries were disbanded, his own subjects, who served him from attachment, who had been long accustomed to victory, and who were animated with a high sense of national honour, burned with a desire of enjoying an opportunity to check the daring insolence of the invaders. Croesus indulged and encouraged this generous ardour. The Lydians in that age fought on horseback, armed with long spears; the strength of the Persians consisted in infantry. They were so little accustomed to the use of horses, that camels were almost the only animals which they employed as beasts of burden. This circumstance suggested to a Mede, by name Harpagus, a stratagem, which being communicated to Cyrus, was immediately adopted with approbation by that prince. Harpagus, having observed that horses had a strong aversion to the shape and smell of camels, advised the Persian army to be drawn up in the following order: All the camels which had been employed to carry baggage and provisions were collected into one body, arranged in a long line fronting the Lydian cavalry. The foot soldiers of the Persians were posted immediately behind the line, and placed at a due distance. The Median horse (for a few squadrons of these followed the standard of Cyrus) formed the rear of the army. As the troops on both sides approached to join battle, the Lydian cavalry, terrified at the unusual appearance of the camels, mounted with men in arms, were thrown into disorder, and turning their heads, endeavoured to escape from the field. Croesus, who perceived the confusion, was ready to despair of his fortune; but the Lydians, abandoning their horses, prepared with uncommon bravery to attack the enemy on foot. Their courage deserved a better fate; but unaccustomed as they were to this mode of fighting, they were received and repelled by the experienced valour of the Persian infantry, and obliged to take refuge within the fortified strength of Sardis, where they imagined themselves secure. The walls of that city bid defiance to the rude art of attack, as then practised by the most warlike nations. If the Persian army should invest it, the Lydians were provided with provisions for several years; and there was reason to expect, that in a few months, and even weeks, they would receive such assistance from Egypt, Babylonia, and Greece (to which countries they had already sent ambassadors), as would oblige the Persians to raise the siege.\n\nThe Lydian ministers despatched into Greece met with great sympathy from the Spartans. That people were particularly observant of the faith of treaties; and while they punished their enemies with unexampled severity, they behaved with generous compassion towards those whom they had once accepted as allies. They immediately resolved therefore to send him a speedy and effectual relief; and for this purpose assembled their troops, made ready their vessels, and prepared every thing necessary for the expedition.\n\nThe valour of the Spartans might perhaps have upheld the sinking empire of Lydia; but before their armament could set sail, Croesus was no longer a sovereign. Notwithstanding the strength of Sardis, that city had been taken by storm on the 20th day of the siege; the walls having been scaled in a quarter, which, appearing altogether inaccessible, was too carelessly guarded. This was effected by the enterprise of Hyreades a Mede, who accidentally observed a centinel defend part of the rock in order to recover his helmet. Hyreades was a native of the mountainous province of Mardia, and being accustomed to clamber over the dangerous precipices of his native country, resolved to try his activity in scaling the rock upon which he had discovered the Lydian. The design was more easily accomplished than he had reason to expect: emulation and success encouraged the bravest of the Persians to follow his example; these were supported by greater numbers of their countrymen; the garrison of Sardis was surprized; the citadel stormed; the rich capital of Lower Asia subjected to the vengeful rapacity of an indignant victor. Thus ended the ancient kingdom of Lydia, which continued subject to the Persians till they also were conquered by the Macedonians. For the fate of the Lydian monarch, see the article CROESUS.\n\nLYDIAT, Thomas, a learned English divine, born in 1572, and educated at Oxford. About the year 1609, he became acquainted with Dr James Usher, afterwards archbishop of Armagh, who carried him to Ireland. He was at Dublin college for about two years, after which he returned to England; and the rectory of Alkrington becoming vacant, he was presented to it: but at length, being engaged for the debts of a near relation, which for the present he was unable to pay, having before spent his patrimony in printing several books, he was sent to prison; and was confined at Oxford, in the King's Bench, and elsewhere, till Sir William Bolwell, a generous patron of learned men, Dr Robert Pink, warden of New college, Bishop Usher, and Dr Laud discharged the debt. In the civil wars, he suffered much in his rectory of Alkington from the parliament party; was four times pillaged to the value of at least 70l.; and was forced for a quarter of a year together to borrow a shirt to shift himself. He died in 1646. He wrote some pieces in English, and many works in Latin, on chronology and natural history.\n\nLYDIUS LAPIS, in the natural history of the ancients; the name of the stone used by way of touchstone for the trial of gold and silver, and called by some Heraclius lapis; both of which names were also applied by the ancients to the loadstone; and hence has arisen\nLYGEUM, a genus of plants belonging to the triandria class; and in the natural method ranking under the fourth order, Graminae.

Their name Lugii is conjectured to be derived from their mutually close confederacy or league. The Vistula was their boundary to the north, east, and south, with Mount Aesciburgius to the west. Now the whole of that country lies in Poland, on this side the Vistula.\n\nLYING-IN WOMEN. See MIDWIFERY.\n\nLYING-TO, or Lying-to, the situation of a ship, when she is retarded in her course, by arranging the sails in such a manner as to counteract each other with nearly an equal effort, and render the ship almost immovable, with respect to her progressive motion, or headway. A ship is usually brought-to by the main, and fore top sails, one of which is laid aback, whilst the other is full; so that the latter pushes the ship forward, whilst the former resists this impulse, by forcing her astern. This is particularly practised in a general engagement, when hostile fleets are drawn up in two lines of battle opposite each other. It is also used to wait for some other ship, either approaching or expected; or to avoid pursuing a dangerous course, especially in dark or foggy weather.\n\nLYME-REGIS, a sea port town of Dorsetshire in England, 148 miles from London. It lies near the sea, on the very borders of Devonshire, in a cavity between two rocky hills, which makes it difficult of access. It is about five furlongs long, and contains about 200 houses. As it lies on the declivity of a hill, the houses make a good show, one above another; and some of them are built of freestone, and covered with blue slate. The corporation consists of a mayor (who is justice of peace during his mayoralty and the year after, and in the third year both justice and coroner), a recorder, 15 capital burgesses, and a town clerk. This place had formerly a very flourishing trade to France, Spain, the Straits, Newfoundland, and the West Indies; during which, the customs amounted some years to 16,000l. But it stands on such a high steep rock, that the merchants are obliged to load and unload their goods at a place a quarter of a mile off, called the Cobb, originally built in the reign of Edward III., which costs a great sum to maintain, but forms such a harbour as perhaps is not to be equalled in the world, the ships being sheltered by a high thick stone wall, raised in the main sea a good way from the shore, broad enough for carriages and warehouses, and the customhouse officers have one upon it. The cellars of the low part of the town, near the sea, are however often overflowed by the spring tides 10 or 12 feet. There are guns planted for defence both of the Cobb and the town, the shore here being very proper for batteries. The customhouse stands on pillars, with the corn market under it. There is an alms-house in Church street, also Presbyterian and Anabaptist meeting-houses. The town hall is near Broad-street. The church stands at the east end of the town on a rising ground. The market here is Friday, and there are two fairs in the year. We read, that in 774, the Saxon king Kinwulf gave land hereabouts to the church of Sherborn, for the boiling of salt there to supply its necessities. At this place the duke of Monmouth landed in 1685. A few years ago above 2000l. worth of gold and silver coin of Char. I. and II. were discovered by some labourers.\n\nLYMINGTON, a borough town of Hampshire in England, 97 miles south-west of London. It stands about a mile from the channel running between the main land and the isle of Wight; and has a harbour for vessels of considerable burden. The tide flows near a mile above the town. It has a market on Saturdays, and two fairs in the year; and sends two members to parliament.\n\nLYMPH, a fine colourless fluid, separated in the body from the mals of blood, and contained in peculiar vessels called lymphatics. See ANATOMY.\n\nLYMPHÆA, were artificial caves or grottos amongst the Romans, furnished with a great many tubes, canals, and various hydraulic apparatus, through which the water gushed out upon the spectators unexpectedly whilst they were admiring the beautiful arrangement of the shell-work in the grotto.\n\nLYMPHATI, was a name given by the Romans to such as were seized with madness. It is supposed to be used for Nymphati, because the ancients imagined that every person who had the misfortune to see a Nymph was instantly struck with phrenzy. Nymphati may indeed signify \"madmen,\" as derived from lympha, \"water,\" over which element the Nymphs were thought to preside: But it appears most likely, that distracted people were called lymphati, from the circumstance of madmen's being affected with the hydrophobia or dread of water after the bite of a mad dog; for this peculiarity, in cases of canine madness, was not unknown to the Romans.\n\nLYNCEUS, in fabulous history, one of the 50 sons of Ægeus, married Hypermnestra, one of the 50 daughters of Danaus. See HYPERMESTRA.\n\nLYNCEUS, in fabulous history, one of the Argonauts, who went with Jason in the expedition to obtain the golden fleece. He was of great use to the Argonauts, by enabling them to avoid the sand-banks and rocks they found in their way. The poets say, that Lynceus had so piercing a sight, that it could not only penetrate to the bottom of the sea, but even to hell. Some mythologists suppose, that this tale is taken from Lynceus's skill in observing the stars, and discovering the mines of gold and silver concealed in the earth.\n\nLYNCURIUM, a stone thought to be the same with\nLyncurius, with the tourmalin. The name is derived from ἀγαθός, \"lapis,\" \"lynx,\" and ἀγαθός, \"urine.\"\n\nLYNCURIOUS LAPIS, a stone capable of producing mushrooms.\n\nIn the Ephemerides of the Curious, we find mention made of a stone, so called by Dr John George Wolckamerus, who saw one in Italy, which never ceases to produce in a few days mushrooms of an excellent flavour by the most simple and easy process imaginable. \"It is (says he) of the bigness of an ox's head, rough and uneven on its surface, and on which also are perceived some clefts and crevices. It is black in some parts, and in others of a lighter and grayish colour. Internally it is porous, and nearly of the nature of the pumice-stone, but much heavier; and it contains a small piece of tint, which is so incorporated with it as to appear to have been formed at the same time the stone itself received its form. This gives room to judge, that those stones have been produced by a fat and viscid juice, which has the property of indurating whatever matter it filtrates into. The stone here spoken of, when it has been lightly covered with earth, and sprinkled with warm water, produces mushrooms of an exquisite flavour, which are usually round, sometimes oval, and whose borders, by their inflexions and different curvatures, represent in some measure human ears. The principal colour of these mushrooms is sometimes yellowish, and sometimes of a bright purple; but they are always distinguished with different spots, of a deep orange colour, or red brown; and when these spots are recent, and still in full bloom, they produce a very agreeable effect to the sight. But what appears admirable is, that the part of the stalk which remains adhering to the stone, when the mushroom has been separated from it, grows gradually hard, and petrifies in time, so that it seems that this fungites restores to the stone the nutritive juice it received from it, and that it thus contributes to its increase.\" John Baptist Porta pretends, that this stone is found in several parts of Italy; and that it is not only to be met with at Naples, taken out of Mount Vesuvius, but also on Mount Pantherico, in the principality of Arellino; on Mount Garganus, in Apulia; and on the summits of some other very high mountains. He adds, that the mushrooms which grow on those sorts of stones, and are usually called fungi lyncearii, have the property of dissolving and breaking the stone of the kidneys and bladder; and that, for this purpose, nothing more is required than to dry them in the shade, and being reduced to powder, to make the patient fasting, take a sufficient quantity of this powder in a glass of white wine, which will so cleanse the excretory ducts of the urine, that no stones will ever after be collected in them. As to the form of those mushrooms, their root is stony, uneven, divided according to its longitudinal direction, and composed of fibres as fine as hairs, interwoven one with another. Their form, on first shooting out, resembles a small bladder, scarce then larger than the bud of a vine; and if in this state they are squeezed between the fingers, an acridous subacid liquor issues out. When they are at their full growth, their pedicle is of a finger's length, larger at top than at bottom, and becomes infinitely slenderer in proportion as it is nearer the earth. These mushrooms are also formed in an umbrella, and variegated with an infinity of little specks situated very near one another. Lynn-regis. They are smooth and even on the upper part, but underneath leafy like the common mushrooms. Their taste is likewise very agreeable, and the sick are not debarred eating of them when they have been dressed in a proper manner. Curiosity having prompted some naturalists and physicians to submit these stones to a chemical analysis, in order to be more competent judges of the uses they might be put to in medicine, there first came forth, by distillation, an insipid water, and afterwards a spirituous liquor. The retort having been heated to a certain point, there arose an oil, which had nearly the smell and taste of that of guaiacum; and a very acid salt was extracted from the ashes.\n\nLYNN-REGIS, a town of Norfolk, in England, distant 98 miles from London. It is a handsome, large, well-built place, and sends two members to parliament. It was a borough by prescription in 1298. King John, on account of its adherence to him against the barons, made it a free borough, with large privileges. He appointed it a provost, and gave it a large silver cup of 73 ounces doubly gilt and enamelled, and a large silver sword that is carried before the mayor; though this last, according to some, is Henry VIII.'s sword, which he gave to the town when it came into his hands by exchange with the bishop of Norwich; after which it was called King's Lynn, whereas before it was Bishop's Lynn. Henry III. made it a mayor town, for its serving him against the barons. It has had 15 royal charters; and is governed by a mayor, high-steward, under-steward, recorder, 12 aldermen, and 18 common-council men. It has two churches, besides St Nicholas, a chapel of ease to St Margaret's, a Presbyterian and a Quakers meeting-house, with a bridewell or workhouse, and several almshouses, and a free school. In September 1741 the spires of its two churches were both blown down by a storm of wind; and that of St Margaret's, which was 193 feet in height, having beat in the body of the church, it has been since rebuilt, towards which King George II. gave £1000, and the late earl of Oxford, then Sir Robert Walpole, £500. This church was formerly an abbey, and afterwards one of the largest parish-churches in England. The town-house, called Trinity-hall, is a noble old fabric; and so is the Exchange, which is of free-stone, with two orders of columns. St Nicholas's chapel is very ancient, and reckoned one of the fairest and largest of the kind in England. It has a bell-tower of free-stone, and an octagonal spire over it, both which together are 170 feet from the ground. There is a library in it that was erected by subscription; and there is another at St Margaret's. Here have been formerly several monasteries; but the only fabric remaining that belongs to any religious order is the Gray-friars steeple, a noted landmark. The situation of this town, near the fall of the Ouse into the sea, after having received several other rivers, of which some are navigable, gives it an opportunity of extending its trade into eight different counties; by which many considerable cities and towns, viz. Peterborough, Ely, Stamford, Bedford, St Ives, Huntingdon, St Neot's, Northampton, Cambridge, St Edmundsbury, and the north parts of Bucks, as well as the inland parts of Norfolk and Suffolk, are supplied with heavy goods, not only from our own produce,\nLynn produces, as coals and salt from Newcastle, but also of merchandise imported from abroad, especially wine; of which two articles, viz., coals and wine, this is the greatest port for importation of any place on all the eastern coast of England; and those wherein the Lynn merchants deal more largely than any town in England, except London, Bristol, and Newcastle. In return for this, Lynn receives back all the corn which the counties just mentioned produce, for exportation; and therefore lends more of it abroad than any port except Hull. The foreign trade of the merchants here, is very considerable, especially to Holland, Norway, and the Baltic, and also to Spain and Portugal; and formerly they drove a good trade to France, till it was turned off, by treaties on one hand, and by prohibitions, high duties, &c. on the other, to Spain and Portugal. The harbour is safe when ships are in it, but difficult to enter by reason of the many flats and shoals in the passage; which, however, are well buoyed, and good pilots are always ready. The town consists of about 2400 houses; and appears to have been very strong, by the ruins of the works demolished in the civil wars. St Ann's platform at the north end mounts 12 great guns, and commands all the ships passing near the harbour; and towards the land, besides the wall, there is a ditch. Four rivulets run through the town; and the tide of the Ouse, which is about as broad here as the Thames at London bridge, rises 20 feet perpendicular. In the great market-place a statue was erected in 1686 to the honour of King James II. There is another spacious market-place, adorned with a statue of King William III. and a fine cross with a dome and gallery round it, supported by 16 pillars. The market-house is of free-stone, supported by 16 columns, and is 70 feet high, erected on four steps, neatly adorned with statues, &c. Every first Monday in the month, the mayor, aldermen, preachers, &c. meet to hear and determine all controversies amicably, for preventing law-suits. This was first established in 1588, and is called The Feast of Reconciliation. The markets are on Tuesdays and Saturdays; and it has two fairs; one of which, beginning Feb. 14, lasts for a fortnight, and is called Lynn mart; the other is a cheese fair on Oct. 6. The adherence of this town to King John and to Henry VIII. as above mentioned, are not the only instances of its loyalty to its sovereigns; for, in the late civil wars, it held out for King Charles I. and sustained a formal siege of above 18,000 men of the parliament army for above three weeks; but, for want of relief, was obliged to surrender, and submit to the terms of paying 10s. a-head for every inhabitant, and a month's pay to the soldiers, to save the town from plunder. There are more gentry, and consequently more gaiety, in this town than in Yarmouth or even Norwich; there being such plenty of eatables and drinkables, that Spelman says, Ceres and Bacchus seem to have established their magazines at this place; the east side abounding with corn, sheep, rabbits, hares, &c. the west side with cheese, butter, black cattle, swans, and the wild fowl common to marshes, besides the abundance of sea and river fish; so that he thinks there is no place in Great Britain, if in Europe, has such a variety in so small a compass of ground. At a small distance from the town, stands a mount, called the Lady's or Red Mount, which was once a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary, which was a resting-place for pilgrims on their way towards her convent at Walsingham. The king's stithy-yard, or quay, where the greatest part of the imported wines is landed and put into large vaults, is a handsome square, with brick buildings, in the centre whereof is a statue of King James I. People pass hence into the fen-country, and over the famous walks into Lincolnshire in boats, which are often lost, by venturing out at an improper season and without guides.\n\nLYNX. See Felis, Mammalia Index.\n\nLYON King of Arms. See King; and Law, No. clviii. 16.\n\nThis office is of great antiquity and respect in Scotland; and although the precise time of its institution is unknown, yet it must have been as early as the introduction of armorial figures as hereditary marks of gentility and distinction into this country, which was in the 12th century. His regalia are, a crown of gold, with a crimson velvet cap, a gold taffet, and an ermine lining; a velvet robe reaching to his feet, with the arms of the kingdom embroidered thereon before and behind in the proper tinctures; a triple row of gold chain round his neck, with an oval gold medal pendant thereto, on one side of which is the royal bearing, and on the other St Andrew with his cross enamelled in proper colours, and a baton of gold enamelled green, powdered with the badges of the kingdom. The lord lyon's rank is superior to that of any other king of arms, as he holds his office immediately from the sovereign by commission under the great seal; whereas the kings of arms in England are deputies to the earl marshal, and act under his authority. Formerly Scotland was divided into two provinces, the one on the north and the other on the south side of Forth; and these provinces were under the management of two deputies appointed by the lord lyon, to superintend the execution of all the business of his office. Before the Revolution, the lord lyon, at his admission into office, was most solemnly crowned by the sovereign or his commissioner, in presence of the nobility, the officers of state, and other great men, after a suitable sermon preached in the royal chapel; and his crown was of the same form with the imperial crown of the kingdom. On solemn occasions he wears the regalia above described; at all other times he wears the oval gold medal or badge on his breast, suspended by a broad green ribbon. He has the absolute disposal of all the offices in his own court, and of the heralds and pursuants places. The messengers at arms throughout Scotland are also created by him, and are amenable to his jurisdiction. And the powers vested in him by his commission are the same with those of the sovereign in all matters relative to the marks of gentility.\n\nLYONET, Peter, an ingenious naturalist, and member of several learned societies, was born at Maastricht, and was descended from a very ancient and respectable family of Lorraine. He had scarcely attained his seventh year before he displayed an uncommon strength and agility in all bodily exercises; but he was not less diligent in the improvement of his mind. Being placed at the Latin school, he learned chronology, and exercised himself in Latin, Greek, and French poetry, as also in Hebrew, logic, and the Cartesian physics. He was particularly fond of the study of languages,\nLyonet, whereof he understood no less than nine, living and dead. Having entered the university of Leyden, he studied the Newtonian philosophy, geometry, algebra, &c.; but his father (who was a clergyman), desiring he should attach himself to divinity, he reluctantly abandoned the former studies, as his passion for them was not easily to be overcome. He at the same time applied himself to anatomy, and also to music and drawing. He began afterwards to practise sculpture; and performed several pieces in wood, some of which are preserved, and have been greatly admired by the artists. After this, he betook himself to drawing portraits of his friends from life; wherein, after three or four months practice, he became a great proficient. Having attained the degree of candidate in divinity, he resolved to study law, to which he applied himself with so much zeal, that he was promoted at the end of the first year. Arrived at the Hague, he undertook the study of deciphering; and became secretary of the cyphers, translator of the Latin and French languages, and patent-master to their High Mightinesses. Meanwhile, having taken a strong liking to the study of insects, he undertook an historical description of such as are found about the Hague, and to that end collected materials for several volumes; and having invented a method of drawing adapted thereto, he enriched this work with a great number of plates, universally admired by all the connoisseurs who had seen them. In the year 1724 was printed at the Hague a French translation of a German work, the 'Theology of Insects,' by Mr Leffler. Love of truth engaged Mr Lyonet to defer the publication of his above-mentioned description, and to make some observations on that work, to which he has added two most beautiful plates, engraved from his designs. This performance caused his merit to be universally known and admired. The celebrated M. de Reaumur had the above translation reprinted at Paris, not so much on account of the work itself as of Mr Lyonet's observations; and bestowed on it, as did also many other authors, the highest encomiums. He afterwards executed drawings of the fresh water polypus for Mr Trembley's beautiful work, 1734. The ingenious Wandelaar had engraved the first five plates; when Mr Lyonet, who had never witnessed this operation, concerned at the difficulties he experienced in getting the remaining eight finished in the superior style he required, resolved to perform the task himself. He accordingly took a lesson of one hour of Mr Wandelaar, engraved three or four small plates, and immediately began upon the work himself, which he performed in such a manner as drew on him the highest degree of praise, both from Mr Trembley and from many other artists, particularly the celebrated Van Gool; who declared that the performance astonished not only the amateurs, but also the most experienced artists. In 1748 he was chosen member of the Royal Society of London. In 1749 he began (by mere chance) his amazing collection of horns and shells, which, according to the universal testimony of all travellers and amateurs who have visited it, is at present the most beautiful, and certainly one of the most valuable, in Europe. In 1753 he became member of the newly-established Dutch Society of Sciences at Haarlem; and in 1757, after the celebrated M. le Cat, professor in anatomy and surgery, and member of almost all the principal societies in Europe, had been Mr Lyonet's incomparable Traité Anatomique de la Chenille qui roule le Bois de Saule, with the drawings belonging to it (which work was afterwards published), he was elected member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Rome, whereof M. le Cat was perpetual secretary. After the publication of this treatise, he became, in 1760, member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin; in 1761, of the Imperial Academy of Naturalists; and, in 1762, of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St Peterburgh. In order to enable such as might be desirous of following him in his intricate and most astonishing discoveries respecting the structure of this animal, Mr Lyonet published, in the Transactions of the Dutch Society of Sciences at Haarlem, a description and a plate (as he also afterwards did in French at the beginning of his Traité Anatomique) of the instrument and tools he had invented for the purpose of dissection, and likewise of the method he used to ascertain the degree of strength of his magnifying glasses. Notwithstanding all this labour, which was considerably increased by the extensive correspondence which he for many years carried on with several learned and respectable personages, he still found means to set apart a large proportion of his time (as he himself mentions it in his preface) for the immediate service of his country; but was not fortunate enough (as appears by his writings) to get any other recompense for his exertions than sorrow and disappointment. During the last fifteen or twenty years of his life, Mr Lyonet added to the valuable treasure he had already collected of natural curiosities, a most superb cabinet of paintings, consisting of more than 560 performances; among which are many of the most eminent works of the first Dutch masters. He did this with a view to procure himself some amusement during the latter part of his life, when old age and infirmities must weaken his powers, and yet bounds to his activity. He had always indeed accustomed himself to employment, inasmuch that he has written some pieces of Dutch poetry; and this disposition remained with him till within a fortnight of his death, when he was attacked with an inflammation in his breast, which, though apparently cured, was, in the end, the cause of his dissolution. He died at the Hague in January 1789, aged 83 years, leaving behind him a most estimable character.\n\nLYONOIS, a large province of France; bounded on the north by Burgundy; on the east, by Dauphiny, Brie, and the principality of Dombes; on the south, by Vivarais and Velay; and on the west by Auvergne and a small part of Bourbonnais. It comprehends Lower Lyonois, Beaujolois, and Forez; and it produces corn, wine, fruits, and more especially excellent chestnuts. The principal rivers are the Saone, the Rhone, and the Loire. Lyons is the capital town.\n\nLYONS, a large, rich, handsome, ancient, and famous town of France, being the most considerable in the kingdom, next to Paris, with an archbishop's see, an academy of sciences and belles lettres, and an academy of arts and sciences settled here in 1736. It is seated in the centre of Europe, on the confluence of the\nthe rivers Rhone and Saone: on the side of it are two high mountains; and the mountain of St Sebastian serves as a bulwark against the north winds, which often blow here with great violence. It contains about 150,000 inhabitants; and the houses, in general, are high and well built. It has six gates, and as many suburbs. The town-house, the arsenal, the amphitheatre built by the ancient Romans, the hospital, and the numerous palaces, are worthy of a traveller's attention. The cathedral is a superb structure, and the canons that compose the chapter are all persons of distinction. It is a place of very great trade, which is extended through Europe. It derives vast advantages from the rivers near it; and is situated in E. Long. 4° 55'. N. Lat. 45° 40'. Lyons was the scene of some of the horrid transactions of the French revolution. See France.\n\nLYRA, a species of fish. See Callyonimus, Ichthyology Index.\n\nLYRA, in Astronomy, a constellation in the northern hemisphere. The number of its stars, in Ptolemy's catalogue, is ten; in Tycho's eleven; in Hevelius's seventeen; and in the Britannic catalogue twenty-one.\n\nLYRE, a musical instrument of the stringed kind, much used by the ancients.\n\nConcerning the number of strings with which this instrument was furnished, there is great controversy. Some assert it to be only three; and that the sounds of the two remote were acute, and that of the intermediate one a mean between those two extremes; that Mercury, the inventor, resembled those three chords as many seasons of the year, which were all that the Greeks reckoned, namely, summer, winter, and spring: affixing the acute to the first, the grave to the second, and the mean to the third.\n\nOthers assert that the lyre had four strings; that the interval between the first and the fourth was an octave; that the second was a fourth from the first, and the fourth the same distance from the third, and that from the second to the third was a tone.\n\nAnother class of writers contend that the lyre of Mercury had seven strings. Nicomachus, a follower of Pythagoras, and the chief of them, gives the following account of the matter: \"The lyre made of the shell was invented by Mercury; and the knowledge of it, as it was constructed by him of seven strings, was transmitted to Orpheus: Orpheus taught the use of it to Thamyris and Linus; the latter of whom taught it to Hercules, who communicated it to Amphion the Theban, who built the seven gates of Thebes to the seven strings of the lyre.\" The same author proceeds to relate, \"That Orpheus was afterwards killed by the Thracian women; and that they are reported to have cast his lyre into the sea, which was afterwards thrown up at Antissa, a city of Lesbos: that certain fishers finding it, they brought it to Terpander, who carried it into Egypt, exquisitely improved, and, showing it to the Egyptian priests, assumed to himself the honour of its invention.\"\n\nThis difference among authors seem to have arisen from their confounding together the Egyptian and the Grecian Mercuries.—The invention of the primitive lyre with three strings was due to the first Egyptian Hermes, as mentioned under that article.—The lyre attributed to the Grecian Mercury is described by almost all the poets to be an instrument of seven strings. Vincenzio Galilei has collected the various opinions of the several Greek writers who have mentioned the invention of the chelys or teftudo; and the late Mr Spence has done the same in a very circumstantial but ludicrous manner. \"Horace talks of Mercury as a wonderful musician, and represents him with a lyre. There is a ridiculous old legend relating to this invention, which informs us, that Mercury, after stealing some bulls from Apollo, retired to a secret grotto, which he used to frequent, at the foot of a mountain in Arcadia. Just as he was going in, he found a tortoise feeding at the entrance of his cave: he killed the poor creature, and perhaps ate the flesh of it. As he was diverting himself with the shell, he was mightily pleased with the noise it gave from its concave figure. He had possibly been cunning enough to find out, that a thong pulled strait and fastened at each end, when struck with the finger, made a sort of musical sound. However that was, he went immediately to work, and cut several thongs out of the hides he had lately stolen, and fastened them as tight as he could to the shell of this tortoise; and, in playing with them, made a new kind of music with them to divert himself in his retreat.\" This, considered only as an account of the first invention of the lyre, is not altogether so unnatural.\n\nThe most ancient representations of this instrument agree very well with the account of its invention: the lyre, in particular on the old celestial globes, was represented as made of one entire shell of a tortoise; and that of Amphion in the celebrated group of the Dirce or Toro, in the Farnese palace at Rome, which is of Greek sculpture, and very high antiquity, is figured in the same manner.\n\nThere have, however, been many other claimants to the seven-stringed lyre. For though Mercury invented this instrument in the manner already related, it is said he afterwards gave it to Apollo, who was the first that played upon it with method, and made it the constant companion of poetry. According to Homer's account of this transaction, in his hymn to Mercury, it was given by that god to Apollo, as a peace-offering and indemnification for the oxen which he had stolen from him:\n\nTo Phoebus Maia's son presents the lyre,\nA gift intended to appease his ire,\nThe god receives it gladly, and essays\nThe novel instrument a thousand ways;\nWith dextrous skill the plectrum wields; and sings\nWith voice accordant to the trembling strings,\nSuch strains as gods and men approv'd, from whence\nThe sweet alliance sprung of sound and sense.\n\nDiodorus informs us, that Apollo soon repenting of the cruelty with which he had treated Marlyas in consequence of their musical contest, broke the strings of the lyre, and by that means put a stop for a time to any further progress in the practice of that new instrument. \"The Muses (adds he) afterwards added to this instrument the string called mefe; Linus, that of lichanoss; and...\"\nand Orpheus and Thamyris, those strings which are named hypate and parhypate (A).\n\nAgain, Many ancient and respectable authors tell us, that, before the time of Terpander, the Grecian lyre had only four strings; and, if we may believe Suidas, it remained in this state 856 years, from the time of Amphion, till Terpander added to it three new strings, which extended the musical scale to a heptachord, or seventh, and supplied the player with two conjoint tetrachords. It was about 150 years after this period, that Pythagoras is said to have added an eighth string to the lyre, in order to complete the octave, which consisted of two disjoint tetrachords.\n\nBoetius gives a different history of the scale, and tells us, that the system did not long remain in such narrow limits as a tetrachord. Chorœbus, the son of Athis, or Atys, king of Lydia, added a fifth string; Hyagnis, a sixth; Terpander, a seventh; and at length Lycaon of Samos, an eighth. But all these accounts are irreconcilable with Homer's hymn to Mercury, where the chelys, or teftudo, the invention of which he ascribes to that god, is said to have had seven strings.\n\nThere are many claimants among the musicians of ancient Greece to the strings that were afterwards added to these, by which the scale, in the time of Aristozenus, was extended to two octaves. Athenæus, more than once, speaks of the nine-stringed instrument; and Ion of Chios, a tragic and lyric poet and philosopher, who first recited his pieces in the 82nd Olympiad, 452 B.C., mentions, in some verses quoted by Euclid, the ten-stringed lyre; a proof that the third conjoint tetrachord was added to the scale in his time, which was about 50 years after Pythagoras is supposed to have constructed the octachord.\n\nThe different claimants among the Greeks to the same musical discoveries, only prove that music was cultivated in different countries, and that the inhabitants of each country invented and improved their own instruments, some of which happening to resemble those of other parts of Greece, rendered it difficult for historians to avoid attributing the same invention to different persons. Thus the single flute was given to Minerva and to Maryas; the syrinx or fiftula, to Pan and to Cybele; and the lyre or cithara, to Mercury, Apollo, Amphion, Linus, and Orpheus. Indeed, the mere addition of a string or two to an instrument without a neck, was so obvious and easy, that it is scarce possible not to conceive many people to have done it at the same time.\n\nWith respect to the form of the ancient lyre, as little agreement is to be found among authors as about the number of strings. The best evidences concerning it, are the representations of that instrument in the hands of ancient statues, bas-reliefs, &c. See Plate CCXCVIII, where,\n\nFig. 1. is a representation of the teftudo, or lyre of Amphion, in front, as it appears on the base of the celebrated Toro Farnese at Rome. This admirable work, consisting of four figures bigger than the life, besides the toro or bull, was found in Caracalla's baths, where the Farnese Hercules was likewise discovered; and, except the Laocoön, is the only piece of Greek sculpture mentioned by Pliny that is now remaining. The two projections near the bottom, seem to have been fastenings for the strings, and to have answered the purpose of tail-pieces in modern instruments.\n\n2. The lyre held by Terpsichore, in the picture of that muse dug out of Herculaneum.\n\n3. The Abyssinian teftudo, or lyre in use at present in the province of Tigre, from a drawing of Mr Bruce, communicated to Dr Burney. \"This instrument (says he) has sometimes five, sometimes six, but most frequently seven strings, made of the thongs of raw sheep or goat skins, cut extremely fine, and twisted; they rot soon, are very subject to break in dry weather, and have scarce any sound in wet. From the idea, however, of this instrument being to accompany and sustain a voice, one would think that it was better mounted formerly. \"The Abyssinians have a tradition, that the fisirum, lyre, and tambourine, were brought from Egypt into Ethiopia, by Thot, in the very first ages of the world. The flute, kettle-drum, and trumpet, they say, were brought from Palestine, with Menelek, the son of their queen of Saba by Solomon, who was their first Jewish king.\n\n\"The lyre in Amharic is called beg, 'the sheep; in Ethiopic it is called mefinko; the verb fuko signifies to strike strings with the fingers: no plectrum is ever used in Abyssinia; so that mefinko, being literally interpreted, will signify the 'stringed instrument played upon with the fingers.'\n\n\"The sides which constitute the frame of the lyre, were anciently composed of the horns of an animal of the goat kind, called agazen, about the size of a small cow, and\n\n(A) It has been already related, that the lyre invented by the Egyptian Mercury had but three strings; and, by putting these two circumstances together, Dr Burney observes, we may perhaps acquire some knowledge of the progress of music, or, at least, of the extension of its scale, in the highest antiquity.\n\nMefe, in the Greek music, is the fourth sound of the second tetrachord of the great system, and first tetrachord invented by the ancients, answering to our A, on the fifth line in the base. If this sound then was added to the former three, it proves two important points; firstly, that the most ancient tetrachord was that from E in the base to A; and that the three original strings in the Mercurian and Apollonian lyre were tuned E, F, G, which the Greeks called Hypate Mefon, Parhypate Mefon, Mefon Diatonos. The addition therefore of Mefe to these, completed the first and most ancient tetrachord, E, F, G, A.\n\nThe string Lichanor, then, being added to these, and answering to our D on the third line in the base, extended the compass downwards, and gave the ancient lyre a regular series of five sounds in the Doric mode, the most ancient of all the Greek modes; and the two strings call Hypate and Parhypate, corresponding with our B and C in the base, completed the heptachord, or seven sounds, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, a compass that received no addition till after the time of Pindar, who calls the instrument then in use the seven-longued lyre.\nand common in the province of Tigre. I have seen several of these instruments very elegantly made of such horns, which nature seems to have shaped on purpose. Some of the horns of an African species of this animal may be seen in M. Buffon's history of the king of France's cabinet. They are bent, and less regular than the Abyssinian; but after fire-arms became common in the province of Tigre, and the woods were cut down, this animal being more scarce, the lyre has been made of a light red wood; however, it is always cut into a spiral twisted form, in imitation of the ancient materials of which the lyre was composed. The drawing I send you was one of these instruments made of wood.\n\n\"The kingdom of Tigre, which is the largest and most populous province of Abyssinia, and was during many ages the seat of the court, was the first which received letters, and civil religious government; it extended once to the Red Sea: various reasons and revolutions have obliged the inhabitants to resign their sea coast to different barbarous nations, Pagan and Mahometan: while they were possessed of it, they say that the Red Sea furnished them with tortoise-shells, of which they made the bellies of their lyres, as the Egyptians did formerly, according to Apollodorus and Lucian; but having now lost that resource, they have adopted in its place a particular species of gourd, or pumpkin, very hard and thin in the bark, still imitating with the knife the squares, compartments, and figure of the shell of the tortoise.\n\n\"The lyre is generally from three feet to three feet six inches high; that is, from a line drawn through the point of the horns, to the lower part of the base of the sounding board. It is exceedingly light, and easy of carriage, as an instrument should naturally be in so rugged and mountainous a country.\n\n\"When we consider the parts which compose this lyre, we cannot deny it the earliest antiquity. Man in his first state was a hunter and a fisher, and the oldest instrument was that which partakes most of that state. The lyre, composed of two principal pieces, owes the one to horns of an animal, the other to the shell of a fish.\n\n\"It is probable, that the lyre continued with the Ethiopians in this rude state as long as they confined themselves to their rainy, steep, and rugged mountains; and afterwards, when many of them descended along the Nile into Egypt, its portability would recommend it in the extreme heats and weariness of their way. Upon their arrival in Egypt, they took up their habitation in caves, in the sides of mountains, which are inhabited to this day. Even in these circumstances, an instrument larger than the lyre must have been inconvenient and liable to accidents in those caverns; but when these people increased in numbers and courage, they ventured down into the plain, and built Thebes. Being now at their ease, and in a fine climate, all nature smiling around them, music and other arts were cultivated and refined, and the imperfect lyre was extended into an instrument of double its compass and volume. The size of the harp could be now no longer an objection; the Nile carried the inhabitants everywhere easily, and without effort; and we may naturally suppose in the fine evenings of that country, that the Nile was the favourite scene upon which this instrument was practised; at least the sphinx and lotus upon its head, seem to hint that it was someway connected with the overflows of that river.\" See Harp.\n\n4. An Etruscan lyre, with seven strings, in the collection of Etruscan, Greek and Roman antiquities, published from the cabinet of the Hon. Sir William Hamilton, Vol I. Naples 1766. Plate CIX. With respect to this instrument, it is worthy of observation, that though the vase upon which it is represented is of such indubitable and remote antiquity, the tail-piece, bridge, belly, and sound-holes, have a very modern appearance, and manifest a knowledge in the construction of musical instruments among the Etruscans superior to that of the Greeks and Romans in much latter times. The lower part of the instrument has much the appearance of an old bass-viol, and it is not difficult to discover in it more than the embryo of the whole violin family. The strings lie round, as if intended to be played on with a bow; and even the cross lines on the tail-piece are such as we frequently see on the tail-pieces of old violins.\n\n5. The Tripodian lyre of Pythagoras the Zacynthian, from a bas-relief in the Maffei palace at Rome representing the whole choir of the muses. Athenaeus gives the following account of this extraordinary instrument, Lib. XIV. cap. xv. p. 637. Many ancient instruments are recorded (says Artemon), of which we have so little knowledge, that we can hardly be certain of their existence; such as the tripod of Pythagoras the Zacynthian, which, on account of its difficulty, continued in use but a short time. It resembled in form the Delphic tripod, whence it had its name. The legs were equidistant, and fixed upon a moveable base that was turned by the foot of the player: the strings were placed between the legs of the stool; the vase at the top served for the purpose of a sound-board, and the strings of the three sides of the instrument were tuned to three different modes, the Doric, Lydian, and Phrygian. The performer sat on a chair made on purpose: striking the strings with the fingers of the left hand, and using the plectrum with the right, at the same time turning the instrument with his foot to whichever of the three modes he pleased: so that by great practice he was enabled to change the modes with such velocity, that those who did not see him would imagine they heard three different performers playing in three different modes. After the death of this admirable musician, no other instrument of the same kind was ever constructed.\"\n\n6.

At 15, he went to Thurion, a colony of the Athenians; and when grown up, assisted in the administration of the government there many years. When about 47 years of age, he returned to Athens; whence, being afterwards banished by the 30 tyrants, he went to Megara. Upon his return, Thrasybulus would have had him employed again in state matters; but this not taking place, he spent the remainder of his life as a private man. He was very familiar with Socrates, and other illustrious philosophers. He professed to teach the art of speaking; not that he pleaded at the bar himself, but he supplied others with speeches. \"Fuit Lyfias in causis forentibus non veratus (says Cicero), sed egregie subtilis scripior atque elegans,\" &c. Quinilian calls him, \"subtilis atque elegant, et quo nihil, si erat oratoris satius fit docere, quaerat perfectius.

His grand statue of the Sun represented in a car drawn by four horses, was worshipped at Rhodes. He made several statues of Alexander and his favourites, which were brought to Rome by Metellus after he had reduced the Macedonian empire; and the statue of a man wiping and anointing himself after bathing, being particularly excellent, was placed by Agrippa before his baths in that city. He lived in the time of Alexander the Great, about 334 B.C.; and left three sons, Lystrum who were all famous statuaries.\n\nLYTHRUM, PURPLE LOOSESTRIFE, a genus of plants belonging to the decandra class; and in the natural method ranking under the 17th order, Calycanthemus. See Botany Index.\n\nLYTTELTON, EDWARD, Lord Lyttelton, keeper of the great seal in the reign of Charles I. was eminent for his probity and his moderation at the commencement of that monarch's disputes with his subjects. Without forfeiting his fidelity to the king, he preserved the esteem of the parliament till 1644, when he was made colonel of a regiment in the king's army at York. He died in 1645. Besides several of his speeches which have been printed, he wrote reports in the common pleas and exchequer, printed at London in 1683, in folio; several arguments and discourses, &c.\n\nLYTTELTON, GEORGE LORD, eldest son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, Bart. descended from the great judge Lyttelton, was born in 1700, at seven months; and the midwife supposing him to be dead, threw him carelessly into the cradle; where, had not some signs of life been taken notice of by one of the attendants, he might never have recovered. He received the elements of his education at Eaton-school, where he showed an early inclination to poetry. His pastoral and some other light pieces were originally written in that seminary of learning; from whence he was removed to the university of Oxford, where he pursued his classical studies with uncommon avidity, and sketched the plan of his Persian Letters; a work which afterwards procured him great reputation, not only from the elegance of the language in which they were composed, but from the excellent observations they contained on the manners of mankind.\n\nIn the year 1728, he set out on the tour of Europe; and, on his arrival at Paris, accidentally became acquainted with the honourable Mr Poyntz, then our minister at the court of Versailles; who was so struck with the extraordinary capacity of our young traveller, that he invited him to his house, and employed him in many political negotiations, which he executed with great judgement and fidelity.\n\nMr Lyttelton's conduct, while on his travels, was a lesson of instruction to the rest of his countrymen. Instead of lounging away his hours at the coffee-houses frequented by the English, and adopting the fashionable follies and vices of France and Italy, his time was passed alternately in his library and in the society of men of rank and literature. In this early part of his life, he wrote a poetical epistle to Dr Aylcough, and another to Mr Pope, which show singular taste and correctness.\n\nAfter continuing a considerable time at Paris with Mr Poyntz, who, to use his own words, behaved like a second father to him, he proceeded to Lyons and Geneva; and from thence to Turin, where he was honoured with great marks of friendship by his Sardinian majesty. He then visited Milan, Venice, Genoa, and Rome, where he applied himself closely to the study of the fine arts; and was, even in that celebrated metropolis, allowed a perfect judge of painting, sculpture, and architecture.\n\nDuring his continuance abroad, he constantly corresponded\nresponded with Sir Thomas, his father. Several of his letters are yet remaining, and place his filial affection in a very distinguished light. He soon after returned to his native country, and was elected representative for the borough of Okelhampton in Devonshire; and behaved so much to the satisfaction of his constituents, that they several times re-elected him for the same place without putting him to the least expense.\n\nAbout this period, he received great marks of friendship from Frederic prince of Wales, father of his present majesty; and was, in the year 1737, appointed principal secretary to his royal highness, and continued in the strictest intimacy with him till the time of his death. His attention to public business did not, however, prevent him from exercising his poetical talent. A most amiable young lady, Miss Fortescue, inspired him with a passion, which produced a number of little pieces, remarkable for their tenderness and elegance; and he had a happy facility of striking out an extempore compliment, which obtained him no small share of reputation. One evening being in company with Lord Cobham and several of the nobility at Stowe, his lordship mentioned his design of putting up a bust of Lady Suffolk in his beautiful gardens; and, turning to Mr Lyttelton, said, \"George, you must furnish me with a motto for it.\" \"I will, my lord,\" answered Mr Lyttelton; and directly produced the following couplet:\n\nHer wit and beauty for a court were made,\nBut truth and goodness fit her for a shade.\n\nWhen Mr Pitt, the late earl of Chatham, lost his commission in the guards, in consequence of his spirited behaviour in parliament, Mr Lyttelton was in waiting at Leicester-house, and, on hearing the circumstance, immediately wrote these lines:\n\nLong had thy virtue mark'd thee out for fame,\nFar, far superior to a coronet's name;\nThis generous Walpole saw, and griev'd to find\nSo mean a poit dilgrace that noble mind;\nThe servile standard from thy free-born hand\nHe took, and bade thee lead the patriot band.\n\nIn the year 1742, he married Lucy, the daughter of Hugh Fortescue, Esq. of Filleigh in the county of Devon, the lady above-mentioned, whose exemplary conduct, and uniform practice of religion and virtue, established his conjugal happiness upon the most solid basis.\n\nIn 1744, he was appointed one of the lords commissioners of the treasury; and, during his continuance in that station, constantly exerted his influence in rewarding merit and ability. He was the friend and patron of the late Henry Fielding, James Thomson author of the Seasons, Mr Mallet, Dr Young, Mr Hammond, Mr West, Mr Pope, and Voltaire. On the death of Thomson, who left his affairs in a very embarrassed condition, Mr Lyttelton took that poet's suffer under his protection. He revived the tragedy of Coriolanus, which that writer had not put the last hand to; and brought it out at the theatre-royal, Covent-garden, with a prologue of his own writing, in which he so affectingly lamented the loss of that delightful bard, that not only Mr Quin, who spoke the lines, but almost the whole audience, spontaneously burst into tears.\n\nIn the beginning of the year 1746, his felicity was interrupted by the loss of his wife, who died in the 29th year of her age; leaving him one son, Thomas, the late Lord Lyttelton; and a daughter, Lucy, who some time since married Lord Viscount Valentia. The remains of his amiable lady were deposited at Over-Arley in Worcestershire; and an elegant monument was erected to her memory in the church of Hagley, which contains the following inscription written by her husband:\n\nMade to engage all hearts, and charm all eyes:\nTho' meek, magnanimous; tho' witty, wise;\nPolite, as all her life in courts had been;\nYet good, as she the world had never seen:\nThe noble fire of an exalted mind,\nWith gentlest female tenderness combined.\nHer speech was the melodious voice of love,\nHer song the warbling of the vernal grove.\nHer eloquence was sweeter than her song,\nSoft as her heart, and as her reason strong.\nHer form each beauty of her mind express'd,\nHer mind was virtue by the Graces dress'd.\n\nBesides these beautiful lines, Mr Lyttelton wrote a monody on the death of his lady, which will be remembered while conjugal affection and a taste for poetry exist in this country.\n\nHis masterly observations on the conversion and apostleship of St Paul, were written at the desire of Gilbert West, Esq. in consequence of Mr Lyttelton's asserting, that, beside all the proofs of the Christian religion, which might be drawn from the prophecies of the Old Testament, from the necessary connection it has with the whole system of the Jewish religion, from the miracles of Christ, and from the evidence given of his resurrection by all the other apostles, he thought the conversion of St Paul alone, duly considered, was of itself a demonstration sufficient to prove Christianity to be a divine revelation. Mr West was struck with the thought; and assured his friend, that so copious a proof would be of great use to convince those unbelievers that will not attend to a longer series of arguments; and time has shown he was not out in his conjecture, as the tract is esteemed one of the best defences of Christianity which has hitherto been published.\n\nIn 1754, he resigned his office of lord of the treasury, and was made cofferer to his majesty's household, and sworn of the privy-council: previous to which, he married, a second time, Elizabeth daughter of Field-marshal Sir Robert Rich; whose indirect conduct gave him great uneasiness, and from whom he was separated, by mutual consent, a few years after his marriage.\n\nAfter being appointed chancellor and under-treasurer of the court of exchequer, he was, by letters-patent dated the 19th of November 1757, 31 Geo. II. created a peer of Great Britain, by the style and title of Lord Lyttelton, baron of Fravkley, in the county of Worcester. His speeches on the Scotch and mutiny bills in the year 1747, on the Jew bill in 1753, and on the privilege of parliament in 1763, showed found judgement, powerful eloquence, and inflexible integrity.\nDuring the last ten years he lived chiefly in retirement, in the continual exercise of all the virtues which can ennoble private life. His last work was Dialogues of the Dead, in which the morality of Cambrai and the spirit of Fontenelle are happily united.\n\nHe was suddenly seized with an inflammation of the bowels, in the middle of July 1773, at his seat at Hagley; which terminated in his death, on the 22d of that month. His last moments were attended with Lyttelton's unimpaired understanding, unaffected greatness of mind, calm resignation, and humble but confident hopes in the mercy of God. As he had lived universally esteemed, he died lamented by all parties. A complete collection of his works has been published since his decease, by his nephew George Aytcough, Esq.\n\nM.\n\nM, a liquid consonant, and the twelfth letter in the alphabet.\n\nIt has one unvaried sound, and is pronounced by striking the upper lip against the lower; in which the pronunciation of this letter agrees with that of b; the only difference between the two consisting in a little motion made in the nose in pronouncing m, and not in b: whence it happens that those who have taken cold, for m ordinarily pronounce b; the nose in that case being disfabled from making the necessary motion.\n\nAll consonants are formed with the aid of vowels; in em the vowel precedes, in be it follows; and m is never mute.\n\nQuintilian observes, that the m sometimes ends Latin words but never Greek ones; the Greeks always changing it in that case into n, for the sake of the better sound.\n\nM is also a numeral letter, and among the ancients was used for a thousand; according to the verse,\n\n\\[ M caput est numeri, quem scimus milie teneri. \\]\n\nWhen a dash is added to the top of it, as \\( \\overline{m} \\); it signifies a thousand times a thousand.\n\nM, as an abbreviation, stands for Manlius, Marcus, Marius, and Mucius: M.

See BLANKOF.\n\nMABILLON, JOHN, a very learned writer of France in the 17th century, was born at Perremont, on the frontiers of Champagne, in 1632. He was educated in the university of Rheims, and afterwards entered into the abbey of the Benedictines of St Remy. In the year 1663, he was appointed keeper of the treasures and monuments of France at St Dennis: but having unfortunately broke a looking glass there, which was pretended to have belonged to Virgil, he desired leave of his superiors to quit an employment which frequently obliged him to tell things he did not believe. Next year he went to Paris; and was very serviceable to Father d'Acheri, who was desirous of having some young monk who could assist him in compiling his Spicilegium. This made him known. Soon after, the congregation of St Maur having formed a design of publishing new editions of the fathers, revised from the MSS. in the libraries of the Benedictines, Mabillon was charged with the edition of St Bernard, which he prepared with extraordinary diligence. After that, he published many other works, which are evidences of his vast capacity and industry. In 1682, he was employed by Mr Colbert in examining some ancient titles relating to the royal family. The year following he sent him into Germany, to search the archives and libraries of the ancient abbeys, for what was most curious and proper to illustrate the history of the church in general, and that of France in particular. He has published an account of this journey. In 1685, he undertook another journey into Italy, by order of the king of France; and returned the year following with a very noble collection. He placed in the king's library above 3000 volumes of rare books, printed and in MSS. and composed two volumes of the pieces which he had discovered in that country. He was highly esteemed for his virtues as well as his learning.\n\nMACACO, or MACAUO. See LEMUR, MAMMALIA Index.\n\nMACAO, a town of China, in the province of Canton, seated in an island at the mouth of the river Tae. The Portuguese have been in possession of the harbour for 150 years. Formerly they had a great trade here; but now they have only a fort with a small garrison.

See PSITTACUS, ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nMACARIANS, in ecclesiastical history, the followers of Macarius, an Egyptian monk, who was distinguished\nMACARONIC, or MACARONIAN, a kind of burlesque poetry, consisting of a jumble of words of different languages, with words of the vulgar tongue Latinized; and Latin words modernized. Macaroni among the Italians, as has been observed by Cælius Rhodiginus, signifies a coarse clownish man; and because this kind of poetry is patched out of several languages, and full of extravagant words, &c. the Italians, among whom it had its rise, gave it the name of macaronian or macaronic poetry. Others choose to derive it from macaroonibus, from macaroons, a kind of confection made of meal not bolted, sweet almonds, sugar, and the white of eggs, accounted a great dainty among the country people in Italy; which, from their being composed of various ingredients, occasioned this kind of poetry, which consists of Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, English, &c. to be called by their name.\n\nExample.—A bold fellow in the macaronic style,\n\nEnflavi omnes scadrones et regimandos, &c.\n\nAnother example:\n\nArchebos piloliferos furiamque manantium,\nEt grandem efneumata que inopinum fafa ruelle est:\nTosinunque alto troublantem corda clochero, &c.\n\nTheoph. Folengius, a Benedictine monk of Mantua, was the first who invented, or at least cultivated, this kind of verse. See FOLENGIO.\n\nThe best pieces of this kind are, the Baldus of Folengio, and Macaronis Forza by Stefano a Jesuit, among the Italians; and the Reatus veritabilis, super terribili efneuta palanarum de Ruellis; among the French. The famous Rabelais first transferred the macaronic style out of the Italian verse into French prose; and on the model thereof formed some of the best things in his Pantagruel. We have little in English in the macaronian way; nothing scarce, but some little loose pieces collected in Camden's remains. But the Germans and Netherlanders have had their macaronic poets; witness the Certamen Catholicum cum Calvinifinis, of one Martinus Hamconius Frisius, which contains about 1200 verses, all the words whereof begin with the letter C.\n\nMACARSKA, a town of Dalmatia, and capital of Primogria, with a pretty good harbour, and a bishop's see, seated on the gulf of Venice.

The climate is very hot; and would be intolerable, were it not for the rains which fall when the sun is directly over their heads. The soil is extremely fertile, and there are Macassar ripe fruits at all times of the year. There are great numbers of monkeys, who are devoured by monstrous serpents; some of which are so large, that they will swallow one of these animals entire. The Macassars are large, robust, courageous, and greatly addicted to war. They profess the Mahometan religion.\n\nMACASSAR, a large, strong, and handsome town, of the island of Celebes, and capital of the kingdom of the same name, where the king resides. The houses are all built of wood, and supported by thick posts; and they have ladders to go up into them, which they draw up as soon as they have entered. The roofs are covered with very large leaves, which prevent the rain from entering. It is situated near the mouth of a large river, which runs through the kingdom from north to south. E. Long. 117° 55'. S. Lat. 5° 0'.\n\nMACASSAR Poison, in Natural History, called ippo in the Macassar and Malayan tongue, is the gum of a certain tree, thinning, brittle, black, and every way like stone pitch, growing in the island of Celebes, in the South seas; with which all the natives arm themselves in travel, having a long hollow trunk of a hard red wood like brasil, accurately bored, and at one end is fixed a large lance-blade of iron. Then they make a small arrow, very straight, and somewhat bigger than a large wheaten straw: at one end they fix it into a round piece of white, light, soft wood, like cork, about the length of the little finger, just fit for the bore of the trunk, to pass clear by the force of one's breath, and to fill it to exactly, that the air may not pass by, but against it, in order to carry it with the greater force. At the other end they fix in it either a small fish-tooth for that purpose, or make a blade of wood of the bigness of the point of a lanceet, about three-quarters of an inch long, and making a little notch in the end of the arrow, they stick it firm therein, which they anoint with poison. The poisonous gum, when gathered, is put into hollow bamboos or canes, stopped up very close, and thus brought to Macassar. When they fit it for use, they take a piece of smooth turtle-shell, and a stick cut flat and smooth at the end: then they take green galangal root, grate it, and with the addition of a little fair water, press the juice into a clean china dish: then with a knife scraping a little of the poison upon the shell, dip the end of the stick in the aforementioned liquor, and with this dissolve the poison to the consistence of a syrup; when this is done, they anoint the fish tooth or wooden blade with the same stick, and lay it in the sun, so that it may be baked hard. The pointed arrows thus prepared, are put in hollow bamboos, close shut, and in this state they retain their virtue for a month.\n\nMACCABÆUS, JUDAS. See Judas.\n\nMACCABEES, two apocryphal books of scripture, containing the history of Judas and his brothers, and their wars against the Syrian kings in defence of their religion and liberties, so called from Judas Mattathias, farnamed Maccabeus, as some say from the word מַכְבֵי, formed of the initials of מִצְרָיִם אֲנֹתָהוּ, q. d. Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? which was the motto of his standard; whence those who fought under his standard were called Maccabeers, and the name was generally applied to all who suffered in the cause of\nMaccabees, of the true religion, under the Egyptian or Syrian kings. The first book of the Maccabees is an excellent history, and comes nearest to the style and manner of the sacred historians of any extant. It was written originally in the Chaldee language, of the Jerusalem dialect, and was extant in this language in the time of Jerome. From the Chaldee it was translated into Greek, from the Greek into Latin. It is supposed to have been written by John Hyrcanus the son of Simon, who was prince and high priest of the Jews near 50 years, and began his government at the time where this history ends. It contains the history of 40 years, from the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes to the death of Simon the high priest; that is, from the year of the world 3829 to the year 3869; 131 years before Christ. The second book of the Maccabees begins with two epistles sent from the Jews of Jerusalem to the Jews of Egypt and Alexandria; to exhort them to observe the feast of the dedication of the new altar erected by Judas on his purifying the temple. The first was written in the 166th year of the era of the Seleucidae, i.e. before Christ 144; and the second in the 186th year of the same era, or 125 before Christ; and both appear to be spurious. After these epistles follows the preface of the author to his history, which is an abridgment of a larger work, composed by one Jafon, a Jew of Cyrene, who wrote in Greek the history of Judas Maccabeus and his brethren, and the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes, and Eupator his son. The second book does not by any means equal the accuracy and excellency of the first. It contains a history of about 15 years, from the execution of Heliodorus's commission, who was sent by Seleucus to fetch away the treasures of the temple, to the victory obtained by Judas Maccabeus over Nicanor; that is, from the year of the world 3828, to the year 3843, 147 years before Christ.\n\nThere are in the Polyglot Bibles, both of Paris and London, Syriac versions of both these books; but they, as well as the English versions which we have among the apocryphal writers in our Bibles, are derived from the Greek. There is also a third book of the Maccabees, containing the history of the persecution of Ptolemy Philopator against the Jews in Egypt, and their sufferings under it; which seems to have been written by some Alexandrian Jew in the Greek language, not long after the time of Siracides. It is in most of the ancient manuscript copies of the Greek Septuagint; particularly in the Alexandrian and Vatican, but was never inserted into the vulgar Latin version of the Bible, nor consequently into any of our English copies. Moreover, Josephus's history of the martyrs that suffered under Antiochus Epiphanes, is found in some manuscript Greek Bibles, under the name of the fourth book of the Maccabees.\n\nMACBETH, a Scots nobleman in the 11th century, nearly allied to Duncan king of Scotland.—Not contented with curbing the king's authority, he carried his pestilent ambition so far as to put him to death; and, chafing Malcolm Cammore his son and heir into England, usurped the crown. Siward earl of Northumberland, whose daughter Duncan had married, undertook, by the order of Edward the Confessor, the protection of the fugitive prince.—He marched with an army into Scotland; defeated and killed Macbeth; and restored Malcolm to the throne of his ancestors. Macbride, Shakespeare has made this transaction the subject of one of his best tragedies.\n\nMACBRIDE, Dr David, an eminent physician and philosopher, was descended from an ancient family in the county of Galloway in Scotland. His grandfather, a clergyman, had settled in Ireland about the end of the last century, as minister to a Presbyterian congregation at Belfast; and his father, who followed the same line, was settled at Ballymoney in the county of Antrim, where he married, and where our author was born in April 1726. After a proper school-education, and having passed some time under the tuition of an eminent surgeon in his native place, he was sent to the university of Glasgow. Having there completed the usual course of academical studies, he came to Edinburgh for the further prosecution of medical science. After a short stay here, a war then prevailing between France and Britain, he was induced to go on board the navy in the station of a surgeon's mate. In the service of his country he continued for several years; and after discharging for some time the duties of an assistant, he was raised to the rank of surgeon. In this situation, he first turned his thoughts towards the discovery of a remedy for the sea-scurvy. It was not, however, at this period, that either chance or reasoning suggested to him the employment of an article which has since been attended with the most beneficial consequences. Here he had an opportunity only of observing the symptoms, of studying the nature, and of lamenting the consequences, of the disease.\n\nThe termination of the war by the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle put a period to Dr Macbride's employment as a naval surgeon. He had now probably obtained much medical knowledge in the school of experience; but he was sensible that he had still much to acquire in that of science. An ardent keenness to mingle in active life had led him from the schools of medicine at an earlier period than could have been wished; and an earnest desire to found his future practice in the best established principles led him back to them, when a judgement, matured by years, and informed from the observation of facts, rendered him capable of hearing teachers with greater advantage. He returned therefore to Edinburgh, and again entered on the career of academical pursuits, under the tuition of Dr Monro, and those other teachers, whose abilities raised the fame of the medical school at this place. But not satisfied with the instructions to be had from any one set of professors, the celebrity of the medical teachers in London led him also to visit that capital. There he particularly became the pupil of those distinguished lecturers, Dr Hunter and Dr Smellie. And while from the former he laboured to acquire an accurate chirurgical knowledge, from the latter he endeavoured to obtain the true principles of midwifery considered as a science. At the same time he was no less industrious in improving himself in the successful practice of both arts by attention at hospitals.\n\nThus prepared for the exercise of his profession, about the end of the year 1749 he fixed his residence in Dublin in the character of surgeon and accoucheur. If amiable manners, and extensive knowledge of his profession, could alone have been sufficient introductions to practice, he might in a short time have look-\nMacbride, ed for a competent share of business in that capital; but while he had to combat that objection which very generally arises from youth, his progress was also not a little retarded by an uncommon degree of modesty. Hence for several years he remained almost in a state of obscurity, and was employed by but few people either of rank or fortune. But, if it is to be regretted that for many years his time was not so fully employed in the lucrative part of his profession as was due to his merit, it ought still to be remembered, that this essentially promoted the cause of science: for by these means his genius and industry were directed to medical researches; and were productive of discoveries which will with honour transmit his name to latest posterity. These, though some of them might have been successfully turned to his own emolument, were freely communicated to the world in different publications; and he did not show greater ingenuity in making discoveries, than liberality of sentiment in publishing them for the advantage of others.—His first publication, entitled, \"Experimental Essays on Medical and Philosophical Subjects,\" made its appearance in the year 1764.—These essays are five in number: 1. On the fermentation of alimentary mixture and the digestion of the food. 2. On the nature and properties of fixed air. 3. On the different kinds of antifeptics. 4. Of the diffusible power of quicklime. 5. Of the sea-scurvy. The merit of all these is sufficiently known and acknowledged; but the last of them is unquestionably the most important; the method therein proposed of both the prevention and cure of that dreadful disease, the scurvy, having been confirmed by repeated and undeniable observation.\n\nHaving thus equally distinguished himself as an ingenious philosopher and able practitioner, the world were not now slow in bestowing upon him the tribute of applause to which he was entitled. His name was enrolled with honour in the lists of many learned societies; and the university where his studies had first been commenced, were proud to confer upon him the degree of doctor of medicine.\n\nThe reputation, however, of being a distinguished author, was to him but a secondary object; and his talents were not confined to the advancement of medicine alone. Having successfully discovered a considerable improvement in the art of tanning, with that spirited generosity which is ever the concomitant of real worth, he speedily and freely communicated it to the public, by publishing, first, \"An Account of a New Method of Tanning;\" and afterwards, \"Instructions for carrying on the New Method of Tanning.\" As a mark of approbation for this liberal conduct, as well as a testimony of respect for his ingenuity, prize-medals were conferred upon him by the Societies of Arts both in London and Dublin. But his last and most extensive publication was more immediately in the line of his own profession: It is entitled, \"A Methodical Introduction to the Theory and Practice of Medicine.\" In that valuable work he has given a concise and connected view of the principles and practice of the healing art, as well established by sound reason, and confirmed by accurate observation. Most, if not all, of these publications, not only went through various editions, but were translated into different languages.\n\nAfter the merit of Dr Macbride came to be properly known, the public seemed to show a desire of making compensation for having so long overlooked it. His employment increased so rapidly, that he had more business than he could transact either with ease or safety. This having kept him in perpetual agitation both of body and mind, at last induced an almost total incapacity of sleeping. From this circumstance his health could not fail to be impaired. In this situation, after accidental exposure to cold, he was attacked with a fever, which put an end to his life on the 13th of December 1778, in the 53rd year of his age.\n\nThose who were his most intimate acquaintance were inclined to believe that his death was not a little hastened by domestic calamities. During his residence in Dublin he was twice married, and was as often subjected to that inexplicable distress which must result from a final separation in this world from the most intimate and loving friends. By both of his wives he had several children; but none of them survived their father. And on these calamitous events, although he was able to conceal his feelings from the world, yet they gave a severe shock to his constitution. After his death, several of the playful trinkets of his infants, with the signature of dulce exuviae, were found in his repositories among papers on medical and other important subjects: an incontrovertible proof, that in him at least, the great mind of the philosopher was conjoined with the feeling heart of the affectionate father. But if his abilities were remarkable as a philosopher and physician, if his conduct was exemplary as a husband and parent, his manners were no less amiable as a companion and friend. His polite and benevolent conduct, joined to his taste for the fine arts, conciliated the affections and esteem of all who knew him. His death was universally and sincerely lamented in the city of Dublin.\n\nMACCLESFIELD, a town of Cheshire in England, 171 miles from London, is seated on the edge of a forest of the same name, upon a high bank near the river Bollin; and is a large handsome town, with a fine church and a very high steeple. It was erected into a borough by King Edward III. is governed by a mayor, and enjoys great privileges and jurisdictions by virtue of the court and the liberties of the forest. In its church are two brass plates, on one of which there is a promise of 26,000 years and 26 days pardon for saying five Paters-Noctis and five Ave. Its chief manufacture is mohair buttons.

It was commonly made of iron; its figure much resembles a chocolate mill; many specimens may be seen in the Tower. It was with one of these that Walworth mayor of London knocked the rebel Wat Tyler from off his horse in Smithfield for approaching the young King Richard II. in an insolent manner; and as he fell, he dispatched him with his dagger. The mace in modern times changed its form; and being no longer a war instrument, is made of copper or silver gilt, ornamented with\nMace, a crown, globe, and cross, and is now the chief insignia of authority throughout Great Britain. Similar to the ancient maces, were those slaves at the end of which iron or leaden balls armed with spikes were suspended by chains; they were till lately carried by the pioneers of the trained bands or city militia.\n\nMace, in the Materia Medica, the second coat or covering of the kernel of the nutmeg, is a thin, membranaceous substance, of a yellowish colour; being met with in flakes of an inch or more in length, which are divided into a multitude of ramifications. It is of an extremely fragrant, aromatic, and agreeable flavour; and of a pleasant, but acid oleaginous taste. See Materia Medica Index.\n\nMACEDON, or MACEDONIA, a most celebrated kingdom of antiquity, was bounded on the east by the Aegean sea; on the south by Thessaly and Epirus; on the west by the Ionian sea or Adriatic; on the north, at first by the river Strymon and the Scardian mountains, but afterwards by the river Nestus or Nestus. In a direct line the whole country extended only 150 miles in length; but the windings of the coast lengthened it out to three times that extent; in which almost every convenient situation was occupied by a Grecian sea-port. The country was naturally divided by the Thermaic and Strymonic gulfs, into the provinces of Pieria, Chalcis, and Pangaean. The middle region, which took its name from a city of Euboea from whence it was originally peopled, was very fertile and pleasant; the inland country, being diversified by lakes, rivers, and arms of the sea, was extremely convenient for inland navigation, while the towns of Amphipolis, Potidaea, Acanthus, and many others, afforded mart for the commerce of the republics of Greece, as well as of Thrace and Macedon. On one side of this district were the mountains of Pangaeus, and on the other the plains of Pieria. The Pangaean mountains, which extended 90 miles towards the east and the river Nestus, though proper neither for corn nor pasture, produced plenty of timber for ship-building; while the southern branches of the mountains contained rich veins of gold and silver; but these, though wrought successively by the Thracians and the Athenians, were only brought to perfection by Philip of Macedon, who extracted from them gold and silver to the value of 200,000l. sterling annually. Pieria extended 50 miles along the Thermaic gulf, to the confines of Thessaly and Mount Pindus. The inland part of the country was beautifully diversified with shady hills and fountains; and so admirably calculated for solitary walks and retirement, that the ancients looked upon it to be the favourite haunt of the Muses, and accordingly bestowed upon them the title of Piedrider.\n\nIn the most early times this country was called Emathia, from Emathius one of its princes. The name of Macedon is said to have been derived from Macedo a descendant of Deucalion; though others suppose it to have been only a corruption of Mygdonia a district of the country. In those remote ages of antiquity, Macedon, like most other countries of Europe, was divided into a great number of petty principalities, of which scarce even the names are known at this time. All authors agree, however, that Caranus was the first who established any permanent sovereignty in Macedon. He was an Argive, a descendant of Macedon. Hercules, and about 800 years B.C. conducted a small colony of his countrymen into the inland district of Macedon, at that time distinguished by the name of Emathia as already mentioned. This territory was about 300 miles in circumference. On the south it was separated from the sea by a number of Greek republics, of which the most considerable were those of Olynthus and Amphipolis; and on the north, east, and west, was surrounded by the barbarous kingdoms of Thrace, Paeonia, and Illyricum. According to the traditions of those times, Caranus, having consulted the oracle on the success of his intended expedition, was commanded to be directed by the goats in the establishment of his empire. For some time he proceeded at random, without knowing what to make of the oracle's answer; but happening to enter the small kingdom of Emathia, at that time governed by King Midas, he observed a herd of goats running towards Edessa the capital. Recollecting then the answer of the oracle, he attacked and took the city by surprise, soon after making himself master of the whole kingdom. In memory of this remarkable event he called the city Edessa, and the people Edessaeans, from the goats who conducted him, and made use of the figure of a goat in his standard. From this fable also we see why the figure of a goat is so frequently seen on the coins of Philip and his successors.\n\nThe little colony of Argives led into Emathia by Policy of Caranus would soon have been overwhelmed by the barbarous nations who surrounded it, had not this prince and his subjects taken care to ingratiate themselves with their neighbours, rather than to attempt to subdue them by force of arms. They instructed them in the Grecian religion and government, and in the knowledge of many useful arts; adopting themselves, in some degree, the language and manners of the barbarians; imparting to them in return some part of the Grecian civilization and polite behaviour. Thus they gradually associated with the fierce and warlike tribes in their neighbourhood; and this prudent conduct, being followed by succeeding generations, may be looked upon as one of the causes of the Macedonian greatness.\n\nCaranus, dying after a reign of three years, left the kingdom to his son Ceneus; who, having considerably enlarged his dominions, was succeeded by Thurymas, and he by Perdiccas I. This last prince is by Thucydides and Herodotus accounted the founder of the Macedonian monarchy; though his history is so obscured by fable, that nothing certain can now be known concerning it. In process of time, however, the good understanding which had subsisted between the Macedonians and their barbarous neighbours began to suffer an interruption; and in 601 B.C. the kingdom was for the first time invaded by the Illyrians. At first they did considerable damage by their ravages; but the Macedonian monarch, Argeus, having decoyed them into an ambush, cut off great numbers, and obliged the remainder to leave the kingdom. In the reigns of his successors, however, they returned, and occasionally proved very troublesome enemies till the reigns of Philip and Alexander.\n\nIn the mean time the kingdom of Macedon began to be affected by those great events which took place Persians in other parts of the world. Cyrus having overthrown the Ionians,\nMacedon, the Babylonian empire, and conquered all the western part of Asia, established a mighty monarchy, which threatened all the eastern parts of Europe with subjugation. The Greeks, however, having now emerged from their barbarism, and acquired great knowledge in the art of war, were able to resist effectually this very formidable power; but the kingdom of Macedon, obscure and unconnected, was obliged to yield, and though not formally made a province of the Persian empire, was nevertheless accounted in some sort as under the vassalage and protection of the Persians. Alcetas, who ascended the Macedonian throne about the time that the Persian monarchy was founded, had the dexterity to preserve his dominions from the encroachments of the Greeks on the one hand, and of the Persians on the other; but in the reign of his successor Amyntas, a formal demand was made of submission to the great king Darius, by sending him a present of earth and water. Seven ambassadors were sent on this errand by Megabizus, one of the officers of Darius. They were sumptuously entertained by Amyntas; but having attempted to take some indecent liberties with the Macedonian women, Alexander the king's son caused them all to be murdered. This rash action had almost proved the ruin of the kingdom; but Alexander found means to pacify Bubares the general sent against him by Megabizus, by showing him his sister Gygaea, a very beautiful woman, with whom the Persian fell in love at first sight, and afterwards married her.\n\nFrom this time the Macedonians were accounted the faithful allies of the Persians; and, through the interest of his son-in-law, Amyntas obtained the country in the neighbourhood of Mount Haemus and Olympus, at the same time that the city of Alabanda in Phrygia was given to Amyntas the nephew of Alexander. The Macedonians distinguished themselves in the time of the Persian invasion of Greece, by furnishing their allies with 200,000 recruits; though some cities, particularly Potidaea, Olynthus, and Pallene, adhered to the Grecian interest. The two last were taken and razed, and the inhabitants massacred by the Persians; but Potidaea escaped by reason of the sea breaking into the Persian camp, where it did great damage. Alexander, however, afterwards thought proper to court the favour of the Greeks by giving them intelligence of the time when Mardonius designed to attack them. The remaining transactions of this reign are entirely unknown, farther than that he enlarged his dominions to the river Nestus on the east and the Axios on the west.\n\nAlexander I. was succeeded by his son Perdiccas II., who, according to Dr Gillies, \"inherited his father's abilities, though not his integrity.\" But from his duplicity above mentioned both to Greeks and Persians, it does not appear that he had much to boast of as to the latter quality. In the Peloponnesian war he espoused the cause of the Spartans against the Athenians, from whom he was in danger by reason of their numerous settlements on the Macedonian coast, and their great power by sea. For some time, however, he amused the Athenians with a show of friendship; but at last, under pretence of enabling Olynthus and some other cities to recover their liberties, he afflired in destroying the influence of the Athenians in those places, in hopes of establishing that of the Macedonians in its stead. But this design failed of success; the Olynthian confederacy was broken, and the members of it became subject to Sparta, until at last, by the misfortunes of that republic, they became sufficiently powerful not only to resist the encroachments of the Macedonians, but to make considerable conquests in their country.\n\nPerdiccas II. was succeeded about 416 B.C. by Of Archeleaus I. He enlarged his dominions by the conquest of Pydna, and other places in Pieria, though his ambition seems rather to have been to improve his dominions than greatly to extend them. He facilitated the communication between the principal towns of Macedon, by cutting straight roads through most part of the country; he built walls and fortresses in such places as afforded a favourable situation; encouraged agriculture and the arts, particularly those subservient to war; formed magazines of arms; raised and disciplined a considerable body of cavalry; and in a word, says Dr Gillies, added more to the solid grandeur of Macedon than had been done by all his predecessors put together. Nor was he regardless of the arts of peace. His palace was adorned by the works of Grecian painters. Euripides was long entertained at his court; Socrates was earnestly solicited to live there, after the example of this philosophic poet, formed by his precepts and cherished by his friendship: men of merit and genius in the various walks of literature and science were invited to reside in Macedon, and treated with distinguishing regard by a monarch duly attentive to promote his own glory and the happiness of his subjects.\"\n\nThis great monarch died after a reign of six years, the space by far too short to accomplish the magnificent designs he had formed. After his death the kingdom fell under the power of usurpers or weak and wicked monarchs. A number of competitors constantly appeared for the throne; and they by turns called in to their assistance the Thracians, Illyrians, Thessalians, the Olynthian confederacy, Athens, Sparta, and Thebes. Bardyllis, an active and daring chief, who, from being head of a gang of robbers, had become sovereign of the Illyrians, entered Macedon at the head of a numerous army, deposed Amyntas II., the father of Philip, and set up in his place one Argaeus, who consented to become tributary to the Illyrians. Another candidate for the throne, named Paylonias, was supported by the Thracians; but, by the assistance of the Thessalians and Olynthians, Amyntas was enabled to resume the government. After his restoration, however, the Olynthians refused to deliver up several places of importance belonging to Macedon, which Amyntas had either intrusted to their care, or which they had taken from his antagonist. Amyntas complained to Sparta; and that republic, which had already formed schemes of very extensive ambition, so readily complied with the request, that it was generally supposed to have proceeded from Spartan emissaries sent into Macedonia. They pretended indeed to hesitate a little, and to take time to deliberate on the army which ought to be raised for the purpose; but Cleomenes, the principal ambassador, represented the urgency of the case in such a manner, that the troops which happened at that time to be ready were ordered to take the field without delay. Two thousand Spartans, under the command\ncommand of Eudamidas, were ordered into Macedon, while a powerful reinforcement under the command of Phoebidas, brother to the general, was ordered to follow him as soon as possible. By accident, Phoebidas and his auxiliaries were detained till the seafarers for action was passed; but Eudamidas with his small army performed very efficient service. The appearance of a Spartan army at once encouraged the subjects and allies of the Olynthians to revolt; and the city of Potidaea, a place of great importance in the isthmus of Pallene, surrendered soon after his arrival in the country. Being too much elated with his success, however, Eudamidas approached so near the city of Olynthus, that he was unexpectedly attacked, defeated, and killed, in a rally of the citizens. He was succeeded by Teletius the brother of Agesilaus, who had under his command a body of 10,000 men, and was farther assisted by Amyntas king of Macedon, and Derdas his brother, the governor or sovereign of the most westerly province of Macedon, which abounded in cavalry. By these formidable enemies the Olynthians were defeated in a number of battles, obliged to shut themselves up in their city, and prevented from cultivating their territory; on which Teletius advanced with his whole forces to invest the city itself. His excessive eagerness to destroy his enemies proved his ruin. A body of Olynthian horse had the boldness to pass the river Amnis in sight of the allied army, though so much superior in number. Teletius ordered his targeteers to attack them, the Olynthians, having retreated across the river, were closely pursued by the Lacedemonians, great part of whom also passed the river; but the Olynthians suddenly turned upon them, killed upwards of 100, with Tlemonidas their leader. Teletius, exasperated at this disaster, ordered the remainder of the targeteers and cavalry to pursue; while he himself advanced at the head of the heavy-armed foot with such celerity that they began to fall into disorder. The Olynthians allowed them to proceed, and the Lacedemonians very imprudently advanced just under the towers and battlements of the city. The townsmen then mounted the walls, and discharged upon them a shower of darts, arrows, and other missile weapons, while the flower of the Olynthian troops, who had been purposely posted behind the gates, fell forth and attacked them with great violence. Teletius, attempting to rally his men, was slain in the first onset; the Spartans who attended him were defeated, and the whole army at last dispersed with great slaughter, and obliged to shelter themselves in the towns of Acanthus, Apollonia, Spartolus, and Potidaea.\n\nThe Spartans, undismayed by this terrible disaster, next sent their king Agesipolis with a powerful reinforcement into Macedon. His presence greatly raised the spirits of the Lacedemonian allies, and his rapid success seemed to promise a speedy termination to the war, when he himself died of a cautery. He was succeeded in the throne by his brother Cleombrotus, and in the command of the army by Polybiades an experienced general, who likewise brought along with him a powerful reinforcement. Olynthus was now completely blocked up by land, while a squadron of Lacedemonian galleys blockaded the neighbouring harbour of Mycebeira. The Olynthians, however, held out for nine or ten months, but at last were obliged to submit on very humiliating conditions. They formally renounced all claim to the dominion of Chalcis; they ceded the Macedonian cities to their ancient governor; the Olynthians left the city of AEginae obligea or Edeffa, where till now he had held his royal seat of residence, and fixed it at Pella, a city of great strength and beauty, situated on an eminence, which, together with a plain of considerable extent, was defended by natural impenetrable morasses, and by the rivers Axios and Lydias. It was distant about 15 miles from the Aegean sea, with which it communicated by means of the above-mentioned rivers. It was originally founded by the Greeks, who had lately conquered and peopled it; but in consequence of the misfortunes of Olynthus, it now became the capital of Macedon, and continued ever after to be so.\n\nAmyntas, thus fully established in his dominions, continued to enjoy tranquillity during the remaining part of his life. The reign of his son Alexander was short, and disturbed by invasions of the Illyrians; from whom he was obliged to purchase a peace. He left behind him two brothers, Perdiccas and Philip, both very young; so that Pausanias again found means to usurp the throne, being supported not only by the Thracians, but a considerable number of Greek mercenaries, as well as a powerful party in Macedon itself. In this critical juncture, however, Iphicrates the Athenian happening to be on an expedition to Amphipolis, was addressed by Euridice the widow of Amyntas, so warmly in behalf of her two sons, whom she presented to him, that he interested himself in their behalf, and got Perdiccas the eldest established on the throne. He was induced also to this piece of generosity by the kindness which Euridice and her husband had formerly shown to himself; and he likewise saw the advantages which must ensue to his country from a connexion with Macedon. During the minority of the young prince, however, his brother aspired to the throne; but he was deposed by the Theban general Pelopidas, who reinstated Perdiccas in his dominions; and in order to secure, in the most effectual manner, the dependence of Macedon upon Thebes, carried along with him thirty Macedonian youths as hostages; and among them Philip, the younger brother of the king. Perdiccas now, elated by the protection of such powerful allies, forgot Iphicrates and the Athenians, and even disputed with them the right to the city of Amphipolis, which had been decreed to them by the general council of Greece, but which his opposition rendered impossible for them to recover. In consequence of the trust he put in these new allies, also, it is probable that he refused to Bardyllis the Illyrian the tribute which the Macedonians had been obliged to pay him; which occasioned a war with that nation. In this contest the Macedonians were defeated with the loss of 4000 men, Perdiccas himself being taken prisoner, and dying soon after his wounds.\n\nThe kingdom was now left in the most deplorable state. Amyntas, the proper heir to the throne, was an infant; the Thebans, in whom Perdiccas had placed too much confidence, were deprived of the sovereignty of Greece; the Athenians, justly provoked at the ungrateful behaviour of the late monarch, showed a hol-\nPhilip, the late king's brother, no sooner heard of his defeat and death, than he set out privately from Thebes; and on his arrival in Macedon found matters in the situation we have just now described. Fired with an insatiable ambition, it is very probable that from the very first moment he had resolved to seize the kingdom for himself; yet it was necessary at first to pretend that he assumed the throne only to preserve it for his nephew. Philip, as has already been mentioned, was carried off as a hostage by Pelopidas, but for a long time past had remained in such obscurity, that historians disagree as to his place of residence; some placing him in Thebes, and others in Macedon. It is certain, however, that from the age of 15 he had been very much in the family of Epaminondas, from whose lessons he could not but derive the greatest advantage. It is probable also that he attended this celebrated general in many of his expeditions; and it is certain, that, with an attendance suitable to his rank, he visited most of the principal republics, and showed an attention to their institutions, both civil and military, far superior to his years. Having easy access to whomsoever he pleased, he cultivated the friendship of the first people in Greece. Even in Athens, where no good will subsisted with Macedon, the philosophers Plato, Isocrates, and Aristotle, cultivated his acquaintance; and the connexion he formed with the principal leaders of that republic in the early period of his life, no doubt contributed greatly to the accomplishment of the designs in which he afterwards proved so successful.\n\nHis appearance in Macedon instantly changed the face of affairs: the Macedonian army, though defeated, was not entirely destroyed; and the remainder of them secured themselves in the fortresses which had been built by Archelaus. There were also considerable garrisons in the fortresses, and walled towns scattered over the kingdom; and the Illyrians, who had made war only for the sake of plunder, soon returned home to enjoy the fruits of their victory. His other enemies, the Thracians and Paeonians, were much less formidable than the Illyrians, being still in a very rude and uncivilized state, incapable of uniting under one head in such a manner as to bring any formidable army into the field. While the Illyrians therefore gave up the campaign through mere caprice and unsteadiness, Philip himself applied to the Paeonians, and by fair promises and flattery prevailed upon them to desist. The king of Thrace, by means of a sum of money, was easily prevailed upon to abandon the cause of Pausanias; so that Philip, freed from these barbarians, was now left at liberty to oppose the Athenians, who supported Argeus, and threatened a very formidable invasion.\n\nThe appearance of the Athenian fleet before Methone, with that of Argeus at the head of a numerous army in Pieria, filled the whole country with consternation; and Philip, who was by no means deficient in talents necessary to recommend himself to the good graces of the people, took the opportunity of getting Amyntas set aside, and himself declared king; for Takes up which indeed the danger of the times afforded a very on him the plausible pretext. Argeus, in the mean time, advanced with his Athenian allies towards Edessa or Æge, the ancient capital of the Macedonian empire, where he hoped to have been amicably received; but finding the gates shut against him, he returned back to Methone. Philip harassed him in his retreat, cutting off great numbers of his men, and afterwards defeated him in a general engagement; in which Argeus himself, with the flower of his army, was cut in pieces, and all the rest taken prisoners.\n\nThis first instance of success contributed greatly to raise the spirits of Philip's party; and he himself took care to improve it in the best manner possible. Having taken a great number of prisoners, both Macedonians and Athenians, he determined, by his treatment of them, to ingratiate himself with both parties. The former were called into his presence, and, after a gentle reprimand, admitted to swear allegiance to him; after which they were distributed through the army: the Athenians were entertained at his table, dismissed without ransom, and their baggage restored. The prisoners were just allowed time to return to their native city and to spread abroad the news of Philip's generosity, when they were followed by ambassadors from Macedon with proposals for peace. As he knew that the loss of Amphipolis had greatly irritated them, he now thought proper to renounce his jurisdiction over that city; and it was accordingly declared free and independent, and subject only to the government of its own free and equitable laws. This artful conduct, together with his kind treatment of the prisoners, so wrought upon the minds of the Athenians, that they consented to the renewal of a treaty which had formerly subsisted between them and his father Amyntas. Thus he found means to remove all jealousy of his ambition or the schemes he might afterwards undertake to their prejudice; and not only this, but to induce them to engage in a ruinous war with their allies, which occupied their attention until Philip had an opportunity of getting his matters so well established that it was impossible to overthrow them.\n\nThe new king being thus left at liberty to regulate his domestic concerns, began to circumscribe the power of his chiefs and nobles; who, especially in the more remote provinces, paid very little regard to the authority of the kings of Macedon; sometimes, even in times of public calamity, throwing off their allegiance altogether, and assuming an independent government over considerable tracts of country. To counteract the ambition of these chiefs, Philip chose a body of illustrious Macedonian youths, whom he entertained at his own table, and honoured with many testimonies for his companionship, allowing them constantly to attend him in war and hunting. Their intimacy with the sovereign, which was considered as an indication of their merit, obliged them to superior diligence in all the severe duties of military discipline; and the young nobility, eager to participate such high honours, vied with each other\nMacedon. other in their endeavours to gain admission into this distinguished order; so that while on the one hand they served as hostages, on the other they formed an useful seminary for future generals, by whom both Philip and Alexander were afterwards greatly assisted in their conquests.\n\nDiodorus Siculus, and all the Roman writers who have treated of the history of Greece, assert that Philip, in the first year of his reign, instituted the Macedonian phalanx; a body of 6000 men armed with short swords fitted either for cutting or stabbing, having also strong bucklers four feet long and two and a half broad, and pikes 14 feet long; usually marching 16 men deep. But this opinion is controverted by others. Dr Gillies supposes that the opinion had arisen from the Romans meeting with the phalanx in its most complete form in Macedon; and as they became acquainted with Greece and Macedon pretty nearly at the same time, it was natural for them to suppose that it had been invented among the Macedonians. The phalanx, he says, is nothing different from the armour and arrangement which had always prevailed among the Greeks, and which Philip adopted in its most perfect form; \"nor is there reason (says he) to think that a prince, who knew the danger of changing what the experience of ages had approved, made any alteration in the weapons or tactics of that people. The improvement in the counter-march, to which Philip gave the appearance of advancing instead of retreating, mentioned by Ælian in his Tactics, cap. xxviii., was borrowed, as this author tells us, from the Lacedemonians. If Philip increased the phalanx, usually less numerous, to 6000 men, this was far from an improvement; and the latter kings of Macedon, who swelled it to 16,000, only rendered that order of battle more unwieldy and inconvenient.\" Instead of this, Philip, according to our author, employed himself in procuring arms, horses, and other necessary materials for war; and in introducing a more severe and exact military discipline than had formerly been known in Macedon.\n\nWhile the king thus took the best methods to render himself secure at home and formidable abroad, the Paeonians again began to make incursions into the kingdom. The death of Agis their king, however, who was a man of great military skill, deprived them almost of every power of resistance when they were attacked. Philip, of consequence, overran their country with little opposition, and reduced them to the state of tributaries to Macedon. No sooner was this accomplished, than he undertook a winter's campaign against the Illyrians, who had long been the natural enemies of Macedon. They had now extended their territory to the east; by which means the Macedonians were excluded from the harbours on the coast of the Adriatic. This was a grievance to Philip, who seems early to have meditated the raising of a naval power; neither could he hope to be in safety, should the kingdom be left open to the incursions of a barbarous enemy; for which reasons he determined at once to humble those enemies in such a manner that they should no longer be in a situation to give him any disturbance. After an ineffectual negotiation, he was met by Bardyllis at the head of a considerable body of infantry, but with only 400 horse. They made a gallant resistance for some time; but being unable to cope with such a skilful general as Philip, they were defeated with the loss of 7000 men, among whom was their leader Bardyllis, who fell at the age of 90.\n\nBy this disaster the Illyrians were so much disheartened, that they sent ambassadors to Philip, humbly begging for peace on any terms. The conqueror granted them the same conditions which had been imposed upon the Paeonians, viz. the becoming tributary, and yielding up to him a considerable part of their country. That part of it which lay to the eastward of a lake named Lychnidus he annexed to Macedon; and probably built a town and settled a colony there; the country being fertile, and the lake abounding with many kinds of fish highly esteemed by the ancients. This town and lake were about 50 miles distant from the Ionian sea; and such was the ascendancy which the arms and policy of Philip acquired over his neighbours, that the inhabitants of all the intermediate district soon adopted the language and manners of their conquerors; and their territory, hitherto unconnected with any foreign power, sunk into such absolute dependence upon Macedon, that many ancient geographers supposed it to be a province of that country.\n\nPhilip had no sooner reduced the Illyrians, than he began to put in execution greater designs than any he had yet attempted. The rich coasts to the southward of Macedon, inhabited chiefly by Greeks, presented a strong temptation to his ambition and avarice. The confederacy of Olynthus, after having thrown off the yoke of Sparta, was become more powerful than ever, and could send into the field an army of 10,000 heavy armed troops, besides a number of cavalry in proportion. Most of the towns in Chalcidice were become its allies or subjects; so that this populous and wealthy province, together with Pangaeus on the right and Pieria on the left, of both which the cities were either independent or subject to the Athenians, formed a barrier not only sufficient to guard against any incursions of the Macedonians, but which was even formidable to them. But though Philip was sensible of the importance of those places, he considered the conquest of Amphipolis as more necessary at the present time. By the possession of this place Macedon would be connected with the sea, and would be secured in many commercial advantages, which could not but contribute greatly to the prosperity of the kingdom at large; a road was likewise opened to the woods and mines of Pangaeus, the former of which were so necessary to the raising of a naval power, and the latter for the establishment of a proper military force. This city had indeed been declared independent by Philip himself in the beginning of his reign; but this was only to prevent a rupture with the Athenians, who still asserted their right to it as an ancient colony; though, by reason of the perfidy of Charidemus, a native of Euboea, they had hitherto failed in their attempts to recover it. The Amphipolitans, however, having once enjoyed the sweets of liberty, prepared to maintain themselves in their independence. In the mean time the hostile designs of Philip, which all his precaution had not been able to conceal, alarmed the inhabitants to such a degree, that they thought proper to put themselves under the protection of the Olynthians. By them they were readily received in...\nMAC\n\nMacedon, to the confederacy; and, trusting to the strength of their new allies, behaved in such an insolent manner to Philip, that he was not long of finding a specious pretext for hostility; at which the Olynthians, greatly alarmed, sent ambassadors to Athens, requesting their assistance against such a powerful enemy. Philip, however, justly alarmed at such a formidable conspiracy, sent agents to Athens, with such expedition that they arrived there before anything could be concluded with the Olynthian deputies. Having gained over the popular leaders and orators, he deceived and flattered the magistrates and senate in such an artful manner, that a negociation was instantly set on foot, by which Philip engaged to conquer Amphipolis for the Athenians, upon condition that they surrendered to him the strong fortress of Pydna, a place which he represented as of much less importance to them; promising also to confer upon them many other advantages, which, however, he did not specify at that time. Thus the Athenians, deceived by the perfidy of their own magistrates, elated with the hopes of recovering Amphipolis, and outwitted by the superior policy of Philip, rejected with disdain the proffers of the Olynthians.\n\nThe ambassadors of Olynthus returned home highly disgusted with the reception they had met with; but had scarce time to communicate the news to their countrymen, when the ambassadors of Philip arrived at Olynthus. He pretended to console with them on the affront they had received at Athens; but testified his surprise that they should court the alliance of that distant and haughty republic, when they could avail themselves of the powerful kingdom of Macedon, which wished for nothing more than to enter into equal and lasting engagements with their confederacy. As a proof of his moderation and sincerity, he offered to put them in possession of Anthemus, an important town in the neighbourhood, of which the Macedonians had long claimed the jurisdiction, making many other fair promises; and among the rest, that he would reduce for them the cities of Pydna and Potidea, which he chose rather to see in dependence on Olynthus than Athens. Thus he prevailed upon the Olynthians not only to abandon Amphipolis, but to assist him with all their power in the execution of his designs.\n\nPhilip now lost no time in executing his purposes on Amphipolis; and prefled the city so closely, that the people were glad to apply to the Athenians for relief. Accordingly they despatched two of their most eminent citizens, Hierax and Stratocles, to represent the danger of an alliance between Philip and the Olynthians, and to profess their sorrow for having so deeply offended the parent state. This representation had such an effect, that though the Athenians were then deeply engaged in the Social war, they would probably have paid some attention to the Amphipolitans, had not Philip taken care to send them a letter with fresh assurances of friendship, acknowledging their right to Amphipolis, and which he hoped shortly to put into their hands in terms of his recent agreement. By these specious pretences the Athenians were persuaded to pay as little regard to the deputies of the Amphipolitans as they had already done to those of the Olynthians; so that the city, unable to defend itself alone against so powerful an enemy, surrendered at last at discretion in Macedon the year 317 B.C.\n\nPhilip still proceeded in the same cautious and politic manner in which he had begun. Though the obstinate defence of the Amphipolitans might have furnished a pretence for severity, he contented himself with banishing a few of the popular leaders from whom he had most cause to dread opposition, treating the rest of the inhabitants with all manner of clemency; but took care to add Amphipolis to his own dominions, from which he was determined that it never should be separated, notwithstanding the promises he had made to the Athenians. Finding that it was not his interest at this time to fall out with the Olynthians, he cultivated the friendship of that republic with great assiduity; took the cities of Pydna and Potidea, which he readily yielded to the Olynthians, though they had given him but little assistance in the reduction of these places. Potidea had been garrisoned by the Athenians; and them the artful king sent back without ransom, lamenting the necessity of his affairs which obliged him, contrary to his inclination, to oppose their republic. Though this was rather too gross, the Athenians at present were so much engaged with the Social war, that they had not leisure to attend to the affairs of other nations. Philip made the best use of his time, and next projected the conquest of the gold mines of Thrace. That rich and fertile country was now held by one Cotys, a prince of such weak intellectual faculties, that the superstition of the Greeks, into which he was newly initiated, had almost entirely subverted his reason; and he wandered about in quest of the goddess Minerva, with whom he fancied himself in love. The invasion of the Macedonians, however, awakened him from his reverie; and Cotys, finding himself destitute of other means of opposition, attempted to stop the progress of the enemy by a letter. To this Philip paid no regard: the Thracians were instantly expelled from their possessions at Crenidae, where there were very valuable gold mines. These had formerly been worked by colonies from Thasos and Athens; but the colonists had long since been expelled by the barbarous Thracians, who knew not how to make use of the treasure they were in possession of. Philip took the trouble to descend into the mines himself, in order to inspect the works; and having caused them to be repaired, planted a Macedonian colony at Crenidae, bestowed upon it the name of Philippi, and drew annually from the gold mines to the value of near 1000 talents, or 200,000l. sterling; an immense sum in those days. The coins struck here were likewise called Philippi.\n\nPhilip having obtained this valuable acquisition, Settles the next took upon him to settle the affairs of Theffaly, where everything was in confusion. This country had been formerly oppressed by Alexander tyrant of Pherae; after whose death three others appeared, viz., Tisiphonius, Pitholaus, and Lycophron, the brothers-in-law of Alexander, who had likewise murdered him. By the united efforts of the Theffalians and Macedonians, however, these usurpers were easily overthrown, and effectually prevented from making any disturbances for the future; and the Theffalians, out of a mistaken gratitude, surrendered to Philip all the revenues arising from\nMAC\n\nMacedon, from their fairs and towns of commerce, as well as all the conveniences of their harbours and shipping; a conceifion which Philip took care to secure in the most effectual manner.\n\nHaving now not only established his sovereignty in the most effectual manner, but rendered himself very powerful and formidable to his neighbours, Philip determined to enjoy some repose from his fatigues. Having formed an alliance with Arybbas king of Epirus, he, in the year 357 B.C., married Olympias the sister of that prince; a match thought the more eligible, as the kings of Epirus were supposed to be descended from Achilles. The nuptials were solemnized at Pella with great pomp, and several months were spent in shows and diversions; during which Philip showed such an extreme propensity to vice of every kind, as disgraced him in the eyes of his neighbours, and most probably laid the foundation of his future domestic unhappiness. So much was this behaviour of the Macedonian monarch taken notice of by the neighbouring princes, that the Paeonians and Illyrians threw off the yoke, engaging in their schemes the king of Thrace; and notwithstanding the infant state of that prince, their designs were now carried on with more judgement than was usual with barbarians. Philip, however, notwithstanding his dissipation, got warning of his danger in sufficient time to prevent the bad consequences which might have ensued had the confederates got time to bring their matters to a proper bearing. Early in the spring 356 he took the field with the flower of the Macedonian troops. Having marched in person against the Paeonians and Thracians, he despatched Parmenio his best general into Illyria. Both enterprises proved successful; and while Philip returned victorious from Thrace, he received an account of the victory gained by Parmenio; a second messenger informed him of a victory gained by his chariot at the Olympic games; and a third, that Olympias had been delivered of a son at Pella. This was the celebrated Alexander, to whom the diviners prophesied the highest prosperity and glory, as being born in such auspicious circumstances.\n\nA short time after the birth of Alexander, Philip wrote a letter to the philosopher Aristotle, whom he chose for preceptor to his young son. The letter was written with great brevity, containing only the following words: \"Know that a son is born to us. We thank the gods not so much for their gift, as for befowling it at a time when Aristotle lives. We assure ourselves that you will form him a prince worthy of his father, and worthy of Macedon.\" He next set about the farther enlargement of his territories, which were already very considerable. Paeonia was now one of his provinces; on the east his dominions extended to the sea of Thasos, and on the west to the lake Lychnidus. The Thessalians were in effect subject to his jurisdiction, and the possession of Amphipolis had secured him many commercial advantages; he had a numerous and well-disciplined army, with plentiful resources for supporting such an armament, and carrying through the other schemes suggested by his ambition; though his deep and impenetrable policy rendered him more truly formidable than all these put together. His first scheme was the reduction of Olynthus, the most populous and fertile country on the borders of Macedon; after which his ambition prompted him to acquire the sovereignty of all Greece.\n\nTo accomplish the former, he had hitherto courted the friendship of the Olynthians by every possible method; and without letting slip any opportunity to accomplish the latter, he deprived the Athenians gradually of several of their settlements in Thrace and Macedon. In these depredations, however, he took care always to give such appearance of justice to his actions, that his antagonists, who had studied the matter less deeply, could not find a plausible pretext for engaging in war against him, even when he had openly committed hostilities against them. Philip easily perceived that the affairs of the Greeks were coming to a crisis, and he determined to wait the event of their mutual difficulties. That event did not disappoint his hopes. The Phocians had violated the religion of those days in a most extraordinary manner; they had even ploughed up the lands consecrated to Apollo; and however they might pretend to excuse themselves by examples, the Amphictyons fulminated a decree against the Phocians, commanding the sacred lands to be laid waste, and imposing a heavy fine upon the community.\n\nBy this decree all Greece was again involved in the war called Phocian, from the name of the city about which it commenced. Philip at the beginning of the troubles was engaged in Thrace, where a civil war had taken place among the sons of Cotys; and wherever Philip interfered, he was sure to make matters turn out to his own advantage. His encroachments at length became so enormous, that Kerobletes, the most powerful of the contending princes, agreed to cede the Thracian Chersonesus to the Athenians; who immediately sent Charax at the head of a powerful armament to take possession of it. In this expedition the town of Sestos was taken by storm, and the inhabitants cruelly treated by Charax, while Philip employed himself in the siege of Methone in Pieria. This city Philip loses he likewise reduced; but the king lost an eye at the siege an eye at the following extraordinary manner, if we may give the siege of Methone credit to some ancient historians. A celebrated archer, named Alter, had, it seems, offered his services to Philip, being represented as such an excellent marksman, that he could hit the swiftest bird on the wing. Philip replied, that he would be of excellent use if they were to make war with starlings. Alter, disfigured with this reception, went over to the enemy, and with an arrow wounded the king in the eye. When the weapon was extracted, it was found to have on it the following inscription: \"For the right eye of Philip.\" The king ordered the arrow to be shot back again, with another inscription, importing that he would cause Alter to be hanged when the town was taken. A report was raised after Philip's death, that he had lost his eye by prying too narrowly into the amours of Olympias and Jupiter Ammon; which the vanity of his successor prompted him to cherish, as his flatterers had probably been the inventors of it.\n\nAll this time the Phocian war raged with the greatest fury, and involved in it all the states of Greece. Lycophron, one of the Thessalian tyrants, whom Philip had formerly deprived of his authority, had again engaged in a war with Onomarchus the Phocian general to the Phocian protector-general,\nprotect him against the power of Philip, by whom he was sensible that he would soon be attacked. The king accordingly marched into Thessaly with a considerable army, defeated Phyllus the brother of Onomarchus, whom the latter had sent into the country with a detachment of 7000 men. After this he besieged and took the city of Pegasa, driving the enemy towards the frontiers of Phocis. Onomarchus then advanced with the whole army; and Philip, though inferior in numbers, did not decline the engagement. The Phocians at first gave ground, on which the Macedonians pursued, but in good order; but coming near a precipice, on the top of which Onomarchus had posted a detachment of soldiers, the latter rolled down stones and fragments of the rock in such a manner as did dreadful execution, and threw them into the utmost disorder. Philip, however, rallied his troops with great presence of mind, and prevented the Phocians from gaining any farther advantage than they had already done; saying, as he drew off his men, that they did not retreat through fear, but like rams, in order to strike with the greater vigour. Nor was he long before he made good his assertion; for having recruited his army with the greatest expedition, he returned into Thessaly at the head of 20,000 foot and 500 horse, where he was met by Onomarchus. The Macedonians at this time were superior in number to their enemies; and Philip moreover took care to remind them, that their quarrel was that of heaven, and that their enemies had been guilty of sacrilege, by profaning the temple of Delphi. That they might be still more animated in the cause, he put crowns of laurel on their heads. Thus fired by enthusiasm, and having besides the advantage of numbers, the Phocians were altogether unable to withstand them. They threw away their arms and fled towards the sea, where they expected to have been relieved by Chares, who, with the Athenian fleet, was nigh the shore; but in this they were disappointed, for he made no attempt to save them. Upwards of 6000 perished in the field of battle or in the pursuit, and 3000 were taken prisoners. The body of Onomarchus being found among the slain, was by order of Philip hung upon a gibbet as a mark of infamy, on account of his having polluted the temple; the bodies of the rest were thrown into the sea, as being all partakers of the same crime. The fate of the prisoners is not known, by reason of an ambiguity in a sentence of Diodorus Siculus, which may imply that they were drowned, though it does not expressly say so.\n\nAfter this victory, Philip set about the settlement of Thessaly, waiting only for an opportunity to put in execution his favourite scheme of invading Greece. In the mean time, he rejoiced to see the states weakening each other by their mutual dissensions; of which he never failed to take advantage as far as possible. He now, however, began to throw off the mask with regard to the Olynthians, whom he had long deceived with fair promises. Having detached Keribolites from the interest of the Athenians, he established him in the sovereignty of Thrace; not out of any good will, but with a view to destroy him whenever a proper opportunity offered. Were he once possessed of the dominions of that prince, the way to Byzantium was open to him; the possession of which must have been a great temptation to Philip, who well knew how to Macedon. value the importance of its situation both with respect to commerce and war; and in order to pave the way to this important conquest, he attacked the fortresses of Heraeum, a small and in itself unimportant place, though, by reason of its neighbourhood to Byzantium, the acquisition was valuable to Philip. The opposed Athenians, however, at last began to perceive the designs of Philip, and determined to counteract them. For this purpose they entered into an alliance with Olynthus; and having warned Keribolites of his danger, they ordered a powerful fleet to the defence of the Heraeum. But these vigorous measures were soon counteracted by the report of Philip's death, which had been occasioned by his wound at Methone, and a dis temper arising from the fatigues he had afterwards undergone. The discontented Athenians too easily gave credit to this report; and, as if all danger had been over with his death, discontinued their preparations, and directed their whole attention to the sacred war. This contest, instead of being ended by the death of Onomarchus, now raged with double fury. Philo-Continualius, above mentioned, the only surviving brother of Onomarchus, undertook the cause of the Phocians, and his affairs becoming every day more and more desperate, he undertook the most unaccountable method of retrieving them which could be imagined: having converted into ready money the most precious materials belonging to the temple at Delphi, and with this treasure doubled the pay of his soldiers. By this new piece of sacrilege, he indeed brought many adventurers to his standard, though he cut off all hopes of mercy for himself or his party should he be defeated. Having the assistance of 1000 Lacedemonians, 2000 Achaeans, and 5000 Athenian foot, with 400 cavalry, he was still enabled to make a very formidable appearance; and the Phocians took the field with great prospect of success.\n\nPhilip now thought it time to throw off the mask entirely, for which the proceedings of the Athenians, particularly their league with Olynthus, furnished him with a plausible pretext; and the revenging such horrible sacrilege as had been committed at Delphi seemed to give him a title to march at the head of an army into Greece. The superstition of the Greeks, however, had not yet blinded them to such a degree, but they could easily perceive that Philip's pietry was a mere pretence, and that his real design was to invade and conquer the whole country. The Athenians no sooner heard of the march of the Macedonian army, than they despatched, with all expedition, a strong guard to secure the pass of Thermopylae; so that Philip was obliged to return greatly chagrined and disappointed. Their next step was to call an assembly, to deliberate upon the measures proper to be taken in order to restrain the ambition of the Macedonian monarch; and this assembly is rendered memorable by the first appearance of Demosthenes as an orator against Philip. Athens for some time had been in a very alarming situation. They were deeply involved in the sacred war; their northern possessions were continually insulted and plundered by Philip; while a number of his mercenary partisans drew off the public attention to such a degree, that, instead of taking measures to counteract that ambitious prince, they amused\nmauled themselves with speculations about the designs of the Persian monarch, who was preparing for war against the Cyprians, Egyptians, and Phoenicians. Ifocrates the celebrated orator, and Phocion the statesman, joined the multitude in their present opinion, though not from any mercenary motives, but purely from a sense of the unsteady conduct of the Athenians; who, they were assured, could not contend with a prince of the vigour and activity of Philip; and therefore exhorted them by all means to cultivate the friendship of Philip, whom they could not oppose with any probability of success. Ifocrates, indeed, greatly wished for an expedition into Asia, and looked upon Philip to be the only general capable of conducting it, though at present the Greeks had no pretence for making war upon the Persians, but that of revenging former injuries: and on this subject he addressed a discourse to Philip himself; and it is even said, that Ifocrates, by the power of his rhetoric, prevailed upon Philip and the Athenians to lay aside their animosities for a short time, and consent to undertake this expedition in conjunction.\n\nIf this coalition, however, did really take place, it was of very short duration. The views of Phocion and Ifocrates were violently opposed by Demosthenes. Though sensible of the corruption and degeneracy of his countrymen, he hoped to be able to rouse them from their lethargy by dint of his eloquence; a talent he had been at great pains to cultivate, and in which he is said to have excelled all men that ever existed.\n\nIn his first addresses to the people, this celebrated orator exhorted them to awake from their indolence, and to assume the direction of their own affairs. They had been too long governed, he said, by the incapacity of a few ambitious men, to the great disadvantage as well as disgrace of the community. In the first place, an orator who had placed himself at the head of a faction of no more than 300 or 400, availed himself and his followers of the carelessness and negligence of the people, to rule them at pleasure. From a consideration of their present weakness and corruption, as well as of the designs and commotions of the neighbouring powers, he advised them to abandon all romantic and distant schemes of ambition; and instead of carrying their arms into remote countries, to prepare for repelling the attacks which might be made upon their own dominions. He insisted also upon a better regulation of their finances, a more equal distribution of the public burdens, in proportion to the abilities of those upon whom they were laid, and upon the retrenching many superfluous expenses. Having pointed out in a strong light the vigorous conduct of Philip; and shown by what means he had attained to such a respectable footing in the world, he next laid down a proper plan for their military operations. He told them, that they were not yet prepared to meet Philip in the field; they must begin with protecting Olynthus and the Chersonesus, for which it would be necessary to raise a body of 2000 light armed troops, with a due proportion of cavalry, which ought to be transported under a proper convoy to the islands of Lemnos, Thasos, and Scyros, in the neighbourhood of Macedon. In these they would enjoy all kinds of necessaries in abundance, and might avail themselves of every favourable incident, to appear at Macedon, the first summons of their allies; and either to repel the incursions of the Macedonians, or harass their territories. While this was going on, more vigorous preparations might be made for war at home; and it was proposed, that only the fourth part of the Athenian citizens should enlist, and no more supplies were wanted at present but 90 talents. But notwithstanding the moderation of these proposals, and the urgent necessities of the state, it was impossible to prevail upon the indolent and careless Athenians to provide for their own safety. They appear, indeed, at this time, to have been desperately sunk in effeminacy and dissipation; which disposition Philip took care to encourage to the utmost of his power. There was an assembly in the city called the Sixty, from their constituting originally of that number, who met expressly for the purpose of extinguishing all care about public affairs, and to intoxicate themselves with every kind of pleasure they had in their power. With this assembly Philip was so well pleased, that he sent them money to support their extravagancies; and so effectually did they answer his purposes, that all the eloquence of Demosthenes could not counteract the speeches of orators much his inferiors when backed by Macedonian gold.\n\nPhilip himself, as we have already hinted, was excessively debauched in his private character, and the most shameful stories are related of him by the ancient writers, particularly by Demosthenes. Theopompus, too, an author who flourished in the time of Alexander, and was rewarded and honoured by that monarch, also speaks of him in such terms as we cannot with decency relate; but these accounts, coming from the avowed enemies of the king, are scarcely to be credited; and perhaps policy, as well as inclination, might contribute somewhat to this scandalous behaviour, that he might thereby recommend himself to the libertines of Athens, and prevent even many of the more thinking part of the people from suspecting his designs. But in whatever excesses he might at times indulge himself, he never lost sight of his main object, the subjugation of the Greek states. On pretence of being in want of money to defray the expense of his buildings, he borrowed money at a very high price throughout the whole country; and this he found an easy matter to do, as the dilapidation of the Delphic treasuries had rendered cash very plentiful in Greece. Thus he attached his creditors firmly to his own interest; and on pretence of paying debts, was enabled without molestation to bestow a number of pensions and gratuities upon the Athenian orators, who by their treacherous harangues contributed greatly to the ruin of their country; at least as far as it could be ruined by subjection to a prince who would have obliged them to remain at peace, and apply themselves to useful arts. These he himself encouraged in a very eminent degree. The greatest part of his time was employed at Pella, which city he adorned in the most magnificent manner with temples, theatres, and porticoes. He invited by liberal rewards, the most ingenious artists in Greece; and as many of these met with very little encouragement in their own country, great numbers flocked to him from all quarters. In the government of his people, also, Philip behaved with the utmost impartiality: listening with condescension to the complaints of the meanest.\nMacedon, meanest of his subjects, and keeping up a constant correspondence with those whom he thought worthy of his acquaintance; from which, it is not easy to imagine how he could be so guilty of the vices we have already mentioned from some ancient historians.\n\nThe fate of Olynthus was now soon determined. This city, which held the balance of power between Athens and Macedon, was taken and plundered, and the inhabitants sold for slaves; but the chief hope of Philip was in putting an end to the Phocian war. For this purpose he affected a neutrality, that he might thereby become the arbiter of Greece. His hopes were well founded; for the Thebans, who were at the head of the league against the Phocians, solicited him on the one side, and the states confederate with the Phocians did the like on the other. He answered neither, yet held both in dependence. In his heart he favoured the Thebans, or rather placed his hopes of favouring his own cause in that state; for he well knew, that the Athenians, Spartans, and other states allied with Phocis, would never allow him to pass Thermopylae, and lead an army into their territories. So much respect, however, did he show to the ambassadors from these states, particularly Ctesiphon and Phrynon, who came from Athens, that they believed him to be in their interest, and reported as much to their masters. The Athenians, who were now dissolute in ease and luxury, received this news with great satisfaction; and named immediately ten plenipotentiaries to go and treat of a full and lasting peace with Philip. Among these plenipotentiaries were Demosthenes and Aeschines, the most celebrated orators in Athens. Philip gave directions that these ambassadors should be treated with the utmost civility; naming, at the same time, three of his ministers to confer with them, viz., Antipater, Pammenio, and Eurylochus. Demosthenes being obliged to return to Athens, recommended it to his colleagues not to carry on their negotiations with Philip's deputies; but to proceed with all diligence to court, there to confer with the king himself. The ambassadors, however, were so far from following his instructions, that they suffered themselves to be put off for three months by the arts of Philip and his ministers.\n\nIn the mean time, the king took from the Athenians such places in Thrace as might best cover his frontiers; giving their plenipotentiaries, in their stead, abundance of fair promises, and the strongest assurances that his good will should be as beneficial to them as ever their colonies had been. At last a peace was concluded; but then the ratification of it was deferred till Philip had possessed himself of Pherae in Thessaly, and saw himself at the head of a numerous army; then he ratified the treaty; and dismissed the plenipotentiaries with assurances, that he would be ready at all times to give the Athenians proofs of his friendship. On their return to Athens, when this matter came to be debated before the people, Demosthenes plainly told them, that, in his opinion, the promises of Philip ought not to be relied on, because they appeared to be of little significance in themselves, and came from a prince of so much art, and so little fidelity, that they could derive no authority from their maker. Aeschines, on the other hand, gave it as his sentiment, that the king of Macedon's assurances ought to give Macedon them full satisfaction. He said, that for his part, he was not politician enough to see anything of disguise or disimulation in the king's conduct; that there was great danger in disfranchising princes; and that the surest method of putting men upon deceit was to show that we suspected them of it. The rest of the plenipotentiaries concurred with Aeschines; and the people, delirious of quiet, and addicted to pleasure, easily gave credit to all that was said, and decreed that the peace should be kept. All this was the easier brought about, because Phocion, the worthiest man in the republic, did not oppose Philip; which was owing to his having a just sense of the state his country was in. He conceived, that the Athenians of those times were nothing like their ancestors; and therefore, as he expressed himself on another occasion, he was furious, since they would not be at the head of Greece themselves, that they would at least be upon good terms with that power which would be so.\n\nPhilip, who knew how to use as well as to procure past opportunity, while the Athenians were in this good Thermopyle humour, passed Thermopylae, without their knowing it, and whether he would fall on Phocis or Thebes; but he quickly undeceived them, by commanding his soldiers to put on crowns of laurel, declaring them thereby the troops of Apollo, and himself the lieutenant-general of that god. He then entered Phocis with an air of triumph; which so terrified the Phocians, whom he had caused to be proclaimed sacrilegious persons, that they immediately dismissed all thoughts of defense, and without more ado submitted to his mercy. Thus the Phocian war, which had so long employed all Greece, was ended without a stroke; and the judgment on the Phocians remitted to the Amphictyons, or grand council of Greece. By their decree the walls of three Phocian cities were demolished, the people were forbidden to inhabit in any but villages, to pay a yearly tribute of 60 talents, and never to make use either of houses or arms till they had repaid to the temple of Apollo the money they had sacrilegiously carried from thence. Their arms were taken from them, broken to pieces, and burnt; their double voice in the council was taken from them, and given to the Macedonians. Other orders were made for settling the affairs both of religion and state throughout Greece; all of which were executed by Philip with great exactness and moderation, he paying the most profound respect to the council; and, when he had performed its commands, retiring peaceably with his army back to Macedon, which gained him great reputation.\n\nAt Athens alone, the justice and piety of Philip was not understood. The people began to see, though a little too late, that they had been abused and deceived by those who had negociated the late peace. They saw that, through their acceptance of it, the Phocians, supposed by them to be destroyed; that Philip was become master of the Athenians, Thermopylae, and might enter Greece when he pleased; that, in abandoning their allies, they had abandoned themselves; and that, in all probability, they might soon feel the weight of his power, whom they had so foolishly trusted; they therefore began to take new and hostile measures; they ordered that the women should retire out of the villages into the city, their walls be repaired, and their forts new strengthened.\nThey seemed inclined to question Philip's election into the council of the Amphictyons, because it had been done without their consent; and even to proceed to an open war. In all likelihood they had carried things to extravagancy, if Demosthenes had not interposed. He told them, that though he was not for making the peace, he was however for keeping it; and that he saw no manner of occasion for their entering into so unequal a contest as would needs ensue, if they took up arms, not only against Philip, but against all the states concurring with him in the late transactions. This seems to have cooled the rage of the Athenians; and to have brought them to think of ruining Philip by degrees, as by degrees they had raised him.\n\nThe fame of his achievements without the bounds of Macedon having disproved the subjects of Philip to hope every thing from his conduct, and the several states of Greece to defer above all things his friendship; that prudent monarch laid hold of this favourable situation to fix his dominion on such a stable foundation as that a reverse of fortune should not immediately destroy it. To this end, while he carried on his negotiations through Greece, he likewise kept his army in exercise, by taking several places in Thrace, which terribly incommode the Athenians. Diopites, who had the government of the Athenian colonies in those parts, perceiving well what end Philip had in view, did not stay for instructions from home; but having raised with much expedition a considerable body of troops, taking advantage of the king's being absent with his army, entered the adjacent territories of Philip, and waited them with fire and sword.\n\nThe king, who, on account of the operations of the campaign in the Chersonese, was not at leisure to repel Diopites by force, nor indeed could divide his army without imminent hazard, chose, like an able general, rather to abandon his provinces to insults, which might be afterwards revenged, than, by following the dictates of an ill-timed passion, to hazard the loss of his veteran army, whereon lay all his hopes. He consented himself, therefore, with complaining to the Athenians of Diopites's conduct, who in a time of peace had entered his dominions, and committed such devastations as could scarcely have been justified in a time of war. His partisans supported this application with all their eloquence. They told the Athenians, that unless they recalled Diopites, and brought him to a trial for this infringement of the peace, they ought not to hope either for the friendship of Philip or of any other prince or state; neither could they justly complain, if, prompted by such a precedent, others should break faith with them, and fall without the least notice upon their dominions. Demosthenes defended Diopites; and undertook to show that he deserved the praise and not the censure of the Athenians. Those of the other party began then to charge him with crimes of a different nature; they alleged, that he oppressed the subjects and maltreated the allies of Athens. Demosthenes replied, that of these things there were as yet no proofs; that when such should appear, a single galley might be sent to bring over Diopites to abide their judgement, but that Philip would not come if they sent a fleet; whence he inferred, that they ought to be cautious, and to weigh well the merits of this cause before they took any resolution.\n\nHe said, that it was true Philip had not as yet attacked Attica, or pretended to make a descent on their territories in Greece, or to force his way into their ports; when it came to that, he was of opinion they would be hardly able to defend themselves; wherefore he thought such men were to be esteemed as fought to protect their frontiers, in order to keep Philip as long as might be at a distance: whereupon he moved, that, instead of disowning what Diopites had done, or directing him to dismiss his army, they should send him over recruits, and show the king of Macedon they knew how to protect their territories, and to maintain the dignity of their state, as well as their ancestors. These arguments had such an effect, that a decree was made conformable to his motion.\n\nWhile affairs stood thus, the Illyrians recovering courage, and seeing Philip at such a distance, harried the frontiers of Macedon, and threatened a formidable invasion; but Philip, by quick marches, arrived on the borders of Illyricum; and struck this barbarous people with such a panic, that they were glad to compound for their former depredations at the price he was pleased to fet. Most of the Greek cities in Thrace now sought the friendship of the king, and entered into a league with him for their mutual defence. As it cannot be supposed that each of these free cities had a power equal to that of Philip, we may therefore look upon him as their protector. About this time Philip's negotiations in Peloponnesus began to come to light; schemes the Argives and Messenians, growing weary of that tyrannical authority which the Spartans exercised over them, applied to Thebes for assistance; and the Thebans, out of their natural aversion to Sparta, fought to open a passage for Philip into Peloponnesus, that, in conjunction with them, he might humble the Lacedemonians. Philip readily accepted the offer; and resolved to procure a decree from the Amphictyons, directing the Lacedemonians to leave Argos and Methene free; which if they complied not with, he, as the lieutenant of the Amphictyons, might, with great appearance of justice, march with a body of troops to enforce their order. When Sparta had intelligence of this, she immediately applied to Athens, earnestly entreating assistance, as in the common cause of Greece. The Argives and Messenians, on the other hand, laboured affidavitously to gain the Athenians to their side; alleging that, if they were friends to liberty, they ought to unfit those whose only aim was to be free. Demosthenes, at this juncture, outwitted Philip, if we may borrow that king's expression; for, by a vehement harangue, he not only determined his own citizens to become the avowed enemies of the king, but also made the Argives and Messenians not over fond of him for an ally; which when Philip perceived, he laid aside all thoughts of this enterprise for the present, and began to practise in Euboea.\n\nThis country, now called Negropont, is separated from Greece by the Euripus, a strait so narrow, that Euboea might easily be united to the continent. This situation made Philip call it the fetters of Greece, which he therefore fought to have in his own hands. There had been for some years great disturbances in that country; under colour of which, Philip sent forces thither,\nMacedon, thither, and demolished Porthmos, the strongest city in those parts, leaving the country under the government of three lords, whom Demosthenes roundly calls tyrants, established by Philip. Shortly after, the Macedonians took Oreus, which was left under the government of five magistrates, styled also tyrants at Athens. Thither Plutarch of Eretria, one of the most eminent persons in Euboea, went to represent the distresses of his country, and to implore the Athenians to let it free. This suit Demosthenes recommended warmly to the people; who sent thither their famous leader Phocion, supported by formidable votes, but a very slender army; yet so well did he manage the affairs of the commonwealth and her allies, that Philip quickly found he must for a time abandon that project; which, however, he did not till he had formed another no less beneficial to himself, or less dangerous to Athens. It was the prosecution of his conquests in Thrace which he thought of pushing much farther than he had hitherto done, or could be reasonably suspected to have any intention of doing.\n\nExtraordinary preparations were made by the Macedonian monarch for this campaign. His son Alexander was left regent of the kingdom; and he himself with 20,000 men laid siege to Perinthus, one of the strongest cities in the country. At present, however, all his arts of cajoling and pretending friendship were insufficient to deceive the Athenians. They gave the command of their army and fleet to Phocion; a general of great abilities, and with whom Philip would have found it very hard to contend. On the other hand, the king of Persia began to turn jealous of the growing power of the Macedonian monarch. The Persian kings had been accustomed to regard those of Macedon as their faithful allies; but the good fortune of Philip, the continual clamour of the Athenians against him, and his dethroning at pleasure the petty princes of Thrace, made him now regarded in another light. When therefore he led his troops against Perinthus, the Great King, as he was styled by the Greeks, sent his letters mandatory to the governors of the maritime provinces, directing them to supply the place with all things in their power; in consequence of which they filled it with troops, granted subsidies in ready money, and sent besides great convoys of provision and ammunition. The Byzantines also, supposing their own turn would be next, exerted their utmost endeavours for the preservation of Perinthus; sending thither the flower of their youth, with all other necessaries for an obstinate defence. The consequence of all this was, that Philip found himself obliged to raise the siege with great loss.\n\nThat the reputation of the Macedonian arms might not sink by this disgrace, Philip made war on the Seythians and Triballi, both of whom he defeated; and then formed a design of invading Attica, though he had no fleet to transport his troops, and knew very well that the Thebans were not to be depended upon if he attempted to march through the Pifæ, and that the Thebans would even then be ready to oppose his march. To obviate all these difficulties, he had recourse to Athens itself; where by means of his partisans, he procured his old friend Æschines to be sent their deputy to the Amphictyons. This seemed a small matter, and yet was the hinge on which his whole project turned. By that time Æschines had taken his seat, a question was flared in the council, whether the Locrians of Amphilia had not been guilty of sacrilege in ploughing the fields of Cyrrha in the neighbourhood of the temple of Delphi. The assembly being divided in their opinions, Æschines proposed to take a view; which was according decreed. But when the Amphictyons came in order to see how things stood, the Locrians, either jealous of their property, or spurred thereto by the suggestions of some who saw farther than themselves, fell upon those venerable persons so rudely, that they were compelled to secure themselves by flight. The Amphictyons decreed, that an army should be raised, under the command of one of their own number, to chastise the delinquents; but as this army was to be composed of troops sent from all parts of Greece, the appearance at the rendezvous was so inconsiderable, that the Amphictyons sent to command them durst undertake nothing. The whole matter being reported to the council, Æschines, in a long and eloquent harangue, showed how much the welfare and even the safety of Greece depended on the deference paid to their decrees; and after inveighing against the want of public spirit in such as had not sent their quotas at the time appointed by the council, he moved that they should elect Philip for their general, and pray him to execute their decree. The deputies from the other states, conceiving that by this expedient their respective constituents would be free from any farther trouble or expense, came into it at once; whereupon a decree was immediately drawn up, purporting that ambassadors should be sent to Philip of Macedon, in the name of Apollo and the Amphictyons, once more to require his alliance, and to notify to him, that the states of Greece had unanimously chosen him their general, with full power to act as he thought fit against such as had opposed the authority of the Amphictyons. Thus of a sudden Philip acquired all that he sought; and having an army ready generally in expectation of this event, he immediately marched the army to execute the commands of the Amphictyons, appearance, but in reality to accomplish his own designs: For having paused into Greece with his army, instead of attacking the Locrians, he seized immediately upon Elatea, a great city of Phocis upon the river Cephissus.\n\nThe Athenians in the mean time were in the utmost confusion on the news of Philip's march. However, by the advice of Demosthenes, they invited the Thebans to join them against the common enemy of Greece, and The-Philip endeavoured as much as possible to prevent this confederacy from taking place; but all his efforts proved ineffectual. The Athenians raised an army, which marched immediately to Eleusis, where they were joined by the Thebans. The confederates made the best appearance that had ever been seen in Greece, and the troops were exceedingly good; but unfortunately the generals were men of no conduct or skill in the military art. An engagement ensued at Cheronæa; where in Alexander commanded one wing of the Macedonian defeats at army, and his father Philip the other. The confederate army was divided according to the different nations of which it consisted; the Athenians having the right and the Boeotians the left. In the beginning of the battle the confederates had the better; where-\nMacedon upon Stratocles an Athenian commander cried out, \"Come on, brother soldiers, let us drive them back to Macedon;\" which being overheard by the king, he said very coolly to one of his officers, \"These Athenians do not know how to conquer.\" Upon this he directed the files of the phalanx to be strained; and drawing his men up very close, retired to a neighbouring eminence; from whence, when the Athenians were eager in their pursuit, he rushed down with impetuosity, broke, and routed them with prodigious slaughter. The orator Demosthenes behaved very unbecomingly in this engagement; for he deserted his post, and was one of the first that fled: nay, we are told, that a stake catching hold of his robe, he, not doubting but it was an enemy, cried out, \"Alas! spare my life.\"\n\nThis victory determined the fate of Greece; and from this time we must reckon Philip supreme lord of all the Grecian states. The first use he made of his power was to convolve a general assembly, wherein he was recognized generalissimo, and with full power appointed their leader against the Persians. Having, by virtue of his authority, settled a general peace among them, and appointed the quota that each of the states should furnish for the war, he dismissed them; and returning to Macedon, began to make great preparations for this new expedition. His pretence for making war on the Persians at this time was the assistance given by the Persians to the city of Perinthus, as already mentioned. In the mean time, however, the king by reason of the dissensions which reigned in his family, was made quite miserable. He quarrelled with his wife Olympias to such a degree, that he divorced her, and married another woman named Cleopatra. This produced a quarrel between him and his son Alexander; which also came to such a height, that Alexander retired into Epirus with his mother. Some time afterwards, however, he was recalled, and a reconciliation took place in appearance; but in the meantime a conspiracy was formed against the king's life, the circumstances and causes of which are very much unknown. Certain it is, however, that it took effect, as the king was exhibiting certain shows in honour of his daughter's marriage with the king of Epirus. Philip, having given a public audience to the ambassadors of Greece, went next day in state to the theatre. All the seats were early taken up; and the shows began with a splendid procession, wherein the images of the superior deities of Greece were carried, as also the image of Philip, habited in like manner, as if he now made the 13th, at which the people shouted aloud. Then came the king alone, in a white robe, crowned, with his guards at a considerable distance, that the Greeks might see he placed his safety only in his confidence of the loyalty of his subjects. Pausanias, the assassin, however, had fixed himself close by the door of the theatre; and observing that all things fell out as he had foreseen they would, took his opportunity when the king drew near him, and plunging his sword in his left side, laid him dead at his feet. He then fled as fast as he was able towards the place where his horses were; and would have escaped, had not the twig of a vine caught his shoe and thrown him down. This gave time to those who pursued him to come up with him; but instead of securing him, in order to extract a discovery of his accomplices, they put an end to Macedon's life.\n\nWith regard to the character of this monarch, it appears certain, that he was one of the most eminent persons that ever sat on a throne. Had he lived for some time longer, he would in all probability have subdued the Persians: which was in truth less difficult than what he had already done. \"Had that event taken place (says Dr Gillies), the undertakings of his long and successful reign would have been ennobled and illuminated by the splendour of extensive foreign conquest. Philip would have reached the height of such renown as is obtained by the habits of activity, vigilance, and fortitude, in the pursuit of unbounded greatness; and in the opinion of posterity, would perhaps have surpassed the glory of all kings and conquerors who either preceded or followed him. Yet, even on this supposition, there is not any man of sense and probity, who, if he allows himself time for serious reflection, would purchase the imagined grandeur and prosperity of the king of Macedon at the price of his artifices and his crimes; and to a philosopher, who considered either the means by which he had obtained his triumphs, or the probable consequences of his dominion over Greece and Asia, the busy ambition of this mighty conqueror would appear but a deceitful scene of splendid misery.\"\n\nNo sooner did the news of Philip's death reach Athens, than, as if all danger had been past, the inhabitants showed the most extravagant signs of joy. Demosthenes and his party put on chaplets of flowers, and behaved as if they had gained a great victory. Phocion reproved them for this madness; bidding them remember, that \"the army which had beaten them at Cheronaea was lessened but by one.\" This reproof, however, had very little effect. The people heard with pleasure all the harsh things which the orators could say of the young Alexander king of Macedon, whom they represented as a giddy wrong-headed boy, ready to grasp all things in his imagination, and able to perform nothing. The affairs of Macedon indeed were in a very distracted state on the accession of Alexander: for all the neighbouring nations had the same notion of the young king with the Athenians; and being irritated by the usurpations of Philip, immediately revolted; and the states of Greece entered into a confederacy against him. The Persians had been contriving to transfer the war into Macedon; but as soon as the news of Philip's death reached them, they behaved as if all danger had been over. At the same time Attalus, one of the Macedonian commanders, aspired to the crown, and sought to draw off the soldiers from their allegiance.\n\nIn the councils held on this occasion, Alexander's best friends advised him rather to make use of dissimulation than force, and to cajole those whom they thought he could not subdue. These advices, however, were ill suited to the temper of their monarch. He thought that vigorous measures only were proper, and therefore immediately led his army into Thessaly. Here he harangued the princes so effectually, that he thoroughly gained them over to his interest, and was declared general of Greece; upon which he returned to Macedon, where he caused Attalus to be seized and put to death.\nIn the spring of the next year (335 B.C.) Alexander resolved to subdue the Triballians and Illyrians, who inhabited the countries now called Bulgaria and Slavonia, and had been very formidable enemies to the Macedonian power. In this expedition he discovered, though then but 20 years of age, a surprising degree of military knowledge. Having advanced to the passes of Mount Haemus, he found that the barbarians had posted themselves in the most advantageous manner. On the tops of the cliffs, and at the head of every passageway, they had placed their carriages and wagons in such a manner as to form a kind of parapet with their shafts inwards, that when the Macedonians should have half ascended the rock, they might be able to push their heavy carriages down upon them. They reckoned the more upon this contrivance, because of the close order of the phalanx, which, they imagined, would be terribly exposed by the soldiers wanting room to stir, and thereby avoid the falling wagons. But Alexander, having directed his heavy armed troops to march, gave orders, that where the way would permit, they should open to the right and left, and suffer the carriages to go through; but that, in the narrow passes, they should throw themselves on their faces with their shields behind them, that the carts might run over them. This had the desired effect; and the Macedonians reached the enemies works without the loss of a man. The dispute was then quickly decided; the barbarians were driven from their posts with great slaughter, and left behind them a considerable booty for the conquerors.\n\nThe next exploits of Alexander were against the Getæ, the Tanantii, and some other nations inhabiting the country on the other side of the Danube. Them he also overcame; showing in all his actions the most perfect skill in military affairs, joined with the greatest valour. In the mean time, however, all Greece was in commotion by a report which had been confidently spread abroad, that the king was dead in Illyria. The Thebans, on this news, seized Amyntas and Timolaus, two eminent officers in the Macedonian garrison which held their citadel, and dragged them to the market-place, where they were put to death without either form or process, or any crime alleged against them. Alexander, however, did not suffer them to remain long in their misfortune. He marched with such expedition, that in seven days he reached Pallene in Thessaly; and in five days more he entered Boeotia, before the Thebans had any intelligence of his passing the straits of Thermopylae. Even then they would not believe that the king was alive; but insisted that the Macedonian army was commanded by Antipater, or by one Alexander the son of Æropus. The rest of the Greeks, however, were not so hard of belief; and therefore sent no affiance to the Thebans, who were thus obliged to bear the consequences of their own folly and obstinacy. The city was taken by storm, and the inhabitants were for some hours massacred without distinction of age or sex; after which the houses were demolished, all except that of Pindar the famous poet, which was spared out of respect to the merit of its owner, and because he had celebrated Alexander I., king of Macedon. The lands, excepting those destined to religious uses, were shared among the soldiers, and all the prisoners sold for slaves; by which 440 talents were brought into the king's treasury.\n\nBy this severity the rest of the Grecian states were so thoroughly humbled, that they thought no more of making any resistance, and Alexander had nothing further to hinder him from his favourite project of invading Asia. Very little preparation was necessary for the Macedonian monarch, who went out as to an assured conquest, and reckoned upon being supplied only by the spoils of his enemies. Historians are not agreed as to the number of his army: Arrian says, that there were 30,000 foot and 5000 horse. Diodorus Siculus tells us, that there were 13,000 Macedonian foot, 7000 of the confederate states, and 5000 mercenaries. These were under the command of Parmenio. Of the Odrysians, Triballians, and Illyrians, there were 5000; and of the Agrians, who were armed only with darts, 1000. As for the horse, he tells us there were 1800 commanded by Philotas, and as many Thebalians under the command of Callas: out of the confederate states of Greece, were 600 commanded by Eurygius; and 900 Thracians and Paeonians, who led the van under Calpander. Plutarch tells us, that, according to a low computation, he had 30,000 foot and 5000 horse; and, according to the largest reckoning, he had 34,000 foot and 4000 horse. As to his fund for the payment of the army, Aristobulus says it was but 70 talents; and Onesicritus, who was also in this expedition, not only takes away the 70 talents, but affirms that the king was 200 in debt. As for provisions, there was just sufficient for a month and no more; and to prevent disturbances, Antipater was left in Macedon with 12,000 foot and 1500 horse.\n\nThe army having assembled at Amphipolis, he marched from thence to the mouths of the river Strymon; then crossing Mount Pangaeus, he took the road to Abdera. Crossing the river Ebrus, he proceeded through the country of Paëtis, and in 20 days reached Sestos; thence he came to Eleusis, where he sacrificed on the tomb of Proteus, because he was the first among the Greeks who at the siege of Troy set foot on the Asiatic shore. He did this, that his landing might be more propitious than that of the hero to whom he sacrificed, who was slain soon after. The greatest part of the army, under the command of Parmenio, embarked at Sestos, on board a fleet of 160 galleys of three benches of oars, besides small craft. Alexander himself sailed from Eleusis; and when he was in the middle of the Hellespont, offered a bull to Neptune and the Nereids, pouring forth at the same time a libation from a golden cup. When he drew near the shore, he launched a javelin, which stuck in the earth: then, in complete armour, he leaped upon the strand; and having erected altars to Jupiter, Minerva, and Hercules, he proceeded to Ilium. Here again he sacrificed to Minerva; and taking down some arms which had hung in the temple of that goddess since the time of the Trojan war, consecrated his own in their stead. He sacrificed also to the ghost of Priam, to avert his wrath on account of the descent which he himself claimed from Achilles.\n\nIn the mean time the Persians had assembled a great army in Phrygia; among whom was one Memnon a Rhodian, the best officer in the service of Darius. Alexander,\nMacedon. Alexander, as soon as he had performed all the ceremonies which he judged necessary, marched directly towards the enemy. Memnon gave it as his opinion, that they should burn and destroy all the country round, that they might deprive the Greeks of the means of subsisting, and then transport a part of their army into Macedon. But the Persians, depending on their cavalry, rejected this salutary advice; and posted themselves along the river Granicus, in order to wait the arrival of Alexander. In the engagement which happened on the banks of that river, the Persians were defeated, and Alexander became master of all the neighbouring country; which he immediately began to take care of, as if it had been part of his hereditary dominions. The city of Sardis was immediately delivered up; and here Alexander built a temple to Jupiter Olympus. After this, he restored the Ephesians to their liberty; ordered the tribute which they formerly paid to the Persians to be applied towards the rebuilding the magnificent temple of Diana; and having settled the affairs of the city, marched against Miletus. This place was defended by Memnon with a considerable body of troops who had fled thither after the battle of Granicus, and therefore made a vigorous resistance. The fortune of Alexander, however, prevailed; and the city was soon reduced, though Memnon with part of the troops escaped to Halicarnassus. After this, the king dismissed his fleet, for which various reasons have been assigned; though it is probable, that the chief one was to show his army that their only resource now was in subverting the Persian empire.\n\nAlmost all the cities between Miletus and Halicarnassus submitted as soon as they heard that the former was taken; but Halicarnassus, where Memnon commanded with a very numerous garrison, made an obstinate defence. Nothing, however, was able to resist the Macedonian army. Memnon was at last obliged to abandon the place; upon which Alexander took and razed the city of Tralles in Phrygia; received the submission of several princes tributary to the Persians; and having destroyed the Marmarians, a people of Lycaonia who had fallen upon the rear of his army, put an end to the campaign; after which he sent home all the new married men; in obedience, it would seem, to a precept of the Mosaic law, and which endeared him more to his soldiers than any other action of his life.\n\nAs soon as the season would permit, Alexander quitted the province of Phaselis; and having sent part of his army through the mountainous country to Perga, by a short but difficult road, took his route by a certain promontory, where the way is altogether impassable, except when the north winds blow. At the time of the king's march the south wind had held for a long time; but of a sudden it changed, and blew from the north so violently, that, as he and his followers declared, they obtained a safe and easy passage through the Divine affluence. By many this march is held to be miraculous, and compared to that of the children of Israel through the Red sea; while, on the other hand, it is the opinion of others, that there was nothing at all extraordinary in it. He continued his march towards Gordium, a city of Phrygia; the enemy having abandoned the strong pass of Telmissus, through which it was necessary for him to march. When he arrived at Gordium, and found himself under a necessity of staying some time there till the several corps of his army could be united, he expressed a strong desire of seeing Gordius's chariot, and the famous knot in the harness, of which such strange stories had been published to the world. The cord in which this knot was tied, was made of the inner rind of the cornel tree; and no eye could perceive where it had begun or ended. Alexander, when he could find no possible way of untying, and yet was unwilling to leave it tied lest it should cause some fears in the breasts of his soldiers, is said by some authors to have cut the cords with his sword, saying, \"It matters not how it is undone.\" But Arriabulus affirms us, that the king wrestled a wooden pin out of the beam of the waggon, which, being driven across the beam, held it up; and so took the yoke from under it. Be this as it will, however, Arrian informs us, that a great tempest of thunder, lightning, and rain, happening the succeeding night, it was held declarative of the true solution of this knot, and that Alexander should become lord of Asia.\n\nThe king having left Gordium, marched towards Cilicia; where he was attended with his usual good fortune, the Persians abandoning all the strong passes as he advanced. As soon as he entered the province, he received advice that Artales, whom Darius had made governor of Tarbus, was about to abandon it, and that the inhabitants were very apprehensive that he intended to plunder them before he withdrew. To prevent this, the king marched incessantly, and arrived just in time to save the city. But his saving it had well nigh cost him his life: for, either through the excessive fatigue of marching, as some say, or, according to others, by his plunging when very hot into the river Cydnus, which, as it runs through thick shades, has its waters excessively cold, he fell into such a distemper as threatened his immediate dissolution. His army lost their spirits immediately; the generals knew not what to do; and his physicians were so much affrighted, that the terror of his death hindered them from using the necessary methods for preserving his life. Philip the Acarnanian alone preferred temper enough to examine the nature of the king's disease; the worst symptom of which was a continual waking, and which he took off by means of a potion, and in a short time the king recovered his usual health.\n\nSoon after Alexander's recovery, he received the agreeable news that Ptolemy and Alexander had defeated the Persian generals, and made great conquests on the Hellespont; a little after that, he met the Persian army at Issus, commanded by Darius himself. A bloody engagement ensued, in which the Persians were defeated with great slaughter, as related under the article Issus. The consequences of this victory were very advantageous to the Macedonians. Many governors of provinces and petty princes submitted themselves to the conqueror; and such as did so were treated, not as a newly conquered people, but as his old hereditary subjects; being neither burdened with soldiers nor opprested with tribute. Among the number of those places which, within a short space after the battle of Issus, sent deputies to submit to the conqueror, was the city of Tyre. The king, whose name was Azelmicus,\nMacedonius, was absent in the Persian fleet; but his son was among the deputies, and was very favourably received by Alexander. The king probably intended to confer particular honours on the city of Tyre; for he acquainted the inhabitants that he would come and sacrifice to the Tyrian Hercules, the patron of their city, to whom they had erected a most magnificent temple. But these people, like most other trading nations, were too suspicious to think of admitting such an enterprising prince with his troops within their walls. They sent therefore their deputies again to him, to inform him, that they were ready to do whatever he should command them; but, as to his coming and sacrificing in their city, they could not consent to that, but were positively determined not to admit a single Macedonian within their gates. Alexander immediately dismissed their deputies in great displeasure. He then assembled a council of war, wherein he insisted strongly on the disaffected state of Greece (for most of the Grecian states had sent ambassadors to Darius, to enter into a league with him against the Macedonians), the power of the Persians by sea, and the folly of carrying on the war in distant provinces, while Tyre was left unreduced behind them: he also remarked, that if once this city was subdued, the sovereignty of the sea would be transferred to them, because it would fix their possession of the coasts; and as the Persian fleet was composed chiefly of tributary squadrons, those tributaries would fight the battles, not of their late, but of their present masters. For these reasons the siege of Tyre was resolved on. The town was not taken, however, without great difficulty; which provoked Alexander to such a degree, that he treated the inhabitants with the greatest cruelty. See Tyre.\n\nAfter the reduction of Tyre, Alexander, though the season was already far advanced, resolved to make an expedition into Syria; and in his way thither proposed to chastise the Jews, who had highly offended him during the siege of Tyre: for when he sent to them to demand provisions for his soldiers, they answered, That they were the subjects of Darius, and bound by oath not to supply his enemies. The king, however, was pacified by their submission; and not only pardoned them, but conferred many privileges upon them, as related under the article Jews.\n\nFrom Jerusalem Alexander marched directly to Gaza, the only place in that part of the world which still held out for Darius. This was a very large and strong city, situated on a high hill, about five miles from the sea-shore. One Batis or Batis, an eunuch, had the government of the place; and had made every preparation necessary for sustaining a long and obstinate siege. The governor defended the place with great valour, and several times repulsed his enemies; but at last it was taken by storm, and all the garrison slain to a man; and this secured to Alexander an entrance into Egypt, which having before been very impatient of the Persian yoke, admitted the Macedonians peaceably.\n\nHere the king laid the foundations of the city of Alexandria, which for many years after continued to be the capital of the country. While he remained here, he also formed the extraordinary design of visiting the temple of Jupiter Ammon. As to the motives by which he was induced to take this extraordinary journey, authors are not agreed; but certain it is, that he hazarded himself and his troops in the highest degree; there being two dangers in this march, which, with the example of Cambyse, who lost the greatest part of his army in it, might have terrified any body but Alexander. The first was the want of water, which, in the sandy deserts surrounding the temple, is nowhere to be found; the other, the uncertainty of the road from the fluctuation of the sands; which changing their situation every moment, leave the traveller neither a road to walk in nor mark to march by. These difficulties, however, Alexander got over; though not without a miraculous interposition, as is pretended by all his historians.\n\nAlexander having consulted the oracle, and received a favourable answer, returned to pursue his conquests. Having settled the government of Egypt, he appointed the general rendezvous of his forces at Tyre. Here he met with ambassadors from Athens, requesting him to pardon such of their countrymen as he found serving the enemy. The king, being desirous to oblige such a famous state, granted their request; and sent also a fleet to the coast of Greece, to prevent the effects of some commotions which had lately happened in Peloponnesus. He then directed his march to Thapsacus; and having passed the Euphrates and Tigris, met with Darius near Arbela, where the Persians were again overthrown with prodigious slaughter, and Alexander in effect became master of the Persian empire.\n\nAfter this important victory, Alexander marched directly to Babylon, which was immediately delivered up; the inhabitants being greatly disaffected to the Sufa, and Persian interest. After 30 days stay in this country, the king marched to Sufa, which had already surrendered to Philoxenus; and here he received the treasures of the Persian monarch, amounting, according to the most generally received account, to 50,000 talents. Having received also at this time a supply of 6000 foot and 500 horse from Macedon, he set about reducing the nations of Media, among whom Darius was retired. He first reduced the Uxians, and having forced a passage to Persepolis the capital of the empire, he like a barbarian destroyed the stately palace there, a pile of building not to be equalled in any part of the world; after having given up the city to be plundered by his soldiers. In the palace he found 120,000 talents, which he appropriated to his own use, and caused immediately to be carried away upon mules and camels; for he had such an extreme aversion to the inhabitants of Persepolis, that he determined to leave nothing valuable in the city.\n\nDuring the time that Alexander remained at Persepolis, he received intelligence that Darius remained at Ecbatana the capital of Media; upon which he pursued him with the greatest expedition, marching at the rate of near 40 miles a-day. In 15 days he reached Ecbatana, where he was informed that Darius had retired from thence five days before, with an intent to pass into the remotest provinces of his empire. This put some stop to the rapid progress of the Macedonian army; and the king, perceiving that there was no necessity for hurrying himself and his soldiers in such a manner, began to give the orders requisite in the present situation of his affairs. The Thebalian horse,\nMacedon horse, who had deserved exceedingly well of him in all his battles, he dismissed according to his agreement; gave them their whole pay, and ordered 2000 talents over and above to be distributed among them. He then declared that he would force no man; but if any were willing to serve him longer for pay, he desired they would enter their names in a book, which a great many of them did; the rest sold their horses, and prepared for their departure. The king appointed Eupollus to conduct them to the sea, and assigned him a body of horse as an escort: he likewise sent Menetres with them, to take care of their embarkation, and that they were safely landed in Euboea without any expense to themselves.\n\nOn receiving fresh information concerning the state of Darius's affairs, the king set out again in pursuit of him, as far as Rhages, a city one day's journey from the Caspian straits: there he understood that Darius had passed those straits some time before; which information leaving him again without hopes, he halted for five days. Oxidates, a Persian whom Darius had left prisoner at Sula, was made governor of Media, while the king departed on an expedition into Parthia. The Caspian straits he passed immediately without opposition; and then gave directions to his officers to collect a quantity of provisions sufficient to serve his army on a long march through a wasted country. But before his officers could accomplish those commands, the king received intelligence that Darius had been murdered by Bessus, one of his own subjects, and governor of Bactria, as is related at length under the article Persia.\n\nAs soon as Alexander had collected his forces together, and settled the government of Parthia, he entered Hyrcania; and having, according to his usual custom, committed the greatest part of his army to the care of Craterus, he, at the head of a choice body of troops, passed through certain craggy roads, and before the arrival of Craterus, who took an open and easy path, struck the whole provinces with such terror, that all the principal places were immediately put into his hands, and soon after the province of Aria also submitted, and the king continued Satibarzanes the governor in his employment.—The reduction of this province finished the conquest of Persia; but the ambition of Alexander to become master of every nation of which he had the least intelligence, induced him to enter the country of the Mardi, merely because its rocks and barrenness had hitherto hindered any body from conquering, or indeed from attempting to conquer it. This conquest, however, he easily accomplished, and obliged the whole nation to submit to his pleasure. But in the mean time disturbances began to arise in Alexander's new empire, and among his troops, which all his activity could not thoroughly suppress. He had scarcely left the province of Aria, when he received intelligence, that the traitor Bessus had caused himself to be proclaimed king of Asia by the name of Artaxerxes; and that Satibarzanes had joined him, after having massacred all the Macedonians who had been left in the province. Alexander appointed one Arjames governor in the room of Satibarzanes; and marched thence with his army against the Zarangee, who, under the command of Barzaentes, one of those who had conspired against Darius, had taken up arms, and threatened to make an obstinate defence. But their numbers daily falling off, Barzaentes being afraid they would purchase their own safety at the expense of his, privately withdrew from his camp, and crossing the river Indus, sought shelter among the nations beyond it. But they, either dreading the power of Alexander, or detesting the treachery of this Persian towards his former master, seized and delivered him up to Alexander, who caused him immediately to be put to death.\n\nThe immense treasure which the Macedonians had acquired in the conquest of Persia began now to corrupt them. The king himself was of a most generous disposition, and liberally bestowed his gifts on those luxury around him; but they made a bad use of his bounty, and foolishly indulged in those vices by which the former possessors of that wealth had lost it. The king did all in his power to discourage the lazy and inactive pride which now began to show itself among his officers; but neither his discourses nor his example had any considerable effect. The manners of his courtiers from bad became worse, in spite of all he could say or do to prevent it; and at last they proceeded to censure his conduct, and to express themselves with some bitterness on the subject of his long continuance of the war, and his leading them constantly from one labour to another. This came to such a height, that the king was at last obliged to use some severity, in order to keep his army within the limits of their duty.\n\nFrom this time forward, however, Alexander himself began to alter his conduct; and by giving a little into the customs of the Orientals, endeavoured to secure that obedience from his new subjects which he found so difficult to be preserved among his old ones. He likewise endeavoured, by various methods, to blend the customs of the Africans and the Greeks. The form of his civil government resembled that of the ancient Persian kings: in the military affairs however, he preferred the Macedonian discipline; but then he made choice of 30,000 boys out of the provinces, whom he caused to be instructed in the Greek language, and directed to be brought up in such a manner as that from time to time he might with them fill up the phalanx. The Macedonians law with great concern these extraordinary measures, which suited very ill with their gross understandings; for they thought, after all the victories they had gained, to be absolute lords of Asia, and to possess not only the riches of its inhabitants, but to rule the inhabitants themselves: whereas they now saw, that Alexander meant no such thing; but that, on the contrary, he conferred governments, offices at court, and all other marks of confidence and favour, indiscriminately both on Greeks and Persians.—From this time also the king seems to have given instances of a cruelty he had never shown before. Philotas his most intimate friend was seized, tortured, and put to death for a conspiracy of which it could never be proved that he was guilty; and soon after Parmenio and some others were executed without any crime at all real or alleged. These things very much disturbed the army. Some of them wrote home to Macedon of the king's suspicions of his friends, and his disposition to hunt cut enemies at the very extremities of the world. Alexander having intercepted some of these letters, and\nMacedon procured the best information he could concerning their authors, picked out these disaffected people, and having disposed them into a corps, gave it the title of the turbulent battalion; hoping by this means to prevent the spirit of disaffection from pervading the whole army.\n\nAs a farther precaution against any future conspiracy, Alexander thought fit to appoint Hephaestion and Clytus generals of the auxiliary horse; being apprehensive, that if this authority was lodged in the hands of a single person, it might prompt him to dangerous undertakings, and at the same time furnish him with the means of carrying them into execution. To keep his forces in action, he suddenly marched into the country of the Euergetae, i.e., Benefactors; and found them full of that kind and hospitable disposition for which that name had been bestowed on their ancestors: he therefore treated them with great respect; and at his departure added some lands to their dominions, which lay contiguous, and which for that reason they had requested of him.\n\nTurning then to the east, he entered Arachosia, the inhabitants of which submitted without giving him any trouble. While he passed the winter in these parts, the king received advice, that the Arians, whom he had so lately subdued, were again up in arms, Satibarzanes being returned into that country with two thousand horse assigned him by Bessus. Alexander instantly despatched Artabazus the Persian, with Erigys and Caranus, two of his commanders, with a considerable body of horse and foot; he likewise ordered Phrataphernes, to whom he had given the government of Parthia, to accompany them. A general engagement ensued, wherein the Arians behaved very well, as long as their commander Satibarzanes lived; but he engaging Erigys, the Macedonian struck him first into the throat, and then, drawing forth his spear again, through the mouth; so that he immediately expired, and with him the courage of his soldiers, who instantly began to fly; whereupon Alexander's commanders made an easy conquest of the rest of the country, and settled it effectually under his obedience.\n\nThe king, notwithstanding the inclemency of the season, advanced into the country of Paropamisus, so called from the mountain Paropamisus, which the soldiers of Alexander called Caucassus. Having crossed the country in 16 days, he came at length to an opening leading into Media; which finding of a sufficient breadth, he directed a city to be built there, which he called Alexandria, as also several other towns about a day's journey distant from thence; and in these places he left 7000 persons, part of them such as had hitherto followed his camp, and part of the mercenary soldiers, who, weary of continual fatigue, were content to dwell there. Having thus settled things in this province, sacrificed solemnly to the gods, and appointed Proxes the Persian president thereof with a small body of troops under the command of Niloxenus to assist him, he resumed his former design of penetrating into Bactria.\n\nBessus, who had assumed the title of Artaxerxes, when he was assured that Alexander was marching towards him, immediately began to waste all the country between Paropamisus and the river Oxus; which river he passed with all his forces, and then burnt all Macedon, the vessels he had made use of for transporting them, retiring to Nautaca, a city of Sogdia; fully persuaded, that, by the precautions he had taken, Alexander would be compelled to give over his pursuit. This conduct of his, however, disheartened his troops, and gave the lie to all his pretensions; for he had affected to censure Darius's conduct, and had charged him with cowardice, in not defending the rivers Euphrates and Tigris, whereas he now quitted the banks of the most defensible river perhaps in the whole world. As to his hopes, though it cannot be said they were ill founded, yet they proved absolutely vain; for Alexander, continuing his march, notwithstanding all the hardships his soldiers sustained, reduced all Bactria under his obedience, particularly the capital Bactria and the strong castle Aornus: in the latter he placed a garrison under the command of Archaes; but the government of the province he committed to Artabazus. He then continued his march to the river Oxus: on the banks of which when he arrived, he found it three quarters of a mile over, its depth more than proportionate to its breadth, its bottom sandy, its stream so rapid as to render it almost unnavigable, and neither boat nor tree in its neighbourhood; so that the ablest commanders in the Macedonian army were of opinion that they should be obliged to march back. The king, however, having first sent away, under a proper effort, all his infirm and worn-out soldiers, that they might be conducted safe to the sea-ports, and from thence to Greece, devised a method of passing this river without either boat or bridge, by causing the hides which covered the soldiers' tents and carriages to be stuffed with straw, and then tied together, and thrown into the river. Having crossed the Oxus, he marched directly towards the camp of Bessus, where, when he arrived, he found it abandoned; but received at the same time letters from Spitamenes and Dataphernes, who were the chief commanders under Bessus, signifying, that, if he would send a small party to receive Bessus, they would deliver him into his hands; which they did accordingly, and the traitor was put to death in the manner related in the history of Persia.\n\nA supply of horses being now arrived, the Macedonian cavalry were remounted. Alexander continued his march to Maracanda the capital of Sogdia, from whence he advanced to the river Iaxartes. Here he performed great exploits against the Scythians; from whom, however, though he overcame them, his army suffered much; and the revolted Sogdians being headed by Spitamenes, gave him a great deal of trouble. Here Alexander married Roxana the daughter of Oxyartes, a prince of the country whom he had subdued. But during these expeditions, the king greatly disgusted his army by the murder of his friend Clytus in a drunken quarrel at a banquet, and by his extravagant vanity in claiming divine honours.\n\nAt last he arrived at the river Indus, where Hephaestion and Perdiccas had already provided a bridge of boats for the passage of the army. The king refreshed his troops for 30 days in the countries on the other side of the river, which were those of his friend and ally Taxiles, who gave him 30 elephants, and joined his army now with 700 Indian horse, to which, when they were to enter upon action, he afterwards added 5000 foot,\nThe true reason of this seems to have been his enmity to Porus, a famous Indian prince whose territories lay on the other side of the river Hydaspes. During this recess, the king sacrificed with great solemnity; receiving also ambassadors from Ambiburus, a very potent prince, and from Doxareas, who was likewise a king in those parts, with tenders of their duty, and considerable presents. These ceremonies over, Alexander appointed Philip governor of Taxila, and put a Macedonian garrison into the place, because he intended to erect a hospital there for the cure of his sick and wounded soldiers. He then ordered the vessels, of which his bridge had been composed when he passed the Indus, to be taken to pieces, that they might be brought to the Hydaspes, where he was informed that Porus with a great army lay encamped to hinder his passage. When he approached the banks of this river with his army and the auxiliaries under the command of Taxiles, he found that the people he had to do with were not so easily to be subdued as the Persians and other Asiatics. The Indians were not only a very tall and robust, but also a very hardy and well disciplined people; and their king Porus was a prince of high spirit, invincible courage, and great conduct.\n\nIt was about the summer solstice when Alexander reached the Hydaspes, and consequently its waters were broader, deeper, and more rapid, than at any other time; for in India the rivers swell as the sun's increasing heat melts the snow, and subside again as winter approaches. Alexander therefore had every difficulty to struggle with. Porus had made his dispositions so judiciously, that Alexander found it impossible to practise upon him as he had done upon others, and to pass the river in this view: wherefore he was constrained to divide his army into small parties, and to practise other arts, in order to get the better of so vigilant a prince. To this end he caused a great quantity of corn and other provisions to be brought into his camp; giving out, that he intended to remain where he was till the river fell, and by becoming fordable should give him an opportunity of forcing a passage: this did not, however, hinder Porus from keeping up very strict discipline in his camp; which when Alexander perceived, he frequently made such motions as seemed to indicate a change of his resolution, and that he had still thoughts of passing the river. The main thing the Macedonians stood in fear of were the elephants; for the bank being pretty steep on the other side, and it being the nature of horses to start at the first appearance of those animals, it was foreseen that the army would be disordered, and incapable of sustaining the charge of Porus's troops.\n\nAt length Alexander passed the river by the following contrivance. There was, at the distance of 150 stadia from his camp, a rocky promontory projecting into the river, thick covered with wood; and over against this promontory there lay a pretty large uninhabited island almost overgrown with trees. The king therefore conceived within himself a project of conveying a body of troops from this promontory into that island; and upon this scheme he built his hopes of surprising Porus, vigilant as he was. To this end he kept him and his army constantly alarmed for many nights together, till he perceived that Porus apprehended it was only done to harass his troops, and therefore no longer drew out of his camp, but trusted to his ordnance guards: then Alexander resolved to put his design in execution. A considerable body of horse, the Macedonian phalanx, with some corps of light-armed foot, he left in his camp under the command of Craterus, as also the auxiliary Indians, giving these orders, to be observed in his absence, that if Porus marched against him with part of his army, and left another part with the elephants behind in his camp, Craterus and his forces should remain where they were; but if it so happened that Porus withdrew his elephants, then Craterus was to pass the river, because his cavalry might then do it safely. Alexander having marched half the way, or about nine of our miles, ordered the mercenary troops under the command of Attalus and other generals, to remain there; and directed them, that as soon as they knew he was engaged with the Indians on the other side, they should pass in vessels provided for that purpose, in order to assist him. Then marching a long way about, that the enemy might not perceive his design of reaching the rock, he advanced as diligently as he could towards that point. It happened very fortunately for him, that a great storm of thunder, lightning, and hail, rose in the night, whereby his march was perfectly concealed, his vessels of 30 oars put together, and his tents flatted and stitched, so that they passed from the rock into the island, without being perceived, a little before break of day; the storm ceasing just as he and his soldiers were ready for their passage. When they had traversed the island, they boldly set forward to gain the opposite shore in sight of Porus's outguards, who instantly posted away to give their master an account of the attempt. Alexander landed first himself, and was followed as expeditiously as possible by his forces, whom he took care to draw up as fast as they arrived. When they began their march again, they found that their good fortune was not so great as at first they esteemed it; for it appeared now, that they had not reached the continent at all, but were in truth in another island much larger than the former. They crossed it as fast as they could, and found that it was divided from the terra firma by a narrow channel, which, however, was so swollen by the late heavy rain, that the poor soldiers were obliged to wade up to the breast. When they were on the other side, the king drew them up again carefully, ordering the foot to march slowly, they being in number about 6000, while himself with 3000 horse advanced before. As soon as Porus received intelligence that Alexander was actually passing the river, he sent his son with 2000 horse and 120 armed chariots, to oppose him. But they came too late: Alexander was already got on shore, and even on his march.\n\nWhen the Macedonian scouts perceived them advancing, they informed the king, who sent a detachment to attack them, remaining still at the head of his cavalry in expectation of Porus. But when he found that this party was unsupported, he instantly attacked with all his horse, and defeated them with the slaughter of many, and the loss of all their armed chariots, the son of Porus being slain in the fight. The remainder of the horse returning to the camp with this disastrous account, Porus was in some confusion; however, he took very quickly the best and wisest resolutions his circumstances would allow: which were,\nto leave a party of his army, with some of his elephants, to oppose Craterus, who was now about to pass the river also; and, with the rest, to march against Alexander and his forces, who were already palled. This resolution once taken, he marched immediately out of his camp at the head of 4000 horse, 30,000 foot, 300 chariots, and 200 elephants. He advanced as expeditiously as he could, till he came into a plain which was firm and sandy, where his chariots and elephants might act to advantage: there he halted, that he might put his army in order, knowing well that he need not go in quest of his enemy. Alexander soon came up with his horse, but he did not charge Porus; on the contrary, he halted, and put his troops in order, that they might be able to defend themselves in case they were attacked. When he had waited some time, his foot arrived; whom he immediately surrounded with his horse, that, after so fatiguing a march, they might have time to cool and breathe themselves, before they were led to engage. Porus permitted all this, because it was not his interest to fight, and because he depended chiefly upon his order of battle, the elephants covering his foot, so that the Macedonians could not charge them.\n\nWhen Alexander had disposed his foot in proper order, he placed his horse on the wings: and, observing that he was much superior in them to the enemy, and that the cavalry of Porus were easy to be charged, he resolved to let the foot have as little share as possible in the battle. To this end, having given the necessary directions to Comus who commanded them, he went himself to the right, and with great fury fell upon the left wing of Porus. The dispute, though short, was very bloody: the cavalry of Porus, though they fought gallantly, were quickly broken; and the foot being by this means uncovered, the Macedonians charged them. But the Indian horse rallying, came up to their relief, yet were again defeated. By this time the archers had wounded many of the elephants, and killed most of their riders, so that they did not prove less troublesome and dangerous to their own side than to the Macedonians; whence a great confusion ensued: and Comus, taking this opportunity, fell on with the troops under his command, and entirely defeated the Indian army. Porus himself behaved with the greatest intrepidity, and with the most excellent conduct: he gave his orders and directed every thing, as long as his troops retained their form; and when they were broken, he retired from party to party as they made stands, and continued fighting till every corps of Indians was put to the rout. In the mean time Craterus had passed with the rest of the Macedonian army; and these, falling upon the flying Indians, increased the slaughter of the day excessively, insomuch that 20,000 foot and 3000 horse were killed, all the chariots were hacked to pieces, and the elephants not killed were taken; two of Porus's sons fell here, as also most of his officers of all ranks.\n\nAs for Porus, Alexander gave strict directions that no injury might be done to his person: he even sent Taxiles to persuade him to surrender himself, and to assure him that he should be treated with all the kindness and respect imaginable; but Porus, disdaining this advice from the mouth of an old enemy, threw a javelin at him, and had killed him but for the quick turn of his horse. Mevoe the Indian, who was also in the Macedonian service of Alexander, succeeded better: he had been the old acquaintance of Porus; and therefore when he entreated that prince to spare his person, and to submit himself to fortune and a generous victor, Porus followed his advice; and we may truly say, that the condition of this Indian king suffered nothing by the losser of the battle. Alexander immediately gave him his liberty, restored him shortly after to his kingdom, to which he annexed provinces almost equal to it in value. Neither was Alexander a loser by his munificence; for Porus remained his true friend and constant ally.\n\nTo perpetuate the memory of this victory, Alexander ordered two cities to be erected; one on the field of battle, which he named Nicaea; the other on this side the river, which he called Bucephala, in honour of his horse Bucephalus, who died here, as Arrian says, of mere old age, being on the verge of 30. All the soldiers who fell in the battle, he buried with great honours; offered solemn sacrifices to the gods, and exhibited pompous shows on the banks of the Hydaspes, where he had forced his passage. He then entered the territories of the Glautea, in which were 37 good cities, and a multitude of populous villages. All these were delivered up to him without fighting; and as soon as he received them, he presented them to Porus; and having reconciled him to Taxiles, he sent the latter home to his own dominions. About this time ambassadors arrived from some Indian princes with their submissions: and Alexander having conquered the dominions of another Porus, which lay on the Hydaspes, a branch of the Indus, added them to those of Porus his ally.\n\nIn the middle of all this success, however, news arrived, that the Catehi, the Oxyracae, and the Malli, the most warlike nations of India, were confederated against the Macedonians, and had drawn together a great army. The king immediately marched to give them battle; and in a few days reached a city called Sangala, seated on the top of a hill, and having a fine lake behind it. Before this city the confederate Sangala Indians lay encamped, having three circular lines of taken carriages locked together, and their tents pitched in the centre. Notwithstanding the apparent difficulty of forcing these intrenchments, Alexander resolved immediately to attack them. The Indians make a noble defence; but at last the first line of their carriages was broken, and the Macedonians entered. The second was stronger by far; yet Alexander attacked that too, and after a desperate resistance forced it. The Indians, without quitting to the third, retired into the city; which Alexander would have invested; but the foot he had with him not being sufficient for that purpose, he caused his works to be carried on both sides as far as the lake; and, on the other side of that, ordered several brigades of horse to take post; ordering also battering engines to be brought up, and in some places employing miners. The second night, he received intelligence that the beleaguered, knowing the lake to be fordable, intended to make their escape through it. Upon this the king ordered all the carriages which had been taken in forcing their camp to be placed up and down the roads, in hopes of hindering their flight; giving directions to Ptolemy, who commanded\nMacedon commanded the horse on the other side of the lake, to be extremely vigilant, and to cause all his trumpets to sound, that the forces might repair to that post where the Indians made their greatest effort. These precautions had all the effect that could be desired: for of the few Indians who got through the lake, and passed the Macedonian horse, the greater part were killed on the roads; but the greatest part of their army was constrained to retire again through the water into the city. Two days after, the place was taken by storm. Seventeen thousand Indians were killed; 70,000 taken prisoners; with 300 chariots, and 500 horse. The Macedonians are said to have lost only 100 men in this siege; but they had 1200 wounded, and among these several persons of great distinction.\n\nThe city was no sooner taken, than Alexander despatched Eumenes his secretary, with a party of horse, to acquaint the inhabitants of the cities adjacent with what had befallen the Sangalans; promising also, that they should be kindly treated if they would submit. But they were so much affrighted at what had happened to their neighbours, that, abandoning all their cities, they fled into the mountains; choosing rather to expose themselves to wild beasts, than to these invaders, who had treated their countrymen so cruelly. When the king was informed of this, he sent detachments of horse and foot to scour the roads; and these, finding aged, infirm, and wounded people, to the number of about 500, put them to the sword without mercy. Perceiving that it was impossible to persuade the inhabitants to return, he caused the city of Sangala to be razed, and gave the territories to the few Indians who had submitted to him.\n\nAlexander, still unsatisfied with conquest, now prepared to pass the Hyphasis. The chief reason which induced him to think of this expedition was, the information he had received of the state of the countries beyond that river. He was told that they were in themselves rich and fruitful; that their inhabitants were not only a very martial people, but very civilized; that they were governed by the nobility, who were themselves subject to the laws; and that as they lived in happiness and freedom, it was likely they would fight obstinately in defence of those blessings. He was farther told, that among these nations there were the largest, strongest, and most useful elephants bred and tamed; and was therefore fired with an earnest desire to reduce such a bold and brave people under his rule, and of attaining to the possession of the many valuable things that were said to be amongst them.\n\nAs exorbitant, however, as his personal ambition was, he found it impossible to infuse any part of it into the minds of his soldiers; who were so far from wishing to triumph over new and remote countries, that they were highly desirous of leaving those that they had already conquered. When therefore they were informed of the king's intentions, they privately consulted together in the camp about the situation of their own affairs. At this consultation, the gravelest and best of the soldiers lamented that they were made use of by their king, not as lions, who fall fiercely upon those who have injured them; but as mastiffs, who fly upon and tear those who are pointed out to them as enemies. The rest were not so modest; but expressed themselves roundly against the king's humour for leading them from battle to battle, from siege to siege, and from river to river; protesting that they would follow him no further, nor lavish away their lives any longer, to purchase fame for him.\n\nAlexander was a man of too much penetration not to be early in perceiving that his troops were very uneasy. He therefore harangued them from his tribunal; but though his eloquence was great, and the love his army had for him was yet very strong, they did not relent. For some time the soldiers remained sullen and silent; and at last turned their eyes on Coenus, an old and experienced general, whom Alexander loved, and in whom the army put great confidence. He had the generosity to undertake their cause; and told Alexander frankly, \"That men endured toil in hopes of repose; that the Macedonians were already much reduced in their numbers; that of those who remained, the greater part were invalids; and that they expected, in consideration of their former services, that he would now lead them back to their native country: an act which, of all others, would most contribute to his own great designs; since it would encourage the youth of Macedon, and even of all Greece, to follow him in whatever new expedition he pleased to undertake.\" The king was far from being pleased with this speech of Coenus, and much less with the disposition of his army, which continued in a deep silence. He therefore dismissed the assembly: but next day he called another, wherein he told the soldiers plainly, that he would not be driven from his purpose; that he would proceed in his conquests with such as should follow him voluntarily; as for the rest, he would not detain them, but would leave them at liberty to go home to Macedon, where they might publish, \"that they had left their king in the midst of his enemies.\" Even this expedient had no success; his army was so thoroughly tired with long marches and desperate battles, that they were determined to go no further, either for fair speeches or foul. Upon this Alexander retired to his tent, where he refused to see his friends, and put on the same gloomy temper that reigned among his troops. For three days things remained in this situation. At last the king suddenly appeared; and, as if he had been fully determined to pursue his first design, he gave orders for sacrificing for the good success of his new undertaking. Ariander the augur reported, that the omens were altogether auspicious; upon which the king said, that since his proceeding farther was neither pleasing to the gods, nor grateful to his army, he would return. When this was rumoured among the army, they assembled in great numbers about the royal tent, saluting the king with loud acclamations, wishing him success in all his future designs; giving him at the same time hearty thanks, for that \"he who was invincible had suffered himself to be overcome by their prayers.\"\n\nA stop being thus put to the conquests of Alexander, he determined to make the Hyphasis the boundary of his dominions; and having erected twelve altars of an extraordinary magnitude, he sacrificed on them: after which he exhibited shows in the Grecian manner; and, having added all the conquered country in these parts to the dominions of Porus, he began\nMacedon began to return. Having arrived at the Hydaspes, he made the necessary preparations for sailing down the Indus into the ocean. For this purpose, he ordered vast quantities of timber to be felled in the neighborhood of the Hydaspes, through which he was to sail into the Indus; he caused the vessels with which he had passed other rivers to be brought thither, and assembled a vast number of artificers capable of repairing and equipping his fleet; which, when finished, consisted of 80 vessels of three banks of oars, and 2000 lesser ships and transports. Those who were to manage this fleet were collected out from the Phoenicians, Cyprians, Carians, and Egyptians following his army, and who were reckoned perfectly well skilled in the naval art. When all things were ready, the army embarked about break of day; the king, in the meantime, sacrificing to the gods according to the ceremonies used in his own country, and likewise according to those of the country where he now was. Then he himself went on board; and causing the signal to be given by sound of trumpet, the fleet set sail.\n\nCraterus and Hephestion had marched some days before with another division of the army; and in three days the fleet reached that part of the river which was opposite to their camps. Here he had information, that the Oxhydrace and Malli were raising forces to oppose him; upon which he immediately determined to reduce them; for, during this voyage, he made it a rule to compel the inhabitants on both sides of the river to yield him obedience. But before he arrived on the coasts of the people above mentioned, he himself sustained no small danger; for, coming to the confluence of the Aceines with the Hydaspes, from whence both rivers roll together into the Indus, the eddies, whirlpools, and rapid currents, rushing with tremendous noise from the respective channels of those rivers into the great one formed by them both, at once terrified those who navigated his vessels, and actually destroyed many of the long vessels, with all who were aboard of them; the king himself being in some danger, and Nearchus the admiral not a little at a loss. As soon as this danger was over, Alexander went on shore; and having ordered his elephants with some troops of horse and archers to be carried across, and put under the command of Craterus, he then divided his army on the left hand bank into three bodies; the first commanded by himself, the second by Hephestion, and the third by Ptolemy. Hephestion had orders to move silently through the heart of the country, five days march before the king; that if, on Alexander's approach, any of the barbarians should attempt to shelter themselves by retiring into the country, they might fall into the hands of Hephestion. Ptolemy Lagus was ordered to march three days journey behind the king, that if any escaped his army, they might fall into Ptolemy's hands; and the fleet had orders to stop at the confluence of this river with the Hydriotes till such time as these several corps should arrive.\n\nAlexander himself, at the head of a body of horse and light armed foot, marched through a desert country against the Malli; and, scarce affording any rest to his soldiers, arrived in three days at a city into which the barbarians had put their wives and children, with a good garrison for their defence. The country people, having no notion that Alexander would march Macedon through such a desert and barren region, were all unarmed, and in the utmost confusion. Many of them therefore were slain in the field; the rest fled into the city, and shut the gates. But this only protracted their fate for a short time; for the king, having ordered the city to be invested by his cavalry, took it, as well as the castle, by storm, and put all he found there to the sword. He sent at the same time Perdiccas with a considerable detachment, to invest another city of the Malli at a considerable distance; but when he came there, he found it abandoned. However, he pursued the inhabitants who had but lately left it, and killed great numbers of them on the road. After this the king took several other cities, but not without considerable resistance; for the Indians sometimes chose to burn themselves in their houses rather than surrender. At last he marched to their capital city; and finding that abandoned, he proceeded to the river Hydriotes, where he found 50,000 men encamped on the opposite bank, in order to dispute his passage. He did not hesitate, however, to enter the river with a considerable party of horse; and so much were the Indians terrified at his presence, that their whole army retired before him. In a short time they returned and attacked him, being ashamed to fly before such an inconsiderable number; but in the mean time the rest of the Macedonian forces came up, and the Indians were obliged to retire to a city which lay behind them, and which Alexander invested that very night. The next day he stormed the city with such violence, that the inhabitants were compelled to abandon it, and to retire to the castle, where they prepared for an obstinate defense. The king instantly gave orders for scaling the walls, and the soldiers prepared to execute these orders as fast as they could; but the king being impatient caught hold of a ladder and mounted it first himself, being followed by Leonatus, Peuceftas, and Abreas, the latter a man of great valor, and who on that account had double pay allowed him. The king having gained the top of the battlements, cleared them quickly of the defenders, killing some of them with his sword, and pushing others over the walls; but after this was done, he was in more danger than ever; for the Indians galled him with their arrows from the adjacent towers, though they durst not come near enough to engage him. His own battalion of targeteers mounting in haste to second him, broke the ladders; which, as soon as Alexander perceived, he threw himself down into the castle, as did also Peuceftas, Leonatus, and Abreas. As soon as the king was on the ground, the Indian general rushed forward to attack him; but Alexander instantly despatched him, as well as several others who followed him. Upon this the rest retired, and contented themselves with throwing darts and stones at him at a distance. Abreas was struck into the head with an arrow, and died on the spot; and, shortly after, another pierced through the king's breastplate into his body. As long as he had spirits, he defended himself valiantly; but, through a vast effusion of blood, losing his senses, he fell upon his shield. Peuceftas then covered him with the sacred shield of Pallas on one side, as did Leonatus with his own shield on the other; though they themselves were dreadfully...\ndreadfully wounded. In the mean time, however, the soldiers on the outside, eager to save their king, supplied their want of ladders, by driving large iron pins into the walls. By the help of these many of them ascended, and came to the affluence of Alexander and his companions. The Indians were now slaughtered without mercy; but Alexander continued for some time in a very dangerous way; however, he at last recovered his strength, and showed himself again to his army, which filled them with the greatest joy.\n\nThe Malli, being now convinced that nothing but submission could save the remainder of them, sent deputies to Alexander, offering the dominion of their country; as did also the Oxydraces: and the king having settled every thing in these countries agreeable to his mind, proceeded on his voyage down the river Indus. In this voyage he received the submission of some other Indian princes; and perceiving, that at the point of the island Pattala, the river divided itself into two vast branches, he ordered an haven and convenient docks to be made there for his ships; and when he had careened his fleet, he sailed down the right hand branch towards the ocean. In his passage he sustained great difficulties by reason of his want of pilots; and at the mouth of the river very narrowly missed being cast away: yet all this did not hinder him from pursuing his first design, though it does not appear that he had any other motive thereto than the vain desire of boasting that he had entered the ocean beyond the Indus; for, having consecrated certain bulls to Neptune, and thrown them into the sea, performed certain libations of golden cups, and thrown the cups also into the sea, he came back again; having only surveyed two little islands, one at the mouth of the Indus, and one a little farther in the ocean.\n\nOn the king's return to Pattala, he resolved to sail down the other branch of the Indus, that he might see whether it was more safe and commodious for his fleet than that which he had already tried; and for this he had very good reasons. He had resolved to send Nearchus with his fleet by sea, through the Persian gulf up the river Tigris, to meet him and his army in Mesopotamia; but as the possibility of this voyage depended on the ceasing of the Etesian winds, there was a necessity of laying up the fleet till the season should prove favourable. Alexander, therefore, failing through this branch of the Indus, fought on the sea coast for bays and creeks, where his fleet might anchor in safety; he caused also pits to be sunk, which might be filled with fresh water for the use of his people; and took all imaginable precautions for preserving them in ease and safety till the season would allow them to continue their voyage. In this he succeeded to his wish; for he found this branch of the river Indus, at its mouth, spread over the plain country, and forming a kind of lake, wherein a fleet might ride with safety. He therefore appointed Leonatus, and a part of his army, to carry on such works as were necessary: causing them to be relieved by fresh troops as often as there was occasion: then having given his last instructions to Nearchus, he departed with the rest of the army, in order to march back to Babylon.\n\nBefore the king's departure, many of his friends advised him against the route which he intended to take. They told him, that nothing could be more rash or dangerous than this resolution. They acquainted him, that the country through which he was to travel was a wild uncultivated desert; that Semiramis, when she led her soldiers this way out of India, brought home but 20 of them; and that Cyrus, attempting to do the same, returned with only seven. But all this was so far from deterring Alexander, that it more than ever determined him to pursue no other road. As soon, therefore, as he had put things in order, he marched at the head of a sufficient body of troops to reduce the Orite, who had never vouchsafed either to make their submission or to court his friendship. Their territories lay on the other side of a river called Aravitis, which Alexander crossed so speedily, that they had no intelligence of his march; whereupon most of them quitted their country, and fled into the deserts. Their capital he found so well situated, that he resolved to take it out of their hands, and to cause a new and noble city to be founded there, the care of which he committed to Hephaestion. Then he received the deputies of the Orite and Gedrofi; and having assured them, that if the people returned to their villages, they should be kindly treated, and having appointed Apollonides president of the Orite, and left a considerable body of troops under Leonatus to secure their obedience, he began his march through Gedrofi. In this march his troops suffered incredible hardships. His road was very uncertain and troublesome, on account of its lying through deep and loose sands, rising in many places into hillocks, which forced the soldiers to climb, at the same time that it sunk under their feet; there were no towns, villages, nor places of refreshment, to be met with; so that, after excessive marches, they were forced to encamp among these dry lands. As to provisions, they hardly met with any during their whole march. The soldiers were therefore obliged to kill their beasts of carriage; and such as were sent to bring some corn from the sea side, were so grievously distressed, that, though it was sealed with the king's signet, they cut open the bags, choosing rather to die a violent death for disobedience than perish by hunger. When the king, however, was informed of this, he freely pardoned the offenders; he was also forced to accept the excuses that were daily made for the loss of mules, horses, &c., which were in truth eaten by the soldiers, and their carriages broken in pieces to avoid further trouble. As for water, their want of it was a great misfortune; and yet their finding it in plenty was sometimes a greater: for, as by the first they perished with thirst, so by the latter they were buried, thrown into ditches, and rendered incapable of travel. Frequently they met with no water for the whole day together: sometimes they were disappointed of it at night; in which case, if they were able, they marched on; so that it was common with them to travel 30, 40, 50, or even 60 miles without encamping. Numbers through these hardships were obliged to lag in the rear; and of these many were left behind, and perished; for indeed scarce any ever joined the army again. Their sufferings, however, they sustained with incredible patience, being encouraged by the example of their king; who, on this occasion, suffered greater hardships than the meanest soldier in his army. At last,\nMacedon, they arrived at the capital of Gedrosia, where they refreshed themselves, and staid some time: after which they marched into Caramania; which being a very plentiful country, they there made themselves ample amends for the hardships and fatigues they had sustained. Here they were joined first by Craterus with the troops under his command, with a number of elephants: then came Stananor president of the Arians, and Pharmanes the son of Phrataphernes governor of Parthia. They brought with them camels, horses, and other beasts of burden, in vast numbers; having foreseen, that the king's march through Gedrosia would be attended with the loss of the greatest part, if not of all the cavalry and beasts belonging to his army.\n\nDuring Alexander's stay in Caramania, he redressed the injuries of his people, who had been grievously oppressed by their governors during his absence. Here also he was joined by his admiral Nearchus, who brought him an account that all under his command were in perfect safety, and in excellent condition; with which the king was mightily pleased, and, after having bestowed on him singular marks of his favour, sent him back to the navy. Alexander next set out for Persia, where great disorders had been committed during his absence. These also he redressed, and caused the governor to be crucified; appointing in his room Peucestas, who saved his life when he fought singly against a whole garrison as above related. The new governor was no sooner invested with his dignity, than he laid aside the Macedonian garb, and put on that of the Medes; being the only one of Alexander's captains, who, by complying with the manners of the people he governed, gained their affection.\n\nWhile Alexander visited the different parts of Persia, he took a view, among the rest, of the ruins of Persepolis, where he is said to have expressed great sorrow for the destruction he had formerly occasioned. From Persepolis he marched to Susa, where he gave an extraordinary loofe to pleasure; resolving to make himself and his followers some amends for the difficulties they had hitherto undergone: purposing at the same time so effectually to unite his new conquered with his hereditary subjects, that the jealousies and fears which had hitherto tormented both, should no longer subsist. With this view he married two wives of the blood royal of Persia; viz. Barfine, or Statira, the daughter of Darius, and Parysatis the daughter of Ochus. Drypetis, another daughter of Darius, he gave to Hephaestion; Amatrine, the daughter of Oxyartes the brother of Darius, married Craterus; and to the rest of his friends, to the number of 80, he gave other women of the greatest quality. All these marriages were celebrated at once, Alexander himself bestowing fortunes upon them; he directed likewise to take account of the number of his officers and soldiers who had married Asiatic wives; and though they appeared to be 10,000, yet he gratified each of them according to his rank. He next resolved to pay the debts of his army, and thereupon issued an edict directing every man to register his name and the sum he owed; with which the soldiers complying slowly, from an apprehension that there was some design against them, Alexander ordered tables heaped with money to be set in all quarters of the camp, and caused every man's debts to be paid on his bare word, without even making any entry of his name: though the whole sum came to 20,000 talents. On such as had distinguished themselves in an extraordinary manner, he bestowed crowns of gold. Peucestas had the first; Leonatus the second; Nearchus the third; Onecifirus the fourth; Hephaestion the fifth; and the rest of his guards had each of them one. After this he made other dispositions for conciliating, as he supposed, the differences among all his subjects. He reviewed the 30,000 youths, whom at his departure for India he had ordered to be taught Greek and the Macedonian discipline; expressing high satisfaction at the fine appearance they made, which rendered them worthy of the appellation he bestowed on them, viz. that of Epigoni, i.e. successors. He promoted also, without any distinction of nation, all those who had served him faithfully and valiantly in the Indian war. When all these regulations were made, he gave the command of his heavy armed troops to Hephaestion, and ordered him to march directly to the banks of the Tigris, while in the mean time a fleet was equipped for carrying the king and the troops he retained with him down to the ocean.\n\nThus ended the exploits of Alexander; the greatest conqueror that ever the world saw, at least with respect to the rapidity of his conquests. In 12 years' time he had brought under his subjection Egypt, Libya, Asia Minor, Syria, Phoenicia, Palestine, Babylonia, Persia, with part of India and Tartary. Still, however, he meditated greater things. He had now got a great taste in maritime affairs; and is said to have meditated a voyage to the coasts of Arabia and Ethiopia, and thence round the whole continent of Africa to the straits of Gibraltar. But of this there is no great certainty; though that he intended to subdue the Carthaginians and Italians, is more than probable. All these designs, however, were frustrated by his death, which happened at Babylon in 323 B.C. He is said to have received several warnings of his approaching fate, and to have been advised to avoid that city; which advice he either despised or could not follow. He died of a fever after eight days illness, he dies at without naming any successor; having only given his Babylon ring to Perdiccas, and left the kingdom, as he said, to the most worthy.\n\nThe character of this great prince has been variously represented; but most historians seem to have looked upon him rather as an illustrious madman than one upon whom the epithet of Great could be properly bestowed. From a careful observation of his conduct, however, it must appear, that he possessed not only a capacity to plan, but likewise to execute, the greatest enterprises that ever entered into the mind of any of the human race. From whatever cause the notion originated, it is plain that he imagined himself a divine person, and born to subdue the whole world: and extravagant and impracticable as this scheme may appear at present, it cannot at all be looked upon in the same light in the time of Alexander. The Greeks were in his time the most powerful people in the world in respect to their skill in the military art, and the Persians were the most powerful with respect to wealth and numbers. The only other powerful people in the world were the Carthaginians, Gauls, and Italian nations. From a long series of wars which the Carthaginians\nMacedonians carried on in Sicily, it appeared that they were by no means capable of contending with the Greeks, even when they had an immense superiority of numbers; much less then could they have sustained an attack from the whole power of Greece and Asia united. The Gauls and Italians were indeed very brave, and of a martial disposition; but they were barbarous, and could not have resisted armies well disciplined and under the command of such a skilful leader as Alexander. Even long after this time, it appeared that the Romans themselves could not have resisted the Greeks; since Regulus, after having defeated the Carthaginians and reduced them to the utmost distress, was totally unable to resist a Carthaginian army commanded by a Greek general, and guided by Greek discipline.\n\nThus it appears, that the scheme of Alexander cannot by any means be accounted that of a madman, or of one who projects great things without judgement or means to execute them. If we consider from his actions the end which most probably he had in view, could his scheme have been accomplished, we shall find it not only the greatest but the best that can possibly be imagined. He did not conquer to destroy, enslave, or oppress; but to civilize and unite the whole world as one nation. No sooner was a province conquered than he took care of it as if it had been part of his paternal inheritance. He allowed not his soldiers to oppress and plunder the Persians, which they were very much inclined to do; on the contrary, by giving into the oriental customs himself, he strove to extinguish that inveterate hatred which had so long subsisted between the two nations. In the Scythian countries which he subdued, he pursued the same excellent plan. His courage and military skill, in which he never was excelled, were displayed, not with a view to rapine or deftory conquest, but to civilize and induce the barbarous inhabitants to employ themselves in a more proper way of life. \"Midst the hardships of a military life (says Dr Gillies), obstinate sieges, bloody battles, and dear bought victories, he still respected the rights of mankind, and practised the mild virtues of humanity. The conquered nations enjoyed their ancient laws and privileges; the rigours of despotism were softened; arts and industry encouraged; and the proud Macedonian governors compelled, by the authority and example of Alexander, to observe the rules of justice towards their meanest subjects. To bridle the fierce inhabitants of the Scythian plains, he founded cities and established colonies on the banks of the Iaxartes and Oxus; and those destructive campaigns usually ascribed to his restless activity, and blind ambition, appeared to the discernment of this extraordinary man not only essential to the security of the conquests which he had already made, but necessary for the more remote and splendid expeditions which he still purposed to undertake, and which he performed with singular boldness and unexampled success.\" In another place, the same author gives his character in the following words.\n\n\"He was of a low stature, and somewhat deformed; but the activity and elevation of his mind animated and ennobled his frame. By a life of continual labour, and by an early and habitual practice of the gymnastic exercises, he had hardened his body against the impressions of cold and heat, hunger and thirst, and prepared his robust constitution for bearing such exertions of strength and activity, as have appeared incredible to the undisciplined softness of modern times. In generosity and in prowess, he rivalled the greatest heroes of antiquity; and in the race of glory, having finally outstripped all competitors, became ambitious to surpass himself. His superior skill in war gave uninterrupted success to his arms; and his natural humanity, enlightened by the philosophy of Greece, taught him to improve his conquests to the best interests of mankind. In his extensive dominions he built or founded not less than 70 cities; the situation of which being chosen with consummate wisdom, tended to facilitate communication, to promote commerce, and to diffuse civility through the greatest nations of the earth. It may be suspected, indeed, that he mistook the extent of human power, when in the course of one reign he undertook to change the face of the world; and that he miscalculated the stubbornness of ignorance and the force of habit, when he attempted to enlighten barbarism, to soften servitude, and to transplant the improvements of Greece into an African and Asiatic soil, where they have never been known to flourish. Yet let not the deigns of Alexander be too hastily accused of extravagance. Whoever seriously considers what he actually performed before his 33rd year, will be cautious of determining what he might have accomplished had he reached the ordinary term of human life. His resources were peculiar to himself; and such views as well as actions became him as would have become none besides. In the language of a philosophical historian, 'he seems to have been given to the world by a peculiar dispensation of Providence, being a man like to none other of the human kind.'\n\n\"From the part which his father Philip and himself acted in the affairs of Greece, his history has been transmitted through the impure channels of exaggerated flattery or malignant envy. The innumerable fictions which disgrace the works of his biographers, are contradicted by the most authentic accounts of his reign, and inconsistent with those public transactions which concurring authorities confirm. In the present work it seemed unnecessary to expatiate on such topics, since it is less the business of history to repeat or even to expose errors than to select and impress useful truths. An author, ambitious of attaining that purpose, can seldom indulge the language of general panegyric. He will acknowledge, that Alexander's actions were not always blameless; but, after the most careful examination, he will affirm, that his faults were few in number, and resulted from his situation rather than from his character.\n\n\"From the first years of his reign he experienced the crimes of disaffection and treachery, which multiplied and became more dangerous with the extent of his dominions and the difficulty to govern them. Several of his lieutenants early aspired at independence; others formed conspiracies against the life of their master. The first criminals were treated with a lenity becoming the generous spirit of Alexander: but when Philotas, the son of Parmenio, and even Parmenio himself, afforded reason to suspect their fidelity; when the Macedonian youths, who, according to the institu-\nMacedon. tution of Philip, guarded the royal pavilion, prepared to murder their sovereign, he found it necessary to depart from his lenient system, and to hold with a firmer hand the reins of government. Elated by unexampled prosperity, and the submissive reverence of vanquished nations, his loftiness disgusted the pride of his European troops, particularly the Macedonian nobles, who had been accustomed to regard themselves rather as his companions than subjects. The pretensions which found policy taught him to form and to maintain, of being treated with those external honours ever claimed by the monarchs of the East, highly offended the religious prejudices of the Greeks, who deemed it impious to prostrate the body or bend the knee to any mortal sovereign. Yet had he remitted formalities consecrated by the practice of ages, he must infallibly have lost the respect of his Asiatic subjects. With a view to reconcile the discordant principles of the victors and vanquished, he affected an immediate descent from Jupiter Ammon, a claim liberally admitted by the avarice or fears of the Libyan priests; and which, he had reason to expect, could not be very obstinately denied by the credulity of the Greeks and Macedonians; who universally acknowledged that Philip, his reputed father, was remotely descended from the Grecian Jupiter. But the success of this design, which might have entitled him, as son of Jupiter, to the same obeisance from the Greeks which the barbarians readily paid him as monarch of the East, was counteracted, at first by the secret displeasure, and afterwards by the open indignation, of several of his generals and courtiers. Nor did the conduct of Alexander tend to extricate him from this difficulty. With his friends he maintained that equal intercourse of visits and entertainments which characterized the Macedonian manners; indulged the liberal flow of unguarded conversation; and often exceeded that intemperance in wine which disgraced his age and country.\n\nWe shall conclude this character of Alexander with observing, that he had in view, and undoubtedly must have accomplished, the sovereignty of the ocean as well as of the land. The violent resistance made by the Tyrians had shown him the strength of a commercial nation; and it was undoubtedly with a view to enrich his dominions by commerce, that he equipped the fleet on the Indus, and wished to keep up a communication with India by sea as well as by land. \"It was chiefly with a view to the former of these objects (says Dr Robertson), that he examined the navigation of the Indus with so much attention. With the same view, on his return to Sufa, he in person surveyed the course of the Euphrates and Tigris, and gave directions to remove the cataracts or dams with which the ancient monarchs of Persia, induced by a peculiar precept of their religion, which enjoined them to guard with the utmost care against defiling any of the elements, had constructed near the mouths of these rivers, in order to shut out their subjects from any access to the ocean. By opening the navigation in this manner, he proposed, that the valuable commodities of India should be conveyed from the Persian gulf into the interior parts of his Asiatic dominions, while by the Arabian gulf they should be carried to Alexandria, and distributed to the rest of the world.\n\n\"Grand and extensive as these schemes were, the precautions employed, and the arrangements made for carrying them into execution, were so various and so proper, that Alexander had good reason to entertain languid hopes of their proving successful. At the time when the mutinous spirit of his soldiers obliged him to relinquish his operations in India, he was not 30 years of age complete. At this enterprising period of life, a prince of a spirit so active, persevering, and indefatigable, must have soon found means to relume a favourite measure on which he had been long intent. If he had invaded India a second time, he would not, as formerly, have been obliged to force his way through hostile and unexplored regions, opposed at every step by nations and tribes of barbarians whose names had never reached Greece. All Asia, from the shores of the Ionian sea to the banks of the Hyphasis, would then have been subject to his dominion; and through that immense stretch of country he had established such a chain of cities or fortified stations, that his armies might have continued their march with safety, and have found a regular succession of magazines provided for their subsistence. Nor would it have been difficult for him to bring into the field forces sufficient to have achieved the conquest of a country so populous and extensive as India. Having armed and disciplined his subjects in the east like Europeans, they would have been ambitious to imitate and to equal their instructors; and Alexander might have drawn recruits, not from his scanty domains in Macedonia and Greece, but from the vast regions of Asia, which in every age has covered the earth, and astonished mankind with its numerous armies. When at the head of such a formidable power he had reached the confines of India, he might have entered it under circumstances very different from those in his first expedition. He had secured a firm footing there, partly by means of the garrisons which he left in the three cities which he had built and fortified, and partly by his alliance with Taxiles and Porus. These two Indian princes, won by Alexander's humanity and beneficence, which, as they were virtues seldom displayed in the ancient mode of carrying on war, excited of course a higher degree of admiration and gratitude, had continued steady in their attachment to the Macedonians. Reinforced by their troops, and guided by their information as well as by the experience which he had acquired in his former campaigns, Alexander must have made rapid progress in a country where every invader from his time to the present age has proved successful.\n\n\"But this and all his other splendid schemes were terminated at once by his untimely death. In consequence of that, however, events took place which illustrate and confirm the justness of the preceding speculations and conjectures, by evidence the most striking and satisfactory. When that great empire, which the superior genius of Alexander had kept united and in subjection, no longer felt his superintending control, it broke into pieces, and its various provinces were seized by his principal officers, and parcelled out among them. From ambition, emulation, and personal animosity, they soon turned their arms against one another; and as several of the leaders were equally eminent for political abilities and for military skill, the contest was maintained long, and carried on with frequent vicissitudes of fortune. Amidst the various convulsions and revolutions\nMacedon. revolutions which these occasioned, it was found that the measures of Alexander for the preservation of his conquests had been concerted with such sagacity, that upon the final restoration of tranquillity, the Macedonian dominion continued to be established in every part of Asia, and not one province had shaken off the yoke. Even India, the most remote of Alexander's conquests, quietly submitted to Python the son of Agenor, and afterwards to Seleucus, who successively obtained dominion over that part of Asia. Ptolemy and Taxiles, notwithstanding the death of their benefactor, neither declined submission to the authority of the Macedonians, nor made any attempt to recover independence.\"\n\nWith the death of Alexander fell also the glory of the Macedonians; who very soon relapsed into a situation as bad, or worse, than that in which they had been before the reign of Philip. This was occasioned principally by his not having distinctly named a successor, and having no child of his own come to the years of discretion to whom the kingdom might seem naturally to belong. The ambition and jealousy of his mother Olympias, his queen Roxana, and especially of the great commanders of his army, not only prevented a successor from being ever named, but occasioned the death of every person, whether male or female, who was in the least related to Alexander. To have a just notion of the origin of these disturbances, it is necessary in the first place to understand the situation of the Macedonian affairs at the time of Alexander's death.\n\nWhen Alexander set out for Asia, he left Antipater, as we formerly observed, in Macedon, to prevent any disturbances that might arise either there or in Greece. The Greeks, even during the lifetime of Alexander, bore the superiority which he exercised over them with great impatience; and, though nothing could be more gentle than the government of Antipater, yet he was exceedingly hated, because he obliged them to be quiet. One of the last actions of Alexander's life set all Greece in a flame. He had, by an edict, directed all the cities of Greece to recall their exiles; which edict, when it was published at the Olympic games, created much confusion. Many of the cities were afraid, that, when the exiles returned, they would change the government; most of them doubted their own safety if the edict took place; and all of them held this peremptory decree to be a total abolition of their liberty. No sooner therefore did the news of Alexander's death arrive than they prepared for war.\n\nIn Asia the state of things was not much better; not indeed through any inclination of the conquered countries to revolt, but through the dissensions among the commanders.—In the general council which was called soon after the death of Alexander, after much confusion and altercation, it was at last agreed, or rather commanded by the soldiers, that Aridaeus the brother of Alexander, who had always accompanied the king, and had been wont to sacrifice with him, should assume the sovereignty.—This Aridaeus was a man of very slender parts and judgement, not naturally, but by the wicked practices of Olympias, who had given him poisonous draughts in his infancy, lest he should stand in the way of her son Alexander or any of his family; and for this, or some other reason, Perdiccas, Ptolemy, and most of the horse officers, refused his promotion to such a degree, that they quitted the assembly, and even the city.\n\nHowever, Meleager, at the head of the phalanx, vigorously supported their first resolution, and threatened loudly to shed the blood of those who affected to rule over their equals, and to assume a kingdom which now belonged to them: Aridaeus was accordingly arrayed in royal robes, had the arms of Alexander put upon him, and was saluted by the name of Philip, to render him more popular. Thus were two parties formed. A party led, at the head of whom were Meleager and Perdiccas, by Meleager both of them pretending vast concern for the public good, yet, at bottom, desiring nothing more than their own advantage. Perdiccas was a man of high birth, Perdiccas, and had a supreme command in the army, was much in favour with Alexander, and one in whom the nobility had put great confidence. Meleager had become formidable by having the phalanx on his side, and having the nominal king entirely in his power; for Aridaeus, or Philip, was obliged to comply with whatever he thought proper; and publicly declared, that whatever he did was by the advice of Meleager; so that he made his minister accountable for his own schemes, and now endangered himself. The Macedonians also, besides their regard for the deceased king, soon began to entertain a personal love for Philip on account of his moderation.\n\nIt is remarkable, however, that notwithstanding all the favours which Alexander had conferred upon his officers, and the fidelity with which they had served him during his life, only two of them were attached to the interests of his family after his death. These were Antipater, and Eumenes the Cardian, whom he had appointed his secretary. Antipater, as we have already seen, was embroiled with the Greeks, and could not assist the royal family who were in Asia; and Eumenes had not as yet sufficient interest to form a party in their favour. In a short time, however, Perdiccas prevailed against Meleager, and got him murdered; and by which means the supreme power for a time fell into his hands. His first step, in consequence of this power, was to distribute the provinces of the empire among the commanders in the following manner, in order to prevent competitors, and to satisfy the ambition of the principal commanders of the army. Aridaeus, and the son of Roxana, born after the death of his father, were to enjoy the regal authority. Antipater had the government of the European provinces. Craterus had the title of protector. Perdiccas was general of the household troops in the room of Hephaestion. Ptolemy the son of Lagus had Egypt, Libya, and that part of Arabia which borders upon Egypt. Cleomenes, a man of infamous character, whom Alexander had made receiver-general in Egypt, was made Ptolemy's deputy. Leomedon had Syria; Philotas, Cilicia; Pythons, Media; Eumenes, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, and all the country bordering on the Euxine sea, as far as Trapezus; but these were not yet conquered, so that he was a governor without a province. Antigonus had Pamphylia, Lycia, and Phrygia Major; Cassander, Caria; Menander, Lydia; Leonatus, Phrygia on the Hellespont.\n\nIn the mean time, not only Alexander's will, but Alexander himself, was so much neglected, that his body was allowed to remain seven days before any neglect, the will was taken of it, or any orders given for its being embalmed. The only will he left was a short memoir.\nMacedon. raudum of six things he would have done.—1. The building of a fleet of 1,000 stout galleys, to be made use of against the Carthaginians and other nations who should oppose the reduction of the sea-coasts of Africa and Spain, with all the adjacent islands as far as Sicily. 2. A large and regular highway was to be made along the coast of Africa, as far as Ceuta and Tangier. 3. Six temples of extraordinary magnificence were to be erected at the expense of 1,500 talents each. 4. Castles, arsenals, havens, and yards for building ships, to be settled in proper places throughout his empire. 5. Several new cities were to be built in Europe and Asia; those in Asia to be inhabited by colonies from Europe, and those in Europe to be filled with Asiatics; that, by blending their people and their manners, that hereditary antipathy might be eradicated which had hitherto subsisted between the inhabitants of the different continents. 6. Lastly, He had projected the building of a pyramid, equal in bulk and beauty to the biggest in Egypt, in honour of his father Philip. All these designs, under pretence of their being expensive, were referred to a council of Macedonians, to be held nobody knew when or where.\n\nThe government, being now in the hands of Perdiccas and Roxana, grew quickly very cruel and dittoful. Alexander was scarce dead when the queen sent for Statira and Drypetis the two daughters of Darius, one of whom had been married to Alexander and the other to Hephæstion: but as soon as they arrived at Babylon, caused them both to be murdered, that no son of Alexander by any other woman, or of Hephæstion, might give any trouble to her or her son Alexander. Sisygambis, the mother of Darius, no sooner heard that Alexander the Great was dead, than she laid violent hands on herself, being apprehensive of the calamities which were about to ensue.\n\nWar was first declared in Greece against Antipater in the year 321 B.C. Through the treachery of the Thessalians, that general was defeated, with the army he had under his own command. Leonatus was therefore sent from Asia, with a very considerable army, to his assistance; but both were overthrown with great loss by the confederates, and Leonatus himself was killed. In a short time, however, Craterus arrived in Greece with a great army, the command of which he resigned to Antipater. The army of the confederates amounted to 25,000 foot and 3,000 horse; but Antipater commanded no fewer than 40,000 foot, 3,000 archers, and 5,000 horse. In such an unequal contest, therefore, the Greeks were defeated, and forced to sue for peace; which they did not obtain but on condition of their receiving Macedonian garrisons into several of their cities. At Athens also the democratic government was abrogated; and such a dreadful punishment did this seem to the Athenians, that 22,000 of them left their country, and retired into Macedon.\n\nWhile these things were doing in Greece, disturbances began also to arise in Asia and in Thrace. The Greek mercenaries, who were dispersed through the inland provinces of Asia, despairing of ever being allowed to return home by fair means, determined to attempt it by force. For this purpose, they assembled to the number of 20,000 foot and 3,000 horse; but were all cut off to a man by the Macedonians. In Thrace, Lykmachus was attacked by one Seuthes, a prince of that country who claimed the dominions of Macedon's ancestors, and had raised an army of 20,000 foot and 8,000 horse. But though the Macedonian commander was forced to engage this army with no more than 4,000 foot and 2,000 horse, yet he kept the field of battle, and could not be driven out of the country. Perdiccas, in the mean time, by pretending friendship to the royal family, had gained over Eumenes entirely to his interest; and at last put him in possession of the Ambition province of Cappadocia by the defeat of Ariarathes and crowning of that country, whom he afterwards cruelly put to death.\n\nPerdiccas, in the mean time, by pretending friendship to the royal family, had gained over Eumenes entirely to his interest; and at last put him in possession of the Ambition province of Cappadocia by the defeat of Ariarathes and crowning of that country, whom he afterwards cruelly put to death. His ambition, however, now began to lead him into difficulties. At the first division of the provinces, Perdiccas, to strengthen his own authority, had proposed to marry Nicea the daughter of Antipater; and so well was this proposal relished, that her brethren Jollas and Archias conducted her to him, in order to be present at the celebration of the nuptials. But Perdiccas now had other things in view. He had been solicited by Olympias to marry her daughter Cleopatra, the widow of Alexander king of Epirus, and who then resided at Sardis in Lydia. Eumenes promoted this match to the utmost of his power, because he thought it would be for the interest of the royal family; and his persuasions had such an effect on Perdiccas, that he was sent to Sardis to compliment Cleopatra, and to carry presents to her in name of her new lover. In the absence of Eumenes, however, Alcetas, the brother of Perdiccas, persuaded him to marry Nicaea; but, in order to gratify his ambition, he resolved to divorce her immediately after marriage, and marry Cleopatra. By this last marriage, he hoped to have a pretence for altering the government of Macedon; and, as a necessary measure preparative to these, he entered into contrivances for destroying Antigonus. Unfortunately for himself, however, he ruined all his schemes by his own jealousy and precipitate cruelty. Cynane, the daughter of Philip by his second wife, had brought her daughter named Adda, and who was afterwards named Euridice, to court, in hopes that King Arrideus might marry her. Against Cynane, Perdiccas, from some political motives, conceived such a grudge, that he caused her to be murdered. This raised a commotion in the army; which frightened Perdiccas to such a degree, that he now promoted the match between Arrideus and Euridice; to prevent which, he had murdered the mother of the young princess. But, in the mean time, Antigonus, knowing the designs of Perdiccas against himself, fled with his son Demetrius to Greece, there to take shelter under the protection of Antipater and Craterus, whom he informed of the ambition and cruelty of the regent.\n\nA civil war was now kindled. Antipater, Craterus, Neoptolemus, and Antigonus, were combined against Perdiccas; and it was the misfortune of the empire in general, that Eumenes, the most able general, as well as the most virtuous of all the commanders, was on the side of Perdiccas, because he believed him to be in the interest of Alexander's family. Ptolemy, in the mean time, remained in quiet possession of Egypt; but without the least intention of owning any person for his superior: however, he also acceded to the league formed against Perdiccas; and thus the only person in the whole empire who consulted the interest of the royal family was Eumenes.\nIt was now thought proper to bury the body of Alexander, which had been kept for two years, during all which time preparations had been making for it. Arideus, to whose care it was committed, set out from Babylon for Damascus, in order to carry the king's body to Egypt. This was done against the will of Perdiccas; for it seems there was a superstitious report, that wherever the body of Alexander was laid, that country should flourish most. Perdiccas, therefore, out of regard to his native soil, would have it conveyed to the royal sepulchres in Macedon; but Arideus, pleading the late king's express direction, was determined to carry it into Egypt, from thence to be conveyed to the temple of Jupiter Ammon.—The funeral was accordingly conducted with all imaginable magnificence. Ptolemy came to meet the body as far as Syria; but, instead of burying it in the temple of Jupiter Ammon, erected a stately temple for it in the city of Alexandria; and, by the respect he showed for his dead master, induced many of the Macedonian veterans to join him, and who were afterwards of the greatest service to him.\n\nNo sooner was the funeral over, than both the parties above mentioned fell to blows. Perdiccas marched against Ptolemy; but was slain by his own men, who, after the death of their general, submitted to his antagonist; and thus Eumenes was left alone to contend against all the other generals who had served under Alexander. In this contest, however, he would by no means have been overmatched, had his soldiers been attached to him; but as they had been accustomed to serve under those very generals against whom they were now to fight, they were on all occasions ready to betray and desert Eumenes. However, he defeated and killed Neoptolemus and Craterus, but then found himself obliged to contend with Antipater and Antigonus. Antipater was now appointed protector of the kings, with sovereign power; and Eumenes was declared a public enemy. A new division of Alexander's empire took place. Egypt, Libya, and the parts adjacent, were given to Ptolemy, because they could not be taken from him. Syria was confirmed to Leomedon. Philoxenus had Cilicia. Mesopotamia and Arabelitus were given to Amphimachus. Babylon was bestowed on Seleucus. Sufiana fell to Antigenes, who commanded the Macedonian Argyrophide or Silver Shields, because he was the first who opposed Perdiccas. Peucestas held Persia. Tlepolemus had Caramania. Python had Media as far as the Caspian straits. Cassander had Aria and Drangia; Philip, Parthia; Stafanor, Bactria and Sogdia; Sybirtius, Aracopa; Oxyartes, the father of Roxana, Parapomiss. Another Python had the country between this province and India. Porus and Taxiles held what Alexander had given them, because they would not part with any of their dominions. Cappadocia was assigned to Nicanor. Phrygia Major, Lycaonia, Pamphylia, and Lycia, were given to Antigonus; Caria to Cassander, Lydia to Clytus, Phrygia the Leós to Arideus. Cassander was appointed general of the horse; while the command of the household troops was given to Antigonus, with orders to prosecute the war against Eumenes. Antipater having thus settled every thing as well as he could, returned to Macedon with the two kings, to the great joy of his countrymen, having left his son Cassander to be a check upon Antigonus in Asia.\n\nMatters now seemed to wear a better aspect than they had yet done; and, had Eumenes believed that his enemies really consulted the interest of Alexander's family, there is not the least doubt that the war would have been immediately terminated. He saw, however, that the design of Antigonus was only to fet up for himself, and therefore he refused to submit. From this time, therefore, the Macedonian empire ceased in Asia; and an account of the transactions of this part of the world fall to be recorded under the article Syria. The Macedonian affairs are now entirely confined to the kingdom of Macedon itself, and to Greece.\n\nAntipater had not long been returned to Macedon, when he died; and the last action of his life completed the ruin of Alexander's family. Out of a view to the public good, he had appointed Polyperchon, the eldest of Alexander's captains at hand, to be protector and governor of Macedon. This failed not to disgust his son Cassander; who thought he had a natural right to these offices, and of course kindled a new civil war in Macedon. This was indeed highly promoted by his first actions as a governor. He began with attempting to remove all the governors appointed in Greece by Antipater, and to restore democracy wherever it had been abolished. The immediate consequence of this was, that the people refused to obey their magistrates; the governors refused to resign their places, and applied for assistance to Cassander. Polyperchon also had the imprudence to recall Olympias from Epirus, and allow her a share in the administration; which Antipater, and even Alexander himself, had always refused her. The consequence of all this was, that Cassander invaded Greece, where he prevailed against Polyperchon: Olympias returned to Macedon, where she cruelly murdered Arideus and his wife Eurydice; she herself was put to death by Cassander, who afterwards caused Roxana and her son to be murdered, and Polyperchon being driven into Eolosia, first raised to the crown Hercules the son of Alexander by the daughter of Darius, and then by the instigation of Cassander murdered him, by which means the line of Alexander the Great became totally extinct.\n\nCassander having thus destroyed all the royal family, various assumed the regal title, as he had for 16 years before volition had all the power. He enjoyed the title of king of Macedon only three years; after which he died, about 298 B.C. By Theffalonica, the daughter of Philip king of Macedon, he left three sons, Philip, Antipater, and Alexander. Philip succeeded him, but soon after died of a consumption. A contest immediately began between the two brothers, Antipater and Alexander. Antipater seized the kingdom; and to secure himself in it, murdered his mother Theffalonica, if not with his own hand, at least the execrable act was committed in his presence. Alexander invited Pyrrhus king of Epirus, and Demetrius the son of Antigonus, to assist him and revenge the death of his mother. But Pyrrhus being bought off, and a peace concluded between the brothers, Alexander, being afraid of having too many protectors, formed a scheme of getting Demetrius assassinated. Instead of this, however, both he and Antipater were put to death; and\nMACEDON. Demetrius became king of Macedon four years after the death of Cassander.\n\nIn 287 B.C. Demetrius was driven out by Pyrrhus, who was again driven out by Lysimachus two years after, who was soon after killed by Seleucus Nicator; and Seleucus, in his turn, was murdered by Ptolemy Ceraunus, who became king of Macedon about 280 B.C. The new king was in a short time cut off, with his whole army, by the Gauls; and Antigonus Gonatas, the son of Demetrius Poliorcetes, became king of Macedon in 278 B.C. He proved successful against the Gauls, but was driven out by Pyrrhus king of Epirus; who, however, soon obliged his subjects to such a degree, that Antigonus recovered a great part of his kingdom. But in a little time, Pyrrhus being killed at the siege of Argos in Greece, Antigonus was restored to the whole of Macedon; but scarcely was he seated on the throne, when he was driven from it by Alexander the son of Pyrrhus. This new invader was, in his turn, expelled by Demetrius the son of Antigonus; who, though at that time but a boy, had almost made himself master of Epirus. In this enterprise, however, he was disappointed; but by his means Antigonus was restored to his kingdom, which he governed for many years in peace. By a stratagem he made himself master of the city of Corinth, and from that time began to form schemes for the thorough conquest of Greece. The method he took to accomplish this was, to support the petty tyrants of Greece against the free states: which indeed weakened the power of the latter; but involved the whole country in so many calamities, that these transactions could not redound much to the reputation either of his arms or his honour. About 243 B.C. he died, leaving the kingdom to his son, Demetrius II.\n\nNeither Demetrius, nor his successor Antigonus Doson, performed anything remarkable. In 221 B.C. the kingdom fell to Philip, the last but one of the Macedonian monarchs. To him Hannibal applied for assistance after the battle of Cannae, which he refused; and the same imprudence which made him refuse this assistance prompted him to embroil himself with the Romans; and at last to conclude a treaty with them, by which he in effect became their subject, being tied up from making peace or war but according to their pleasure. In 179 B.C. he was succeeded by his eldest son Perseus, under whom the war with the Romans was renewed. Even yet the Macedonians were terrible in war; and their phalanx, when properly conducted, seems to have been absolutely invincible by any method of making war known at that time. It consisted of 16,000 men, of whom 1000 marched abreast, and thus was 16 men deep, each of whom carried a kind of pike 23 feet long. The soldiers stood so close, that the pikes of the fifth rank reached their points beyond the front of the battle. The hindermost ranks leaned their pikes on the shoulders of those who went before them, and, locking them fast, pressed briskly against them when they made the charge; so that the first five ranks had the impetus of the whole phalanx, which was the reason why the shock was generally irresistible. The Romans had never encountered such a terrible enemy; and in the first battle, which happened 171 B.C. they were defeated with the loss of 2200 men, while the Macedonians lost no more than 60. The generals of Perseus now pressed him to storm the enemy's Macedonian camp; but he being naturally of a cowardly disposition, refused to comply, and thus the best opportunity he ever had was lost. Still, however, the Romans gained little or no advantage, till the year 168 B.C. when Paulus Emilius, a most experienced commander, was sent to Macedon. Perseus now put all upon the issue of a general engagement; and Emilius, with all his courage and military experience, would have been defeated, had the Macedonians been commanded by a general of the smallest courage or conduct. The light-armed Macedonians charged with such vigour, that after the battle, some of their bodies were found within two furlongs of the Roman camp. When the phalanx came to charge, the points of their spears striking into the Roman shields, kept the heavy-armed troops from making any motion; while, on the other hand, Perseus' light-armed men did terrible execution. On this occasion, it is said, that Emilius tore his clothes, and gave up all hopes. However, perceiving that as the phalanx gained ground it lost its order in several places, he caused his own light-armed troops to charge in those places, whereby the Macedonians were soon put into confusion. If Perseus with his horse had on the first appearance of this charged the Romans briskly, his infantry would have been able to recover themselves; but instead of this, he betook himself to flight, and the infantry at last did the same, but not till 20,000 of them had lost their lives.\n\nThis battle decided the fate of Macedon, which immediately submitted to the conqueror. The cowardly king took refuge in the island of Smothrace: but was at last obliged to surrender to the Roman consul, by whom he was carried to Rome, led in triumph, and afterwards most barbarously used. Some pretenders to the throne appeared afterwards; but being unable to defend themselves against the Romans, the country Macedonia was reduced to a Roman province in 148 B.C. To become a Roman province subject till the year 1357, when it was reduced by the Turkish sultan Bajazet, and has remained in the hands of the Turks ever since.\n\nMACEDONIANS, in ecclesiastical history, the followers of Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople, who through the influence of the Eumomians, was deposed by the council of Constantinople in 360, and sent into exile. He considered the Holy Ghost as a divine energy diffused throughout the universe, and not as a person distinct from the Father and the Son. The sect of Macedonians was crushed before it had arrived at its full maturity, by the council assembled by Theodosius in 381, at Constantinople. See Semiarians.\n\nMACEDONIUS. See Macedonians.\n\nMACER, Emilius, an ancient Latin poet, was born at Verona, and flourished under Augustus Caesar. Eusebius relates, that he died a few years after Virgil. Ovid speaks of a poem of his, on the nature and quality of birds, serpents, and herbs; which he says Macer being then very old had often read to him:\n\n*Saepe suas volucres legit milii grandior ævo,\nQueaque nocet serpens, qua juvat herba, Macer.*\nDe Ponto, lib. iv. eieg. 10.\n\nThere is extant a poem upon the nature and power of herbs under Macer's name; but it is spurious. He also wrote\nMACERATION wrote a supplement to Homer, as Quintus Calaber did afterwards in Greek:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tu canis aeterno quicquid reflabat Homero:} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Ne careant summa Troica bella manu.} \\]\n\nDe Ponto, lib. ii. eleg. 10.\n\nMACERATION, is an infusion of, or soaking ingredients in water or any other fluid, in order either to soften them or draw out their virtues.\n\nMACERATA, a handsome and populous town of Italy, in the territory of the church, and in the Marche of Ancona, with a bishop's see, and an university. It is seated near the mountain Chiento, in E. Long. 13. 37. N. Lat. 43. 15.\n\nMACHAON, a celebrated physician among the ancients, son of Aesculapius and brother to Podalirius. He went to the Trojan war with the inhabitants of Trica, Ithome, and Cephalia. According to some, he was king of Messenia. He was physician to the Greeks, and healed the wounds which they received during the Trojan war. Some suppose he was killed before Troy by Eurypylus the son of Telephus. He received divine honours after death, and had a temple in Messenia.\n\nMACHÆRUS, in Ancient Geography, a citadel on the other side Jordan, near the mountains of Moab, not far from and to the north of the Lacus Asphaltites. It was the south boundary of the Pereæa: situated on a mountain encompassed round with deep and broad valleys; built by Alexander king of the Jews; destroyed by Gabinius, in the war with Aristobulus, and rebuilt by Herod, with a cognominal town round it. Here John the Baptist was beheaded (Josephus).\n\nMACHIAN, one of the Molucca islands, in the East Indian ocean, about 20 miles in circumference, and the most fertile of them all. It likewise produces the best cloves; and is in possession of the Dutch, who have three strong forts built on it.\n\nMACHIAVEL, Nicholas, a famous political writer of the 16th century, was born of a distinguished family at Florence. He wrote in his native language with great elegance and politeness, though he understood very little of the Latin tongue; but he was in the service of Marcellus Virgilius, a learned man, who pointed out to him many of the beautiful passages in the ancients, which Machiavel had the art of placing properly in his works. He composed a comedy upon the ancient Greek model; in which he turned into ridicule many of the Florentine ladies, and which was so well received, that Pope Leo X. caused it to be acted at Rome. Machiavel was secretary, and afterwards historiographer, to the republic of Florence. The house of Medicis procured him this last office, together with a handsome salary, in order to pacify his resentment for having suffered the torture upon suspicion of being an accomplice in the conspiracy of the Soderini against that house, when Machiavel bore his sufferings without making any confession. The great encomiums he bestowed upon Brutus and Cassius, both in his conversations and writings, made him strongly suspected of being concerned in another conspiracy against Cardinal Julian de Medicis, who was afterwards pope under the name of Clement VII. However, they carried on no proceedings against him; but from that time he turned every thing into ridicule, and gave himself up to irreligion. He died in 1530, of a remedy which he had taken by way of prevention.\n\nOf Machinery, all his writings, that which has made the most noise, and has drawn upon him the most enemies, is a political treatise entitled the Prince; which has been translated into several languages, and wrote against by many authors. The world is not agreed as to the motives of this work; some thinking he meant to recommend tyrannical maxims; others, that he only delineated them to excite abhorrence. Machiavel also wrote, Reflections on Titus Livius, which are extremely curious; The History of Florence, from the year 1205 to 1494; and a quarto volume of Poems and other pieces. Mr Harrington considers him as a superior genius, and as the most excellent writer on politics and government that ever appeared.\n\nMACHINE, (Machina), in the general, signifies anything that serves to augment or to regulate moving powers: Or it is any body defined to produce motion, so as to save either time or force. The word comes from the Greek μηχανή, \"machine, invention, art:\" And hence, in strictness, a machine is something that consists more in art and invention, than in the strength and solidity of the materials; for which reason it is that inventors of machines are called ingénieurs or engineers.\n\nMachines are either simple or compound. The simplest ones are the seven mechanical powers, viz. lever, balance, pulley, axis and wheel, wedge, screw, and inclined plane. See Mechanics.\n\nFrom these the compound ones are formed by various combinations, and serve for different purposes. See Mechanics; also Agriculture, Cannon, Centrifugal, Steam, Furnace, Burroughs, Ramsden, &c. &c.\n\nMachines used in war amongst the Greeks were principally these; 1. Κλίμαξ, on scaling ladders; 2. The battering ram; 3. The heliopolis; 4. The ξύλον or tortoise, called by the Romans teftudo; 5. The σχοινος or agger, which was faced with stone, and raised higher than the wall; 6. Upon the σχοινος were built πύργοι or towers of wood; 7. Γέραξ, or other hurdles; 8. Cata-putia, or καταπυλία, from which they threw arrows with amazing force; and, 9. The λοβόνειον, περικάλα, or αφίγια, from which stones were cast with great velocity.\n\nThe principal warlike machines made use of by the Romans were, the ram, the lupus or wolf, the teftudo or tortoise, the balista, the catapultia, and the scorpion.\n\nMACHINERY, in epic and dramatic poetry, is when the poet introduces the use of machines; or brings some supernatural being upon the stage, in order to solve some difficulty or to perform some exploit out of the reach of human power.\n\nThe ancient dramatic poets never made use of machines, unless where there was an absolute necessity for doing so; whence the precept of Horace,\n\n\\[ \\text{Nec Deus interfìt, nisi dignus vindice nodus Inciderit.} \\]\n\nIt is quite otherwise with epic poets, who introduce machines in every part of their poems; so that nothing is done without the intervention of the gods. In Milton's Paradise Lost, by far the greater part of the ac-\ntors are supernatural personages: Homer and Virgil do nothing without them; and, in Voltaire's Henriade, the poet has made excellent use of St Louis.\n\nAs to the manner in which these machines should act, it is sometimes invisibly, by simple inspirations and suggestions; sometimes by actually appearing under some human form; and, lastly, by means of dreams and oracles, which partake of the other two. However, all these should be managed in such a manner as to keep within the bounds of probability.\n\nMACHUL, an instrument of music among the Hebrews. Kircher apprehends that the name was given to two kinds of instruments, one of the stringed and the other of the plectral kind. That of the former sort had six chords; though there is great reason to doubt whether an instrument requiring the aid of the hair-bow, and so much resembling the violin, be so ancient. The second kind was of a circular form, made of metal, and either hung round with little bells, or furnished with iron rings suspended on a rod or bar that passed across the circle. Kircher supposes that it was moved to and fro by a handle fixed to it, and thus emitted a melancholy kind of murmur.\n\nMACHYNLETH, a town of Montgomeryshire in North Wales, 198 miles from London, and 32 from Montgomery. It is an ancient town; and has a market on Mondays, and fairs on May 16, June 26, July 9, September 18, and November 25, for sheep, horned cattle, and horses. It is seated on the river Douay, over which there is a large stone bridge, which leads into Mertonethshire. It was here that Owen Glyndwr exercised the first acts of his royalty in 1402. Here he accepted the crown of Wales, and assembled a parliament; and the house wherein they met is now standing, divided into tenements.\n\nMACKENZIE, Sir GEORGE, an able lawyer, a polite scholar, and a celebrated wit, was born at Dundee in the county of Angus in Scotland in 1636, and studied at the universities of Aberdeen and St Andrew's; after which he applied himself to the civil law, travelled into France, and prosecuted his study in that faculty for about three years. At his return to his native country he became an advocate in the city of Edinburgh; and soon gained the character of an eminent pleader. He did not, however, suffer his abilities to be confined entirely to that province. He had a good taste for polite literature; and he gave the public, from time to time, incontrovertible proofs of an uncommon proficiency therein. He had practised but a few years, when he was promoted to the office of a judge in the criminal court; and, in 1674, was made king's advocate, and one of the lords of the privy council in Scotland. He was also knighted by his majesty. In these stations he met with a great deal of trouble, on account of the rebellions which happened in his time; and his office of advocate requiring him to act with severity, he did not escape being censured, as if in the deaths of some particular persons who were executed he had stretched the laws too far. But there does not seem to have been any just foundation for this clamour against him; and it is generally agreed, that he acquitted himself like an able and upright magistrate. Upon the abrogation of the penal laws by King James II., our advocate, though he had always been remarkable for his loyalty, and even censured for his zeal against traitors and fanatics, thought himself Mackarel, obliged to resign his post; being convinced, that he MacLaurin, could not discharge the duties of it in that point with a good conscience. But he was soon after restored, and held his offices till the Revolution; an event which, it seems, he could not bring himself to approve. He had hoped that the prince of Orange would have returned to his own country when matters were adjusted between the king and his subjects; and upon its proving otherwise, he quitted all his employments in Scotland, and retired into England, resolving to spend the remainder of his days in the university of Oxford. He arrived there in September 1689, and prosecuted his studies in the Bodleian library, being admitted a student there by a grace passed in the congregation, June 2, 1690. In the spring following, he went to London; where he fell into a disorder, of which he died in May 1691. His corpse was conveyed by land to Scotland, and interred there with great pomp and solemnity. \"The politeness of his learning, and the sprightliness of his wit, were (says the reverend Mr Granger) conspicuous in all his pleadings, and thone in his ordinary conversation.\" Mr Dryden acknowledges, that he was unacquainted with what he calls the beautiful turn of words and thoughts in poetry, till they were explained and exemplified to him in a conversation with that noble wit of Scotland Sir George Mackenzie.—He wrote several pieces of history and antiquities; Institutions of the laws of Scotland; Essays upon various subjects, &c. His works were printed together at Edinburgh in 1716, in 2 vols. folio.\n\nMACKEREEL. See SCOMBER, ICHTHYOLOGY Index.\n\nMACLAURIN, COLIN, a most eminent mathematician and philosopher, was the son of a clergyman, and born at Kilmoddan in Scotland in 1698. He was sent to the university of Glasgow in 1709; where he continued five years, and applied himself to study in a most intense manner. His great genius for mathematical learning discovered itself so early as at twelve years of age; when, having accidentally met with an Euclid in a friend's chamber, he became in a few days master of the first six books without any affluence: and it is certain, that in his 16th year he had invented many of the propositions which were afterwards published under the title of Geometria Organica. In his 15th year he took the degree of master of arts; on which occasion he composed and publicly defended a thesis On the power of Gravity, with great applause. After this he quitted the university, and retired to a country-seat of his uncle, who had the care of his education; for his parents had been dead some time. Here he spent two or three years in pursuing his favourite studies; but, in 1717, he offered himself a candidate for the professorship of mathematics in the Marischal college of Aberdeen, and obtained it after a ten days trial with a very able competitor. In 1719, he went to London, where he became acquainted with Dr Hoadly then bishop of Bangor, Dr Clarke, Sir Isaac Newton, and other eminent men; at which time also he was admitted a member of the Royal Society; and in another journey in 1721, he contracted an intimacy with Martin Folkes, Esq. the president of it, which lasted to his death.\n\nIn 1722, Lord Polwarth, plenipotentiary of the king of Great Britain at the congress of Cambray, engaged\nMaclaurin him to go as a tutor and companion to his eldest son, who was then to set out on his travels. After a short stay at Paris, and visiting other towns in France, they fixed in Lorraine; where Maclaurin wrote his piece On the Percussion of Bodies, which gained the prize of the Royal Academy of Sciences for the year 1724. But his pupil dying soon after at Montpellier, he returned immediately to his profession at Aberdeen. He was hardly settled here, when he received an invitation to Edinburgh; the curators of that university being desirous that he should supply the place of Mr James Gregory, whose great age and infirmities had rendered him incapable of teaching. He had some difficulties to encounter, arising from competitors, who had good interest with the patrons of the university, and also from the want of an additional fund for the new professor; which however at length were all surmounted, principally by the means of Sir Isaac Newton. In November 1725, he was introduced into the university. After this, the mathematical classes soon became very numerous, there being generally upwards of 100 young gentlemen attending his lectures every year; who being of different standings and proficiency, he was obliged to divide them into four or five classes, in each of which he employed a full hour every day, from the first of November to the first of June.\n\nHe lived a bachelor to the year 1733: but being not less formed for society than for contemplation, he then married Anne, the daughter of Mr Walter Stewart, solicitor-general to his late majesty for Scotland. By this lady he had seven children, of whom two sons and three daughters, together with his wife, survived him. In 1734, Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne, published a piece called \"The Analyst;\" in which he took occasion, from some disputes that had arisen concerning the grounds of the fluxionary method, to explode the method itself, and also to charge mathematicians in general with infidelity in religion. Maclaurin thought himself included in this charge, and began an answer to Berkeley's book: but, as he proceeded, so many discoveries, so many new theories and problems occurred to him, that instead of a vindictive pamphlet, his work came out, A complete system of fluxions, with their application to the most considerable problems in geometry and natural philosophy. This work was published at Edinburgh in 1742, 2 vols. 4to; and as it cost him infinite pains, so it is the most considerable of all his works, and will do him immortal honour. In the mean time, he was continually obliging the public with some performance or observation of his own; many of which were published in the fifth and sixth volumes of the \"Medical Essays\" at Edinburgh. Some of them were likewise published in the Philosophical Transactions; as the following: 1. Of the construction and measure of curves, No. 356. 2. A new method of describing all kinds of curves, No. 359. 3. A letter to Martin Folkes, Esq., on equations with impossible roots, May 1726, No. 394. 4. Continuation of the same, March 1729, No. 408. 5. December the 21st, 1732, on the description of curves; with an account of farther improvements, and a paper dated at Nancy, November 27, 1722, No. 439. 6. An account of the treatise of fluxions, January 27, 1742, No. 467. 7. The same continued, March 10, 1742, No. 469. 8. A rule for finding the meridional parts of a spheroid with the same exactness as of a Maclaurin sphere, August 1741, No. 401. 9. Of the basis of the cells wherein the bees deposit their honey; Nov. 3, 1734, No. 471.\n\nIn the midst of these studies, he was always ready to lend his assistance in contriving and promoting any scheme which might contribute to the service of his country. When the earl of Morton set out in 1739 for Orkney and Shetland, to visit his estates there, he desired Mr Maclaurin to assist him in settling the geography of those countries, which is very erroneous in all our maps; to examine their natural history, to survey the coasts, and to take the measure of a degree of the meridian. Maclaurin's family affairs, and other connexions, would not permit him to do this; he drew, however, a memorial of what he thought necessary to be observed, furnished the proper instruments, and recommended Mr Short, the famous optician, as a fit operator for the management of them. He had still another scheme for the improvement of geography and navigation, of a more extensive nature; which was the opening a passage from Greenland to the South sea by the north pole. That such a passage might be found, he was so fully persuaded, that he has been heard to say, if his situation could admit of such adventures, he would undertake the voyage, even at his own charge. But when schemes for finding it were laid before the parliament in 1744, and himself consulted by several persons of high rank concerning them, before he could finish the memorials he proposed to send, the premium was limited to the discovery of a north-west passage: and he used to regret, that the word west was inserted, because he thought that passage, if at all to be found, must lie not far from the pole.\n\nIn 1745, having been very active in fortifying the city of Edinburgh against the rebel army, he was obliged to fly from thence to the north of England; where he was invited by Herring, then archbishop of York, to reside with him during his stay in this country. In this expedition, however, being exposed to cold and hardships, and naturally of a weak and tender constitution, he laid the foundation of an illness which put an end to his life, in June 1746, at the age of 48.\n\nMr Maclaurin was a very good as well as a very great man, and worthy of love as well as admiration. His peculiar merit as a philosopher was, that all his studies were accommodated to general utility; and we find, in many places of his works, an application even of the most abstruse theories, to the perfecting of mechanical arts. He had resolved, for the same purpose, to compose a course of practical mathematics, and to rescue several useful branches of the science from the bad treatment they often met with in less skilful hands. But all this his death prevented; unless we should reckon, as a part of his intended work, the translation of Dr David Gregory's \"Practical Geometry,\" which he revised, and published with additions, 1745. In his lifetime, however, he had frequent opportunities of serving his friends and his country by his great skill. Whatever difficulty occurred concerning the constructing or perfecting of machines, the working of mines, the improving of manufactures, the conveying of water, or the execution of any other public work,\nhe was at hand to resolve it. He was likewise employed to terminate some disputes of consequence that had arisen at Glasgow concerning the gauging of vessels; and for that purpose presented to the commissioners of excise two elaborate memorials, with their demonstrations, containing rules for which the officers now act. He made also calculations relating to the provision, now established by law, for the children and widows of the Scots clergy, and of the professors in the universities, entitling them to certain annuities and sums, upon the voluntary annual payment of a certain sum by the incumbent. In contriving and adjusting this wise and useful scheme, he bestowed a great deal of labour, and contributed not a little towards bringing it to perfection. It may be said of such a man, that \"he lived to some purpose;\" which can hardly be said of those, how uncommon soever their abilities and attainments, who spend their whole time in abstract speculations, and produce nothing to the real use and service of their fellow creatures.\n\nOf his works, we have mentioned his *Geometria Organica*, in which he treats of the description of curve lines by continued motion. We need not repeat what has been said concerning his piece which gained the prize of the Royal Academy of Sciences in 1724. In 1749, the academy adjudged him a prize, which did him still more honour, for solving the motion of the tides from the theory of gravity; a question which had been given out the former year, without receiving any solution. He had only ten days to draw this paper up in, and could not find leisure to transcribe a fair copy; so that the Paris edition of it is incorrect. He afterwards revised the whole, and inserted it in his Treatise of Fluxions; as he did also the substance of the former piece. These, with the Treatise of Fluxions, and the pieces printed in the Philosophical Transactions, of which we have given a list, are all the writings which our author lived to publish. Since his death, two volumes more have appeared; his Algebra, and his Account of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophical Discoveries. His Algebra, though not finished by himself, is yet allowed to be excellent in its kind; containing, in no large volume, a complete elementary treatise of that science, as far as it has hitherto been carried. His Account of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy was occasioned in the following manner: Sir Isaac dying in the beginning of 1728, his nephew, Mr Conduitt, proposed to publish an account of his life, and desired Mr MacLaurin's assistance. The latter, out of gratitude to his great benefactor, cheerfully undertook, and soon finished, the history of the progress which philosophy had made before Sir Isaac's time, and this was the first draught of the work in hand; which not going forward, on account of Mr Conduitt's death, was returned to Mr MacLaurin—To this he afterwards made great additions, and left it in the state in which it now appears. His main design seems to have been, to explain only those parts of Sir Isaac's philosophy which have been, and still are, controverted; and this is supposed to be the reason why his grand discoveries concerning light and colours are but transiently and generally touched upon. For it is known, that ever since the experiments, on which his doctrine of light and colours is founded, have been repeated with due care, this doctrine has not been contested; whereas his accounting for the celestial motions, and the other great appearances of nature, from gravity, is misinterpreted, and even ridiculed by some to this day.\n\nMACQUER, Philippe, advocate of the parliament of Paris, where he was born in 1729, being descended from a respectable family. A weakness in his lungs having prevented him from engaging in the laborious exercises of pleading, he dedicated himself to literary pursuits. His works are, 1. *L'Abrege Chronologique de l'Histoire Ecclesiastique*, 3 vols, 8vo; written in the manner of the president Henault's History of France, but not possessed of equal spirit and elegance. 2. *Les Annales Romaines*, 1756, 8vo; another chronological abridgement, and much better supported than the former. Into this work the author has introduced every thing most worthy of notice which has been written by Saint Evremond, Abbé Saint-Real, Président Montefleuret, Abbé Mably, &c., concerning the Romans; and, if we except a difference of style, which is easily discernible it is, in other respects, a very judicious compilation. 3. *Abrege Chronologique de l'Histoire d'Espagne et de Portugal*, 1759, 1765; in 2 vols, 8vo. This book, in point of accuracy, is worthy of the president Henault, by whom it was begun; but it displays no discrimination of character nor depth of research. The author received assistance from M. Lacombe, whose talents for chronological abridgment are well known. The republic of letters sustained a loss by the death of M. Macquer, which happened on the 27th of January 1770, at the age of 50. As to his character, he was industrious, agreeable, modest, and sincere, and an enemy to all foolish vanity and affectation. He had a cold imagination, but a correct taste. He had an eager thirst for knowledge of every kind, and he had neglected no useful branch of study. He had a share in the Dictionary of Arts and Professions, in 2 vols 8vo, and in the Translation of the Syphilis of Fracastor published by Lacombe.\n\nMACQUER, Pierre Joseph, brother to the former, was born at Paris the 9th of October 1718, and died there February 16, 1784. He was a member of the Academy of Sciences, and late professor of pharmacy; and was engaged in the *Journal des Sçavans*, for the articles of medicine and chemistry. With the latter science he was intimately acquainted. He had a share in the *Pharmacopoeia Parisiensis*, published in 1758, in 4to. His other works are, 1. *Elements de Chimie theorique*; Paris, 1749, 1753, 12mo; which have been translated into English and German.—2. *Element de Chimie pratique*, 1751, 2 vols 12mo. These two works were republished together, in 1756, in 3 vols. 12mo. 3. *Plan d'un cours de Chimie experimentale et raisonne*, 1757, 12mo; in the composition of which he was associated with M. Beaumé. 4. *Formule Medicamentorum Magistralium*, 1763. 5. *L'Art de la Teinture en Soie*, 1763. 6. *Dictionnaire de Chimie, contenant la Théorie et la Pratique de cet art*, 1766, 2 vols, 8vo; which has been translated into German, with notes; and into English, with notes, by Mr Keir. Macquer has, by his labours and writings, greatly contributed to render useful an art which formerly tended only to ruin the health of the patient by foreign remedies, or to reduce\nreduce the professors of it to beggary, while they prosecuted the idle dreams of converting every thing into gold.\n\nMACRIN, SALMON, one of the best Latin poets of the 16th century, was born at Loudun. His true name was John Salmon; but he took that of Macrin, from his being frequently so called in ridicule by Francis I. on account of his extraordinary leanness. He was preceptor to Claudius de Savoy, count of Tende; and to Honorius the count's brother; and wrote several pieces of poetry in lyric verse, which were so admired, that he was called the Horace of his time. He died of old age, at Loudun, in 1555.—Charles Macrin, his son, was not inferior to him as a poet, and surpassed him in his knowledge of the Greek tongue. He was preceptor to Catharine of Navarre, the sister of Henry the Great; and perished in the massacre on St Bartholomew's day in 1572.\n\nMACROBIUS, a people of Ethiopia, celebrated for their justice, and the innocence of their manners: also a people in the island Meröe. The Hyperboreans were also called Macrobii: They generally lived to their 120th year; and from their longevity they obtained their name (μακρόβιοι, long life.)\n\nMACROBIUS, AMBROSIUS AURELIUS THEODORIUS, an ancient Latin writer, who flourished towards the latter part of the fourth century.—Of what country he was, is not clear: Erafmus, in his Ciceronianus, seems to think he was a Greek; and he himself tells us, in the preface to his Saturnalia, that he was not a Roman, but laboured under the inconveniences of writing in a language which was not natural to him. Of what religion he was, Christian or Pagan, is uncertain. Barthius ranks him among the Christians; but Spanheim and Fabricius suppose him to have been a heathen. This, however, is certain, that he was a man of confular dignity, and one of the chamberlains or officers of the wardrobe to Theodosius; as appears from a rescript directed to Florentius, concerning those who were to obtain that office. He wrote a Commentary upon Cicero's Somnium Scipionis, and seven books of Saturnalia, which treat of various subjects, and are an agreeable mixture of criticism and antiquity. He was not an original writer, but made great use of other people's works, borrowing not only their materials, but even their language, and for this he has been satirically rallied by some modern authors, though rather unfairly, considering the express declaration and apology which he makes on this head, at the very entrance of his work. \"Don't blame me,\" says he, \"if what I have collected from multiform reading, I shall frequently express in the very words of the authors from whom I have taken it: for my view in this present work is, not to give proofs of my eloquence, but to collect and digest into some regularity and order such things as I thought might be useful to be known. I shall therefore here imitate the bees, who suck the best juices from all sorts of flowers, and afterwards work them up into various forms and orders with some mixture of their own proper spirit.\" The Somnium Scipionis and Saturnalia have been often printed; to which has been added, in the later editions, a piece entitled De Differentiis et Societatis Graecae Latinaeque Verbi.\n\nMACROCEPHALUS (compounded of μακρός \"great,\" and κεφάλη \"head,\") denotes a person with a head larger or longer than the common size. Macrocephali, or Long-heads, is a name given to a certain people, who, according to the accounts of authors, were famous for the unseemly length of their heads: yet custom so far habituated them to it, that instead of looking on it as a deformity, they esteemed it a beauty, and, as soon as the child was born, moulded and fashioned its head in their hands to as great a length as possible, and afterwards used all such rollers and bandages as might seem most likely to determine its growing long. The greater part of the islanders in the Archipelago, some of the people of Asia, and even some of those of Europe, still press their children's heads out lengthwise. We may observe also, that the Epirots, many people of America, &c. are all born with some singularity in the conformation of their heads; either a flatness on the top, two extraordinary protuberances behind, or one on each side; singularities which we can only regard as an effect of an ancient and strange mode, which at length is become hereditary in the nation. According to the report of many travelers, the operation of compressing the head of a child lengthwise, while it is yet soft, is with a view infallibly to enlarge the interval between the two eyes, so that the visual rays turning more to the right and left, the sight would embrace a much larger portion of the horizon; the advantage of which they are well acquainted with, either in the constant exercise of hunting, or on a thousand other occasions. Ever since the 16th century, the missionaries established in the countries inhabited by the savages of America, have endeavoured to destroy this custom; and we find in the decrees of the third council of Lima, held in 1585, a canon which expressly prohibits it. But if it has been repressed one way, the free negroes and Maroons, although Africans, have adopted it, since they have been established among the Caribs, solely with the view of distinguishing their children, which are born free, from those who are born in slavery. The Omaquas, a people of South America, according to P. Veigh, press the heads of their children so violently between two planks that they become quite sharp at the top, and flat before and behind. They say they do this to give their heads a greater resemblance to the moon.\n\nMACROCERCI, a name given to that class of animals, which have tails longer than their bodies.\n\nMACROCOLUM, or MACROCOLUM (formed of μακρός \"large,\" and κολομή \"I join,\") among the Romans, the largest kind of paper then in use. It measured fifteen inches, and frequently two feet.\n\nMACROCOSM, a word denoting the great world or universe. It is compounded of the Greek words μακρός \"great,\" and κόσμος \"world.\"\n\nMACROOMP, or MACROOM, a town of Ireland, in the barony of Muskerry, county of Cork, and province of Munster, 142 miles from Dublin; it is situated amongst hills, in a dry gravelly limestone soil. This place is said to take its name from an old crooked oak, so called in Irish, which formerly grew here. The castle was first built in King John's time, soon after the English conquest (according to Sir Richard Cox), by the Carews; but others attribute it to the Daltons. It was repaired and beautified by Thague Macarty, who died in the year 1565, and was father to\nMACROURUS, a genus of fishes belonging to the order Thoracici. See Ichthyology Index.\n\nMACTATIO, in the Roman sacrifices, signifies the act of killing the victim. This was performed either by the priest himself, or some of his inferior officers, whom we meet with under the names of pope, agonet, culturari, and victimarius; but, before the beast was killed, the priest, turning himself to the east, drew a crooked line with his knife, from the forehead to the tail. Among the Greeks, this ceremony was performed most commonly by the priest, or, in his absence, by the most honourable person present. If the sacrifice was offered to the celestial gods, the victim's throat was bent up towards heaven; if to the infernal, or to heroes, it was killed with its throat towards the ground. The manner of killing the animal was by a stroke on the head, and, after it was fallen, thrusting a knife into its throat. Much notice was taken, and good or ill success predicted, from the struggles of the beast, or its quiet submission to the blow, from the flowing of the blood, and the length of time it happened to live after the fall, &c.\n\nMACULÆ, in Astronomy, dark spots appearing on the luminous surfaces of the sun and moon, and even some of the planets. See Astronomy Index.\n\nMAD-APPLE. See Solanum, Botany Index.\n\nMADAGASCAR, the largest of the African islands, is situated between 43° and 51° of E. Long. and between 12° and 26° of S. Lat.; extending in length near 1000 miles from north-north-east to south-south-west, and about 300 in breadth where broadest. It was discovered in 1506 by Laurence Almeida; but the Persians and the Arabians were acquainted with it from time immemorial under the name of Serandib. Alphonzo Albuquerque ordered Ruy Pereira dy Continho to visit the interior parts, and that general intrusted Tristan d'Acunha with the survey. The Portuguese called it the island of St Lawrence; the French who visited it in the reign of Henry IV, named it Isle Dauphine; its proper name is Madagasca. It is now, however, by common consent, called Madagascar.\n\nThis large island, according to many learned geographers, is the Cerné of Pliny, and the Menuthiasde of Ptolemy. It is everywhere watered by large rivers, streams and rivulets, which have their sources at the foot of that long chain of mountains which runs through the whole extent of the island from east to west. The two highest promontories are called Vivangaora and Boitimene.\n\nThese mountains (according to the abbé Rochon) enclose within their bosoms a variety of precious minerals and useful fruits. The traveller (who for the first time rambles over savage and mountainous countries, intersected with valleys and with hills, where nature left to herself brings forth the most singular and the most varied productions) is involuntarily surprized and terrified at the sight of precipices, the summits of which are crowned with monitrous trees, that seem coeval with the world. His astonishment is redoubled at the noise of those grand calcades, the approach to which is generally inaccessible. But to those views so sublimely picturesque, rural scenes soon succeed; little hills, gently rising grounds, and plains, the vegetation of which is never repressed by the intemperance or the vicissitude of the seasons. The eye contemplates with pleasure those vast savannahs which nourish numberless herds of bullocks and of sheep. You behold a flourishing agriculture, produced almost solely by the fertilizing womb of nature. The fortunate inhabitants of Madagascar do not bedew the earth with their sweat; they scarcely stir the ground with a rake, and even that slight preparation is sufficient. They scrape little holes at a small distance from each other, into which they scatter a few grains of rice, and cover them with their feet; and so great is the fertility of the soil, that the lands sown in this careless manner produce a hundred fold.\n\nThe forests present a prodigious variety of the most useful and the most beautiful trees; ebony, wood for dying, bamboos of an enormous thickness, and palm trees of every kind. The timber employed in shipbuilding is no less common than those kinds so much prized by the cabinetmaker. We are told by the French governor Flacourt, in his history of this island†, that in the year 1650 he lent to France 52,000 weight Grand Ile de Madagascar, Paris 1660.\n\nBesides the aromatic and medicinal herbs which abound in the forests, the island produces flax and hemp of a length and strength which surpass any in Europe. Sugar-canes, wax, honey of different kinds, tobacco, indigo, white pepper, gum-lac, ambergris, silk, and cotton, would long since have been objects of commerce which Madagascar would have yielded in profusion, if the Europeans, in visiting the island, had furnished the inhabitants with the necessary information for preparing and improving these several productions.\n\nThe sugar-canes (as we are informed by another traveller‡) are much larger and finer than any in the West Indies; being as thick as a man's wrist, and so full of juice, that a foot of them will weigh two pounds. When the natives travel, they carry a sugar-cane along with them, which will support them for two or three days. Here are also plenty of tamarinds; and such quantities of limes and oranges, that very large casks may...\nMadagascar may be filled with their juices at a trifling expense, as they may be purchased for iron pots, muskets, powder, ball, &c. During the short time that Admiral Watson's squadron stood here in 1754, Mr Ives preserved about half a hoghead full of those juices, which proved afterwards of the greatest service to the ships' crews.\n\nIt must be observed, however, that no good water is to be had at St Augustine in the south-west part of the island, where ships usually touch, unless boats are sent for it four or five miles up the river; and instead of filling their casks at low water (as is the case in most other rivers), they must begin to fill at about a quarter's flood: The reason assigned for this is, that the river has a communication with the sea at other places besides this of St Augustine's bay; and it has been found by experience, that the sea water brought into the river by the flood tide is not discharged till a quarter's flood of the next tide in St Augustine's bay; and for three miles up the river, the water is always very brackish, if not quite salt.\n\nThe abundance and variety of provisions of every kind, which a fine climate and fertile soil can produce, are on no part of the globe, according to M. Rochon, superior to those of Madagascar: game, wild-fowl, poultry, fish, cattle, and fruits, are alike plentiful. The oxen, Mr Ives also informs us, are large and fat, and have each a protuberance of fat between the shoulders, weighing about 20 pounds. Their flesh is greatly esteemed by all the European nations trading to India, and ships are sent to Madagascar on purpose to kill and salt them on the island. The protuberance of fat above mentioned is particularly esteemed after it has lain some time in salt; but our author says, that he could not join in the encomiums either on this piece or the beef in general; as the herbage on which the creatures feed gives their flesh a particular taste, which to him was disagreeable. The sheep differ little from the goats; being equally hairy, only that their heads are somewhat larger; their necks resemble that of a calf, and their tails weigh at least ten pounds. Vast quantities of locusts rise here from the low lands in thick clouds, extending sometimes to an incredible length and breadth. The natives eat these insects, and even prefer them to their finest fish. Their method of dressing them is to strip off their legs and wings, and fry them in oil.\n\nThe inhabitants (termed Melagaches or Madecoffes), M. Rochon informs us, are in person above the middle size of Europeans. The colour of the skin is different in different tribes: among some it is of a deep black, among others tawny; some of the natives are of a copper colour, but the complexion of by far the greatest number is olive. All those who are black have woolly hair like the negroes of the coast of Africa: those, on the other hand, who resemble Indians and Mulattoes, have hair equally straight with that of the Europeans; the nose is not broad and flat; the forehead is large and open; in short, all the features are regular and agreeable. Their physiognomy displays the appearance of frankness and of satisfaction; they are desirous only of learning such things as may minister to their necessities; that species of knowledge which demands reflection is indifferent to them; sober, agile, active, they spend the greatest part of their time either in sleep or in amusement. In fine, according to the Abé, the native of Madagascar, like savages in general, possesses a character equally devoid of vice and of virtue; the gratifications of the present moment solely occupy his reflections; he possesses no kind of foresight whatever; and he cannot conceive the idea that there are men in the world who trouble themselves about the evils of futurity.\n\nThe population of the island has been estimated at four millions; but this calculation is thought exaggerated by our author, and indeed it appears incredible to us. Every tribe or society inhabits its own canton, and is governed by its own customs. Each of these acknowledges a chief; this chief is sometimes elective, but more usually hereditary. The lands are not divided and portioned out, but belong to those who are at the trouble of cultivating them. These islanders make use of neither locks nor keys; the principal part of their food consists in rice, fish, and flesh; their rice is moistened with a soup which is seasoned with pimento, ginger, saffron, and aromatic herbs. They display wonderful cunning in catching a variety of birds, many of which are unknown in Europe; they have the pheasant, the partridge, the quail, the pintado, the wild duck, teal of five or six different kinds, the blue hen, the black paroquet, and the turtle-dove, in great plenty; and also a bat of a monstrous size, which is much prized on account of its exquisite flavour. These last are so hideous in their appearance, that they at first terrify the European sailors: but after they have vanquished their repugnance to them, they prize their flesh infinitely before that of the pullets of their own country. The Melagaches also catch an immense quantity of sea-fish: such as the dorado, the sole, the herring, the mackerel, the turtle, &c. with oysters, crabs, &c. The rivers afford excellent eels, and mullets of an exquisite flavour.\n\nThe inhabitants near St Augustine's bay, Mr Ives informs us, speak as much broken English as enables them to exchange their provisions for European articles. These, on the part of the Melagaches are cattle, poultry, milk, fruit, rice, salt, porcelain, potatoes, yams, fish, lances, and shells. From the Europeans they receive muskets, powder, bullets, flints, cloths, (including handkerchiefs, and linen of all kinds), beads, iron pots, &c.—Silver, which they call manila, is in great esteem with them, and is made by them into bracelets for their wives.\n\nThat part of the island at which the English squadron touched, is the dominions of the king of Baba, who, by the account of Mr Ives, seemed greatly to affect to be an Englishman. They had no sooner touched at the island, than they were waited on by one called Robin Hood, and another person, both of whom bore the office of pursers. Along with these were Philibey the general; John Anderson and Frederic Martin, captains. Nor did the king himself and his family disdain to pay them a visit; who, in like manner were distinguished by English names; the king's eldest son being called the prince of Wales, and the court not being without a duke of Cumberland, a prince Augustus, princesses, &c. as in England. All these grandees came on board naked, excepting only a slight covering about their loins and on their shoulders, made of a kind of grass growing on the island; which they had adorned with small glass beads by way of border or fringe. Their hair resembled that of the Indians.\nMadagascar Indians in being long and black, rather than the woolly heads of the African negroes. \"The wives of the Malagaches (according to our author) take great pains with their husbands hair; sometimes putting it in large and regular curls; at other times braiding it in great order, and making it shine with a particular oil which the island produces. They can always carry in their hands a wooden lance headed with iron, which is commonly made very neat; and they are such excellent marksmen, that they will strike with it a very small object at 30 or 40 yards distance. They have also commonly a musket, which they get from Europeans in exchange for cattle, and are always sure to keep in excellent order. I am sorry to say (continues Mr Ives) that the English are frequently guilty of great impositions in this kind of traffic, by defrauding of cheap and ill-tempered barrels among the poor inhabitants, who sometimes lose their lives by the bursting of these pieces. Such iniquitous practices as these must in the end prove injurious to the nation; and has indeed already made the name of more than one-half of these traders truly infamous among the deduced but hitherto friendly Madagascarians.\n\n\"They are a civil and good-natured people, but easily provoked, and apt to throw their resentment on the least provocation, especially when they think themselves injured or slighted. Another characteristic of them is, the very high notions of dignity they entertain of their king; which is carried to such a height, that they are never more sensibly hurt than when they imagine he is treated with incivility or disrespect. This mighty monarch resides in a town built with mud, about 12 miles up the country from St Augustine's bay. On the east side of the bay, as you enter, there resided one Prince William, a relation and tributary to the king; but who in most cases acted as an independent prince, and always used his utmost endeavours with the officers to cause them buy their provisions from him, and not from the king or his subjects. In this prince's territories, not far from the sea, are the remains of a fort built by Avery the pirate.\n\n\"All the women of Madagascar, excepting the very poorest sort, wear a covering over their breasts and shoulders, ornamented with glass beads, and none go without a cloth about their loins. They commonly walk with a long slender rod or stick. The men are allowed to marry as many women as they can support.\n\n\"During our stay at this island (says Mr Ives), I observed with great concern, several miserable objects in the last stage of the venereal disease. They had not been able to find any cure; and as far as I could learn, their doctors are totally ignorant of medicine. The only method they use for curing all distempers, as well external as internal, is the wearing on the arm or neck a particular charm or amulet; or belmearing the part affected with earth moistened with the juice of some plant or tree, and made up into soft paste.\n\n\"I took some pains to learn their religious tenets; and find that they worship one Universal Father; whom, when they speak in English, they call God; and in whom they conceive all kinds of perfection to reside. The sun they look upon as a glorious body; and, I believe, as a spiritual being, but created and dependent. They frequently look up to it with wonder, if not with praise and adoration. They make their supplications to the One Almighty, and offer sacrifices to him in their distresses. I had the curiosity to attend a sacrifice, at the hut of John Anderson, whose father had for a long time been afflicted with sickness. About sunset an ox was brought into the yard; and the son, who officiated as priest, slew it. An altar was reared high, and the post of it was sprinkled with the blood of the victim. The head after its being severed from the body, was placed, with the horns on, at the foot of the altar: the cauldron was burned on the fire, and most of the pluck and entrails boiled in a pot. The sick man, who was brought to the door, and placed on the ground so as to face the sacrifice, prayed often, and seemingly with great fervency. His eyes were fixed attentively towards the heavens, and his hands held up in a supplicating posture. The ceremony ended with the son's cutting up the ox into small pieces; the greatest part of which he distributed among the poor slaves belonging to his father and himself; reserving, however, some of the best pieces for his own use. Upon the whole, I saw so many circumstances in this Madagascarian sacrifice, so exactly resembling those described in the Old Testament as offered up by the Jews, that I could not turn my thoughts back to the original, without being sensibly struck by the exactness of the copy.\"\n\nWhen the squadron first arrived at Madagascar, the king of Baba, a man of about 60 years of age, was ill of the gout. Having demanded of Admiral Watson some presents, the latter complimented him, among other things, with some brandy. The monarch then asked him if he had any doctor with him, and if he was a great doctor, and a king's doctor? To all which being answered in the affirmative, he desired him to bring some medicines (medicines) for his sick knee. With this requisition Mr Ives desirous to comply; but having waited until some officers should be ready to accompany him, his majesty, in the mean time, took such a dose of brandy as quickly sent the gout into his head, and occasioned his death. Mr Ives observes, that it happened very luckily for him that the monarch's decease happened without his having taken any of the medicines intended for him, as it would have been impossible to avoid the imputation of having poisoned him, which would certainly have been reflected by his loyal subjects.\n\nThe king's death occasioned great confusion; the grandees being delirious that it should be concealed for some time. This, however, was found impossible; on which they set off for the Mud Town about 11 o'clock the same evening. All the inhabitants of the village followed their example; leaving only the dogs, who set up the most hideous howling. Captain Frederic Martin coming to take leave of the English, begged with great earnestness for a fresh supply of gunpowder; whispering that the king was dead, and that they should in all probability go to war about making another. They had been formerly told, that one who had the title of duke of Baba would certainly succeed to the throne; but they afterwards learned, that Phileby the general having espoused the cause of Raphani the late king's son, and taken him under his tutelage and protection, this youth, who was only about\nMadagascar, 16 years of age, succeeded his father as king of Baha.\n\nThe following is a description of the southern division of the island, from the Abbé Rochon.\n\n\"That part of Madagascar in which Fort Dauphin is situated is very populous. Almost all the villages are placed on eminences, and surrounded with two rows of strong palisadoes, somewhat in the manner of such of our fences as are composed of hurdles and turf. Within, is a parapet of solid earth about four feet in height; large pointed bamboos placed at the distance of five feet from each other, and sunk in a pit, form a kind of loop-holes, which contribute towards the defence of these villages, some of which are besides fortified with a ditch ten feet in breadth and six in depth. The dwelling of the chief is called a donac. When the chiefs go abroad, they are always provided with a musket and a stick armed with iron, and adorned at the extremity with a little tuft of cow's hair. They wear a bonnet of red wool. It is chiefly by the colour of their bonnet that they are distinguished from their subjects. Their authority is extremely limited; however, in the province of Carcanoffi, the lands by custom belong to their chiefs, who distribute them among their subjects for the purposes of cultivation; they exact a trifling quit-rent in return, which in their language is called fanfa. The people of Carcanoffi are not altogether ignorant of the art of writing; they even possess some historical works in the Madagascar tongue: but their learned men, whom they term Ombiaffes, make use of the Arabic characters alone. They have treaties on medicine, geomancy, and judicial astrology; the most renowned live in the province of Matanane; it is in that district that magic still remains in all its glory; the Matanes are actually dreaded by the other Madagascanes on account of their excellence in this delusive art. The Ombiaffes have public schools in which they teach geomancy and astrology. The natives have undoubtedly learned the art of writing from the Arabians, who made a conquest of this island about 300 years since.\n\n\"The people of the province of Anoiffi, near Fort Dauphin, are lively, gay, sensible, and grateful; they are passionately fond of women; are never melancholy in their company; and their principal occupation is to please the sex; indeed, whenever they meet their wives, they begin to sing and dance. The women, from being happy, are always in good humour. Their lively and cheerful character is extremely pleasing to the Europeans. I have often been present at their assemblies, where affairs of importance have been agitated; I have observed their dances, their sports, and their amusements, and I have found them free from those excellences which are but too common among polished nations. Indeed I was too young as this time for my observations to be of much weight; but if my experience be insufficient to inspire confidence, I beg the reader will rather consider the nature of things, than the relations given by men without principles or intelligence, who fancy that they have a right to tyrannize over the inhabitants of every country which they can subdue. If the people of Madagascar have sometimes availed themselves of treachery, they have been forced to it by the tyranny of the Europeans. The weak have no other arms against the strong. Could they defend themselves by any other means from our artillery and bayonets? They are uninformed and helpless; and we avail ourselves of their weaknesses, in order to make them submit to our covetousness and caprice. They receive the most cruel and oppressive treatment, in return for the hospitality which they generously bestow on us; and we call them traitors and cowards, when we force them to break the yoke with which we have been pleased to load them.\"\n\nIn the second volume of Count Benyovszky's Memoirs and Travels we have the following account of the religion, government, &c. of the people of this island.\n\n\"The Madagascar nation believe in a Supreme Being, whom they call Zanhare, which denotes creator of all things. They honour and revere this Being; but have dedicated no temple to him, and much less have they substituted idols. They make sacrifices, by killing oxen and sheep, and they address all these libations to God. It has been asserted, that this nation likewise makes offerings to the devil; but in this there is a deception; for the piece of the sacrificed beast which is usually thrown into the fire is not intended in honour of the devil, as is usually pretended. This custom is very ancient, and no one can tell the true reason of it. With regard to the immortality of the soul, the Madagascar people are persuaded, that, after their death, their spirit will return again to the region in which the Zanhare dwells; but they by no means admit that the spirit of man, after his death, can suffer any evil. As to the distinction of evil or good, they are persuaded that the good and upright man shall be recompensed, in this life, by a good state of health, the constancy of his friends, the increase of his fortunes, the obedience of his children, and the happiness of beholding the prosperity of his family; and they believe that the wicked man's fate shall be the contrary to this. The Madagascar people, upon this conviction, when they make oaths, add benedictions in favour of those who keep them, and curses against those who break them. In this manner it is that they appeal to the judgement of Zanhare, in making agreements; and it has never been known, or heard of, that a native of Madagascar has broken his oath, provided it was made in the usual manner, which they say was prescribed by their forefathers.\n\n\"As to their kings and form of government, &c., the Madagascar people have always acknowledged the line of Raminin, as that to which the rights of Ampanafacabe or sovereign belongs. They have considered this line as extinct since the death of Dian Ramiri Lartizon, which happened 66 years ago, and whose body was buried upon a mountain, out of which the river Manangouron springs; but having acknowledged the heir of this line on the female side, they re-established this title in the year 1776. The right of the Ampanafacabe consists in nominating the Rohandrians to assist in the cabars, at which all those who are cited are bound to appear; and the judgement of the Ampanafacabe in his cabar is decisive. Another prerogative of the Ampanafacabe is, that each Rohandrian is obliged to leave him by will a certain proportion of his property, which the successors usually purchase by a slight tribute or fine. Thirdly, The Ampanafacabe has a right to exact from each Rohandrian one-tenth...\"\ntenth of the produce of his land, and a number of horned cattle and slaves, in proportion to the riches of the country possessed by each Rohandrian. The second order is composed of the Rohandrians, or princes. Since the loss of the Ampanacabe, three of these Rohandrians have assumed the title of kings, namely the Rohandrian of the province of Mahavelou, named Hiavi; of the province of Voemar, named Lambouin; and a third at Bombetoki, named Cimanounpau. The third order consists of the Voaziri, or lords of a district, composed of several villages. The fourth order consists of the Lohavohits, or chiefs of villages. The fifth order, Ondzatzi, who are freemen, compose the attendants or followers of the Rohandrians, Voaziri, or Lohavohits. The sixth order consists of Ombialles, or learned men; and this order forms the warriors, workmen, physicians, and diviners: these last possess no charge. The seventh order consists of Amurias or slaves.\n\n\"Having made inquiries from Bombetoki passing to the northward, and as far as Itapere, the result proved that there are 38 Rohandrians actually reigning, and 287 Voaziri. With respect to the Lohavohits, Ondzatzi, and Ombialles, it was not possible to obtain any accurate determination of their number. These orders preserve a regular gradation, respecting which it would be very difficult to give a detailed account. They live in the manner we read of concerning the ancient patriarchs. Every father of a family is priest and judge in his own house, though he depends upon the Lohavohits, who superintends his conduct. This last is answerable to his Voaziri, and the Voaziri to the Rohandrian.\n\n\"The Madagascar people having no communication with the main land of Ethiopia, have not altered their primitive laws; and the language throughout the whole extent of the island is the same. It would be a rash attempt to determine the origin of this nation; it is certain that it consists of three distinct races, who have for ages past formed intermixtures which vary to infinity. The first race is that of Zafe Ibrahim, or descendants of Abraham; but they have no vestige of Judaism, except circumcision, and some names, such as Isaac, Reuben, Jacob, &c. This race is of a brown colour.—The second race is that of Zafarimini: with respect to this, some books which are still extant among the Ombialles, affirm that it is not more than six centuries since their arrival at Madagascar.—With respect to the third race of Zafe Camambou, it is of Arabian extraction, and arrived much more lately than the others from the coasts of Ethiopia: hence it possesses neither power nor credit, and fills only the charges of writers, historians, poets, &c.\n\n\"In regard to arts and trades, the Madagascar nation are contented with such as are necessary to make their moveables, tools, utensils, and arms for defence; to construct their dwellings, and the boats which are necessary for their navigation; and finally, to fabricate cloths and stuffs for their clothing. They are dexterous only of possessing the necessary supplies of immediate utility and convenience. The principal and most respected business, is the manufacture of iron and steel. The artists in this way call themselves ampanefa vola. They are very expert in fusing the ore, and forging utensils, such as hatchets, hammers, anvils, knives, spades, sagayes, razors, pincers and tweezers for pulling out the hair, &c. The second class consists of the goldsmiths (ompanefa vola mena): they cast gold in ingots, and make up bracelets, buckles, earrings, drops, rings, &c. The third are called ompanavilanga, and are potters. The fourth are the ompanavilava, or turners in wood, who make boxes called vatto, plates, wooden and horn spoons, bee-hives, coffins, &c. The fifth ompan cecofu, or carpenters. They are very expert in this business, and make use of the rule, the plane, the compasses, &c. The sixth are the ompanavivi, or ropemakers. They make their ropes of different kinds of bark of trees, and likewise of hemp. The seventh, ampan lamba, or weavers. This business is performed by women only, and it would be reckoned dishonourable in a man to exercise it. The ombialles are the literary men and physicians, who give advice only. The herawivivi are comedians and dancers.\n\n\"The Madagascar people always live in society; that is to say, in towns and villages. The towns are surrounded by a ditch and palliasses (as already mentioned), at the extremities of which a guard of from 12 to 20 armed men is kept. The houses of private people consist of a convenient cottage, surrounded by several small ones: the master of the house dwells in the largest, and his women or slaves lodge in the smaller. These houses are built of wood, covered with leaves of the palm tree or straw.\n\n\"The houses of the great men of the country are very spacious; each house is composed of two walls and four apartments: round about the principal house other smaller habitations are built for the accommodation of the women, and the whole family of the chief; but the slaves cannot pass the night within them.—Most of the houses inhabited by the Rohandrians are built with taste and admirable symmetry.\"\n\nThe French attempted to conquer and take possession of the whole island, by order, and for the use of their Most Christian Majesties Louis XIII. and XIV., and they maintained a footing on it from the year 1642 to 1657. During this period, by the most cruel treachery, they taught the native princes the barbarous traffic in slaves, by villanously selling to the Dutch governor of Mauritius a number of innocent people, who had been afflicting them in forming a settlement at Fort Dauphin.\n\nThe Abbé Rochon tells us, that the infidelity of the air in Madagascar determined his countrymen in 1664 to quit that immense island, in order to establish themselves at so inconsiderable a place as the isle of Bourbon, which is scarcely perceptible in a map of the globe: but it is apparent, from the account of the state of the French affairs on the island of Madagascar, in 1661, when Flacourt's narrative was published, that their ill treatment of the natives had raised such a general and formidable opposition to their residence in the country, that the French were obliged to abandon their possessions for other reasons than the unhealthy qualities of the climate. We have not room here for a detail of all the oppressive measures of the French, which the abbé himself candidly censures in the strongest terms; but shall extract the following narrative, both because it is interesting in itself, and exhibits the causes and the means of their expulsion.\nLa Cafe, one of the French officers employed by the governor of Fort Dauphin against the natives, was so successful in all his enterprises, that they called him Deaan Pous, the name of a chief who had formerly conquered the whole island. The French governor, jealous of his renown, treated him harshly, and refused to allow him the rank or honours due to his valour. The sovereign of the province of Amboulle, called Deaan Rafcitat, taking advantage of his discontent, prevailed on him to become his general. Five Frenchmen followed him. Deaan Nong, the daughter of Rafcitat, captivated by the person and heroism of La Cafe, offered him her hand with the consent of her father. The chief, grown old, infirm, and arrived at the last stage of existence, had the satisfaction of securing the happiness of his subjects, by appointing his son-in-law absolute master of the rich province of Amboulle. La Cafe, in marrying Deaan Nong, refused to take the titles and honours attached to the sovereign power; he would accept of no other character, than that of the first subject of his wife, who was declared sovereign at the death of her father. Secure in the affection of this princess, who was not only possessed of personal charms, but of courage and great qualities, he was beloved and respected by her family, and by all the people of Amboulle, who reverenced him as a father; and yet, how muchsoever he wished it, he was unable to contribute to the prosperity of his countrymen at Fort Dauphin, whom he knew to be in the utmost distress. The governor, regarding him as a traitor, had set a price on his head, and on the heads of the five Frenchmen who had followed him. The neighbouring chiefs, irritated at this treatment of a man whom they so much venerated, unanimously refused to supply the fort with provisions. This occasioned a famine in the place, which, with a contagious fever and other maladies, reduced the French garrison to 80 men.\n\nThe establishment at Fort Dauphin, on the point of being totally destroyed, was preserved for a short time from ruin by the arrival of a vessel from France, commanded by Kercadio an officer of Brittany, who, with the assistance of a young advocate who had been kidnapped on board the vessel, prevailed on the envious and implacable governor Chamargou to make peace with La Cafe and his sovereign spouse Deaan Nong. This peace, however, lasted but for a short time; the French, restless and insolent to the neighbouring nations, again drew on them the vengeance of the natives. Even the few friends whom they had been able to acquire by means of La Cafe, were rendered hostile to them by the tyrannic zeal of the missionaries; who, not contented with being tolerated and allowed to make converts, insisted on Deaan Manang, sovereign of Mandarey, a powerful, courageous, and intelligent chief, well disposed to the French, to divorce all his wives but one. This prince, not convinced of the necessity of such a measure, assured them that he was unable to change his habits and way of living, which were those of his forefathers. \"You would allow me (says he) to have one wife; but if the possession of one woman is a blessing, why should a numerous seraglio be an evil, while peace and concord reign among those of whom it is composed? Do you see among us any indications of jealousy or hatred? No, all our women are good; all try to make Madagascar happy; and I am more than twice their master.\" This speech had no effect on Father Rochon, superior of the Madagascar mission. He promptly ordered him instantly to repudiate all his wives except one; and threatened, in presence of the women, to have them taken from him by the French soldiers, if he hesitated in complying with his commands. It is easy to imagine, says M. Rochon, with what indignation this language must have been heard in the donac or palace of this prince. The females attacked the missionary on all sides; loaded him with execrations and blows; and, in their fury, would doubtless have afforded him no more quarter than the Thracian women did Orpheus, if Deaan Manang, notwithstanding his own agitation, had not made use of all his authority to save him.\n\nIn order to free himself from the persecution of this priest, he removed with his family 70 or 80 miles up into the country; but he was soon followed by Father Stephens and another missionary, with their attendants. The chief, Manang, still received them civilly; but he intreated them no longer to insist on the conversion of him and his people, as it was impossible to oblige them to quit the customs and manners of their ancestors. The only reply which Father Stephen made to this intreaty, was by tearing off the oii, and the amulets and charms which the chief wore as sacred badges of his own religion; and, throwing them into the fire, he declared war against him and his nation. This violence instantly cost him and his followers their lives: they were all massacred by order of Manang, who vowed the destruction of all the French in the island; in which intention he proceeded in a manner that has been related by an eyewitness, who was afterwards provincial commissary of artillery, in a narrative published at Lyons in 1722, entitled, Voyage de Madagascar. \"Our yoke (says the Abbé Rochon) was become odious and intolerable. Historians, for the honour of civilized nations, should bury in oblivion the afflicting narratives of the atrocities exercised on these people, whom we are pleased to call barbarous, treacherous, and deceitful, because they have revolted against European adventurers, whose least crime is that of violating the sacred rites of hospitality.\"\n\nIt was about the year 1672 that the French were totally driven from the island of Madagascar; and no considerable attempts were made to form fresh establishments there till within these few years, by M. de Modeve, and by Count Benyowski; neither of which was attended with success, for reasons given by the Abbé, but which we have not room to detail.\n\nMadder, a plant used in dyeing. See Rubia, Botany Index; and for its dyeing properties, see Dyeing.\n\nMadeiras, a cluster of islands situated in the Atlantic ocean in W. Long. 16°, and between 32° and 33° N. Lat.—The largest of them, called Madeira, from which the rest take their name, is about 55 English miles long, and 10 miles broad; and was first discovered on the 2d of July, in the year 1419, by João Gonzales Zarco, there being no historical foundation for the fabulous report of its discovery by one Machin an Englishman. It is divided into two capitans, named Funchal and Maxico, from the towns of those...\nMadeiras, those names. The former contains two judicatures, viz. Funchal and Galheta; the latter being a town with the title of a county, belonging to the family of Castello Melhor. The second capitania likewise comprehends two judicatures, viz. Maxico (read Matheo) and San Vicente.\n\nFunchal is the only citadel or city in the island, which has also seven villas or towns; of which there are four, Calheta, Camara de Lobos, Ribeira Braba, and Ponta de Sol in the capitania of Funchal, which is divided into 26 parishes. The other three are in the capitania of Maxico, which consists of 17 parishes; these towns are called Maxico, San Vicente, and Santa Cruz.\n\nThere is one curiosity in the town of Funchal, which deserves to be taken notice of, and that is a chamber in one of the corners of the Franciscan convent, the walls and ceiling of which are completely covered with rows of human skulls and human thigh bones, so arranged that in the obtuse angle made by each pair of the latter, crossing each other obliquely, is placed a skull. The only vacant space that appears is in the centre of the side opposite to the door, on which there is an extraordinary painting above a kind of altar, but what the subject it is intended to represent, it is difficult to determine. A figure probably intended for St Francis, the patron saint, seems to be intent on trying in a balance the comparative weight of a firmer and a faint. A dirty lamp suspended from the ceiling, and just glimmering in the socket, serves dimly to light up this dismal den of skulls. The monk who attends as the man, is careful to impress on the minds of those who visit it, the idea that they are all relics of holy men who died on the island, although Mr Barrow is of opinion that the church-yard must have been frequently robbed, in order to accumulate such a prodigious number of skulls, which from a rough computation made by that gentleman, could not be under 3000.\n\nThe governor is at the head of all the civil and military departments of this island, of Porto Santo, the Salvages, and the Ilhas Defartas; which last only contain the temporary huts of some fishermen, who resort thither in pursuit of their bustles; his salary is computed to be worth 2000l. per annum, 200l. of which is in the form of a present from the English merchants.\n\nThe law department is under the corregidor, who is appointed by the king of Portugal, commonly sent from Lisbon, and holds his place during the king's pleasure. All causes come to him from inferior courts by appeal. Each judicature has a senate; and a juiz or judge, whom they choose, presides over them. At Funchal he is called Juiz da Fora; and in the absence, or after the death of the corregidor, acts as his deputy. The foreign merchants elect their own judges, called the Provador, who is at the same time collector of the king's customs and revenues, which amount in all to about 12,000l. sterling. Far the greatest part of this sum is applied towards the salaries of civil and military officers, the pay of troops, and the maintenance of public buildings. This revenue arises, first from the tenth of all the produce of this island belonging to the king, by virtue of his office as grand master of the order of Christ; secondly, from ten per cent. duties laid on all imports, provisions excepted; and finally, from the eleven per cent. charged Madeiras, on all exports.\n\nThe island has but one company of regular soldiers of 100 men; the rest of the military force is a militia consisting of 3500 men, divided into companies, each commanded by a captain, who has one lieutenant under him and one ensign. There is no pay given to either the private men or the officers of this militia; and yet their places are much sought after, on account of the rank which they communicate. These troops are embodied once a-year, and exercised once a-month. All the military are commanded by the Serjeante Mor. The governor has two Capitanos de Sal about him, who do duty as aides-de-camp.\n\nThe secular priests on the island are about 1200, many of whom are employed as private tutors. Since the expulsion of the Jesuits, no regular public school is to be found here; unless we except a seminary, where a priest, appointed for that purpose, instructs and educates ten students at the king's expense. They wear a red cloak over the usual black gowns worn by ordinary students. All those who intend to go into orders, are obliged to qualify themselves by studying in the university of Coimbra, lately re-established in Portugal. There is also a dean and chapter at Madeira, with a bishop at their head, whose income is considerably greater than the governor's; it consists of 110 pipes of wine, and of 40 muys of wheat, each containing 24 bushels; which amounts in common years to 3000l. sterling. Here are likewise 60 or 70 Franciscan friars, in four monasteries, one of which is at Funchal. About 300 nuns live on the island, in four convents, of the order of Mercy, Sta Clara, Incarnacao, and Dom Jesus. Those of the last mentioned institution may marry whenever they choose, and leave their monastery.\n\nIn the year 1768, the inhabitants living in the 43 parishes of Madeira, amounted to 63,913, of whom there were 31,341 males and 32,572 females. But in that year 5243 persons died, and no more than 2198 children were born; so that the number of the dead exceeded that of the born by 3045. It is highly probable that some epidemic disease carried off a disproportionate number in that year, as the island would shortly be entirely depopulated if the mortality were always equal to this. Another circumstance concurs to strengthen this supposition, namely, the excellence of the climate. The weather is in general mild and temperate: in summer, the heat is very moderate on the higher parts of the island, whether the better sort of people retire for that season; and in the winter the snow remains there for several days, whilst it is never known to continue above a day or two in the lower parts.\n\nThe common people of this island are of a tawny colour, and well shaped; though they have large feet, owing perhaps to the efforts they are obliged to make in climbing the craggy paths of this mountainous country. Their faces are oblong, their eyes dark; their black hair naturally falls in ringlets, and begins to crisp in some individuals, which may perhaps be owing to intermarriages with negroes; in general, they are hard featured, but not disagreeable. Their women are too frequently ill-favoured, and want the florid complexion, which, when united to a pleasing attire,\nblage of regular features, gives our northern fair ones\nthe superiority over all their sex. They are small,\nhave prominent cheek bones, large feet, an ungraceful\ngait, and the colour of the darkest brunette. The\njust proportion of the body, the fine form of their\nhands, and their large lively eyes, seem in some mea-\nsure to compensate for those defects. The labour-\ning men, in summer, wear linen trowsers, a coarse\nshirt, a large hat, and boots; some have a short jacket\nmade of cloth, and a long cloak, which they some-\ntimes carry over their arm. The women wear a pet-\nticoat, and a short corset or jacket, closely fitting\ntheir shapes, which is simple, and often not an in-\nelegant dress. They have also a short but wide\ncloak; and those that are unmarried tie their hair on\nthe crown of their head, on which they wear no co-\nvering.\n\nThe country people are exceeding sober and frugal;\ntheir diet in general consisting of bread and onions,\nor other roots, and little animal food. However,\nthey avoid eating tripe, or any offals, because it is\nproverbially said of a very poor man, \"He is reduced\nto eat tripe.\" Their common drink is water, or an\ninfusion of the remaining rind or skin of the grape\n(after it has passed through the wine press), which\nwhen fermented acquires some tartness and acidity, but\ncannot be kept very long. The wine for which the\nisland is so famous, and which their own hands prepare,\nfeldom if ever regales them.\n\nTheir principal occupation is the planting and rais-\ning of vines; but as that branch of agriculture re-\nquires little attendance during the greatest part of the\nyear, they naturally incline to idleness. The warmth\nof the climate, which renders great provision against\nthe inclemencies of weather unnecessary, and the ease\nwith which the cravings of appetite are satisfied, must\ntend to indolence, wherever the regulations of the\nlegislature do not counteract it, by endeavouring, with\nthe prospect of increasing happiness, to infuse the spi-\nrit of industry. It seems the Portuguese government\ndoes not pursue the proper methods against this dan-\ngerous lethargy of the state. They have lately ordered\nthe plantation of olive trees here, on such spots as\nare too dry and barren to bear vines; but they have\nnot thought of giving temporary assistance to the la-\nbourers, and have offered no premium by which these\nmight be induced to conquer their reluctance to innova-\ntions and aversion to labour.\n\nThe vineyards are held only on an annual tenure,\nand the farmer reaps but four-tenths of the produce,\nsince other four tenths are paid in kind to the owner\nof the land, one tenth to the king, and one to the\nclergy. Such small profits, joined to the thought of\ntrailing merely for the advantage of others, if improve-\nments were attempted, entirely preclude the hopes of\na future increase. Oppressed as they are, they have\nhowever preserved a high degree of cheerfulness and\ncontentment; their labours are commonly alleviated\nwith songs, and in the evening they assemble from\ndifferent cottages to dance to the drowsy music of a\nguitar.\n\nThe inhabitants of the towns are more ill-favoured\nthan the country people, and often pale and lean.\nThe men wear French clothes, commonly black, which\ndo not seem to fit them, and have been in fashion in\nthe polite world about half a century ago. Their la-\ndies are delicate, and have agreeable features; but the\ncharacteristic jealousy of the men still locks them up,\nand deprives them of a happiness which the country\nwomen, amidst all their distresses, enjoy. Many of the\nbetter people are a sort of petite noblesse, which we\nwould call gentry, whose genealogical pride makes them\nuncomfortable and ignorant, and causes a ridiculous affecta-\ntion of gravity. The landed property is in the hands\nof a few ancient families, who live at Funchal, and in\nthe various towns on the island.\n\nMadeira consists of one large mountain, whose\nbranches rise everywhere from the sea towards the\ncentre of the island, converging to the summit, in the\nmidst of which is a depression or excavation, called the\nVal by the inhabitants, always covered with a fresh\nand delicate herbage. The stones on the island seem to\nhave been in the fire, are full of holes, and of a black-\nish colour; in short, the greater part of them are lava.\nA few of them are of the kind which the Derbyshire\nminers call claystone. The soil of the whole island is\na tarras mixed with some particles of clay, lime, and\nsand, and has much the same appearance as some\nearths on the isle of Ascension. From this circum-\nstance, and from the excavation of the summit of the\nmountain, it is probable, that in some remote period\na volcano has produced the lava and the ochreous par-\nticles, and that the Val was formerly its crater.\n\nMany brooks and small rivulets descend from the\nsummits in deep chasms or glens, which separate the\nvarious parts of the island. The beds of the brooks are\nin some places covered with stones of all sizes, carried\ndown from the higher parts by the violence of winter\nrains or floods of melted snow. The water is conduct-\ned by weirs and channels in the vineyards, where each\nproprietor has the use of it for a certain time; some\nbeing allowed to keep a constant supply of it, some\nto use it thrice, others twice, and others only once a\nweek. As the heat of the climate renders this supply\nof water to the vineyards absolutely necessary, it is\nnot without great expense that a new vineyard can be\nplanted; for the maintenance of which, the owners must\npurchase water at a high price, from those who are\nconstantly supplied, and are thus enabled to spare some\nof it.\n\nWherever a level piece of ground can be contrived\nin the higher hills, the natives make plantations of ed-\ndoes enclosed by a kind of dike to cause a stagnation,\nas that plant succeeds best in swampy ground. Its leaves\nserve as food for hogs, and the country people use\nthe roots for their own nourishment.\n\nThe sweet potato is planted for the same purpose,\nand makes a principal article of diet; together with\nchestnuts, which grow in extensive woods, on the higher\nparts of the island, where the vine will not thrive.\nWheat and barley are likewise sown, especially in\nspots where the vines are decaying through age, or\nwhere they are newly planted. But the crops do not\nproduce above three months provisions; and the in-\nhabitants are therefore obliged to have recourse to\nother food, besides importing considerable quantities\nof corn from North America in exchange for wine.\nThe want of manure, and the inability of the people,\nare in some measure the causes of this disadvantage;\nbut supposing husbandry to be carried to its perfection,\n\nVol. XII. Part I.\nMAD\n\nMadras; here, they could not raise corn sufficient for their consumption. They make their threshing-floors of a circular form, in a corner of a field, which is cleared and beaten solid for the purpose. The sheaves are laid round about it; and a square board, stuck full of sharp flints below, is dragged over them by a pair of oxen, the driver getting on it to increase its weight. This machine cuts the straw as if it had been chopped, and frees the grain from the husk, from which it is afterwards separated.\n\nThe great produce of Madeira is the wine, from which it has acquired fame and support. Where the soil, exposure, and supply of water, will admit of it, the vine is cultivated. One or more walks, about a yard or two wide, interfect each vineyard, and are included by stone walls two feet high. Along these walks, which are arched over with laths about seven feet high, they erect wooden pillars at regular distances, to support a lattice-work of bamboos, which slopes down from both sides of the walk, till it is only a foot and a half or two feet high, in which elevation it extends over the whole vineyard. The vines are in this manner supported from the ground, and the people have room to root out the weeds which spring up between them. In the season of the vintage, they creep under this lattice-work, cut off the grapes, and lay them into baskets; some bunches of these grapes weigh six pounds and upwards. This method of keeping the ground clean and moist, and ripening the grapes in the shade, contributes to give the Madeira wines that excellent flavour and body for which they are remarkable. The owners of vineyards are however obliged to allot a certain spot of ground for the growth of bamboos; for the lattice-work cannot be made without them; and it is said some vineyards lie quite neglected for want of this useful reed.\n\nThe wines are not all of equal goodness, and consequently of different prices. The best, made of a vine imported from Candia by order of the Infante of Portugal, Don Henry, is called Madeira Malvasia, a pipe of which cannot be bought on the spot for less than 45l. or 45l. sterling. It is an exceeding rich sweet wine, and is only made in a small quantity. The next sort is a dry wine, such as is exported for the London market, at 20l. or 31l. sterling the pipe. Inferior sorts for the East India, West India, and North American markets, sell at 28l. 25l. and 20l. sterling. About 30,000 pipes, upon a mean, are made every year, each containing 110 gallons. About 13,000 pipes of the better sorts are exported; and all the rest is made into brandy for the Brazils, converted into vinegar, or consumed at home.\n\nThe largest quantity of this article exported in the course of one year, is said to have amounted to 15,000 pipes, valued at 500,000l. of which 5,500 pipes were sent to the East Indies, 4,500 to England, 3,000 to the West Indies, and 2,000 to America.\n\nThe enclosures of the vineyards consist of walls, and hedges of prickly pear, pomegranates, myrtles, brambles, and wild roses. The gardens produce peaches, apricots, quinces, apples, pears, walnuts, chestnuts, and many other European fruits; together with now and then some tropical plants, such as bananas, goavas, and pine-apples.\n\nAll the common domestic animals of Europe are likewise found at Madeira; and their mutton and beef, though small, is very well tasted. Their horses are small, but sure-footed; and with great agility climb the difficult paths, which are the only means of communication in the country. They have no wheel-carriages of any kind: but in the town they use a fort of drays or sledges, formed of two pieces of plank joined by cross pieces, which make an acute angle before; these are drawn by oxen, and are used to transport casks of wine, and other heavy goods, to and from the warehouses.\n\nThe animals of the feathered tribe, which live wild here, are more numerous than the wild quadrupeds; there being only the common gray rabbit here, as a representative of the last mentioned class. Tame birds, such as turkeys, geese, ducks, and hens, are very rare, which is perhaps owing to the scarcity of corn.\n\nThere are no snakes whatsoever in Madeira; but all the housetops, vineyards, and gardens, swarm with lizards. The friars of one of the convents complained to Mr Fonler, that these vermin destroyed the fruit in their garden; they had therefore placed a brass-kettle in the ground to catch them, as they are constantly running about in quest of food. In this manner they daily caught hundreds, which could not get out on account of the smooth sides of the kettle, but were forced to perish.\n\nThe shores of Madeira, and of the neighbouring Salvages and Desertas, are not without fish; but as they are not in plenty enough for the rigid observance of Lent, pickled herrings are brought from Gottenburg in English bottoms, and salted cod from New York and other American ports, to supply the deficiency.\n\nMADIAN, in Ancient Geography, a town of Arabia Petraea, near the Arnon; so called from one of the sons of Abraham by Keturah, in ruins in Jerome's time. Jerome mentions another Madian, or Midian, beyond Arabia, in the desert, to the south of the Red sea; and hence Madianaei, and Madianitari, the people; and Madianae Regio, the country.\n\nMADNESS, a most dreadful kind of delirium, without fever.

See HELMINTHOLOGY Index.\n\nMADRID, a town of New Castile in Spain, and capital of the whole kingdom, though it never had the title of a city, is situated in W. Long. 3° 5' N. Lat. 40° 26'. It stands in the centre of a large plain, surrounded with mountains, and in the very heart of Spain, on the banks of the little river Manzanares, which is always very low and shallow, except when it is swelled by the melting of the snow on the mountains. The city is in general well laid out; the streets are very handsome; and the houses are fair and lofty, but built of brick, with lattice-windows, excepting those of the rich,\nMadrid rich who have glaas in their windows; only during the summer heats, they use gauze, or some such thin stuff, instead of it, to let in the fresh air. There are two splendid bridges here over the Manzanares, a great many magnificent churches, convents, hospitals, and palaces. The royal palace, which stands on the west side of the town, on an eminence, is spacious and magnificent, consisting of three courts, and commanding a fine prospect. At the east end of the town is the prado, or pardo; which is a delightful plain, planted with regular rows of poplar trees, and watered with a great many fountains; where the nobility and gentry take the air on horseback, or in their coaches, and the common people on foot, or divert themselves with a variety of sports and exercises. Almost all the streets of Madrid are straight, wide, clean, and well paved. The largest and most frequented are the street of Alcalá, that of Atocha, that of Toledo, and the Calle Grande or great street. Madrid has also several squares, which in general are not very regular. The principal are those of San Joaquín, Sol, La Laguna, San Domingo, La Cebada, and the Plaza Mayor. The latter especially deserves notice for its spaciousness and regularity, and the elegant and lofty houses it contains. It is 1356 feet in circuit. The houses, of which there are 136, are of five stories, ornamented with balconies; the first of which, supported by pillars, forms a piazza round the square, where the inhabitants may walk under cover. In the middle of the square a market is kept.\n\nThe streets and squares of Madrid, except the Plaza Mayor which has been just described, are ornamented with fountains in a very ill taste. Those most to be distinguished in this particular are the fountain of the small irregular square called Plaza de Antonio Martín, and that of the square named Puerta del Sol. The others are not more magnificent though less ridiculous. The water of all these fountains is excellent; and the air of Madrid, though the weather be variable and uncertain, is extremely pure. It was this purity of the air and excellent quality of the water which induced Philip II, and his successors to fix their residence in this city. It is also well supplied with provisions of all kinds at reasonable rates; and the court, with the report and reliance of the quality, and the high colleges and offices that are kept here, occasion a brisk trade and circulation of money.\n\nThe sacred edifices in this city have nothing remarkable in their architecture; those of St Pasequín, St Isabel, and the Carmelites contain highly valuable collections of pictures, which may be seen with admiration even after the paintings of the Escorial and the new palace. The church of St Isidro, which heretofore belonged to the Jesuits, has a portal which has escaped the contagion of the age in which it was built. There is another church much more modern, which on account of its size has a venerable appearance, but which true taste may justly disavow: it is that of St Simeón, or the Vistalón, founded by Ferdinand VI, and the queen Barbara his wife.—The convent of St Francis has already been some years building*; and there are hopes that it will become one of the finest productions of architecture in the capital.—Besides a variety of charitable foundations, there are here three brotherhoods, the revenues of which are appropriated to the succour of the wretched; and an institution similar to the Mont de Piété in Paris, the principal object of which is to advance money to the necessitous.\n\nThe city of Madrid contains 15 gates, 18 parishes, 35 convents of monks, and 31 of nuns; 39 colleges, hospital, or houses of charity; 7399 dwelling-houses, and about 160,000 inhabitants. The Lombard traveller, Father Caimo, tells us, that 50,000 sheep and 10,000 oxen are annually consumed there; to which his editor has added a ludicrous estimate of the onions and leeks devoured there, which he says amount to 970,000,000,000,000,000,000 grams. But this writer (M. Bourgognone) would not at present have any reason to complain of the disagreeable smells of the streets, nor would he find all the perfumes of Arabia necessary to defend himself from them. By the vigilance of the modern police, for which (M. Bourgognone informs us) it is indebted to the Count d'Aranda, it is rendered one of the cleanest cities in Europe.\n\nThere are four academies in Madrid: The first is the Spanish academy, founded on 24th May, in imitation of the French academy, and consisting of 24 members, including the president. Its motto is terraeque lacus, facendo et dae feliciter*; it purifies, fixes, and gives life. Its first object was the compilation of a dictionary of the Spanish language, which was published in six volumes folio, and of which a new edition, with great additions, has been lately put to press. The same academy is also employed on a superb edition of Don Quixote, adorned with elegant engravings, far superior to the last, and collated with all the former editions. The second is the academy of history, which owes its origin to a society of individuals, whose meetings was to preserve and illustrate the historical monuments of the kingdom of Spain. Their labours met the approbation of Philip V, who in 1733 confirmed the statutes by a royal cedula. This academy consists of 24 members, including the president, secretary, and censor. Its device is a river at its source; and its motto: In patriam populamque fluit.* The other two academies are, the academy of the fine arts, painting, sculpture, and architecture; and the academy of medecine. The latter is held in no great esteem.\n\nThe environs of Madrid contain several royal seats; among which are El Buen Retiro, Casa de Campo, Florida, Le Pardo Sancho, and San Ildefonso; but the most magnificent not only in this country but perhaps in the whole world is the Escorial, which takes its name from a small village near which it stands, about 22 miles north-west from Madrid; and of which a description is given under the article Escorial. Another royal palace, greatly admired, particularly for its delicious gardens and surprising water-works, is Aranjuez, which is situated on the Tagus, about 30 miles south of Madrid.\n\n*Madrigal, a short amorous poem, composed of a number of free and unequal verses, neither confined to the regularity of a sonnet, nor to the point of an epigram; but only consisting of some tender and delicate thought, expressed with a beautiful, noble, and elegant simplicity.\n\nMenage derives the word from mandra, which in Latin and Greek, signifies \"a sheep-fold;\" imagining it\nMadura it to have been originally a kind of pastoral or shepherd's song; whence the Italians formed their madrigale, and we madrigal. Others rather choose to derive it from the word madugar, which in the Spanish language signifies \"to rise in the morning;\" the madrigales being formerly sung early in the morning by those who had a mind to serenade their mistresses.\n\nMADURA, a province of Asia, in the peninsula on this side the Ganges; bounded on the east by Tanjore and Marava, on the south-east by the sea, on the west by the Balaghat mountains, which separate it from Malabar, and on the north by Vizapour and Carnate. The inhabitants are Gentoo, and of a thievish disposition. The commodities are rice, elephants' teeth, and cotton cloth; of which last a great deal is made here, and very fine. The Dutch have a pearl fishery, which brings them in a large sum annually.\n\nMAEANDER, in Ancient Geography, a celebrated river of Asia Minor, rising near Celene. It flows through Caria and Ionia into the Aegean sea between Miletus and Priene, after it has been increased by the waters of the Mariyas, Lycus Eudon, Lethaus, &c. It is celebrated among the poets for its windings, which amount to not less than 600, and from which all obliquities have received the name of meanders. It forms in its course, according to the observation of some travellers, the Greek letters Ξξς & ω; and from its windings Daedalus is said to have had the first idea of his famous labyrinth.\n\nMAEATÆ, anciently a people of Britain, near Severus's wall, inhabiting the district now called Lauderdale, in Scotland.\n\nMAECENAS, CAIUS CILNIUS, the great friend and counsellor of Augustus Caesar, was himself a very polite scholar, but is chiefly memorable for having been the patron and protector of men of letters. He was descended from a most ancient and illustrious origin, even from the kings of Hetruria, as Horace often tells us; but his immediate forefathers were only of the equestrian order. He is supposed to have been born at Rome, because his family lived there; but in what year, antiquity does not tell us. It says as little about his education; but we know it must have been of the most liberal kind, and perfectly agreeable to the dignity and splendour of his birth, since he excelled in every thing that related to arms, politics, and letters. How Maecenas spent his younger years is also unknown to us, any farther than by effects; there being no mention made of him by any writer before the death of Julius Caesar, which happened in the year of Rome 759.\n\nThen Octavius Caesar, who was afterwards called Augustus, went to Rome, to take possession of his uncle's inheritance; and then Maecenas became first publicly known, though he appears to have been Augustus's intimate friend, and as it should seem guardian, in his childhood. From that time he accompanied him through all his fortunes, and was his counsellor and adviser upon all occasions; so that Pæo Albinovanus justly called him Caesaris dextram, \"Caesar's right-hand.\"\n\nIn A. R. 710, the year that Cicero was killed and Ovid banished, Maecenas distinguished himself by his courage and military skill at the battle of Modena, where the consul Hirtius and Panpa were slain in fighting against Antony; as he did afterwards at Philippa.\n\nAfter this last battle began the memorable friendship Maecenas between Maecenas and Horace. Horace, as Suetonius relates, was a tribune in the army of Brutus and Cassius, and upon the defeat of those generals made a prisoner of war. Maecenas, finding him an accomplished man, became immediately his friend and protector; and afterwards recommended him to Augustus, who restored to him his estate with no small additions. In the meantime, though Maecenas behaved himself well as a soldier in the field and other battles, yet his principal province was that of a minister and counsellor. He was the adviser, the manager, the negociator, in every thing that related to civil affairs. When the league was made at Brundisium between Antony and Augustus, Maecenas was sent to act on the part of Augustus. This we learn from Horace in his journey to Brundisium:\n\nHoc venturus erat Maecenar optimus, atque\nCoeceius, mihi magnum de rebus uterque\nLegati, auro solii componere amicos. Sat. v. lib. i.\n\nAnd afterwards, when this league was near breaking, through the suspicions of each party, Maecenas was sent to Antony to ratify it anew.\n\nIn the year 717, when Augustus and Agrippa went to Sicily to fight Sextus Pompeius by sea, Maecenas went with them; but soon after returned, to appease some commotions which were rising at Rome: for though he usually attended Augustus in all his military expeditions, yet whenever there was any thing to be done at Rome either with the senate or people, he was always despatched thither for that purpose.\n\nUpon the total defeat of Antony at Actium, Maecenas returned to Rome, to take the government into his hands, till Augustus could settle some necessary affairs in Greece and Asia. Agrippa soon followed Maecenas; and when Augustus arrived, he placed these two great men and faithful adherents, the one over his civil, the other over his military concerns. While Augustus was extinguishing the remains of the civil war in Asia and Egypt, young Lepidus, the son of the triumvir, was forming a scheme to assassinate him at his return to Rome. This conspiracy was discovered at once, by the extraordinary vigilance of Maecenas; who, as Velleius Paterculus says, \"observing the rash councils of the headstrong youth with the same tranquillity and calmness as if nothing at all had been doing, instantly put him to death, without the least noise and tumult; and by that means extinguished another civil war in its very beginning.\"\n\nThe civil wars being now at an end, Augustus returned to Rome; and from this time Maecenas indulged himself at vacant hours in literary amusements, and the conversation of men of letters. In the year 734 Virgil died, and left Augustus and Maecenas heirs to what he had. Maecenas was excessively fond of this poet, who, of all the wits of the Augustan age, stood highest in his esteem; and if the Georgics and the Aeneid be owing to the good taste and encouragement of this patron, as there is some reason to think, poverties cannot commendate him with too much gratitude. Horace may be ranked next to Virgil in Maecenas's good graces: we have already mentioned how and at what time their friendship commenced. Propertius also acknowledges Maecenas for his favourite and protector, lib. ii., eleg. 7.\nNor must Varius be forgot, though we have nothing of his remaining; since we find him highly praised by both Virgil and Horace. He was a writer of tragedies; and Quintilian thinks he may be compared with any of the ancients. In a word, Maecenas's house was a place of refuge and welcome to all the learned of his time; not only to Virgil, Horace, Propertius, and Varius, but to Fundarius, whom Horace extols as an admirable writer of comedies: to Pufius Ariftius, a noble grammarian, and Horace's intimate friend: to Plotius Tucea, who assisted Varius in correcting the Æneid after the death of Virgil; to Valgius, a poet and very learned man, who, as Pliny tells us, dedicated a book to Augustus, De usu Herbarum; to Asinius Pollio, an excellent tragic writer; and to several others, whom it would be tedious to mention. All these dedicated their works, or some part of them at least, to Maecenas, and celebrated his praises in them over and over: and we may observe farther, what Plutarch tells us, that even Augustus himself inscribed his Commentaries to him and to Agrippa.\n\nMaecenas continued in Augustus's favour to the end of his life, but not uninterruptedly. Augustus had an intrigue with Maecenas's wife: and though the minister bore this liberty of his master very patiently, yet there was a coldness on the part of Augustus, which, however, soon went off. Maecenas died in the year 745; but at what age we cannot precisely determine, though we know he must have been old. He must have been older than Augustus, because he was a kind of tutor to him in his youth: and then find him often called an old man by Pedo Albinoanus, a contemporary poet, whose elegy upon his dead patron is still extant. He made Augustus his heir; and recommended his friend Horace to him in those memorable last words, \"Horatii Flacci, ut mei, menor effo,\" &c. Horace, however, did not probably survive him long, as there is no elegy of his upon Maecenas extant, nor any account of one having ever been written, which there certainly would have been had Horace survived him any time. Nay, Father Sandon, the French editor of Horace, will have it, that the poet died before his patron; and that these last words were found only in Maecenas's will, which had not been altered.\n\nMaecenas is said never to have enjoyed a good state of health in any part of his life: and many singularities are related of his bodily constitution. Thus Pliny tells us, that he was always in a fever; and that, for three years before his death, he had not a moment's sleep. Though he was certainly an extraordinary man, and possessed many admirable virtues and qualities, yet it is agreed on all hands, that he was very luxurious and effeminate. \"Maecenas (says Velleius Paterculus) was of the equestrian order, but sprung from a most illustrious origin. He was a man, who, when business required, was able to undergo any fatigue and watching; who consulted properly upon all occasions, and knew as well how to execute what he had consulted; yet a man who in seasons of leisure was luxurious, soft, and effeminate, almost beyond a woman. He was no less dear to Caesar than Agrippa, but distinguished by him with fewer honours; for he always continued of the equestrian rank, in which he was born: not that he could not have been advanced upon the least intimation, but he never solicited it.\"\n\nBut let moralists and politicians determine of Maecenas as they please, the men of letters are under high obligations to celebrate his praises and revere his memory: for he countenanced, protected, and supported, as far as they wanted his support, all the wits and learned men of his time; and that, too, out of a pure and disinterested love of letters, when he had no little views of policy to serve by their means: whence it is no wonder, that all the protectors and patrons of learning, ever since, have usually been called Maecenas's.\n\nMAELSTROM, a very dangerous whirlpool on the coast of Norway, in the 68th degree of latitude, in the province of Nordland, and the district of Lofoten, and near the island of Møkoe, from whence it also takes the name of Møkoe-ström. Its violence and roarings exceed that of a cataract, being heard to a great distance, and without any intermission, except a quarter every fifth hour, that is, at the turn of high and low water, when its impetuosity seems at a stand, which short interval is the only time the fishermen can venture in; but this motion soon returns, and, however calm the sea may be, gradually increases with such a draught and vortex, as absorbs whatever comes within their sphere of action, and keep it under water for some hours, when the fragments, flung by the rocks, appear again. This circumstance, among others, makes strongly against Kircher and others, who imagine that there is here an abyss penetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote parts, which Kircher is so particular as to affirm, for he names the gulf of Bothnia. But after the most exact researches which the circumstances will admit, this is but a conjecture without foundation; for this and three other vortices among the Ferroe islands, but smaller, have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at the flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confine the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be; and the natural result of this is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction whereof is sufficiently known by lesser experiments. But what has been thus absorbed, remains no longer at the bottom than the ebb lasts; for the suction then ceases, and the flood removes all attraction, and permits whatever had been sunk to make its appearance again. Of the situation of this amazing Møkoe-ström we have the following account from Mr Jonas Ramus: \"The mountain of Helleggen, in Lofoten, lies a league from the island Ver, and betwixt these two runs that large and dreadful stream called Møkoe-ström, from the island Møkoe, which in the middle of it, together with several circumjacent isles, as Ambaren, half a quarter of a league northward, Ithelen, Hoeholm, Kieldholm, Suarven, and Buckholm. Møkoe lies about half a quarter of a mile south of the island of Ver, and betwixt them these small islands, Otterholm, Flimen, Sandefen, Stockholm. Betwixt Lofoten and Møkoe, the depth of the water is between 36 and 40 fathoms; but on the other side, towards Ver, the depth decreases, so as not to afford a convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather: when it is flood, the stream runs up the country between Lofoten and Møkoe with a boisterous rapidity: but the roar of its impetuous ebb...\nMæanic to the sea is scarcely equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off, and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But these intervals of tranquillity are only at the turn of the ebb and flood, and calm weather: and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it; boats, ships, and yachts having been carried away, by not guarding against it before they were within its reach. It likewise happens frequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowering by its violence; and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A bear once attempting to swim from Lofoten to Molkoe, with a design of preying upon the sheep at pasture in the island, afforded the like spectacle to the people; the stream caught him, and bore him down, whilst he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore. Large flocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the current, rise again, broken and torn to such a degree as if brittle grew on them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea; it being constantly high and low water every six hours. In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sextagesima Sunday, it raged with such noise and impetuosity, that on the island of Molkoe, the very stones of the houses fell to the ground.\n\nMæmacteria, sacrifices offered to Jupiter at Athens in the winter month Mæmacterion. The god named Mæmactes was entreated to send mild and temperate weather, as he presided over the seasons, and was the god of the air.\n\nMæmacterion, was the fourth month of the Athenian year, containing twenty-nine days, and answering to the latter part of our September, and the beginning of October. It received its name from the festival Mæmacteria, which was observed about this time. This month was called by the Boeotians Alalcomenius.\n\nMæna. See Sparus, Ichthyology Index.\n\nMænalus, in Ancient Geography, a mountain of Arcadia sacred to the god Pan, and greatly frequented by shepherds. It received its name from Mænalus, a son of Lycaon. It was covered with pine trees, whose echo and shade have been greatly celebrated by all the ancient poets.\n\nMæonia, or Moeonia, a country of Asia Minor, and forming part of Lydia; namely the neighbourhood of Mount Tmolus, and the country watered by the Paëolus. The reef on the sea coast was called Lydia. See Lydia.\n\nMæonidae, a name given to the muses, because Homer, their greatest and worthiest favourite, was supposed to be a native of Mæonia.\n\nMæonides, a surname of Homer, because, according to the opinion of some writers, he was born in Mæonia, or because his father's name was Mæon.\n\nMæotis Palus or Lagus, Maeoticus Palus, or Maeoticus Lacus, in Ancient Geography, a large lake or part of the sea between Europe and Asia, at the north of the Euxine, to which it communicates by the Cimmerian Bosphorus. It was worshipped as a deity by the Maeotae. It extends about 390 miles from south-west to north-east, and is about 600 miles in circumference. Still called Palus Maeoticus, reaching from Crim Tartary to the mouth of the Don.\n\nMæstlin, Michael, in Latin Meßlinus, a celebrated astronomer of Germany, was born in the duchy of Wittenberg; but spent his youth in Italy, where he made a speech in favour of Copernicus's system, which brought Galileo over from Aristotle and Ptolemy, to whom he had been hitherto entirely devoted. He afterwards returned to Germany, and became professor of mathematics at Tubingen; where, among his other scholars, he taught the great Kepler, who has praised several of his ingenious inventions, in his Astronomia Optica. Though Tycho Brahe did not affect to Mæstlin's opinion, yet he allowed him to be an extraordinary person, deeply skilled in the science of astronomy. Mæstlin published many mathematical and astronomical works, and died in 1590.\n\nMaaestricht, an ancient, large, and strong town of the Netherlands, ceded to the Dutch by the treaty of Munster. The townhouse and the other public buildings are handsome, and the place is about four miles in circumference, and strongly fortified. It is governed jointly by the Dutch and the bishop of Liege; however, it has a Dutch garrison. The inhabitants are noted for making excellent firearms, and some say that in the arsenal there are arms sufficient for a whole army. Both Papists and Protestants are allowed the free exercise of their religion, and the magistrates are composed of both. It is seated on the river Maas, which separates it from Wyck, and with which it communicates by a handsome bridge. Maaestricht revolted from the Spaniards in 1570, but was reduced in 1579. Louis XIV. became master of it in 1673; but it was restored to the states by the treaty of Nimeguen in 1678. It was again taken by the French in 1794. E. Long, 5° 50' N.

He wrote epigrams, and a humorous supplement to Virgil, which he called The thirteenth book of the Æneid: this was as humorously translated into English a few years since by Mr Ellis. Maaffeus wrote also some prose works. He was chancellor of Rome towards the end of the pontificate of Martin V.; and died in 1458.\n\nMaaffe, Scipio, a celebrated Italian poet, born of an illustrious and ancient family at Verona, in 1675. After having finished his studies, he took arms, and distinguished himself by his valour at the battle of Danawert; but he more particularly distinguished himself by his love of learning, which made him undertake several voyages into France, England, and Germany. He conversed with the learned in all those countries, and obtained their friendship and esteem. He was a member of the academy of the Arcadia at Rome, an honorary foreign member of that of Inscriptions at Paris; and died in 1755. He wrote many works in verse and prose, which are esteemed; the most known of which are, 1. The tragedy of Medea, of which there\nthere are two French translations in prose. 2. Ceremony, a comedy. 3. A translation, into Italian verse, of the first book of Homer's Iliad. 4. Many other pieces of poetry, in a collection entitled Rhyme and Prose, quarto. His principal works in prose are, 1. Verona illustrata. 2. Istoria diplomatica. 3. Scienza cavalleresca; an excellent work, in which he attacks duelling. 4. An edition of Theatro Italiano. 5. An edition of Caffiodorus on the Epistles, Acts of the Apostles, and Apocalypse. 6. Galliae Antiquitates quaestiones selectae atque in plures epistolae distribute; and several other works.\n\nMAGADA, in Mythology, a title under which Venus was known and worshipped in Lower Saxony; where this goddess had a famous temple, which was treated with respect even by the Huns and Vandals when they ravaged the country. It is said to have been destroyed by Charlemagne.\n\nMAGADOXO, the capital town of a kingdom of the same name, in Africa, and on the coast of Ajan. It is seated near the mouth of a river of the same name, defended by a citadel, and has a good harbour. The inhabitants are Mahometans. E. Long. 45° 15' N. Lat. 3° O.\n\nMAGAS, MAGADIS, (from μαγάς, \"to sing or play in unison or octave.\") the name of a musical instrument in use among the ancients.\n\nThere were two kinds of magades, the one a string instrument, formed of 20 chords arranged in pairs, and tuned to unison or octave, so that they yielded ten sounds; the invention whereof is ascribed by some to Sappho; by others, to the Lydians; and by some, to Timotheus of Miletus. The other was a kind of flute, which at the same time yielded very high and very low notes. The former kind was at least much improved by Timotheus of Miletus, who is said to have been impeached of a crime, because by increasing the number of chords he spoiled and discredited the ancient music.\n\nMAGAZINE, a place in which stores are kept, of arms, ammunition, provisions, &c. Every fortified town ought to be furnished with a large magazine, which should contain stores of all kinds, sufficient to enable the garrison and inhabitants to hold out a long siege; and in which smiths, carpenters, wheelwrights, &c. may be employed in making everything belonging to the artillery; as carriages, wagons, &c.\n\nPowder Magazine, is that place where the powder is kept in very large quantities. Authors differ greatly both with regard to their situation and construction; but all agree that they ought to be arched and bomb-proof. In fortifications, they are frequently placed in the rampart; but of late they have been built in different parts of the town. The first powder magazines were made with Gothic arches: but M. Vauban finding them too weak, constructed them in a semicircular form; whose dimensions are 60 feet long within, and 25 broad; the foundations are eight or nine feet thick, and eight feet high from the foundation to the spring of the arch; the floor is two feet from the ground, which keeps it from dampness.\n\nOne of our engineers of great experience some time since had observed, that after the centres of semicircular arches are struck, they settle at the crown and rise up at the hanches, even with a straight horizontal ex-magazine, trados, and fill much more so in powder magazines, whose outside at top is formed like the roof of a house, by two inclined planes joining in an angle over the top of the arch, to give a proper descent to the rain; which effects are exactly what might be expected agreeable to the true theory of arches. Now, as this shrinking of the arches must be attended with very ill consequences, by breaking the texture of the cement after it has been in some degree dried, and also by opening the joints of the vousoirs at one end, so a remedy is provided for this inconvenience with regard to bridges, by the arch of equilibration in Mr Hutton's book on bridges; but as the ill effect is much greater in powder magazines, the same ingenious gentleman proposed to find an arch of equilibration for them also, and to construct it when the span is 20 feet, the pitch or height 10 (which are the same dimensions as the semicircle), the inclined exterior walls at top forming an angle of 113 degrees, and the height of their angular point above the top of the arch equal to seven feet. This very curious question was answered in 1775 by the reverend Mr Wildbore, to be found in Mr Hutton's Miscellanea Mathematica.\n\nArtillery Magazine. In a siege, the magazine is made about 25 or 30 yards behind the battery, towards the parallels, and at least three feet under ground, to hold the powder, loaded shells, portfires, &c. Its sides and roof must be well secured with boards to prevent the earth from falling in: a door is made to it, and a double trench or palisade is sunk from the magazine to the battery, one to go in and the other to come out at, to prevent confusion. Sometimes traverses are made in the palisades to prevent ricochet shot from plunging into them.\n\nMagazine, on shipboard, a close room or storehouse, built in the fore or after-part of the hold, to contain the gunpowder used in battle. This apartment is strongly secured against fire, and no person is allowed to enter it with a lamp or candle: it is therefore lighted, as occasion requires, by means of the candles or lamps in the light-room contiguous to it.\n\nMagazine Air-Gun. See Air-Gun.\n\nMagazines, Literary; a well-known species of periodical publications, of which the first that appeared was The Gentleman's Magazine, set on foot by the projector Mr Edward Cave in the year 1731: (see the article CAVE). This, as Dr Kippis observes*, \"may be considered as *Big-Britain* something of an epocha in the literary history of this country. The periodical performances before that time were almost wholly confined to political transactions, and to foreign and domestic occurrences; but the monthly magazines have opened a way for every kind of inquiry and information. The intelligence and discussion contained in them are very extensive and various; and they have been the means of diffusing a general habit of reading through the nation, which in a certain degree hath enlarged the public understanding. Many young authors, who have afterwards risen to considerable eminence in the literary world, have here made their first attempts in composition. Here too are preferred a multitude of curious and useful hints, observations, and facts, which otherwise might have never appeared; or if they had appeared in a more evanescent form, would have incurred the danger of being lost. If\nMagdalen, it were not an invidious task, the history of them would be no incurious or unentertaining subject. The magazines that unite utility with entertainment, are undoubtedly preferable to those (if there have been any such) which have only a view to idle and frivolous amusement. It may be observed, that two of them, The Gentleman's and The London, which last was begun the year after the former, have amidst their numerous rivals preserved their reputation to the present day. They have both of them, in general, joined instruction with pleasure; and this likewise hath been the case with some others of a latter origin.\"—The original London Magazine, it is believed, has been discontinued for some years past.—The next oldest publication of this kind is that entitled The Scots Magazine; which was commenced at Edinburgh a few years posterior to the appearance of the Gentleman's at London; which, like it, has survived many rivals; and which still subsists, deservedly esteemed for the chaffiness of its plan and the accuracy of its information.\n\nMAGDALEN, Mary. See Mary.\n\nReligious of St Magdalen, a denomination given to divers communities of nuns, consisting generally of penitent courtezans; sometimes also called Magdalenettes. Such are those at Metz, established in 1452; those at Paris, in 1492; those at Naples, first established in 1324, and endowed by Queen Sancha, to serve as a retreat for public courtezans, who should betake themselves to repentance; and those of Rouen and Bourdeaux, which had their original among those of Paris in 1618. In each of these monasteries there are three kinds of persons and congregations; the first consist of those who are admitted to make vows, and these bear the name of St Magdalen; the congregation of St Martha is the second, and is composed of those whom it is not judged proper to admit to vows; finally, the congregation of St Lazarus is composed of such as are detained there by force.\n\nThe religious of St Magdalen at Rome were established by Pope Leo X. Clement VIII. settled a revenue on them; and farther appointed, that the effects of all public prostitutes, dying intestate, should fall to them; and that the testaments of the rest should be invalid unless they bequeathed a portion of their effects, which was to be at least a fifth part, to them.\n\nMagdalen Hospital. See London, No 115.\n\nMAGDALENA, one of the Marquesas islands, about five leagues in circuit, and supposed to be in S. Lat. 10° 25'. W. Long. 138° 50'. It was only seen at nine leagues distance by those who discovered it.\n\nMAGDALENE'S CAVE, a cave of Germany, and in Carinthia, 10 miles east of Gortz. It appears like a chasm in a rock, and at the entrance torches are lighted to conduct travellers. It is divided into several apartments, or halls, with a vast number of pillars formed by nature, which give it a beautiful appearance, they being as white as snow, and almost transparent. The bottom is of the same substance, insomuch that a person may fancy himself to be walking among the ruins of an enchanted castle, surrounded with magnificent pillars, some entire and others broken.\n\nMAGDEBURG, a duchy of Germany, in the circle of Lower Saxony; bounded on the north by the duchy of Mecklenburgh, on the south and south-west by the principality of Anhalt and Halberstadt, on the east by Upper Saxony with part of Brandenburg, and on the west by the duchy of Wolfenbuttel. The Saale circle, and that of Luxkenwalde, are separated from the rest, and surrounded on all sides by a part of Upper Saxony. This country is for the most part level; but sandy, marshy, or overgrown with woods. There are salt springs in it so rich, that they are sufficient to supply all Germany with that commodity. The Holz circle is the most fruitful part of it. In the Saale circle, where wood is scarce, there is pit-coal: and at Rothenburg is a copper-mine worked. The duchy is well watered, for the Elbe passes through it; and the Saale, Havel, Aller, Ohre, and Elster, either rise in, or wash some part of it in their course. The whole duchy, exclusive of that part of the county of Mansfeldt which is connected with it, is said to contain 29 cities, six towns, about 430 villages, and 330,000 inhabitants. The states of the country consist of the clergy, the nobility, and deputies of the cities. Before it became subject to the electoral house of Brandenburg, frequent diets were held in it; but at present no diets are held, nor have the states the direction of the finances as formerly. Before the Reformation, it was an archbishopric, subject in spirituals to the pope alone, and its prelate was primate of all Germany; but embracing the Reformation, it chose itself administrators, till the treaty of Munster in 1648, when it was given, together with the bishopric of Halberstadt, to the elector of Brandenburg, as an equivalent for the Hither Pomerania, granted by that treaty to the king of Sweden. Lutheranism is the predominant religion here; but Calvinists, Jews, and Roman Catholics, are tolerated. Of the last there are five convents, who never embraced the Reformation. All the Lutheran parishes, amounting to 314, are subject to 16 inspectors, under one general superintendent; only the clergy of the old town of Magdeburg are under the direction of their senior. The Jews have a synagogue at Halle. The manufactures of the duchy are cloth, stuffs, stockings, linen, oilskins, leather, and parchment; of which, and grain of all sorts, large quantities are exported. The arms of it are, Party per pale, ruby, and pearl. The king of Prussia, as duke of Magdeburg, sits and votes between the elector of Bavaria, as duke of Bavaria, and the elector palatine, as palgrave of Lautern. Of the states of the circle of Lower Saxony he is the first. His maticular settlement for the duchy is 43 horse and 196 foot, or 1300 florins monthly; and to the chamber of Wetzlar 343 florins and 40 kruitzers. For the civil government of the duchy there is a council of regency, with a war and demesne chamber; and for the ecclesiastical a consistory and general superintendent. The revenues of the duchy, arising from the salt-works, demesne, and taxes, some of which are very heavy and oppressive, are said to amount to 800,000 rixdollars annually. With respect to salt, every housekeeper in the Prussian dominion is obliged to buy a certain quantity for himself and wife; and also for every child and servant, horse, cow, calf, and sheep, that he possesses. The principal places are Magdeburg, Halle, and Glauche.\n\nMAGDEBURG, a city of Germany, in a duchy of the same name, of which it is not only the capital, but that of\nof all Lower Saxony, and formerly even of all Germany. It stands on the Elbe, in E. Long. 12° 9' N. Lat. 52° 16'. It is a city of great trade, strongly fortified, and very ancient. Its name signifies the maiden city; which, some imagine, took its rise from the temple of Venus, which is said to have stood here anciently, and to have been destroyed by Charlemagne. The founder of the city is supposed to have been Otho I. or his empress Editha, daughter to Edmund the Saxon king of England. The same emperor founded a Benedictine convent here, which he afterwards converted into an archbishopric, of which the archbishop was a count-palatine, and had very great privileges, particularly that of wearing the archiepiscopal pallium, and having the crofs borne before him, besides many others. The first tournament in Germany is said to have been appointed near this city, by the emperor Henry the Fowler; but these pastimes were afterwards abolished, because they occasioned such envy and animosity among the nobility, that several of them killed one another upon the spot. The situation of the city is very convenient and pleasant, upon the banks of the Elbe, amidst spacious fruitful plains, and on the road betwixt High and Low Germany. It has been a great sufferer by fires and sieges; but by none so much as that in 1631 when the emperor's general, Count Tilly, took it by storm, plundered and set it on fire, by which it was entirely reduced to ashes, except the cathedral, the convent of our Lady, and a few cottages belonging to fishermen; of 40,000 burghers, not above 400 escaping. The soldiers spared neither age nor sex; but ripped up women with child, murdered sucking infants in sight of their parents, and ravished young women in the streets; to prevent which violation, many of them flung themselves into the Elbe, and others into the fire. The city is now populous, large, and well built, particularly the broad street and cathedral square. The principal buildings are the king's palace, the governor's house, the armory, guildhall, and cathedral. The last is a superb structure in the antique taste, dedicated to St Maurice, which has a fine organ, the master pipe of which is so big, that a man can scarce clap it with both arms; it also contains the tombs of the emperor Otho and the empress Editha; a fine marble statue of St Maurice, a porphyry font, an altar in the choir of one stone of divers colours, curiously wrought, and many other curiosities. They show here a bedstead and table which belonged to Martin Luther, when he was an Augustinian friar in a cloister of this city before the Reformation. Among the relics, they pretended to have the basin in which Pilate washed his hands after his condemnation of our Saviour; the lantern which Judas made use of when he apprehended him; and the ladder on which the cock crowed after St Peter denied him. The chapter consists of a provost, fifteen major and seven minor canons; besides which, there are four other Lutheran collegiate foundations, and a Lutheran convent dedicated to our Lady, in which is a school or seminary. Here is also a gymnasium, with an academy, in which young gentlemen are instructed in the art of war. The canons of the chapter, which, except the change of religion, is upon the same footing as before the Reformation, must make proof of their nobility. The prebends and dignities are all in the gift of the elector; and the revenue of the provost is Magdolum, computed at 12,000 crowns a-year. Here is a great trade, and a variety of manufactures. The chief are those of woollen cloths and stuffs, silks, cottons, linen, stockings, hats, gloves, tobacco and snuff. The city was formerly one of the Hanse and Imperial towns. Editha, consort to Otho I., on whom it was conferred as a dowry, among many other privileges and advantages, procured it the grant of a yearly fair. The burgomaster of this city was anciently an office of great power; having the civil and criminal jurisdiction, the office of hereditary cupbearer being annexed to it; and was long held as a fief of the archbishopric, but afterwards became an imperial fief, which was again conferred on the archbishopric by the elector of Saxony, upon certain conditions.\n\nMAGDOLUM, or MAGDALUM, in Ancient Geography, a town of the Lower Egypt, twelve miles to the south of Pelusium (Herodotus, Antonine), which doubles the Migdol or Magdol of Jeremiah.—Another MAGDALUM, or MIGDOL, denoting literally \"a tower or place of strength,\" near the Red Sea, (Moses); far to the south of the former.\n\nMAGELLAN, FERDINAND DE, an eminent navigator, was by birth a Portuguese, of a good family. He served in the East Indies with reputation for five years under Albuquerque, and in 1510 he greatly distinguished himself at the battle of Malacca. Deeming his services poorly repaid by his own court, he entered into the employment of Charles V., king of Spain. He has been charged with peculation by some of his countrymen, who have assigned this as the reason why he quitted Portugal. In conjunction with Ruy Folero he formed the bold design of discovering a new passage by the west to the Molucca islands, which he offered to prove fell within the division of the globe assigned by the pope to the crown of Castile. It is said that he first proposed this enterprise to Emanuel king of Portugal, who rejected it, as opening a way for other nations to have access to the East Indies, the trade of which was now monopolized by the Portuguese. The proposition was agreed to by the king of Spain, and on the 20th of September 1519 Magellan sailed from San Lucar with five ships and 236 men under his command. His officers soon murmured at this appointment, considering it as a disgrace to be commanded by a renegade Portuguese; and when the fleet was lying at a port in South America which they named San Julian, a conspiracy was formed against him by three of the captains, which he discovered and quelled. He caused the captain of one of the ships to be assassinated, he boarded a second, and secured the mutineers, and the third submitted.\n\nThe coast on which they lay was that of Patagonia; and this first voyage contains accounts of the extraordinary stature of the natives. About the end of October they reached a cape, to which they gave the name of Dee las Virgenes, forming the entrance of the straits which bear the name of Magellan. He exerted all his authority to induce his men to venture on this unknown passage, with the view of crossing a vast ocean beyond it, at the hazard of running short of provisions, of which a supply for three months was all he had remaining. One of his ships abandoned him, and made the best of her way to Europe. The rest proceeded, and on the\nMagellan discovered the South Sea, which made Magellan shed tears of joy. They continued their voyage over this ocean, now visited for the first time by Europeans, and were not long in suffering those evils from famine which they had apprehended. The men were reduced to the necessity of eating the hides with which the rigging was covered. The weather proved so uniformly calm and temperate, that they gave to the ocean the name of Pacific. They came in sight of the Ladrones on the 6th of March, so called from the thievish disposition of the inhabitants; and from thence they sailed to the Philippines. At Zebu Magellan obtained with little difficulty the conversion of the king; and on condition of his becoming a vassal of Spain, the Portuguese assisted him in reducing some neighbouring chieftains, and the crops were erected over some burnt villages.\n\nWith about 50 men Magellan landed upon Matan, whose chief refused to submit to Zebu, and an engagement between them lasted for the greater part of the day. His troops having spent all their ammunition, found it necessary to retreat, during which Magellan was wounded in the leg by an arrow, beaten down, and at last slain with a lance. This happened in 1521. By this act of imprudence he lost the honour of being the first circumnavigator of the globe, which fell to the lot of Cano, who brought his ship home by the East Indies. Yet Magellan has secured an immortal name among maritime discoverers, by the commencement of this great enterprise, in which he displayed extraordinary skill and resolution, but disregarded justice and humanity, then almost universal among adventurers of this class.\n\nStraits of Magellan, a narrow passage between the island of Terra del Fuego and the southern extremity of the continent of America. This passage was first discovered by Ferdinand Magellan, who sailed through it into the South Sea, and from thence to the East Indies. Other navigators have passed the same way; but as these straits are exceedingly difficult, and subject to storms, it has been common to fail by Cape Horn, rather than through the straits of Magellan. See Straits Le Maire, and Terra del Fuego.\n\nMagellanic clouds, whitish appearances like clouds, seen in the heavens towards the south pole, and having the same apparent motion as the stars. They are three in number, two of them near each other. The largest lies far from the south pole; but the other two are not many degrees more remote from it than the nearest conspicuous star, that is, about 11 degrees. Mr Boyle conjectures, that if these clouds were seen through a good telescope, they would appear to be multitudes of small stars, like the milky-way.\n\nMaggi, Jerome, in Latin Magius, one of the most learned men of the 16th century, was born at Anghiari in Tuscany. He applied himself to all the sciences, and even to the art of war; and distinguished himself so much in this last study, that the Venetians sent him into the island of Cyprus in quality of judge of the admiralty. When the Turks besieged Famagusta, he performed all the services that could be expected from the most excellent engineer; he invented mines and machines for throwing fire, by means of which he destroyed all the works of the besiegers, and in an instant overthrew what had cost the Turks infinite labour. But they had their revenge; for, taking the city in 1571, they plundered his library, carried him loaded with chains to Constantinople, and treated him in the most inhuman and barbarous manner. He nevertheless comforted himself from the example of Ælop, Menippus, Epictetus, and other learned men; and, after passing the whole day in the meanest drudgery, he spent the night in writing. He composed, by the help of his memory alone, treatises filled with quotations, which he dedicated to the Imperial and French ambassadors. These ministers, moved by compassion for this learned man, resolved to purchase him; but while they were treating for his ransom, Maggi found means to make his escape, and to get to the Imperial ambassador's house; when the grand vizir being enraged at his flight, and remembering the great mischief he had done the Turks during the siege of Famagusta, sent to have him seized, and caused him to be strangled in prison in 1572. His principal works are, 1. A Treatise on the Bells of the Ancients. 2. On the Destruction of the World by Fire. 3. Commentaries on Æmilius Probus's Lives of Illustrious Men. 4. Commentaries on the Institutes. These works are written in elegant Latin. He also wrote a treatise on fortification in Italian; and a book on the situation of ancient Tuscany.\n\nHe ought not to be confounded with his brother Bartholomew Maggi, a physician at Bologna, who wrote a treatise of gunshot wounds; nor with Vincent Maggi, a native of Brescia, and a celebrated professor of humanity at Ferrara in Padua, who was the author of several works.\n\nMaggot, the common name of the fly-worm bred in flesh, from the egg of the great blue flesh fly. Notwithstanding the distaste for this animal, its figure and structure of parts are greatly worth attending to; and may serve as a general history of the clas of worms produced from the eggs of flies.\n\nThis animal is white and fleshy; its body is composed of a number of rings, like the bodies of caterpillars and other similar insects; and is capable, at the pleasure of the animal, of assuming different figures; being at times more or less extended in length, and consequently more or less thick.\n\nNotwithstanding that this animal has no legs, it is able to move itself very swiftly; and in its first attempt to move its body, is extended to its greatest length, and assumes something of the figure of a pointed cone. The pointed part of the cone is the head of the animal, and is not separated from the next ring by any deeper furrow than the rest of the rings are from one another. In some states of the animal, one may see two short horns thrust out from the head; but more generally two scaly hooks are observable; these are, however, sometimes hid, and have each of them a case or sheath; into which the animal can retract them at pleasure. These hooks are bent into an arch, the concavity of which is towards the plane on which the creature is placed; and they are thickest at their insertion in the head, and hence diminish gradually, till they terminate in a fine sharp point.\n\nThese two hooks are placed in a parallel direction, and can never come together, and therefore cannot serve in the place of teeth for grinding the food; but merely to pull and sever it in pieces, that it may be of\nMaggot, a proper size for the mouth of the creature. Besides these hooks the maggot has a kind of dart, which is about a third part of their length, and is placed at an equal distance between them. This also is brown and scaly like them; it is quite straight, and terminates in a fine point. The hooks have as it were two scaly thorns at their points; and this dart seems intended, by reiterated strokes to divide, and break the pieces of flesh these have separated from the rest into smaller parts. Immediately below the apertures for the egress of the hooks, is placed the mouth of the animal; the creature does not show this little opening unless provoked; but if the prelude is properly managed it will sufficiently open it, and there may be discovered within it a small protuberance, which may very naturally be supposed either the tongue or the sucker of the animal. The hooks in these creatures not only supply the place of teeth, but also of legs; since it is by fastening these hooks into the substance it is placed on, and then drawing up its body to it, that it pulls itself along.\n\nThe back of this creature lowers itself by degrees as it approaches the extremity of the belly; and near the place where the back begins to lower itself, are placed the creature's two principal organs of respiration. One may perceive there are two small roundish brown spots; they are very easily distinguishable by the naked eye, because the rest of the body of the creature is white; but if we take in the affluence of galls, each of these spots appears to be a brown circular eminence raised a little above the rest of the body. On each of these spots one may also discover three oblong oval cavities, something of the shape of button holes; these are situated in a parallel direction to one another, and their length nearly in a perpendicular direction to that of the body of the animal. These apertures are so many stigmata or air-holes; openings defined to admit the air necessary to the life of the animal. It has six of these stigmata, three in each side of its body.\n\nThe great transparency of the body of this animal gives us an opportunity also to distinguish that it has on each side a large white vessel running the whole length of the body. It is easy to follow the course of these vessels through their whole length, but they are most distinct of all towards its hinder part; and they are always seen to terminate each in the brown spot above mentioned; this leaves us no room to doubt that they are the two principal tracheae.\n\nThe ramifications of the two great tracheae are very beautifully seen in this creature, especially on its belly; and it is remarkable, that no vessel analogous to the great artery in the caterpillar clasps can be discovered in these; though, if there were any such, their great transparency must needs make them very easily distinguishable; nor could its dilatations and contractions, if so considerable as in that clasps of animals, be less so.\n\nSee Caterpillar, Entomology Index.\n\nMalpighi imagined, that this artery in the caterpillar clasps was a series of hearts; in its place, however, there may be seen in these animals a true heart. It is easy to observe in these creatures, about the fourth ring of their body, a small fleshy part, which has alternate contractions and dilatations; and is not only discoverable in the body by means of its transparency, but on making a proper section of them in the second, third, and fourth, will be thrown out of the body of the creature, and continue its beats for some time afterwards.\n\nMagi, Magic.\n\nMAGI, or Magicians, an ancient religious sect in Persia, and other eastern countries, who maintained that there were two principles, one the cause of all good, the other the cause of all evil: and, abominating the adoration of images, they worshipped God only by fire; which they looked upon as the brightest and most glorious symbol of Ormaldes, or the good god; as darkness is the truest symbol of Arimanus, or the evil god. This religion was reformed by Zoroaster, who maintained that there was one supreme independent Being; and under him two principles or angels, one the angel of goodness and light, and the other of evil and darkness; that there is a perpetual struggle between them, which shall last to the end of the world; that then the angel of darkness and his disciples shall go into a world of their own, where they shall be punished in everlasting darkness; and the angel of light and his disciples shall also go into a world of their own, where they shall be rewarded in everlasting light.\n\nThe priests of the magi were the most skilful mathematicians and philosophers of the ages in which they lived, inasmuch that a learned man and a magician became equivalent terms. The vulgar looked on their knowledge as supernatural; and hence those who practised wicked and mischievous arts, taking upon themselves the name of magicians, drew on it that ill figuration which the word magician now bears among us.\n\nThis sect still subsists in Persia under the denomination of saurs, where they watch the sacred fire with the greatest care, and never suffer it to be extinguished.\n\nMagic, (Magia, Μαγια), in its ancient sense, the science or discipline and doctrine of the magi, or wise men of Persia. See Magi.\n\nThe origin of magic and the magi is ascribed to Zoroaster. Salmagius derives the very name from Zoroaster, who, he says, was named Mag, whence Magus. Others, instead of making him the author of the Persian philosophy, make him only the reformer and improver thereof; alleging, that many of the Persian rites in use among the magi were borrowed from the Zabii among the Chaldeans, who agreed in many things with the magi of the Persians; whence some make the name magus common both to the Chaldeans and Persians. Thus Plutarch mentions, that Zoroaster instituted magi among the Chaldeans, in imitation whereof the Persians had theirs too.\n\nMagic, in a more modern sense, is a science which teaches to perform wonderful and surprising effects.\n\nThe word magic originally carried with it a very innocent, nay, laudable meaning; being used purely to signify the study of wisdom, and the more sublime parts of knowledge; but in regard the ancient magi engaged themselves in astrology, divination, sorcery, &c., the term magic in time became odious, and was only used to signify an unlawful and diabolical kind of science, depending on the assistance of the devil and departed souls.\n\nIf any wonder how so vain and deceitful a science should gain so much credit and authority over men's minds, Pliny gives the reason of it. It is, says he,\nMagic, because it has possessed itself of three sciences of the most esteem among men: taking from each all that is great and marvellous in it. Nobody doubts but it had its first origin in medicine; and that it insinuated itself into the minds of the people, under pretence of affording extraordinary remedies. To these fine promises it added every thing in religion that is pompous and splendid, and that appears calculated to blind and captivate mankind. Lastly, it mingled judicial astrology with the rest; perverting people, curious of futurity, that it saw every thing to come in the heavens.\n\nAgrippa divides magic into three kinds; natural, celestial, and ceremonial or superstitious.\n\nNatural Magic is no more than the application of natural active causes to passive subjects; by means whereof many surprising, but yet natural, effects are produced.\n\nIn this way many of our experiments in natural philosophy, especially those of electricity, optics, and magnetism, have a kind of magical appearance, and among the ignorant and credulous might easily pass for miracles. Such, without doubt, have been some of those miracles wrought by ancient magicians, whose knowledge of the various powers of nature, there is reason to believe, was much greater than modern vanity will sometimes allow.\n\nBaptista Porta has a treatise of natural magic, or of secrets for performing very extraordinary things by natural causes. The natural magic of the Chaldeans was nothing but the knowledge of the powers of simples and minerals. The magic which they called theurgia, consisted wholly in the knowledge of the ceremonies to be observed in the worship of the gods, in order to be acceptable. By virtue of these ceremonies they believed they could converse with spiritual beings, and cure diseases.\n\nCelestial Magic borders nearly on judiciary astrology: it attributes to spirits a kind of rule or dominion over the planets, and to planets a dominion over men; and on those principles builds a ridiculous kind of system. See Astrology.\n\nSuperstitious or Goetic Magic consists in the invocation of devils. Its effects are usually evil and wicked, though very strange, and seemingly surpassing the powers of nature; supposed to be produced by virtue of some compact, either tacit or express, with evil spirits; but the truth is, these have not all the power that is usually imagined, nor do they produce those effects ordinarily ascribed to them.\n\nThis species of magic, there is every reason to believe, had its origin in Egypt, the native country of paganism. The first magicians mentioned in history were Egyptians; and that people so famed for early wisdom believed not only in the existence of demons, the great agents in magic (see Daemon), but also that different orders of those spirits presided over the elements of earth, air, fire, and water, as well as over the persons and affairs of men. Hence they ascribed every disease with which they were afflicted to the immediate agency of some evil daemon. When any person was seized with a fever, for instance, they did not think it necessary to search for any natural cause of the disease: it was immediately attributed to some daemon which had taken possession of the body of the patient, and which could not be ejected but by charms and incantations.\n\nThese superstitious notions, which had spread from Egypt over all the east, the Jews imbibed during their captivity in Babylon. Hence we find them in the writings of the New Testament attributing almost every disease to which they were incident to the immediate agency of devils (see Possession). Many of the same impious superstitions were brought from Egypt and Chaldea by Pythagoras, and transmitted by him and his followers to the Platonists in Greece. This is apparent from the writers of the life of Pythagoras. Jamblicus, speaking of the followers of that philosopher, says expressly, that they cured certain diseases by incantations; and Porphyry adds, that they cured diseases both of the mind and of the body by songs and incantations. This was exactly the practice of the Egyptian priests, who were supposed to keep up a constant intercourse with daemons, and to have the power of controlling them by magical charms and sacred songs. Agreeably to this practice of his masters, we are told that Pythagoras directed certain diseases of the mind, doubtless those which he attributed to the agency of daemons, to be cured partly by incantations, partly by magical hymns, and partly by music—καὶ τὰς ἐργασίας τῆς νοῦς παραδίδονται τοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν ἐργασιῶν καὶ μαγικῶν τῶν ἀπὸ μουσικῆς.\n\nThat there are different orders of created spirits, whether called daemons or angels, whose powers intellectual and active greatly surpass the powers of man, reason makes probable, and revelation certain. Now it was the universal belief of the ancient nations, says the learned Mosheim *, and especially of the orientals, * See his that certain sounds and words, for the most part barbarous, were highly grateful, and that others were equally disagreeable, to these spirits. Hence, when they wished to render a daemon propitious, and to employ him on any particular office, the magicians composed their sacred songs of the words which were believed to be agreeable to him; and when it was their intention to drive him from themselves or others, they sung in a strain which they fancied a daemon could not hear but with horror. From the same persuasion arose the custom of suspending from the neck of a sick person, whose disease was supposed to be inflicted by a daemon, an amulet, sometimes made of gold and sometimes of parchment on which was written one or more of those words which daemons could not bear either to hear or to see: and in a didactic poem on the healing art still extant, we are taught by Serenus Sammonicus, that the word Abracadabra is an infallible remedy for a febrile fever orague; and to banish grief of heart, Marcellinus thinks nothing more effectual than the word ηαμαρκαλα. In more modern times, as we are informed by Agrippa, the words used by those in compact with the devil, to invoke him, and to succeed in what they undertake, are, Dies, mes, fefquet, beneoefet, doweina, enteinaus. There are a hundred other formulas of words composed at pleasure, or gathered from several different languages, or patched from the Hebrew or formed in imitation of it. And among the primitive Christians there was a superstitious custom, of which we suspect some remains may yet be found among the illiterate vulgar in different countries,\nMagic of fastening to the neck of a sick person, or to the bed on which he lay, some text from the New Testament, and especially the first two or three verses of the gospel of St John, as a charm undoubtedly efficacious to banish the disease.\n\nThat magicians who could thus cure the sick, were likewise believed to have the power of inflicting diseases, and of working miracles, by means of their subterranean demons, need not be doubted. Ancient writers of good credit are full of the wonders which they performed. We shall mention a few of those which are best attested, and inquire whether they might not have been effected by other means than the interpolation of demons.\n\nThe first magicians of whom we read are those who in Egypt opposed Moses. And we are told, that when Aaron cast down his rod, and it became a serpent, they also did the like with their enchantments; \"for they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents.\" This was a phenomenon which, it must be confessed, had a very miraculous appearance; and yet there seems to have been nothing in it which might not have been effected by flight of hand. The Egyptians, and perhaps the inhabitants of every country where serpents abound, have the art of depriving them of their power to do mischief, so that they may be handled without danger. It was easy for the magicians, who were favoured by the court, to pretend that they changed their rods into serpents, by dexterously substituting one of those animals in place of the rod. In like manner they might pretend to change water into blood, and to produce frogs; for if Moses gave in these instances, as we know he did in others, any previous information of the nature of the miracles which were to be wrought, the magicians might easily provide themselves in a quantity of blood and number of frogs sufficient to answer their purpose of deceiving the people. Beyond this, however, their power could not go. It stopped where that of all workers in legerdemain must have stopped—at the failure of proper materials to work with. Egypt abounds with serpents; blood could be easily procured; and without difficulty they might have frogs from the river: But when Moses produced lice from the dust of the ground, the magicians, who had it not in their power to collect a sufficient quantity of these animals, were compelled to own this to be an effect of divine agency.\n\nThe appearance of Samuel to Saul at Endor is the next miracle, seemingly performed by the power of magic, which we shall consider. It was a common pretence of magicians, that they could raise up ghosts from below, or make dead persons appear unto them to declare future events; and the manner of their incantation is thus described by Horace:\n\n---\n\nPallor utraque\nFecerat horrendas aspectu. Scalpere terram\nUnguis, et pullam divellere horridus agnam\nCoerentum: cruris in foliam confusis, ut inde\nManes elicent, animas responsa daturas.\n\n\"With yellings dire they fill'd the place,\nAnd hideous pale was either's face.\nSoon with their nails they scrap'd the ground,\nAnd fill'd a magic trench profound\n\nWith a black lamb's thick-streaming gore,\nWhole members with their teeth they tore;\nThat they might charm the sprights to tell\nSome curious anecdotes from hell.\"\n\nFrancis.\n\n---\n\nWhether the witch of Endor made use of such infernal charms as these, the sacred historian has not informed us; but Saul addressed her, as if he believed that by some form of incantation she could recall from the state of departed spirits the soul of the prophet who had been for some time dead. In the subsequent apparition, however, which was produced, some have thought there was nothing more than a trick, by which a cunning woman imposed upon Saul's credulity, making him believe that some confidant of her own was the ghost of Samuel. But had that been the case, she would undoubtedly have made the pretended Samuel's answer as pleasing to the king as possible, both to save her own life, which appears from the context to have been in danger, and likewise to have procured the larger reward. She would never have told her sovereign, the durst not have told him, that he himself should be shortly slain, and his sons with him; and that the host of Israel should be delivered into the hands of the Philistines. For this reason many critics, both Jewish and Christian, have supposed that the apparition was really a demon or evil angel, by whose assistance the woman was accustomed to work wonders, and to foretell future events. But it is surely very incredible, that one of the apostate spirits of hell should have reproached Saul for applying to a sorcerer, or should have accosted him in such words as these: \"Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? Wherefore dost thou ask of me, seeing the Lord is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy! For the Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David. Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the Lord, therefore the Lord hath done this thing to thee this day.\" It is to be observed farther, that what was here denounced against Saul was really prophetic, and that the event answered to the prophecy in every particular. Now, though we do not deny that there are created spirits of penetration vastly superior to that of the most enlarged human understanding; yet we dare maintain, that no finite intelligence could by its own mere capacity have ever found out the precise time of the two armies engaging, the success of the Philistines, the consequences of the victory, and the very names of the persons that were to fall in battle. Saul and his sons were indeed men of tried bravery, and therefore likely to expose themselves to the greatest danger; but after the menaces which he received from the apparition, he would have been impelled, one should think, by common prudence, either to chicane with the enemy, or to retire from the field without exposing himself, his sons, and the whole army, to certain and inevitable destruction; and his acting differently, with the consequences of his conduct, were events which no limited understanding could either foresee or certainly foretell. If to these circumstances we add the suddenness of Samuel's appearance, with the effect which it had upon the sorceress herself, we shall find reason to believe, that the apparition was that of no evil daemon. There is not, we believe, upon record, another instance of any person's\nson's pretending to raise a ghost from below, without previously using some magical rites or some form of incantation. As nothing of that kind is mentioned in the case before us, it is probable that Samuel appeared before he was called. It is likewise evident from the narrative, that the apparition was not what the woman expected; for we are told, that \"when the faw Samuel, she cried out for fear.\" And when the king exhorted her not to be afraid, and asked what the faw, \"the woman said, I see gods (elohim) attending out of the earth.\" Now, had she been accustomed to do such feats, and known that what the faw was only her subterranean daemon, it is not conceivable that she could have been so frightened, or have mistaken her familiar for elohim in any sense in which that word can be taken. We are therefore strongly inclined to adopt the opinion of those who hold that it was Samuel himself who appeared and prophesied, not called up by the wretched woman or her demons, but, to her utter confusion, and the disgrace of her art, sent by God to rebuke Saul's madness in a most affecting and mortifying way, and to deter all others from ever applying to magicians or demons for assistance when refused comfort from heaven. For though this hypothesis may to a superficial thinker seem to transgress the rule of Horace—Nec deus interfisit, &c.—which is as applicable to the interpretation of scripture, as to the introduction of supernatural agency in human compositions; yet he who has studied the theocratical constitution of Israel, the nature of the office which was there termed regal, and by what means the administration was in emergencies conducted, will have a different opinion; and at once perceive the dignus vincule nodus.\n\nThe sudden and wonderful destruction of the army of Brennus the Gaul, has likewise been attributed to magic, or, what in this inquiry amounts to the same thing, to the interposition of evil spirits, whom the priests of Apollo invoked as gods. Those barbarians had made an inroad into Greece, and invested the temple of Apollo at Delphi, with a view to plunder it of its sacred treasure. Their numbers and courage overpowered all opposition; and they were just upon the point of making themselves masters of the place, when, Justin informs us, that, to encourage the besieged, the priests and prophets \"advenisse deum clamant;\" cumque se vidisse defilientem in templum per culminis aperta faugia. Dum omnes opem dei suppliciter implorant, juvenem supra humanum modum infirmiss pulchritudinis, comitique ei duas armatas virgines, ex propinquis duabus Diana Minervaque sedibus occurrisse, nec oculis tantum haec se perspexisse; audisse\n\n“(A) Called aloud that the god had arrived: That they had seen him leap into the temple through the aperture in the roof: That whilst they were all humbly imploring his help, a youth of more than human beauty, accompanied by two virgins in armour, had run to their assistance from the neighbouring temples of Diana and Minerva; and that they had not only beheld these things with their eyes, but had also heard the whizzing of his bow and the clangor of his arms. They therefore earnestly exhorted the besieged not to neglect the heavenly signal, but to fall out upon their enemies, and partake with the divinities of the glory of the victory.\" With these words the soldiers being animated, eagerly rushed to battle: and were themselves quickly sensible of the presence of the god; for part of the rock being torn away by an earthquake, rolled down upon the Gauls; whose thickest battalions being thus thrown into confusion, fled, exposed to the weapons of their enemies. Soon afterwards a tempest arose, which by cold and the fall of hailstones cut off the wounded.\ninstead of walls. A large recess within assumed the form of a theatre; so that the shouts of soldiers, and the sounds of military instruments, re-echoing from rock to rock, and from cavern to cavern, increased the clamour to an immense degree; which, as the historian observes, could not but have great effects on ignorant and barbarous minds. The playing off these panic terrors was not indeed of itself sufficient to repulse and dissipate a host of fierce and hungry invaders, but it enabled the defenders to keep them at bay till a more solid entertainment was provided for them, in the explosion and fall of that portion of the rock at the foot of which the greater part of the army lay encamped.\n\nAmong the caverns in the sacred rock, there was one which, from an intoxicating quality discovered in the steam which issued from it, was rendered very famous by being fitted to the recipient of the priests of Apollo (b). Now, if we only suppose this, or any other of the vapours emitted from the numerous fissures, to be endowed with that unctuous, or otherwise inflammatory quality, which modern experience shows to be common in mines and subterranean places, we can easily conceive how the priests of the temple might, without the agency of demons, be able to work the wonders which history speaks of as effected in this transaction. For the throwing down a lighted torch or two into a chasm, whence such a vapour issued, would set the whole into a flame; which by suddenly rarefying and dilating the air, would, like fired gunpowder, blow up all before it. That the priests, the guardians of the rock, could be long ignorant of such a quality, or that they would divulge it when discovered, cannot be supposed. Strabo relates, that one Onomarchus, with his companions, as they were attempting by night to dig their way through to rob the holy treasury, were frightened from their work by the violent shaking of the rock; and he adds, that the same phenomenon had defeated many other attempts of the like nature. Now, whether the tapers which Onomarchus and his companions were obliged to use while they were at work, inflamed the vapour, or whether the priests of Apollo heard them at it, and let fire to a countermine, it is certain a quality of this kind would always stand them in stead. Such then (prefuses the learned prelate) was the expedient (c) they employed to dislodge this nest of hornets, which had settled at the foot of their sacred rock; for the storm of thunder, lightning, and hail, which followed, was the natural effect of the violent concussions given to the air by the explosion of the mine.\"\n\nTwo instances more of the power of ancient magic we shall just mention, not because there is anything particular or important in the facts, but because some credit seems to have been given to the narration by the differing Cudworth. Philostratus, in his life of Apollonius Tyaneus, informs us that a laughing demoniac at Athens was cured by that magician, who ejected the evil spirit by threats and menaces; and the biographer adds, that the demon, at his departure, is said to have overturned a statue which stood before the porch where the cure was performed. The other instance is of the same magician freeing the city of Ephesus from the plague, by flinging to death an old ragged beggar whom Apollonius called the plague, and who appeared to be a demon by his changing himself into the form of a fanged dog.\n\nThat such tales as these should have been thought worthy of the slightest notice by the incomparable author of the Intellectual System, is indeed a wonderful phenomenon in the history of human nature. The whole story of Apollonius Tyaneus, as is now well known, is nothing better than a collection of the most extravagant fables*: but were the narrative such as that credit could be given to the facts here related, there appears no necessity in either case for calling in the agency of evil spirits by the power of magic.—History of The Athenians of that age were a superstitious people. Apollonius was a shrewd impostor, long practised in the art of deceiving the multitude. For such a man it was easy to persuade a friend and confidant to act the part of the laughing demoniac; and without much difficulty the statue might be so undermined as inevitably to tumble, upon a violent concussion being given to the ground at the time of the departure of the pretended demon. If so, this feat of magic dwindles down into a very trifling trick performed by means both simple and natural. The other case of the poor man at Ephesus, who was stoned to death, is exactly similar to that of those innocent women in our own country, whom the vulgar in the last century were instigated to burn for the supposed crime of witchcraft. We have no reason to suppose that an Ephesian mob was less inflammable or credulous than a British mob, or that Apollonius played his part with less skill than a Christian demonologist; and as the spirits of our witches, who were sacrificed to folly and fanaticism, were often supposed to migrate from their dead bodies into the bodies of hares or cats accidentally passing by, so might this impostor at Ephesus persuade his cruel and credulous instruments, that the spirit of their victim had taken possession of the body of the fanged dog.\n\nStill it may be said, that in magic and divination events have been produced out of the ordinary course of nature; and as we cannot suppose the Supreme Being\n\n---\n\n(b) \"In hoc rupis anfractu, media ferme montis altitudine, planities exigua est, atque in ea profundum terrae foramen, quod in oraculo patet, ex quo frigidus spiritus, vi quadam velut vento in sublimè expulitus, mentes vatum in recordiæ veritatis, implectasque deo responsa confulentibus dare cogit.\" Just. lib. 24. c. 19.\n\n(c) The learned author, by arguments too tedious to be here enumerated, confirms the reasoning which we have borrowed from him; and likewise shows from history, that the priests, before they came to extremities with the sacred rock, had entered into treaty with those barbarians, and paid them a large tribute to decamp and quit the country. This adds greatly to the probability of his account of the explosion; for nothing but the absolute imposibility of getting quit of their believers by any other means, could have induced the priests to hazard an experiment so big with danger to themselves as well as to their enemies.\nMagic.\n\nBeing to have countenanced such abominable practices by the interposition of his power, we must necessarily attribute those effects to the agency of demons, or evil spirits. Thus, when Æneas consulted the Sibyl, the agency of the inspiring god changed her whole appearance:\n\n---\n\n\"Pocere fata\nTempus,\" ait: \"Deus, ecce, Deus.\" Cui talia fanti\nAnte fores, subito non vultus, non color unus,\nNon comptae manere comea: sed pectus anhelum,\nEt rabie fera corda tument; majoroque viderti,\nNec mortale sonans: afflata est numine quando\nJam propiore Dei.\n\n---\n\n\"Aloud she cries,\n\"This is the time, inquire your destinies.\nHe comes, behold, a god!\" Thus while she said,\nAnd shivering at the sacred entry staid,\nHer colour chang'd, her face was not the same;\nAnd hollow groans from her deep spirit came;\nHer hair stood up; convulsive rage posled;\nHer trembling limbs, and heav'd her lab'ring breast;\nGreater than human kind she seem'd to look,\nAnd with an accent more than mortal spoke.\nHer staring eyes with sparkling fury roll,\nWhen all the god came rushing on her soul.\"\n\nDRYDEN.\n\nIn answer to this, it is to be observed, that the temple of Apollo at Cumæ was an immense excavation in a solid rock. The rock was probably of the same kind with that on which the temple of Delphi was built, full of fissures, out of which exhaled perpetually a poisonous kind of vapour. Over one of these fissures was the tripod placed, from which the priests gave the oracle. Now we learn from St Chrysostom, that the priests was a woman: Quæ in tripodes fedens expansa malignum spiritum per interna immifum, et per genitalis partes subeminent excitent, furore repleretur, ipsaque resolutis crinibus baccharatur, ex ore ipsum emittens, et sic furoris verba loquebatur.\" By comparing this account with that quoted above from Justin, which is confirmed both by Pausanias and by Strabo, it is evident, that what Chrysostom calls malignum spiritum was a particular kind of vapour blown forcibly through the fissure of the rock. But if there be a vapour of such a quality as, if received per partes genitalis, would make a woman furious, there is surely no necessity for calling into the scene at Cumæ the agency of a demon or evil spirit. Besides, it is to be remembered, that in all mystical and magical rites, such as this was, both the priests, and the persons consulting them, prepared themselves by particular kinds of food, and sometimes, as there is reason to believe, by human sacrifices, for the approach of the god or demon whose aid they invoked. On the present occasion, we know from the poet himself, that a cake was used which was composed of poppy-seed and honey; and Plutarch speaks of a shrub called lenoçulus, used in the celebration of the mysteries of Hecate, which drives men into a kind of frenzy, and makes them confess all the wickedness which they had done or intended. This being the case, the illusions of fancy occasioned by poppy will sufficiently account for the change of the sibyl's appearance, even though the inhaled vapour should not have possessed that efficacy which Chrysostom and Justin attribute to it. Even some sorts of our ordinary food occasion strange dreams, for which onions in particular are remarkable. Excessive drunkenness, as is well known, produces a disorder named by the bacchanalians of this country the blue devils, which consists of an immense number of spectres, accompanied with extreme horror to the person who sees them. From these facts, which cannot be denied there must arise a suspicion, that by using very unnatural food, such as human blood, the vilest of insects, serpents, and medicated cakes, by shutting themselves up in follies and caves, and by devising every method to excite horrid and dreadful ideas or images in the fancy, the ancient magicians might by natural means produce every phenomenon which they attributed to their gods or demons. Add to this, that in ancient times magic was studied as a science. Now, as we cannot suppose that every one who studied it intended absolutely nothing, or that all who believed in it were wholly deceived; what can we infer, but that the science consisted in the knowledge of those drugs which produced the phantoms in the imagination, and of the method of preparing and properly employing them for that purpose? The celebrated Friar Bacon indeed, as far back as the 13th century, wrote a book de Nullitate Magiae: but though we should allow that this book proved to demonstration, that in his time no such thing as magic existed, it never could prove that the case had always been so. At that time almost all the sciences were lost; and why not magic as well as others? It is likewise an undoubted fact, that magic at all times prevailed among the Asiatics and Africans more than among the Europeans. The reason doubtless was, that the former had the requisites for the art in much greater perfection than we. Human sacrifices were frequent among them; they had the most poisonous serpents, and the greatest variety of vegetable poisons, together with that powerful narcotic opium; all which were of essential use in mystical and magic rites. They had, besides, a burning fun, frightful deferts and follies; which, together with extreme fasting, were all called in to their affluence, and were sufficient to produce, by natural means, the most wonderful phenomena which have ever been attributed to magical incantations. Even in our own days, we have the testimony of two travellers, whom we cannot suspect to be either liars or enthusiasts, that both the Indians and Africans perform feats for which neither they nor the most enlightened Europeans can account. The one is Mr Grofe, who visited the East Indies about the year 1762; and the other is Mr Bruce, who informs us, that the inhabitants of the western coast of Africa pretend to hold a communication with the devil, and verify their assertions in such a manner that neither he nor other travellers know what to make of it: but it does not from this follow, that Mr Bruce believed that communication to be real. We have all seen one of the most illiterate men that ever assumed the title of Doctor, perform feats very surprising, and such as even a philosopher would have been puzzled to account for, if he had not been previously let into the secret; and yet no man supposes that Katterfelto holds any communica-\ntion with the devil, although he has sometimes pretended it among people whose minds he supposed unenlightened.\n\nStill it may be objected, that we have a vast number of histories of witches, who in the last century confessed, that they were present with the devil at certain meetings; that they were carried through the air, and saw many strange feats performed, too numerous and too ridiculous to be here mentioned. The best answer to this objection seems to be that given by Dr. Ferriar in his essay on Popular Illusions*. \"The solemn meeting of witches (says he) is supposed to be put beyond all doubt by the numerous confessions of criminals, who have described their ceremonies, named the times and places of their meetings, with the persons present, and who have agreed in their relations, though separately delivered.\" But I would observe, first, that the circumstances told of these festivals are in themselves ridiculous and incredible; for they are represented as gloomy and horrible, and yet with a mixture of childish and extravagant fancies, more likely to disgust and alienate than conciliate the minds of their guests. They have every appearance of uneasy dreams. Sometimes the devil and his subjects say mass; sometimes he preaches to them; more commonly he was seen in the form of a black goat, surrounded by imps in a thousand frightful shapes; but none of these forms are new, they all resemble known quadrupeds or reptiles. Secondly, I observe, that there is direct proof furnished even by demonologists, that all those supposed journeys and entertainments were nothing more than dreams. Persons accused of witchcraft have been repeatedly watched about the time they had fixed for their meeting: they have been seen to anoint themselves with soporific compositions; after which they fell into profound sleep; and on awaking several hours afterwards, they have related their journey through the air, with their amusement at the festival, and have named the persons whom they saw there.\" This is exactly conformable to the practice of the ancient magicians and diviners, and seems to be the true way of accounting, as well for many of the phenomena of magic, as for that extravagant and shameful superstition which prevailed so much during part of the last century, and by which such numbers of innocent men and women were cruelly put to death (c). We may indeed be assured, that the devil has not in his power to reverse in a single instance the laws of nature without a divine permission; and we can conceive but one occasion (see Possession) on which such permission could be given consistently with the wisdom and the goodness of God. All the tales, therefore, of diabolical agency in magic and witchcraft must undoubtedly be false; for a power, which the devil is not himself at liberty to exert, he cannot communicate to a human creature. Were the case otherwise; were those powers, \"which (according to Johnstone) only the control of Omnipotence restrains from laying creation waste, subservient to the invocations of wicked mortals; were those spirits,—of which the least could yield\n\nThe elements, and arm him with the force Of all their regions,\"—permitted to work miracles, and either to inflict or to remove diseases at the desire of their capricious votaries, how comfortless and wretched would be the life of man! But the matter has been long ago determined by the failure of Pharaoh's magicians; who, though by legerdemain they imitated some of the miracles of Moses, could not form the vilest insect, or stand before the disease which he inflicted upon them as well as upon others.\n\nThe revival of learning, and the success with which the laws of nature have been investigated, have long ago banished this species of magic from all the enlightened nations of Europe. Among ourselves, none but persons grossly illiterate pay the least regard to magical charms; nor are they anywhere abroad more prevalent than among the inhabitants of Lapland and Iceland. These people, indeed, place an absolute confidence in the effects of certain idle words and actions: and ignorant sailors from other parts of the world are deceived by their assertions and their ceremonies. The famous magical drum of the Laplanders is still in constant use in that nation; and Scheffer, in his History of Lapland, has given an account of its structure.\n\nThis instrument is made of beech, pine, or fir, split in the middle, and hollowed on the flat side where the drum is to be made. The hollow is of an oval figure; and is covered with a skin clean dressed, and painted with figures of various kinds, such as stars, suns and moons, animals and plants, and even countries, lakes and rivers; and of later days, since the preaching of Christianity among them, the acts and sufferings of our Saviour and his apostles are often added among the rest. All these figures are separated by lines into three regions or clutters.\n\nThere is, besides these parts of the drum, an index and a hammer. The index is a bundle of braids or iron rings, the biggest of which has a hole in its middle, and the smaller ones are hung to it. The hammer or drumstick is made of the horn of a reindeer; and with this they beat the drum so as to make these rings move, they being laid on the top for that purpose. In the motion of these rings about the pictures figured on the drum, they fancy to themselves some prediction in regard to the things they inquire about.\n\nWhat they principally inquire into by this instrument, are three things. 1. What sacrifices will prove most acceptable to their gods. 2. What success they shall have in their several occupations, as hunting, fishing, curing of diseases, and the like; and, 3. What is doing in places remote from them. On these several occasions they use several peculiar ceremonies, and place themselves in various odd postures as they beat the drum; which influences the rings to the one or the other side, and to come nearer to the one or the other set of figures. And when they have done this, they have a method of calculating a discovery, which they keep as a great secret, but which seems merely\n\n(c) For some farther account of popular illusions, see Animal Magnetism.\nmerely the busines of the imagination in the diviner or magician.\n\nMagic Square, a square figure, formed of a series of numbers in mathematical proportion; so disposed in parallel and equal ranks, as that the sums of each row, taken either perpendicularly, horizontally, or diagonally, are equal.\n\nLet the several numbers which compose any square number (for instance, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. to 25 inclusive, the square number) be disposed, in their natural order, after each other in a square figure of 25 cells, each in its cell; if now you change the order of these numbers, and dispose them in the cells in such manner, as that the five numbers which fill a horizontal rank of cells, being added together, shall make the same sum with the five numbers in any other rank of cells, whether horizontal or vertical, and even the same number with the five in each of the two diagonal ranks: this disposition of numbers is called a magic square, in opposition to the former disposition, which is called a natural square. See the figures following:\n\n| Natural Square | Magic Square |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| 1 2 3 4 5     | 16 14 8 2 25 |\n| 6 7 8 9 10    | 3 22 20 11 9 |\n| 11 12 13 14 15| 15 6 4 23 17 |\n| 16 17 18 19 20| 24 18 12 10 1 |\n| 21 22 23 24 25| 7 5 21 19 13 |\n\nOne would imagine that these magic squares had that name given them, in regard this property of all their ranks, which, taken any way, make always the same sum, appeared extremely surprising, especially in certain ignorant ages, when mathematics passed for magic; but there is a great deal of reason to suspect, that these squares merited their name still farther, by the superstitious operations they were employed in, as the construction of talismans, &c. for, according to the childish philosophy of those days, which attributed virtues to numbers, what virtues might not be expected from numbers so wonderful?\n\nHowever, what was at first the vain practice of makers of talismans and conjurors, has since become the subject of a serious research among mathematicians; not that they imagine it will lead them to anything of solid use or advantage (magic squares favour too much of their original to be of much use); but only as it is a kind of play, where the difficulty makes the merit, and it may chance to produce some new views of numbers, which mathematicians will not lose the occasion of.\n\nEman. Moschopulus, a Greek author of no great antiquity, is the first that appears to have spoken of magic squares: and by the age wherein he lived, there is reason to imagine he did not look on them merely as a mathematician. However, he has left us some rules for their construction. In the treatise of Cor. Agricola, so much accused of magic, we find the squares of seven numbers, viz. from three to nine inclusive, disposed magically; and it must not be supposed that those seven numbers were preferred to all the other without some very good reason: in effect, it is because their squares, according to the system of Agricola and his followers, are planetary. The square of 3, for instance, belongs to Saturn; that of 4 to Jupiter; that of 5 to Mars; that of 6 to the Sun; that of 7 to Venus; that of 8 to Mercury; and that of 9 to the Moon. M. Bachet applied himself to the study of magic squares, on the hint he had taken from the planetary squares of Agricola, as being unacquainted with the work of Moschopulus, which is only in manuscript in the French king's library; and, without the assistance of any author, he found out a new method for those squares whose root is uneven, for instance 25, 49, &c. but he could not make any thing of those whole root is even.\n\nAfter him came M. Frenicle, who took the same subject in hand. A certain great algebraist was of opinion, that whereas the 16 numbers which compose the square might be disposed 20922780888000 different ways in a natural square (as from the rules of combination it is certain they may), they could not be disposed in a magic square above 16 different ways; but M. Frenicle showed, that they might be thus disposed 878 different ways; whence it appears how much his method exceeds the former, which only yielded the 55th part of magic squares of that of M. Frenicle.\n\nTo this inquiry he thought fit to add a difficulty that had not yet been considered: the magic square of 7, for instance, being constructed, and its 49 cells filled, if the two horizontal ranks of cells, and, at the same time, the two vertical ones, the most remote from the middle, be retrenched; that is, if the whole border or circumference of the square be taken away, there will remain a square whose root will be 5, and which will only consist of 25 cells. Now it is not at all surprising that the square should be no longer magical, because the ranks of the large ones were not intended to make the same sum, excepting when taken entire with all the seven numbers that fill their seven cells; so that being mutilated each of two cells, and having lost two of their numbers, it may be well expected, that their remainders will not any longer make the same sum. But M. Frenicle would not be satisfied, unless when the circumference or border of the magic square was taken away, and even any circumferences at pleasure, or, in fine, several circumferences at once, the remaining square was still magical: which last condition, no doubt, made these squares vastly more magical than ever.\n\nAgain, He inverted that condition, and required that any circumference taken at pleasure, or even several circumferences, should be inseparable from the square; that is, that it should cease to be magical when they were removed, and yet continue magical after the removal of any of the rest. M. Frenicle, however, gives no general demonstration of his methods, and frequently seems to have no other guide but chance. It is true, his book was not published by himself, nor did it appear till after his death, viz. in 1693.\n\nIn 1703, M. Poignard, canon of Bruxelles, published a treatise of sublime magic squares. Before him there had been no magic squares made but for series of natural numbers that formed a square; but M. Poignard made two very considerable improvements. Instead of taking all the numbers that fill a square, for instance, the 36 successive numbers, which would fill all the cells of a natural square whose side is 6, he only takes as many successive numbers as there are units in\nin the side of the square, which, in this case, are six; and these fix numbers alone he dispenses in such manner in the 36 cells, that none of them are repeated twice in the same rank, whether it be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal; whence it follows, that all the ranks, taken all the ways possible, must always make the same sum, which M. Poignard calls repeated progression. Instead of being confined to take these numbers according to the series and succession of the natural numbers, that is, in an arithmetical progression, he takes them likewise in a geometrical progression, and even in an harmonical progression. But with these two last progressions the magic must necessarily be different from what it was: in the squares filled with numbers in geometrical progression, it consists in this, that the products of all the ranks are equal; and in the harmonical progression, the numbers of all the ranks continually follow that progression: he makes squares of each of these three progressions repeated.\n\nThis book of M. Poignard gave occasion to M. de la Hire to turn his thoughts the same way, which he did with such success, that he seems to have well nigh completed the theory of magic squares. He first considers uneven squares: all his predecessors on the subject having found the construction of even ones by much the most difficult; for which reason M. de la Hire reserves those for the last. This excess of difficulty may arise partly from hence, that the numbers are taken in arithmetical progression. Now in that progression, if the number of terms be uneven, that in the middle has some properties, which may be of service; for instance, being multiplied by the number of terms in the progression, the product is equal to the sum of all the terms.\n\nM. de la Hire proposes a general method for uneven squares, which has some similarity with the theory of compound motions, so useful and fertile in mechanics. As that consists in decomposing motions, and resolving them into others more simple; so does M. de la Hire's method consist in resolving the square that is to be constructed into two simple and primitive squares. It must be owned, however, it is not quite so easy to conceive these two simple and primitive squares in the compound or perfect square, as in an oblique motion to imagine a parallel and perpendicular one.\n\nSuppose a square of cells, whose root is uneven, for instance 7; and that its 49 cells are to be filled magically with numbers, for instance the first 7; M. de la Hire, on the one side, takes the first 7 numbers, beginning with unity, and ending with the root 7; and on the other 7, and all its multiples to 49, exclusively; and as these only make six numbers, he adds 0, which makes this an arithmetical progression of 7 terms as well as the other; 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42. This done, with the first progression repeated, he fills the square of the root magically: In order to this, he writes in the first seven cells of the first horizontal rank the seven numbers proposed in what order he pleases, for that is absolutely indifferent; and it is proper to observe here, that these seven numbers may be ranged in 5040 different manners in the same rank. The order in which they are placed in the first horizontal rank, be it what it will, is that which determines their order in all the rest. For the second horizontal rank, he places in its first cell, either the third, the fourth, the fifth, or the sixth number, from the first number of the first rank; and after that writes the five others in order as they follow. For the third horizontal rank, he observes the same method with regard to the second that he observed in the second with regard to the first, and so of the rest. For instance, suppose the first horizontal rank filled with the seven numbers in their natural order, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; the second horizontal rank, may either commence with 3, with 4, with 5, or with 6; but in this instance it commences with 3; the third rank therefore must commence with 5, the fourth with 7, the fifth with 2, the sixth with 4, and the seventh with 6.\n\nThe commencement of the ranks which follow the first being thus determined, the other numbers, as we have already observed, must be written down in the order wherein they stand in the first, going on to 5, 6, and 7, and returning to 1, 2, &c., till every number in the first rank be found in every rank underneath, according to the order arbitrarily pitched upon at first. By this means it is evident, that no number whatever can be repeated twice in the same rank; and by consequence, that the seven numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, being in each rank, must of necessity make the same sum.\n\nIt appears, from this example, that the arrangement of the numbers in the first rank being chosen at pleasure, the other ranks may be continued in four different manners; and since the first rank may have 5040 different arrangements, there are no less than 20,160 different manners of constructing the magic square of seven numbers repeated.\n\nThe order of the numbers in the first rank being determined; if in beginning with the second rank, the second number 2, or the last number 7, should be pitched upon in one of these cases, and repeated; and in the other case, the other diagonal would be false unless the number repeated seven times should happen to be 4; for four times seven is equal to the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; and in general, in every square consisting of an unequal number of terms, in arithmetical progression, one of the diagonals would be false according to those two constructions, unless the term always repeated in that diagonal were the middle term of the progression. It is not, however, at all necessary to take the terms in an arithmetical progression; for, according to this method, one may construct a magic square of any numbers at pleasure, whether they be according to any certain progression or not. If they be in an arithmetical progression, it will be proper, out of the general method, to except those...\ntwo constructions which produce a continual repetition of the same term in one of the two diagonals, and only to take in the case wherein that repetition would prevent the diagonal from being just; which case being absolutely disregarded when we computed that the square of 7 might have 20,160 different constructions, it is evident that by taking that case in, it must have vastly more.\n\nTo begin the second rank with any other number besides the second and the last, must not, however, be looked on as an universal rule: it holds good for the square of 7; but if the square of 9, for instance, were to be constructed, and the fourth figure of the first horizontal rank were pitched on for the first of the second, the consequence would be, that the fifth and eighth horizontal ranks would likewise commence with the same number, which would therefore be repeated three times in the same vertical rank, and occasion other repetitions in all the rest. The general rule, therefore, must be conceived thus: Let the number in the first rank pitched on, for the commencement of the second, have such an exponent of its quota; that is, let the order of its place be such, as that if an unit be taken from it, the remainder will not be any just quota part of the root of the square; that is, cannot divide it equally. If, for example, in the square of 7, the third number of the first horizontal rank be pitched on for the first of the second, such construction will be just; because the exponent of the place of that number, viz. 3, subtracting 1, that is, 2 cannot divide 7. Thus also might the fourth number of the same first rank be chosen, because 4—1, viz. 3, cannot divide 7; and, for the same reason, the fifth or sixth number might be taken: but in the square of 9, the fourth number of the first rank must not be taken, because 4—1, viz. 3, does divide 9. The reason of this rule will appear very evidently, by considering in what manner the returns of the same numbers do or do not happen, taking them always in the same manner in any given series. And hence it follows, that the fewer divisions the root of any square to be constructed has, the more different manners of constructing it there are; and that the prime numbers, i.e. those which have no divisions, as 3, 7, 11, 13, &c. are those whose squares will admit of the most variations in proportion to their quantities.\n\nThe squares constructed according to this method have some particular properties not required in the problem; for the numbers that compose any rank parallel to one of the two diagonals, are ranged in the same order with the numbers that compose the diagonal to which they are parallel. And as any rank parallel to a diagonal must necessarily be shorter, and have fewer cells than the diagonal itself, by adding to it the correspondent parallel, which has the number of cells by which the other falls short of the diagonal, the numbers of those two parallels, placed as it were end to end, still follow the same order with those of the diagonal: besides that their sums are likewise equal; so that they are magical on another account.\n\nInstead of the squares which we have hitherto formed by horizontal ranks, one might also form them by vertical ones; the case is the same in both.\n\nAll we have hitherto said regards only the first primitive square, whose numbers, in the proposed example, were: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; here still remains the second primitive, whose numbers are: 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42.\n\nM. de la Hire proceeds in the same manner here as in the former; and this may likewise be constructed in 20,160 different manners, as containing the same number of terms with the first. Its construction being made, and of consequence all its ranks making the same sum, it is evident, that if we bring the two into one, by adding together the numbers of the two corresponding cells of the two squares, that is, the two numbers of the first of each, the two numbers of the second, of the third, &c. and dispose them in the 49 corresponding cells of a third square, it will likewise be magical in regard to its rank, formed by the addition of equal sums to equal sums, which must of necessity be equal among themselves. All that remains in doubt is, whether or no, by the addition of the corresponding cells of the two first squares, all the cells of the third will be filled in such manner, as that each not only contains one of the numbers of the progression from 1 to 49, but also that this number be different from any of the rest, which is the end and design of the whole operation.\n\nAs to this it must be observed, that if in the construction of the second primitive square care has been taken, in the commencement of the second horizontal rank, to observe an order with regard to the first, different from what was observed in the construction of the first square; for instance, if the second rank of the first square began with the third term of the first rank, and the second rank of the second square commence with the fourth of the first rank, as in the example it actually does; each number of the first square may be combined once, and only once, by addition with all the numbers of the second. And as the numbers of the first are here 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and those of the second, 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42; by combining them in this manner we have all the numbers in the progression from 1 to 49, without having any of them repeated; which is the perfect magic square proposed.\n\nThe necessity of constructing the two primitive squares in a different manner does not at all hinder but that each of the 20,160 constructions of the one may be combined with all the 20,160 constructions of the other: of consequence, therefore, 20,160 multiplied by itself, which makes 406,425,600, is the number of different constructions that may be made of the perfect square, which here consists of the 49 numbers of the natural progression. But as we have already observed, that a primitive square of seven numbers repeated.\npeated may have above 23,160 several constructions; the number 406,425,600 must come vastly short of expressing all the possible constructions of a perfect magic square of the 49 first numbers.\n\nAs to the even squares, he constructs them like the uneven ones, by two primitive squares; but the construction of primitives is different in general, and may be so a great number of ways: and those general differences admit of a great number of particular variations, which give as many different constructions of the same even square. It scarce seems possible to determine exactly, either how many general differences there may be between the construction of the primitive squares of an even square and an uneven one, nor how many particular variations each general difference may admit of; and, of consequence, we are still far from being able to determine the number of different constructions of all those that may be made by the primitive squares.\n\nThe ingenious Dr Franklin seems to have carried this curious speculation farther than any of his predecessors in the same way. He has constructed not only a magic square of squares, but likewise a magic circle of circles, of which we shall give some account for the amusement of our readers. The magic square of squares is formed by dividing the great square, as in Plate CCXCVIII. The great square is divided into 256 small squares, in which all the numbers from 1 to 256 are placed in 16 columns, which may be taken either horizontally or vertically. The properties are as follow:\n\n1. The sum of the 16 numbers in each column, vertical and horizontal, is 2056.\n2. Every half column, vertical and horizontal, makes 1028, or half of 2056.\n3. Half a diagonal ascending added to half a diagonal descending, makes 2056; taking these half diagonals from the ends of any side of the square to the middle thereof; and so reckoning them either upward or downward, or sidewise from left to right hand, or from right to left.\n4. The same, with all the parallels to the half diagonals, as many as can be drawn in the great square; for any two of them being directed upward and downward, from the place where they begin to that where they end, their sums will make 2056. The same downward and upward in like manner: or all the same if taken sidewise to the middle, and back to the same side again. N.B. One set of these half diagonals and their parallels is drawn in the same square upward and downward. Another such set may be drawn from any of the other three sides.\n5. The four corner numbers in the great square, added to the four central numbers therein, make 1028; equal to the half sum of any vertical or horizontal column which contains 16 numbers; and equal to half a diagonal or its parallel.\n6. If a square hole (equal in breadth to four of the little squares) be cut in a paper, through which any of the 16 little squares in the great square may be seen, and the paper be laid on the great square, the sum of all the 16 numbers, seen through the hole, is equal to the sum of the 16 numbers in any horizontal or vertical column, viz. to 2056.\n\nThe magic circle of circles, Plate CCXCVIII., is composed of a series of numbers from 12 to 75 inclusive, divided into eight concentric circular spaces, and ranged in eight radii of numbers, with the number 12 in the centre; which number, like the centre, is common to all these circular spaces, and to all the radii.\n\nThe numbers are so placed, that the sum of all those in either of the concentric circular spaces above mentioned, together with the central number 12, make 360; equal to the number of degrees in a circle.\n\nThe numbers in each radius also, together with the central number 12, make just 360.\n\nThe numbers in half of any of the above circular spaces, taken either above or below the double horizontal line, with half the central number 12, make 180; equal to the number of degrees in a semicircle.\n\nIf any four adjoining numbers be taken, as if in a square, in the radial divisions of these circular spaces, the sum of these, with half the central number, makes 180.\n\nThere are, moreover, included, four sets of other circular spaces, bounded by circles which are eccentric with respect to the common centre; each of these sets containing five spaces. The centres of the circles which bound them are at A, B, C, and D. The set whose centre is at A is bounded by dotted lines; the set whose centre is at C is bounded by lines of short unconnected strokes; and the set round D is bounded by lines of unconnected longer strokes, to distinguish them from one another. In drawing this figure by hand, the set of concentric circles should be drawn with black ink, and the four different sets of eccentric circles with four kinds of ink of different colours; as blue, red, yellow, and green, for distinguishing them readily from one another. These sets of eccentric circular spaces intersect those of the concentric, and each other; and yet the numbers contained in each of the eccentric spaces, taken all around through any of the 20 which are eccentric, make the same sum as those in the concentric, namely 360, when the central number 12 is added. Their halves also, taken above or below the double horizontal line, with half the central number, make 180.\n\nObserve, that there is not one of the numbers but what belongs at least to two of the circular spaces, some to three, some to four, some to five; and yet they are all so placed as never to break the required number 360 in any of the 28 circular spaces within the primitive circle.\n\nTo bring these matters in view, all the numbers as above mentioned are taken out, and placed in separate columns as they stand around both the concentric and eccentric circular spaces, always beginning with the outermost and ending with the innermost of each set, and also the numbers as they stand in the eight radii, from the circumference to the centre: the common central number 12 being placed the lowest in each column.\n1. In the eight concentric circular spaces.\n\n| 14 | 72 | 23 | 65 | 21 | 67 | 12 | 74 |\n|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| 25 | 63 | 16 | 70 | 18 | 68 | 27 | 61 |\n| 30 | 56 | 39 | 49 | 37 | 51 | 28 | 58 |\n| 41 | 47 | 32 | 54 | 34 | 52 | 43 | 45 |\n| 46 | 40 | 55 | 33 | 53 | 35 | 44 | 42 |\n| 57 | 31 | 48 | 38 | 50 | 36 | 59 | 29 |\n| 62 | 24 | 71 | 17 | 69 | 19 | 60 | 20 |\n| 73 | 15 | 64 | 22 | 66 | 20 | 75 | 13 |\n| 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 |\n\n2.

His father died when he was only seven years old. His mother had him taught grammar and drawing, and then put him apprentice to one of the best goldsmiths in Florence. When he was about 16 years old, his petition for learning began to appear; and he laid out all his money in buying books. Becoming acquainted with Michael Ermini, librarian to the cardinal de Medicis, he soon perfected himself by his affluence in the Latin tongue, and in a little time became master of the Hebrew. His name soon became famous among the learned. A prodigious memory was his distinguishing talent; and he retained not only the sense of what he had read, but\nbut frequently all the words and the very manner of spelling. It is said that a gentleman, to make trial of the force of his memory, lent him a manuscript he was going to print. Some time after it was returned, the gentleman, coming to him with a melancholy countenance, pretended it was lost, and requested Magliabechi to recollect what he remembered of it; upon which he wrote the whole, without missing a word. He generally shut himself up the whole day, and opened his doors in the evening to the men of letters who came to converse with him. His attention was so absorbed by his studies, that he often forgot the most urgent wants of nature. Cosimo III., grand duke of Florence, made him his librarian; but he still continued negligent in his dress, and simple in his manners. An old cloak served him for a morning gown in the day and for bed-clothes at night. The duke, however, provided for him a commodious apartment in his palace, which he was with difficulty persuaded to take possession of; but which he quitted four months after, and returned to his house. He was remarkable for his extraordinary modesty, his sincerity, and his beneficence, which his friends often experienced in their wants. He was a patron of men of learning; and had the highest pleasure in afflicting them with his advice and information, and in furnishing them with books and manuscripts. He had the utmost aversion at anything that looked like constraint; and therefore the grand duke always dispensed with his personal attendance, and sent him orders in writing. Though he lived a very sedentary life, he reached the 81st year of his age; and died in the midst of the public applause, after enjoying, during the latter part of his life, such affluence as few have ever procured by their learning. By his will, he left a very fine library to the public, with a fund for its support.\n\nMAGLOIRE, St., a native of Wales in Great Britain, and cousin-german to St Sampson and St Malo. He embraced a monastic life, and went into France, where he was made abbot of Dol, and after that a provincial bishop in Brittany. He afterwards founded a monastery in the island of Jersey, where he died on the 14th of October 575, about the age of 80. His remains were transported to the suburb of St Jacques, and deposited in a monastery of Benedictines, which was ceded to the fathers of the oratory in 1628. It is now the seminary of St Magloire, celebrated on account of the learned men whom it has produced.—This saint cultivated poetry with considerable success: the hymn which is sung at the feast of All Saints was composed by him; \"Calo quos eadem gloria confert,\" &c.\n\nMAGNA ASSISA ELIGENDA, is a writ anciently directed to the sheriff for summoning four lawful knights before the justices of assize, in order to choose 12 knights of the neighbourhood, &c. to pass upon the great assize between such a person plaintiff and such a one defendant.\n\nMAGNA Chartia.

It renders the soul superior to the trouble, disorder, and emotion, which the appearance of great danger might excite; and it is by this quality that heroes maintain their tranquillity, and preserve the free use of their reason, in the most surprising and dreadful accidents. It admires the same quality in its enemy; and fame, glory, conquests, desire of opportunities to pardon and oblige their opposers, are what glow in the minds of the brave. Magnanimity and courage are inseparable.\n\n1. The inhabitants of Privernum being subdued and taken prisoners after a revolt, one of them being asked by a Roman senator, who was for putting them all to death, what punishment he and his fellow captives deserved? answered with great intrepidity, \"We deserve that punishment which is due to men who are jealous of their liberty, and think themselves worthy of it.\" Plautius perceiving that his answer excited some of the senators, endeavoured to prevent the ill effects of it, by putting a milder question to the prisoner: How would you behave (says he) if Rome should pardon you?\" \"Our conduct (replied the generous captive) depends upon yours. If the peace you grant be an honourable one, you may depend on a constant fidelity on our parts: if the terms of it be hard and dishonourable, lay no stress on our adherence to you.\" Some of the judges confirmed these words as menaces; but the wiser part finding in them a great deal of magnanimity, cried out, that a nation whose only desire was liberty, and their only fear that of losing it, was worthy to become Roman. Accordingly, a decree passed in favour of the prisoners, and Privernum was declared a municipium. Thus the bold sincerity of one man saved his country, and gained it the privilege of being incorporated into the Roman state.\n\n2. Subrius Flavius, the Roman tribune, being impeached for having conspired against the life of the emperor Nero, not only owned the charge, but gloried in it. Upon the emperor's asking him what provocation he had given him to plot his death. Because I abhorred thee (said Flavius), though there was not in the whole army one more zealously attached to thee than I, so long as thou didst merit affection; but I began to hate thee when thou becamest the murderer of thy mother, the murderer of thy brother and wife, a charioteer, a comedian, an incendiary, and a tyrant.\" Tacitus tells us, that the whole conspiracy afforded nothing which proved so bitter and pungent to Nero as this reproach. He ordered Flavius to be immediately put to death, which he suffered with amazing intrepidity. When the executioner desired him to stretch out his neck valiantly, \"I wish (replied he) thou mayest strike as valiantly.\"\n\n3. When the Scythian ambassadors waited on Alexander the Great, they gazed attentively upon him for a long time without speaking a word, being very probably surprized, as they formed a judgement of men from their air and stature, to find that his did not answer the high idea they entertained of him from his fame. At last, the oldest of the ambassadors (according to Q. Curtius) addressed him thus: \"Had the gods given thee a body proportionable to thy ambition, the whole universe would have been too little for thee. With one hand thou wouldst touch the east, and with the other the west; and, not satisfied with this, thou wouldst follow the sun, and know where he hides himself.\"\nhimself. But what have we to do with thee? we never set foot in thy country. May not those who inhabit woods be allowed to live, without knowing who thou art, and whence thou comest? We will neither command over, nor submit to, any man. And that thou mayest be sensible what kind of people the Scythians are, know, that we received from heaven as a rich present, a yoke of oxen, a ploughshare, a dart, a javelin, and a cup. These we make use of, both with our friends and against our enemies. To our friends we give corn, which we procure by the labour of our oxen; with them we offer wine to the gods in our cup; and with regard to our enemies, we combat them at a distance with our arrows, and near at hand with our javelins. But thou, who boastest thy coming to extirpate robbers, thou thyself art the greatest robber upon earth. Thou hast plundered all nations thou overcamest; thou hast polluted thyself of Lydia, invaded Syria, Persia, and Bactriana; thou art forming a design to march as far as India; and now thou comest hither to seize upon our herds of cattle. The great pollutions thou hast, only make thee covet more eagerly what thou hast not. If thou art a god, thou oughtest to do good to mortals, and not deprive them of their possessions. If thou art a mere man, reflect always on what thou art. They whom thou shalt not molest will be thy true friends, the strongest friendships being contracted between equals; and they are esteemed equals who have not tried their strength against each other; but do not imagine that those whom thou conquerest can love thee.”\n\n4. Richard I. king of England, having invested the castle of Chalus, was shot in the shoulder with an arrow; an unskilful surgeon endeavouring to extract the weapon, mangled the flesh in such a manner, that a gangrene ensued. The castle being taken, and perceiving he should not live, he ordered Bertram de Gourdon, who had shot the arrow, to be brought into his presence. Bertram being come, “What harm (said the king) did I ever do thee, that thou shouldest kill me?” The other replied with great magnanimity and courage, “You killed with your own hand my father and two of my brothers, and you likewise designed to have killed me. You may now satiate your revenge. I should cheerfully suffer all the torments that can be inflicted, were I sure of having delivered the world of a tyrant who filled it with blood and carnage.” This bold and spirited answer struck Richard with remorse. He ordered the prisoner to be presented with one hundred shillings, and set at liberty: but Maccardoc, one of the king’s friends, like a true ruffian, ordered him to be flayed alive.\n\n5. The following modern instance is extracted from a French work entitled, École historique et morale du soldat, &c. A mine, underneath one of the outworks of a citadel, was intrusted to the charge of a sergeant and a few soldiers of the Piedmontese guards. Several companies of the enemy’s troops had made themselves masters of this work; and the loss of the place would probably soon have followed had they maintained their post in it. The mine was charged, and a single spark would blow them all into the air. The sergeant, with the greatest coolness, ordered the soldiers to retire, desiring them to request the king to take care of his wife and children; struck fire, set a match to the train, and sacrificed himself for his country.\n\nMAGNESIA, or MAGNESIA, in Ancient Geography, a town or a district of Thessaly, at the foot of Mount Pelion, called by Philip, the son of Demetrius, one of the three keys of Greece, (Paulanias.)\n\nMAGNESIA, or MAGNESIA ALBA, in Chemistry, a peculiar kind of earth.

Themistocles died there: it was one of the three towns given him by Artaxerxes, with these words, “to furnish his table with bread.” It is also celebrated for a battle which was fought there, 190 years before the Christian era, between the Romans and Antiochus king of Syria. The forces of Antiochus amounted to 70,000 men according to Appian, or 70,000 foot and 12,000 horse according to Livy, which has been exaggerated by Florus to 300,000 men; the Roman army consisted of about 28,000 or 30,000 men, 2000 of whom were employed in guarding the camp. The Syrians lost 50,000 foot and 4000 horse; and the Romans only 300 killed, with 25 horse. It was founded by a colony from Magnesia in Thessaly; and was commonly called Magnesia ad Maeandrum, to distinguish it from another called Magnesia ad Sipylum in Lydia at the foot of Mount Sipylus.\n\nMAGNESIA ad Sipylum, anciently Tantalis, the residence of Tantalus, and capital of Maeonia, where now stands the lake Sale.

It was destroyed by an earthquake in the reign of Tiberius.\n\nMAGNET (Magnes) the LOADSTONE: a species of iron ore. See Magnetism, and Mineralogy Index.\n\nThe magnet is also called Lapis Heracleus, from Heraclea, a city of Magnesia, a port of the ancient Lydia, where it is said to have been first found, and from which it is usually supposed to have taken its name. Though others derive the word from a shepherd named Magnes, who first discovered it with the iron of his crook on Mount Ida. It is also called Lapis Nauticus, from its use in navigation; and siderites, from its attracting iron, which the Greeks call eidones.\n\nThe ancients reckoned five kinds of magnets, different in colour and virtue; the Ethiopic, Magnesian, Boeotic, Alexandrian, and Natolian. They also took it to be male and female: but the chief use they made of it was in medicine; especially for the cure of burns and defluxions on the eyes.—The moderns, more fortunate in its application, employ it to conduct them in their voyages. See Navigation.\n\nThe most distinguishing properties of the magnet are, That it attracts iron, and that it points to the poles of the world; and in other circumstances also dips or inclines\nMagnetism\n\nIntroduction\n\nGeneral Principles.\n\nIf the mineral body called magnet or loadstone (an ore of iron which will be described under Mineralogy) is brought within a moderate distance from a piece of iron or steel, or other ferruginous body, such as a small key, a sewing needle, or the like, the ferruginous body will approach the magnet; and if no obstacle intervene, will come in contact with it, and the two bodies will adhere together, so as to require an evident force to separate them from each other.\n\nAgain, if a magnet be freely balanced, so that it be left at liberty to assume any direction, as if be suspended by a thread, or made to float on the surface of water by placing it on a piece of cork or wood, it will soon settle itself in one particular direction, so as to turn one part of its surface towards the northern point of the horizon, and the opposite part of course towards the southern point. These two parts of the surface of the magnet are called its north and south poles; this property of the magnet, of assuming this particular direction, is called its polarity, or its directive power; and when a magnet is placed so as to arrange itself in such a direction, it is said to traverse.\n\nThe direction in which a suspended magnet finally settles is called the magnetic meridian, and it is different in different places, and at different times. It is generally, however, very different from the real meridian line, so that the north pole of a magnet declines a little to the east or west, and the south pole to the west or east. The difference of the magnetic from the astronomical meridian, is called the declination, or variation of the magnet; and the declination is said to be east or west, according as the north pole of the magnet verges to the one or the other of these points.\n\nIf an oblong magnet be suspended on a pivot by its centre of gravity, it does not settle in a perfectly horizontal position, but one of its poles is depressed below the magnet, the horizontal line, and the other elevated as far above it, making an angle with the horizon that is also different on different parts of the earth's surface. This depression of one of the poles is called the dipping of the magnet.\n\nIf two magnets that are each freely suspended, be brought within a moderate distance from each other, so that the north pole of the one is opposed to the south pole of the other, they will attract each other; and if no obstacle intervene, will rush together; but if the two north poles, or the two south poles, be mutually opposed, the magnets will repel each other.\n\nSuch are the leading properties of what is called the natural magnet; but what is of more importance, as we shall see hereafter, any piece of iron or steel may, by being rubbed with a natural magnet, or by some other processes to be afterwards explained, be made to acquire the same properties, and thus in every useful respect serve the same purposes as the natural magnet. These pieces of iron or steel thus magnetised, are called artificial magnets; and when they are of a slender, oblong form, they are termed magnetic needles. When afterwards we speak of the polarity, the declination, or the dipping of the magnetic needle, we would be understood as alluding to these slender, oblong, artificial magnets.\n\nA straight line joining the two poles of a magnet is Axis and called its axis, and a line drawn transversely on the face of the magnet, perpendicular to the axis, is called a magnet.\n\nThe properties of natural and artificial magnets above enumerated, are attributed to the agency of some unknown force or power, either inherent in the magnet, or imparted to it by the processes to which it is subjected. This force is sometimes called magnetism, but we shall for the present denominate it the magnetic power.\nThe most important property of the magnet is its polarity, as it is by means of this that the mariner is enabled to find his way along the trackless ocean, where, before the discovery of this important property, he had no other guide but the stars, and could therefore seldom venture far from the coast. It is by this property too, that the miner is enabled to pursue a direct course through the bowels of the earth, or the traveller direct his steps through immense forests, or over sandy deserts. The uses of the magnet are therefore obvious and important, and the science which places these uses in the best point of view, and thus enables us to turn them to the greatest advantage, is well deserving our attention. Many of the facts to be related under this article are highly curious, and form a pleasing addition to those scientific amusements which are so well calculated to excite the attention of beginners in the study of experimental philosophy.\n\nIt is unnecessary for us to attempt giving here a history of the origin and progress of our knowledge in magnetism. To a general reader, it would be uninteresting, and to such as are better informed, superfluous. We shall only mention the most important works that have appeared on the subject.\n\nFew treatises expressly on magnetism have appeared in this country. In the year 1600, Dr Gilbert, a physician of Colchester, and the friend of Lord Bacon, published an excellent work De Magnete et Corporibus Magneticis, which is still perhaps the most valuable that we possess. Mr Cavallo's Treatise on Magnetism, first published in 1787, contains a great variety of facts and experiments; and a neat compendium of it is given in the 3d volume of the same author's Elements of Natural and Experimental Philosophy. Mr Cavallo's Treatise, and Mr Adams's Essay on Magnetism, form the substance of most of the compilations on this subject that have lately appeared.\n\nTo those who wish to enter minutely on the study of magnetism, the following list of foreign publications recommended by the late Professor Robison of Edinburgh will be acceptable.\n\nÆpinii Tentamen Theoriae Magn. et Electr.

I. Of Magnetical Apparatus.\n\nThe principal instruments employed in magnetical experiments and observations, are reducible to three instruments, heads: First, Magnets of various kinds and forms; Secondly, Magnetic needles and compasses; and, Thirdly, the Dipping needle. Of compasses we have nothing to say here, having fully treated of them under Compass.\n\nMagnets, as we have said, are either natural or artificial. The natural magnet may be cut into various forms, according to the experiments that are to be made with it. The most usual shape is oblong, having the poles at the two most distant extremities. Dr Gilbert, whom we shall mention more at large hereafter, made his magnets of a spherical shape, so as to resemble the terrestrial globe. Magnets of this shape are called terrella, or little earths, and are usually marked upon their surface the magnetic poles, meridian, and equator.\n\nNatural magnets of an oblong shape have usually a piece of soft iron attached to each pole, called the core of magnets. Another piece of soft iron placed so as to join two of the extremities of the former pieces, and usually furnished with a hook or hole in the middle. The magnet thus fitted up, as represented at fig. 1, is said to be armed, and the iron pieces CD, CD, are called the armature of the magnet AB. The magnet with its armature is commonly inclosed in a brass box, represented in the figure by the dotted lines DC, CC, CD; and to the upper part of the box is fixed a ring E, for holding the magnet.\n\nOne of the most common forms of the artificial magnet is that of an oblong bar, as NS, fig. 2, of which N is the north pole, and S the south, having the north end marked with a transverse notch. These bars are made of hardened steel, and are either sold separately, or what is more common, in sets of six in a box.\n\nAnother very common form of the artificial magnet is\nExperiments that of a horse shoe, such as fig. 3, having the two poles N, S brought near each other, and commonly united by a piece of soft iron or conductor. The horse-shoe magnets sometimes consist only of a single crooked bar; but they are frequently composed of several such bars united together by their flat surfaces, and inclosed in a leathern covering that envelopes all but the poles, and thus preserves the bars from rusting.\n\nInstead of the very arched form of which horse-shoe magnets are usually made, they are sometimes constructed so as to form nearly a semicircle, and in this shape they are very convenient for several experiments.\n\nArtificial magnets, like the natural, when of an oblong shape, are sometimes armed at each end, so as to enable them to apply both poles to a ferruginous body at the same time. One material advantage of the horse-shoe magnet is, that in such an armature is unnecessary, as the poles are brought so near each other as easily to be applied to the object it is proposed to lift, as a key, &c.\n\nA magnetic needle is an oblong piece of steel, tempered so as commonly to assume the blue tinge that is seen in watch-springs, and supported on a brass point, so as, when left at liberty, to arrange itself in the magnetic meridian, but in a horizontal position. These needles are sometimes made pointed at both extremities; sometimes the northern extremity is made in the form of a cross; but perhaps the best form is that of the oblong, with extremities that are nearly obtuse, such as is represented at fig. 4. To balance the needle on its pivot, it is furnished near its middle with a hollow cap, which is formed of some substance that is not attracted by the magnet. The cap is usually of brass; but for nice experiments it is sometimes made of agate, as this latter does not wear so fast as brass, and consequently the needle will longer retain its original suspension.\n\nThe dipping needle, fig. 5, consists of an oblong bar of steel, A.B., balanced between two horizontal slips of brass, C.D., C.D., so as when magnetized to form an angle with the horizon, equal to the dipping of the needle at the place where the instrument is made. The two horizontal slips of brass are either fixed to a graduated semicircle that is supported on a stand of wood, or more commonly they form diameters to a brass ring which is graduated on its circumference, and furnished with a ring H, by which it may be held on the finger.\n\nThe construction and uses of these instruments will be fully explained in the next chapter; our only object here being to bring the reader acquainted with the names and general form of the instruments that are made use of in the experiments which we are about to describe, for illustrating the principles of magnetism.\n\nSeveral smaller articles will be required by the experimentalist; but these are easily procured, and need no particular description. Such are a number of fewing needles of various sizes, soft iron bars, pieces of iron wire, small iron balls, iron filings, &c.\n\n**Chap. II. Experimental Illustrations of the Principles of Magnetism.**\n\n**Sect. I. Of Magnetic-Polarity.**\n\nWe have stated (No. 3.) that when a magnet is suspended at perfect freedom, it assumes a certain determinate position with respect to the astronomical meridian. This is but a particular case of a much more general fact, which may be expressed by the following proposition.\n\nIf an oblong piece of iron be so adjusted, as to be at liberty to take any position; it will assume a certain determinate direction with respect to the axis of the earth, differing according to the place where the experiment is made.\n\n**Experiment 1.—Take a moderately sized straight iron rod, as a piece of iron wire about the thickness of a goose quill, and about eight or ten inches long; pass it through one extremity of a large wine cork, so that it may be at right angles to the axis of the cork, and adjust it in such a manner that it may swing in water in a horizontal position. Now, provide a pretty large earthen vessel, as a hand basin or round deep dish, nearly filled with water; and when the water is free from agitation, cautiously put in the wire, in such a direction as not to be very far from the north and south line. The iron rod will, after some time, be found to have arranged itself so as, in Britain, to form an angle with the meridian of about 25 degrees.\n\nThis experiment requires some nicety, and it will sometimes be long before the iron assumes its proper position; but if due attention be paid to all the particulars above mentioned, it will at length arrange itself in the magnetic line. It is necessary that the rod should be placed not too far from the magnetic line, as if it be laid at right angles to that line, it will never acquire the proper direction. The situation of the rod in this experiment is in the true magnetic line, so far as respects the meridian; but, as it is horizontal, it is not in the position that a magnet would assume, if freely suspended by its centre of gravity. An iron rod may, however, be made to take such a position, as well as a magnet.\n\n**Exper. 2.—Instead of passing the iron rod through the extremity of a cylindrical or conical piece of cork, let it be passed through the centre of a spherical piece of cork or wood, so that the centre of gravity may coincide with the centre of the sphere, and let the whole be of such a specific gravity as to remain suspended in any part of the water, without ascending or descending. If the iron rod thus fitted be placed as in the last experiment, it will at length arrange itself in the true magnetic direction, so as to make an angle of about 25 degrees with the meridian, and with one extremity depressed below the horizon at an angle of about 73 degrees.\n\nThese experiments were contrived by Dr Gilbert, and fully shew that the property of assuming a determinate direction with respect to the earth's axis is not confined to magnets, or iron rendered magnetic by the usual processes. There is, however, a remarkable difference between the polarity of unmagnetized iron and that of natural and artificial magnets. It is of no consequence in the former which extremity be placed towards the north, or which below the surface of the water, as either will retain the position it first acquired, unless disturbed by agitation, or by the proximity of a magnet; and both extremities may easily be made to change situations. The effect produced on the iron is therefore temporary. But if a magnetic needle be freely\nfreely suspended, the same extremity always points towards the north, and this northern extremity always dips below the horizon, at least in these northern latitudes; and if the position of the needle be disturbed by mechanical motion, or by the application of a magnet, it will be restored when the disturbing cause is removed.\n\nThe polarity of magnets therefore is permanent.\n\nWe have said that the magnetic line varies at different times, and in different places. The declination of the magnet is so uncertain as to impose great impediments to the art of navigation, as it is necessary, in the course of a long voyage, frequently to ascertain the degree of variation for any particular time or place. The method of doing this is mentioned under Compass. The declination observed in different places at different times, has been laid down in tables; and as such tables are very useful, we shall here subjoin one, given by Mr Cavallo.\n\n| Latitude | Longitude | Declination | Years in which the observations were made |\n|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------------------------------|\n| North    | Weft.     | Easf.       |                                        |\n| 70° 17'  | 163° 24'  | 30° 21'     | 1779                                   |\n| 69° 38'  | 164° 11'  | 31° 0       | 1778                                   |\n| 66° 36'  | 167° 55'  | 27° 50'     |                                        |\n| 65° 43'  | 170° 34'  | 27° 58'     |                                        |\n| 63° 58'  | 165° 48'  | 26° 25'     |                                        |\n| 59° 39'  | 149° 8    | 22° 54'     |                                        |\n| 58° 14'  | 139° 19'  | 24° 40'     |                                        |\n| 55° 12'  | 135° 0    | 23° 29'     |                                        |\n| 53° 37'  | 134° 53'  | 20° 32'     |                                        |\n|          | Weft.     |             |                                        |\n| 50° 8    | 4° 40'    | 20° 36'     | 1776                                   |\n| 48° 44'  | 5° 0      | 22° 38'     |                                        |\n| 40° 41'  | 11° 10    | 22° 27'     |                                        |\n| 33° 45'  | 14° 50'   | 18° 7       |                                        |\n| 31° 8    | 15° 30'   | 17° 43'     |                                        |\n| 28° 30'  | 17° 0     | 14° 0       |                                        |\n| 23° 54'  | 18° 20'   | 15° 4       |                                        |\n| 20° 30'  | 20° 3     | 14° 35'     |                                        |\n| 19° 45'  | 20° 39'   | 13° 11'     |                                        |\n| 16° 37'  | 22° 50'   | 10° 33'     |                                        |\n| 15° 25'  | 23° 36'   | 9° 15'      |                                        |\n| 13° 32'  | 23° 45'   | 9° 25'      |                                        |\n| 12° 21'  | 23° 54'   | 9° 48'      |                                        |\n| 11° 51'  | 24° 5     | 8° 19'      |                                        |\n| 8° 55'   | 22° 50'   | 8° 58'      |                                        |\n| 6° 29'   | 20° 5     | 9° 44'      |                                        |\n| 4° 23'   | 21° 2     | 9° 1        |                                        |\n| 3° 45'   | 22° 34'   | 8° 27'      |                                        |\n| 2° 40'   | 24° 10'   | 7° 42'      |                                        |\n| 1° 14'   | 26° 2     | 5° 35'      |                                        |\n| 0° 51'   | 27° 10'   | 4° 59'      |                                        |\n| 0° 7     | 27° 0     | 4° 27'      |                                        |\n| South    |           |             |                                        |\n| 1° 13'   | 28° 58'   | 3° 12'      |                                        |\n| 2° 48'   | 29° 37'   | 2° 52'      |                                        |\n| 3° 37'   | 30° 14'   | 2° 14'      |                                        |\n| 4° 22'   | 30° 29'   | 2° 54'      |                                        |\n| 5° 0     | 31° 40'   | 1° 26'      |                                        |\n\nIt is of still more importance to know the progressive change of the declination at any certain place, and we shall therefore give here the following table of the declination as observed at London in different years, from 1576 to 1800.\n\n| Years | Declination | Observers |\n|-------|-------------|-----------|\n| 1576  | 11° 15'     | Burrowes. |\n| 1580  | 11° 11'     |           |\n| 1612  | 6° 10'      | Gunter.   |\n| 1622  | 6° 0        |           |\n| 1633  | 4° 6        | Gellibrand. |\n| 1634  | 4° 5        |           |\n| 1656  | 0° 0        | Bond.     |\n| 1665  | 1° 22° 1/2  | Gellibrand. |\n| 1666  | 1° 35° 1/2  |           |\n| 1672  | 2° 30'      | Halley.   |\n### Table of the Mean Monthly Variation of the Magnetic Needle for 20 Years at London\n\n| Years | January | February | March | April | May | June | July | August | September | October | November | December |\n|-------|---------|----------|-------|-------|-----|------|------|--------|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|\n|       |         |          |       |       |     |      |      |        |           |         |           |          |\n| 1786  | -

Trans. 1806. p. 416.*\nCharts have been constructed for shewing the declination of the needle in various parts of the earth by means of curve lines. Referring these charts and several other circumstances with regard to this subject, see Variation of the Compass.\n\nIt may not be improper here to point out the general method of applying the polarity of the magnet to the useful purposes of navigation, mining, &c.\n\nA mariner's compass, or magnetic needle in a case, is so placed as to be as little as possible disturbed by the motion of the vessel, person, &c. In a ship, it is placed in the binnacle (see Binnacle), or suspended from the upper deck in the cabin. Then the head of the vessel is kept by the helm in such a direction as to make any required angle with the line of the needle, or the person (in mining or travelling) advances in a similar manner. Thus, supposing that a vessel gets out from a certain part, in order to go to another place that is exactly westward of the former; as for example, from Land's End in Cornwall to Newfoundland on the coast of North America. The vessel must be directed in such a way, as that its course may be always at right angles with the direction of the magnetic needle, or so that the part of the needle or compass card, which points to the northward, (allowing for the variation) may be always kept to the right hand of the man at the helm, or to the starboard side of the vessel. The reason of this is evident; for, supposing the needle to point duly north and south, the direction of east and west being perpendicular to it, this must be the true course of the vessel. From this example, a little reflection will easily point out how a vessel may be steered in any other course.\n\nThe declaration of the magnetic needle is disturbed by the near approach of a ferruginous body, especially if this be of considerable size.\n\nOn holding the extremity of a pretty large iron rod, such as a poker, near one end of a magnetic needle properly suspended, the needle will be found to turn considerably from its usual direction. This circumstance, though proper to be mentioned here, will be better understood when we have considered the attractive power of the magnet. The fact is useful, as it teaches us to keep magnetic needles in such a situation as not to be acted on by any considerable body of iron.\n\nA magnet, whether natural or artificial, has a great effect in disturbing the polarity of a magnetic needle than is produced by iron.\n\nMagnetic polarity seems also to be affected by changes in the state of the atmosphere; and the following axioms respecting this effect on the declination of the needle, collected by M. la Cotte, are deserving of attention.\n\n1. The greatest declination of the needle from the north towards the west, takes place about two in the afternoon; and the greatest approximation of it towards the north, about eight in the morning; so that from the last mentioned hour till about two in the afternoon, it endeavours to remove from the north, and between two in the afternoon and the next morning, to approach it.\n\n2. The annual progress of the magnetic needle is as follows:—Between January and March, it removes from the north; between March and May it approaches it; in June it is stationary; in July it removes from it; in August, September, and October it approaches it; its declination in October is the same as in May; in November and December it removes from the north; its greatest western declination is at the vernal equinox, and its greatest approximation to the north, at the autumnal equinox.\n\n3. The declination of the magnetic needle is different, according to the latitude; among us, (i.e., in France) it has always increased since 1657; before that period it was easterly.\n\n4. Before volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, the magnetic needle is often subject to very extraordinary movements.\n\n5. The magnetic needle is agitated before and after the appearance of the northern lights: its declination on these occasions is about noon greater than usual.\n\nSo much has already been said respecting the phenomena, &c. of the dipping needle, under the article Dipping Needle, that it is unnecessary here to add much more on the subject. It was there noticed, that at the equator the dipping needle lies quite horizontal, and that one of its extremities inclines more towards the earth, according as the instrument is carried farther from the equator. We may here add, that from some late observations made by experimentalists with balloons, it appears that the higher we ascend above the surface,\n\n(A) In reply to some inquiries respecting the mode of employing the compass in mining, we were favoured by an ingenious friend, who is manager of one of the most extensive coalworks in this island, with the following remarks: \"The compass is used in all mines where great accuracy is required. In some coal-mines the cleats or faces of the coal are the guides to the miners in excavating the mine, and the compass is used to ascertain the situation and extent of the excavations. In other coal-mines the courses of the excavations are at first directed by the compass. In doing this, the compass is placed in a given situation, and is made to point the desired course. Then from the centre of one flight a perpendicular line is conveyed to the roof of the mine, and a small mark is there made with chalk; then a person looks at a candle (placed so as nearly to touch the roof), through the lower part of the flight of the compass nearest to him, and through the upper part of the opposite flight. The candle at the roof is moved in any direction until he sees it through both flights of the compass. It is then in a proper place, and a chalk mark is made in the roof immediately above it. A line struck with a chalked cord, between these two marks upon the roof, marks the proper course, by which the workmen are directed in making the excavation. By applying one part of a chalked cord along part of the course or white line thus begun on the roof, and extending the other part of the cord past it to any required distance, and then striking the cord, the course may be continued from time to time as the excavation advances.\"\nChap.

Trans. 1806. p. 419.\nTo what was said under Dipping Needle, respecting the construction of that instrument, we may add, that notwithstanding the great improvements that have been lately made in the arts, the making of a dipping needle is one of the most delicate and difficult tasks that an instrument-maker can undertake. The needle must be made of tempered steel which we are certain has no magnetism before it is touched; it must be polished so nicely, and with such a perfect coincidence of its centre of gravity and axis of motion, that it will retain any position (before being magnetized) that is given it. A good dipping needle cannot be had below twenty guineas.\n\nSect. II. On Magnetic Attraction and Repulsion.\n\nA magnet attracts iron, and all bodies, into the composition of which iron enters in any considerable degree. This principle is illustrated by very simple experiments, which will readily occur to every reader. It is of consequence here to observe, that the purer and softer the iron to which the magnet is presented, the stronger will be the attraction; thus, a magnet attracts a piece of soft and clean iron much more strongly than it attracts any other ferruginous body of the same shape and weight. Hard steel, or the harder ores of iron, are less forcibly attracted than soft steel, and still less than soft iron; and all pieces of iron are less forcibly attracted in proportion as they are more oxygenated.\n\nThe attractive power of a magnet is not equally strong on every part of its surface. It is most powerful at the poles of the magnet, and it is found to diminish in proportion as the part of the surface is more distant from the poles. Thus, in an oblong magnet, the attraction is least at about its middle, where it is often very trifling.\n\nIt is by this property of the magnet that we are enabled to discover the poles of a magnet, where they are not yet ascertained; a circumstance which is often necessary with respect to natural magnets, in which, when of an irregular shape, it would otherwise be difficult to discover the poles. The usual method of ascertaining the poles of a magnetic body is, to present various parts of the body to be examined, successively to the poles of a magnetic needle, when it will soon be discovered which parts of the body have most influence on the needle, by the pole of the latter standing perpendicularly to that part of the body. It will presently appear, that in this way it may also be ascertained which of these poles is the north, and which the south, as the fourth pole of the body under examination will have most influence on the north pole of the needle, and vice versa.\n\nA good magnet should have no more than two poles, and these should be situated in the extreme surface of the magnet; but it sometimes happens, especially in natural magnets, and in artificial magnetic bars, if they be very long, that there are more than two poles, or that the poles are very confused. For example, in a very long magnetized bar, there may be a strong north pole at one extremity, a fourth pole a little farther on, then a weaker north pole, and so on to the extremity, which will be found possessed of a still weaker south polarity. These poles are to be discovered by presenting to the several parts of the bar one or other of the poles of a magnetic needle; for, as we shall immediately mention, each pole of the needle will be attracted towards that part of the rod which is poled of the contrary polarity.\n\nThe attractive power of the magnet and the iron is most forcible when the two bodies are in contact, and it diminishes as they are made to recede from each other. The exact law according to which this diminution takes place, has not yet been completely ascertained. We shall see in the next chapter, what approximation has been made to it.\n\nA magnet is not capable of lifting above a certain weight of iron; and all magnets of the same form and size are not able to lift the same weight. Among the natural magnets, the smallest seem in general to possess a greater attractive power in proportion to their size, than those of larger dimensions. Mr Cavalli mentions a small magnet that weighed not more than 6 or 7 grains, and was capable of lifting about 300 grains; and Sir Isaac Newton poled a magnet that he wore in a ring, weighing but about 3 grains, which is said to have lifted 746 grains, or nearly 250 times its own weight. The larger natural magnets are very weak in proportion to these. Those of two pounds scarcely lift more than ten times their own weight. It seems extraordinary, that a piece cut off from a large magnet is sometimes much stronger in respect of its attractive power, than the magnet from which it was taken.\n\nIt has been said that the attractive power of magnets is greatest at their poles. Both poles, however, are seldom equal in this respect; and it appears, that in the northern parts of the world, the north pole of magnets is more powerful than the south. In the southern hemisphere the contrary effect is said to take place. The attractive power of the magnet is most forcible when both poles are made to act conjointly; hence an armed magnet, or one of the horse-shoe form, is best adapted for experiments on the force of magnetic attraction.\n\nIt is of little consequence whether the iron that is presented to the magnet be in one piece, or consist of several pieces. The attraction is indeed stronger in the former case; but if several pieces of iron are presented to the magnet, they will either all adhere about the pole of the magnet, or will adhere to each other, so as to form a sort of chain. If a small iron ball be made to adhere to the pole of a magnet, this ball will support a second; and this latter, if the magnet be pretty strong, will support a third. If the magnet be of the horse shoe form, and have these three balls hanging by one ball, if two others be suspended from the other pole, all the five may be made to adhere, so as to form a curved chain. It will be evident, that pieces of iron which present a greater extent of surface than the above spherical balls, will be more powerfully attracted.\n\nOne of the most pleasing experiments on the attraction of the magnet for iron, is shown by means of iron filings.\n\nExper.—Let a paper be placed above a bar magnet, and let iron filings be shaken on the paper through a gauze sieve. They will arrange themselves round the magnet in a very beautiful manner, forming curves and arches of curves, as represented in fig. 6. At the two ends of the magnet, as a a, there are chains of filings standing out nearly perpendicular; and along the sides they\nChap. II.\n\nMagnetism.\n\nExperiments—They form complete curves, bending outwards away from the magnet towards its middle, and having their extremities bounded by the poles of the magnet; and at the corners there are a number of arches that seem to form imperfect curves.\n\nA similar effect may be produced by firing iron filings on a piece of paper, so as to leave a vacancy in the middle, capable of receiving a bar magnet. When the magnet is placed on the paper, and the paper gently tapped, so as to agitate the filings, they will arrange themselves about the magnet, in curves, as above described.\n\nThe form of these curves will be better defined if the magnet be laid at the bottom of an earthen or glass vessel of water, and the iron filings be sifted over it so as to pass through the water.\n\nThe attraction between a magnet and a ferruginous body is mutual.\n\nExper.—Place a piece of iron or other ferruginous body upon a piece of cork or wood, so that it may float on the surface of water in an earthen or wooden vessel. Bring a magnet within a moderate distance of the floating body, and the latter will approach the former, and may be drawn by it in any direction. Again, place the magnet on cork or wood, so as to float on the water, and present to it a piece of iron, or other ferruginous body. The magnet will now approach the iron, and may be drawn by it as the iron was before. Lastly, Place both the magnet and the iron on separate pieces of wood or cork, within a moderate distance of each other, on the surface of the water. They will gradually approach each other, with a velocity that becomes greater in proportion as they approach nearer each other.\n\nMagnetic attraction is not sensibly impeded by the interposition of bodies of any kind, that do not contain iron in their composition.\n\nExper.—Suppose that a magnet, placed at the distance of an inch from a piece of iron, exerts a certain degree of attraction, it will be found that the attraction is not sensibly weakened by the interposition of a plate of glass, a fleck of paper, a piece of copper, or any other similar substance. A needle, inclosed in a glass globe, will be still attracted by the magnet.\n\nIt is not easy to ascertain correctly the degree of attractive force exerted between a magnet and a ferruginous body. The usual method of observing this is, to fasten a magnet to one arm of a balance, and placing the body to be attracted at different distances below the magnet, to counterpoise the attraction with weights placed in the opposite scale of the balance. Proceeding in this way, then, if we find that it requires the weight of an ounce to counterpoise the attractive power of a magnet, when presented immediately to a piece of iron, it will be found that it requires the same counterpoise, if a plate of any matter that is not ferruginous be interposed.\n\nNot only is iron attracted by the magnet, but under certain circumstances, one piece of iron exerts an attractive power on another piece of iron.\n\nExper.—Let an oblong piece of iron be fixed in a spherical piece of wood or cork, so as to float in water in the true magnetic line, as in Exper. 2. of No. 16. When the iron is nearly in the magnetical position, bring the extremity of a large iron rod, as the point of experiment new poker, holding it in a position not very different from that of the iron wire, within about a quarter of an inch of the upper extremity of the floating iron, and hold it there for some time, a little towards one side. The floating wire will gradually approach the iron rod with an accelerated motion, will at length touch it, and may be drawn through the water in any direction. A similar attraction will take place between the head of the poker and the extremity of the wire that is below the water.\n\nThe attractive power of the magnet is increased by the near approach of a piece of iron.\n\nExper. 1.—Suppose we have a magnetic bar that is capable of supporting a small key by one of its extremities, but which will not lift a key somewhat larger. If we bring a considerable oblong piece of iron near the opposite extremity of the bar, it will be found capable of supporting the larger key, or at least of lifting a weight somewhat greater than it sustained before.\n\nExper. 2.—Let an oblong magnetic bar be supported in a horizontal position, and let a piece of iron wire, about an inch in length, be hung by a short thread, so that its extremity is just opposite one of the poles of the magnetic bar, but so far out of the reach of the bar's attractive power as not to be brought from the perpendicular. Now, if a considerable iron bar be brought with one end within a moderate distance of the opposite pole of the magnet, the suspended wire will be drawn towards the magnet, thus shewing that the power of the latter has been increased by the juxtaposition of the bar of iron. If the bar of iron be brought still nearer the opposite pole of the magnet, the suspended wire will be drawn still nearer its adjacent pole; but if the bar of iron be drawn back from the magnet, the wire will fall into its original position.\n\nThis fact leads to many important practical conclusions in the management of magnets. As the juxtaposition of iron to the poles of a magnet improves its powers, we may infer, that if we keep a piece of soft iron in contact with the poles, the magnet will be improved by it; and this is in fact the case, and it shews the utility of the armature and conductor mentioned in No. 13. But of this more hereafter.\n\nThe attractive power of a magnet may be improved by increasing the weight appended to it.\n\nThis is best shown by a horse-hoe magnet, having a conductor of soft iron attached to its two poles, and a brass ring at the convex part by which it may be suspended. If a small bag be hung to the conductor, and if the magnet is capable of containing a certain weight at any particular time, it will, by adding a little more, suppose a few floz., to the bag, at moderate intervals, be made to support gradually a much greater weight. If the magnet, on a first trial, was able to lift a small key, it will soon be able to lift a larger one, &c. How far this increase of power may be carried, has not, we believe, yet been ascertained.\n\nIt sometimes happens that a magnet does not shew any great attractive power, as exemplified in its power of lifting a considerable weight of iron, though it may have a great effect in exciting or in altering magnetic polarity. This was observed by Dr Gilbert, who remarks\nMagnets marks that the directive power of a magnet extends farther than its attractive power.\n\nThe contrary poles of two magnets attract each other; that is, the north the south, and vice versa.\n\nExper. 1.—Place two oblong magnets on cork or wood, so as to float in water, or suspend each by a pretty long thread, with the north pole of the one opposed to the south pole of the other. They will gradually approach, and will at length rush together.\n\nA similar effect will be produced, if the north pole of a bar magnet be held near the south pole of a magnetic needle; the latter will be attracted, and the same thing will happen if the south pole of the bar is brought near the north pole of the needle.\n\nExper. 2.—Take two semicircular magnets, and dip their extremities into iron filings. The filings will of course adhere to the extremities of the magnets, and will appear as if radiating from them. Now, present the two magnets with their adhering filings to each other, so that the north and south pole of the one is opposite to the contrary poles of the other, and the iron filings at their extremities will approach each other, and coalesce, as represented in fig. 7.\n\nThe attraction exerted between two magnets is not so strong in proportion, as between a magnet and a piece of soft iron in contact; but it has been found to commence at a greater distance.\n\nThe corresponding poles of two magnets repel each other; that is, the north the north, and the south the south.\n\nExper. 1.—Make the two magnets float on water, or suspend them by threads, so that the north or south pole of the one may be opposite to the north or south pole of the other. They will recede from each other, and the repulsion will evidently be greater, in proportion as they are brought nearer together.\n\nExper. 2.—Take two semicircular magnets, and dip their ends in iron filings, as mentioned above. Present them to each other, so that their corresponding poles may be mutually opposed. The filings at their extremities will start back, and leave a vacancy between the opposed poles of the magnets, somewhat like what is represented in fig. 8.\n\nIt sometimes happens that the corresponding poles of two magnets do not repel each other, but either mutually attract, or are quite indifferent. In this case, it will, in general, be found that one of them is stronger than the other; and the reason of the phenomenon will appear hereafter.\n\nThe repulsive power of a magnet is generally in a less proportion than its attractive power.\n\nIt is by the attractive power of the magnet that we usually ascertain whether any substance be magnetic; that is, whether the magnet possesses any attractive power for it. If the body contain any considerable quantity of iron in its composition, its magnetism is easily ascertained, by approaching it with the pole of a pretty strong magnetic bar. If, however, the magnetism is too feeble to be discovered in this way, it may be ascertained by placing the body on a piece of cork or wood, so that it may float on the surface of water or mercury, in an earthen or wooden vessel, and bringing the pole of the magnet within a small distance of the floating body. It will sometimes be necessary to bring the magnet within one-tenth of an inch of the body, when, if it possesses any magnetism, it will gradually approach the magnet. This experiment is most satisfactory when the body to be examined is made to float on mercury; but in that case the vessel containing the mercury must not be too small, otherwise the natural convexity of the surface of the mercury will cause the floating body perpetually to fall down towards the sides of the vessel. A common soup plate will answer the purpose very well. It is also necessary that the mercury be very pure, and as clean as possible. To insure this, it will be proper, before using the mercury, to pass it through a conical piece of writing paper, rolled up so as to terminate in a very small aperture; or what is better, to squeeze it through a pretty thick piece of flannel leather. It need scarcely be remarked, that in these delicate experiments, the air of the room should be kept as still as possible.\n\nBy the above methods, Mr Cavallo and others discovered, that the following substances are in some measure affected by the magnet. Most metallic ores, especially after their having been exposed to a fire; zinc, bismuth, and particularly cobalt, as well as their ores, are almost always attracted. Of the earths, the calcareous is the least, if at all, and the filaceous is the most frequently attracted. The ruby, the chrysolite and the tourmaline, are attracted. The emerald, and particularly the garnet, are not only attracted, but frequently acquire a permanent polarity. The opal is weakly attracted, especially after combustion. Most animal and vegetable substances, after combustion, are attracted. Even dust, and the dust which usually falls upon whatever is left exposed to the atmosphere, are sensibly attracted by the magnet.\n\n\"It has long ago been remarked, that platinum, nickel, and several other bodies, acquire a sensible degree of experiments magnetism; but some philosophers attribute this property only to a portion of iron not easy to be separated, and conclude, that by obtaining a greater degree of purity, we might succeed in rendering them perfectly indifferent to the action of the magnetic bar.\n\n\"The new experiments which Citizen Coulomb has made and repeated before the institute, lead us on the contrary to think, that the action of magnetism extends through all nature; for none of the bodies he has yet tried was found to resist this power.\n\n\"But however real this action may be, it is not alike in all bodies, and in most of them it must be necessarily very small, to have escaped the attention of philosophers to this time. In order, therefore, to exhibit and to measure these results, we must begin by placing the bodies in a situation which shall allow them to yield to the weakest action.\n\n\"For this purpose, Citizen Coulomb fashioned his subjects into the form of a cylinder or small bar; and in this state he suspended them to a silk thread, such as is drawn from the silk worm's cone, and in this state he placed them between the opposite poles of two magnetic bars of steel. The single thread of silk could hardly bear the weight of a quarter of an ounce without breaking, consequently it became necessary to form small bars very light and thin. Citizen Coulomb made them about seven or eight millimetres in length (or less than half an inch), with three-fourths of a millimetre (or\nIn his experiments he placed the steel bars in the same right line, their opposite poles being five or six millimetres farther asunder than the length of the needle intended to oscillate between them. The result of the experiment showed, that whatever might be the substance of the needle, it always disposed itself according to the direction of the two bars; and that if they were turned from this direction, they always recovered it, after oscillations of which the number was often more than 30 per minute. It was therefore easy in every case to determine, from the weight and figure of the needle, the force which had produced the oscillation.\n\nThese experiments were successfully made with small needles of gold, silver, copper, lead, tin, small cylinders of glass, a piece of chalk, a fragment of bone, and different kinds of wood.\n\nCitizen Coulomb has proved, that the force of torsion of the silk thread is so slight, that in order to draw it round the entire circle, it would require a force scarcely equal to the one hundred thousandth part of a gramme (or about one seven hundredth part of a grain). A quantity so minute cannot therefore sensibly derange the measure of magnetic force in the different bodies; and its effect, even if it were admitted to be of perceptible magnitude, may also be urged in proof of the general conclusion of Citizen Coulomb, because the magnetic power must overcome this resistance of the thread in order to manifest itself. Our author gives, in the third volume of the Memoirs of Natural Philosophy and Mathematics of the National Institute, a very simple formula to determine the magnetic force of a body from the time of its oscillations; and he means to shew in another memoir, the method of determining this result in different bodies of the same figure placed between the poles of two bars. He thinks it now proved, that all the elements which enter into the composition of our globe are subjected to the magnetic power, and that the whole mass collectively forms one single magnet.\n\nIn favour of those who might be desirous of repeating his experiments, and rendering them very sensible, the author remarks, that the method of succeeding consists in diminishing the size of the oscillating bodies. From some essays, of which the results terminate this memoir, it seems to follow, that the accelerating forces are inversely as the masses, or very nearly in the direct proportion of the surfaces; but Citizen Coulomb gives this rule only as a first deduction, which requires to be confirmed.\n\nThe opinion of the general influence of magnetism on all terrestrial bodies was, as we shall see hereafter, maintained by our countryman Dr Gilbert, though Coulomb has certainly the merit of having put it to the test of experiment.\n\nBesides the experiments which we have related, there are some that depend on the attractive power of the magnet, and which are ranked among scientific amusements. We shall here describe a few of these.\n\nBefore we relate the manner of making these experiments, it may be proper to describe an instrument that is employed in some of them. This, from its form and apparent use, is called the magnetic perspective glass, and is thus constructed.\n\nProvide an ivory tube about 2½ inches long, and of such a form as is expressed in fig. 9. The sides of this tube must be so thin as to admit a considerable quantity of light. It is to open at one end with a screw, and at that end must be placed an eye-glass of about two inches focus, and at the other end any glass you please. Have a small magnetic needle like that in a compass. It must be strongly touched, and so placed at the bottom of the tube that it may turn freely round. It is to be fixed on the centre of a small ivory circle C, of the thickness of a counter, placed on the object-glass D, and painted black on the side next it. This circle must be kept fast by a circular rim of pasteboard, that the needle may not rise off its pivot, in the same manner as in the compass. This tube will thus become a kind of compass sufficiently transparent to show the motions of the needle. The eye-glass serves more clearly to distinguish the direction of the needle, and the glass at the other end, merely to give the tube the appearance of a common perspective glass. It will appear, from what has been already stated, that the needle in this tube, when placed over and at a small distance from a magnet, or any machine in which it is contained, will necessarily place itself in a position directed by that magnet, and consequently show where the north and south pole of it is placed; the north end of the needle constantly pointing to the south end of the magnet. This effect will take place, though the magnet be enclosed in a case of wood, or even metal. You must observe, however, that the attracting magnet must not be very far distant from the needle, especially if it be small, as in that case its influence extends but to a short distance. This tube may be differently constructed, by placing the needle in a perpendicular direction, on a small axis of iron, on which it must turn quite freely, between two small plates of brass placed on each side of the tube; the two ends of the needle should be in exact equilibrium. The north and south ends of the needle will, in like manner, be attracted by the south and north ends of the magnetic bar. The former construction, however, appears preferable, as it is more easily excited, and the situation of the needle much more easily distinguished.\n\nExp. 1. The communicative Piece of Money.\n\nTake a crown or dollar, and drill a hole in the side of it, in which place a piece of wire, or a large needle-like piece well polished, and strongly touched with a magnet of money. Then close the hole with a small piece of pewter, that it may not be perceived. Now, the needle in the magnetic perspective before described, when it is brought near to this piece of money, will fix itself in a direction corresponding to the wire or needle in that piece. Desire any person to lend you a crown piece or dollar, which you dexterously change for one that you have prepared as above. Then give the latter piece to another person, and leave him at liberty either to put it privately in a small box, or not; he is then to place the box on a table, and you are to tell him by means of your glasses, whether the crown is or is not in the box. Then bringing your perspective close to the box, you will know, by the motion of the needle, whether it be there or not; for as the needle in the perspective will always\nMagnetism.\n\nExp. 2. The Magnetic Table.\n\nUnder the top of a common table place a magnet that turns on a pivot, and fix a board under it, that nothing may appear. There may also be a drawer under the table, which you pull out to show that there is nothing concealed. At one end of the table there must be a pin that communicates with the magnet, and by which it may be placed in different positions; this pin must be so placed as not to be visible to the spectators. Strengthen some steel filings or very small nails over that part of the table where the magnet is. Then ask any one to lend you a knife or a key, which will then attract part of the nails or filings. Then placing your hand in a careless manner on the pin at the end of the table, you alter the position of the magnet, and giving the key to any person, you desire him to make the experiment, which he will then not be able to perform. You then give the key to another person, at the same time placing the magnet, by means of the pin, in the first position, when that person will immediately perform the experiment.\n\nExp. 3. The Mysterious Watch.\n\nYou desire any one in company who has a watch with a steel balance, (B) to lend it you for a few minutes, asking him whether it will continue to go when laid on the table. He will probably say it will. To prove to him that he is wrong, you lay it on that part of the table below which you have previously placed a strong bar-magnet (as in Exp. 2.), so that the watch may be above one of the poles. It will immediately stop. Now, if you shift the position of the magnet, and give the watch to another person to lay it on the table, it will not stop, but replacing the magnet, and desiring a third person to try the experiment, he will succeed. All this, to those who are not acquainted with the secret, will appear very extraordinary.\n\nExp. 4. The Magnetic Dial.\n\nProvide a circle of wood or ivory, of about five or six inches diameter, as fig. 10, which must turn quite free on the stand B (fig. 11.), in the circular border A: on the circle must be placed the dial of pasteboard C (fig. 10.), whose circumference is to be divided into 12 equal parts, in which must be inscribed the numbers from 1 to 12, as on a common dial. There must be a small groove in the circular frame D, to receive the pasteboard circle; and observe that the dial must be made to turn so freely that it may go round without moving the circular border in which it is placed. Between the pasteboard circle and the bottom of the frame, place a small artificial magnet E (fig. 12.) that has a hole in its middle, or a small protuberance. On the outside of the frame place a small pin P, which serves to show where the magnetic needle I, that is placed on a pivot at the centre of the dial, is to stop. This needle must turn quite freely on its pivot, and its two sides should be in exact equilibrium. Then provide a small bag, that has five or six divisions, like a lady's work-bag, but smaller. In one of these divisions put small square pieces of pasteboard on which are written the numbers from 1 to 12, and if you please you may put several of each number. In each of the other divisions you must put 12 or more like pieces, observing, that all the pieces in each division must be marked with the same number. Now the needle being placed upon its pivot, and turned quickly about, it will necessarily stop at that point where the north end of the magnetic bar is placed, and which you previously knew by the situation of the small pin in the circular border. You therefore prefer to any person that division of the bag which contains the several pieces on which is written the number opposite to the north end of the bar, and tell him to draw any one of them he pleases. Then placing the needle on the pivot, you turn it quickly about, and it will necessarily stop, as we have already said, at that particular number.\n\nAnother experiment may be made with the same dial, by desiring two persons to draw each of them one number out of two different divisions of the bag; and if their numbers, when added together, exceed 12, the needle or index will stop at the number they exceed it; but if they do not amount to 12, the index will stop at the sum of those two numbers. In order to perform this experiment, you must place the pin against the number 5, if the two numbers to be drawn from the bag be 10 and 7; or against 9, if they be seven and two. If this experiment be made immediately after the former, as it easily may, by dexterously moving the pin, it will appear the more extraordinary.\n\nExp. 5. The Divining Circles.\n\nOn the top of a thin box, as A.B fig. 13., paste two divining circles drawn on paper, as F, G, each of which is divided into compartments. In those of one circle, as G, are written questions, and in those of the other, as F, appropriate answers. Through the centre of the circle G an axle passes, carrying a toothed wheel, and which works into the pinion d, to the axis of which is fixed another pinion, and this receives the teeth of another wheel g, whose axis is passed through the centre of the circle F. On the axis of the wheel e is to be fixed an index a above the paper circle, and to the axis of the wheel g just below the cover of the box, is fixed a bar magnet q q, turning together with the axis; while on the part of the axis that projects above the circle F a loose needle xx is balanced, so as to move independently of the axis. A carton of strong paper, of the size\n\n(b) The balance of a watch is sometimes, though very seldom, made of brass, when it is scarcely susceptible of magnetic influence.\nChap. II.\n\nMagnetism.\n\nExperimen- of F should cover the pasted circle, and turn easily on tal Illustra- the centre 2; and it should have a triangular piece as tions. F cut out, in order to see the answers. If now the needle be taken off its point, and a person be desired to ask some of the questions on the circle G, the index must be turned to the question, and then the needle placed on its pivot, giving it a whirl round. When it flops, its point will stand over the proper answer, which may be seen by turning the open part of the carton to that place.\n\nSect. III. Of the Communication and Production of Magnetism.\n\nThe whole of this important part of the subject may be said to depend on one general fact, which we shall therefore first lay down and illustrate.\n\nAny piece of iron when in the neighbourhood of a magnet, is itself a magnet, and possesses all the material properties of that body.\n\nEx. 1. Let there be a large and strong magnet properly supported in the horizontal direction, at a distance from iron or other similar bodies, and with its poles perfectly free. Take also any small piece of common iron, not more than two or three inches long, such as a common small key, and take another piece of iron, as a smaller key, or short piece of wire about the size of a goose quill.\n\nIn the first place hold the key in a horizontal position, with one end opposite one of the poles of the magnet, but so as not to be in contact with it. Then bring the other piece of iron to the other end of the key, and it will hang by the key, and will so continue to hang, though we withdraw the key from the magnet horizontally, till there is a certain interval between the key and the magnet, when the former will be no longer able to support the piece of iron. Even at this distance the key will, however, be found capable of supporting a piece of iron considerably smaller than the former, till its distance from the magnet be increased.\n\nAgain, hold the key with one extremity below one of the poles of the magnet, and touch the other extremity with the small piece of iron, the latter will adhere till the key be removed too far below the magnet.\n\nThirdly, Hold the key with one of its extremities above one of the poles of the magnet, but at such a distance that there is room for the small piece of iron to go between the key and the magnet, without touching the latter. The piece of iron will be supported by the key, as in the two former instances.\n\nFourthly, Let the magnet be placed in a vertical position, and hold the key with one extremity immediately below or above one of the poles. The piece of iron will be supported in a similar manner, in the former case by the extremity of the key that is most remote from the magnet, and in the latter by that which is adjacent.\n\nIf, instead of approaching the magnet with the key, we reverse the circumstances, the effect of the magnet in rendering the key magnetic will be still more evident. Suppose the piece of iron to be lying on the table; let one end of it be touched with the key, and there will be found no attraction between them; but if while we hold the key very near one extremity of the wire, we bring the pole of the magnet near the other end of the key, we shall see the wire rise from the table, and adhere to the key.\n\nIn all these cases the attractive power of the key, that is, its magnetism, is evidently derived from its juxtaposition to the magnet.\n\nExp. 2. Let two pieces of iron wire be suspended by separate ends of a piece of thread, so that they may be hung from a pin in the wall in a situation parallel to each other, or in contact. Now bring one end of a bar magnet a little below the wires, and they will repel each other. If these wires are of soft iron, they will collapse immediately on the magnet being withdrawn; but if they are formed of hard iron or of steel, they will continue apart for a considerable time.\n\nHere the two wires are, by the proximity of the magnet, become magnets, and the extremities next the bar have each acquired a similar polarity, i.e., both contrary to that of the adjacent pole of the bar. They, therefore, repel each other.\n\nExp. 3. Let a bar-magnet, such as N, S, fig. 14, be laid in a horizontal position, and let a small key, as B, C, be held near the north pole of the magnet, in the direction of its axis. Let a very small magnetic needle, supported on a sharp pivot, be brought near that end of the key C, which is most remote from N. The needle will immediately turn its south pole towards C, as is indicated by the feathered part of the arrow c. Hence it appears that the key has acquired a directive power like a magnet, and that its remote extremity performs the office of a north pole, as it attracts the south pole of the needle, and repels its north pole. If it be said that the magnetic needle in this case is affected directly by the directive power of the magnet, as it would take the above position though the key were not present; to show that the effect is produced through the medium of the key, remove the needle into another situation as b, and it will still arrange itself with the same pole opposite C, and if it be carried to the proximate extremity of the key, as at a, it will turn round, and present its north pole to B, thus shewing that it is, at least in some measure, influenced by the key.\n\nIn general, when a piece of iron is presented to the nearest end of a magnet, the extremity next that pole is possessed of the contrary polarity, and the remote extremity has acquired a similar polarity. The situation of that of the poles, however, depends much on the form of the adjacent piece of iron, and on the part of its surface which is presented to the pole of the magnet. If the form be that of an oblong bar, one extremity of which is presented to the pole, which is the most usual case, the circumstances will be as we have just mentioned. If the oblong bar be presented to the pole in a perpendicular direction, with its middle very near the pole of the magnet, this middle point will be possessed of a polarity contrary to that of the adjacent pole, while the two extremities have acquired the same polarity. If the presented iron be in the form of a circular plate, and its centre be held near the pole of the magnet, this centre will have the contrary polarity, and every point of the circumference the same polarity. If the plate have its circumference fashioned into points, each of these points will acquire a very strong polarity, contrary to that of the pole near which the centre of the plate is held.\n\nThe communication of magnetic power from the magnet...\nExperiment—magnet to the key in the foregoing experiments, will be still more strongly illustrated by holding another piece of wire to the wire that is already suspended by the key. The new piece of wire will also be suspended, and so several more may be suspended by one another, like the links of a chain, according to the strength of the magnet. This fact was known to the ancients, who speak of a loadstone causing an iron ring to carry another ring; and that a third, till the whole puts on the appearance of a chain.\n\nIt will be found that the magnet has lost none of its power by producing magnetism in the iron, and of course, that nothing has been transferred from the magnet to the iron. The magnetism of the iron thus caused by its juxtaposition to a magnet is called induced magnetism, or magnetism by induction.\n\nThere is an apparent exception to the universality of the above proposition. If the key be held in such a position as that it shall be perpendicular to the magnet, with one extremity either opposite one of the poles, or a little above the centre of the magnet, the bit of wire will not be attracted by that extremity, and we may hence suppose that the key has acquired no magnetic power by its proximity to the magnet. But if we bring a needle or a piece of iron wire near its remote end, it will be strongly attracted, and shew that end to have the same polarity with the nearest pole of the magnet. Now, the ends both of the key and the wire that are next the magnet, having the same polarity with the pole of the magnet nearest them, cannot attract each other, but on the contrary will repel each other, and therefore the wire cannot adhere to the key, though by the change produced by the other extremity, it is evident that the key has acquired magnetic power.\n\nThere is, however, one exception. If the key in the first experiment, with the wire hanging to it, be carried from any of the situations there described, towards the middle of the magnet, the wire will fall off as soon as it arrives very near the middle. If we suppose a plane to pass through the centre of the magnet in a direction perpendicular to its axis, so as to form the magnetic equator, a slender piece of iron held anywhere within this plane can acquire no sensible magnetism, which is demonstrated by its shewing no signs of polarity, and not being attracted by the magnet. Now it is well known that the greatest activity of a magnet resides in its two poles, and that those magnets are the best in which this activity is least diffused. A certain circumference of every magnet is entirely inactive, as we see in the experiment with the iron filings described in No. 26, where the filings collect themselves principally on two points of the surface, between which there is a space all round, to which no filings are attached. Many circumstances shew that the two poles of a magnet have contrary actions; the north pole producing a strong northern polarity in the remote end of an iron bar brought near it, and a south polarity in the proximate end, while an opposite effect is produced by its south pole. Now, adopting this principle, that the actions of the two poles are opposite, it follows that if these actions are equal, and act in a similar manner, each must counteract and prevent the action of the other, and produce what may be called a magnetic equilibrium. Therefore if a slender iron rod or thin plate be placed so that every part of it lies within the magnetic equator, it will exhibit no magnetism, will not be attracted by the magnet, and will not attract iron. This will be seen more satisfactorily when we have explained the theory of magnetism.\n\nThe consideration of the above important facts will enable us to explain, especially after what will be stated in the next chapter, the production or communication of magnetism in all the methods by which these are usually effected.\n\nMagnetism may be produced artificially in a piece of iron or steel, by various methods.\n\n1. By touching the iron or steel either with a natural magnet, or with a steel bar already magnetized.\n\nThe process of communicating magnetism by natural or artificial magnets, or by what has been called touching, has undergone various improvements and modifications, which we shall endeavour briefly to trace.\n\nThe most simple method of magnetizing a bar of steel is to apply the north pole of a magnet to that extremity of the bar which we wish to acquire a south polarity. In this way, merely by contact, a slight degree of magnetic power will, after some time, be imparted to the bar, and the communication will be expedited by striking the bar so as to make it sound. Only a slight degree of magnetism can, however, be communicated in this way, and unless the steel bar be very short, its poles will be much confused.\n\nAnother method of communicating magnetism to a bar of this kind is, to apply the pole of a magnet to one end of the bar, and pass it on to the other end, giving a moderate degree of pressure. This is repeated several times on both sides of the bar, taking care always to begin the stroke at the same end as at first, and instead of drawing the magnet back along the bar, lifting it up every time that we come to the other end. The following description will best explain the mode of communicating magnetism in this way, by one or two magnetic bars.\n\nWhen only one magnetic bar is to be made use of, one of its poles must be applied as represented fig. 15, where CD represents the needle or steel bar to be impregnated. The magnet AB is then to be drawn all along the surface of it, till it reaches the extremity D. The magnet being then removed, must be applied to the extremity C, and drawn over the needle as before. Thus the needle must be rubbed several times, by which means it will acquire a considerable degree of magnetism. In this method, the other extremity of the needle which the magnet touched last acquires the contrary magnetism; that is, if B be the north pole of the magnet, C will be the north pole and D the south of the needle. This method, however, is never found to be equally effectual with that in which two magnets, or both poles of one magnet, are made use of.\n\nTo communicate magnetism by means of two magnetic bars, place the bar or needle AB, fig. 16, upon a table; then set the two magnetic bars CD, EF, straight upright upon it at a little distance, equal on both sides from the middle of the bar AB, and in such a manner that the south pole D of one of the bars may be nearest to that end of the bar AB which is to become the north pole, &c. These two bars must then be slid gradually towards one extremity of the bar, keeping them constantly at the same distance from each other; and when one of them, for instance CD, is arrived\nChap. II.\n\nMagnetism.\n\nExperiments rived at A, then they must be tried in the contrary way, till EF arrives at B; and thus the bar AB must be rubbed a greater or smaller number of times, till it will be found by trial to have acquired a considerable power. When the magnetic bars are powerful, and the bar AB of very good steel, and not very large, a dozen of strokes are fully sufficient; but when the bars are to be removed from the bar AB, care must be taken to bring them to the same situation where they were first placed; viz. a little and equal distance from the middle of the bar AB, from which they may be lifted up.\n\nThe mode of employing two bars instead of one was an improvement, and the method was still farther improved by placing them in an inclined position, with their extremities C, E, remote from each other, and sliding them contraryways from the middle towards each extremity of the bar AB, lifting them up when they come to the extremities, and replacing them on the middle of the bar, thus repeating the operation as often as required.\n\nHorsehoe bars, or those of a semicircular form, may be magnetized in a similar manner, except that the magnetic bars employed for the purpose must follow the curvature of the bar to be impregnated. The following is the method usually employed for magnetizing bars of this kind. The crooked bar is laid flat upon a table, and to each of its extremities is applied a straight magnetic bar, as DF, EG, fig. 17. and the remote extremities of these bars F, G, are joined by the conductor or piece of soft iron FG. Then to its middle are to be applied two magnetic bars, with their opposite poles at a little distance from each other, H, I, and with these the crooked bar is to be stroked from end to end, following the direction of the crooked bar, so that on one side of it the magnetic bars may stand in the direction represented by the dotted lines at K and L. When in this manner the piece of steel ABC has been rubbed a sufficient number of times on the one side, it is to be turned, and the same operation repeated on the other side, taking care that the adhering magnetic bars, and the conductor of soft iron, be preserved in the same situation as at first. It must be observed that in this process the magnets DF, DG, as well as the magnets HI, must be placed so that their south poles shall be towards that extremity of the bar which is to be made a north pole.\n\nA material improvement in the process for communicating magnetism from artificial magnets to steel bars, was introduced by Duhamel. He formed a right-angled parallelogram, two of the sides of which were made by two equal bars of steel, that were intended to be magnetized, while the other two were formed by joining the extremities of the steel bars by two pieces of soft iron, also equal to each other in length, but much shorter than the steel bars. Then taking two parcels of bars already magnetized, he brought together their opposite poles towards the middle of one of the steel bars forming the parallelogram, and inclining the parcels as in fig. 18. he made them glide gently, separating them from each other towards the extremities of the bar; and this operation was repeated as often as required, when the inclined parcels of magnetic bars were carried to the opposite bars of the parallelogram, and this was rubbed in a similar manner. After the bars were rubbed sufficiently on one side, they were, as in former experiments, turned on the other.\n\nThis method is one of the best that we can employ for magnetizing the needles of compasses, and such steel bars as are of moderate thinness, especially if we employ magnetic bars strongly impregnated for the purpose of rubbing the steel bars.\n\nMuch about the time that M. Duhamel contrived the above method, the same object was employed by Mr Mitchell, where the process of magnetizing bars was much improved by Mr Mitchell and Mr Canton.\n\nMr Mitchell employed two parcels of bars already strongly magnetized, joined together in a parallel direction, with their opposite poles united at each extremity, but in such a manner, that there remained between the two parcels a small interval. He then placed a number of equal steel bars in a straight line, and made one extremity of the magnetized bars slide over the line formed by the steel bars at right angles; and this he repeated as usual. In this way he found that the intermediate bars in the straight line acquired a great degree of magnetic power.\n\nMr Canton placed the bar which he wished to magnetize, so as to form part of a parallelogram, as in the method of M. Duhamel, and then employed the same means as Mr Mitchell for impregnating the bar, after which he separated the two parcels of magnets, and inclining them to each other in the manner of Duhamel upon the bar, he made them slide from the needle towards the extremities. This last method considerably augmented, according to Mr Canton, the magnetic power of the bar; but by Coulomb it is considered as the only effectual part of the process. These methods of Mitchell and Canton constitute what has been called the double touch, which was still farther improved by the celebrated Æpinus.\n\nThis philosopher, after having formed a parallelogram with steel bars, and pieces of soft iron, in the manner of Duhamel, placed upon the bar to be magnetized, two parcels of magnetic bars inclined in such a way that each of them formed on its own side an angle of 15° or 20° with the steel bar on which it was placed; their opposite poles being at a very small distance from one another. Keeping the parcels of magnetic bars in the same relative situation with respect to each other, he made both parcels slide along alternately from the middle of the bar towards each extremity, beginning at every renewal of the operation from the middle of the bar. This method has a very great advantage over the former, as by it we may magnetize bars of considerable length and thickness, by means of magnetic bars that have no great magnetic power.\n\nIn all these processes it must be remarked, that, in order to proceed properly, it is necessary to employ a considerable degree of pressure. A parallelogram of steel bars and soft iron should be kept firm by wedges, somewhat in the manner of printers types, and the extremities of the magnetic bars should be perfectly cleaned. Dr Robison supposed, that wetting these extremities considerably aided the process; but he found that the least particle of oil between the bars greatly obstructed it, as did the smallest piece of the thinnest gold leaf. He found that bars which were rough acquired a more powerful\npowerful magnetism than those which were moderately polished; but that, if moderately rough, they acquired the first degrees of magnetism more expeditiously than smooth bars, but did not receive so strong an impregnation as the latter.\n\nThe method of making artificial magnets has been greatly improved by M. Coulomb, who in a series of memoirs, printed in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, and of the National Institute of Paris, has communicated a number of valuable observations and experiments that have contributed, perhaps more than any preceding labours, to the advancement both of the theory and practice of magnetism. Many years ago he published his process for making very powerful artificial magnets.\n\nIn his operations he uses four very strong magnets previously impregnated. He placed his strongest magnets, (as NS, NS, fig. 19.) on an horizontal plane in one right line, at such a distance that they might be a few lines nearer to each other than the length of the needle NS intended to be magnetized. He afterwards took the two magnets NS', and inclining them as in the method of Æpinus, he placed them first on the middle of the needle, or with their poles nearly in contact. He then drew each magnet, without changing its inclination, to the extremity of the needle, and repeated this operation 5 or 6 times on each face of the needle. It is clear, that in this operation the poles of the needle NS remain fixed and invariable at the extremities of the needle, by means of the two strong magnets NS on which it rests. The effect produced by these can only be augmented by the action of the two superior magnets, which concur in magnetizing all the particles of the needle in the same direction.\n\nHe found likewise, that in this method of magnetizing there is a greater certainty of giving to both surfaces of needles intended to determine the magnetic meridian, an equal degree of magnetism; a circumstance deserving of the greatest attention in the construction of compasses, if the needle be suspended with its broadest surface parallel to the horizon.\n\nAfter these previous processes, he took 30 bars of steel hardened and tempered to the temper of a spring, five or six lines broad, two or three lines thick, and 36 inches long. The blades of fencing foils, such as are found in the shops, make pretty good magnets. English sheet steel cut into pieces one inch wide, hardened and lowered to spring temper, is preferable. When each compound magnet is to contain no more than 15 or 20 pounds of steel, it is sufficient to make the bars 30 or 36 inches long.\n\nHe magnetized each bar singly, according to the method already described. He then took two rectangular parallelopipeds of very soft iron, well polished, six inches in length, between 20 and 24 lines broad, and 10 or 12 lines thick. With these two parallelopipeds, represented fig. 20. at N and S, he formed the armour of his magnet by enveloping one extremity of each parallelopipedon with a stratum of his magnetic bars, so that the extremities of the parallelopipeds may project beyond the extremities of the bars 20 or 24 lines, and the other end may be enveloped by the ends of the set of bars. On this first layer of steel bars of three or four lines thick he places a second, three inches shorter than the first, so that the first projects beyond the second about 18 lines on each side. The whole is secured at the ends by two binding pieces of copper, which preserves the bars close together, and prevent the armour from escaping.\n\nFig. 20. represents two artificial magnets composed according to the method just described. N and S are the extremities of the two iron parallelopipeds. The two other extremities are inclosed by the bars. Each magnet thus compounded is solidly connected together by the copper pieces marked a, b, c, d'. The pieces of contact A, R, join the opposite poles of the magnets.\n\nHe found by experience, that with an apparatus of this form, each part weighing 15 or 20 lbs. a force of 80 or 100 lb. will be required to separate the pieces of contact; and that when an ordinary needle of the compass is placed on the two extremities of the compound bars, fig. 20., they become magnetized to saturation, without being rubbed with the upper pair. When magnets of greater force are desired, it is necessary, in proportion as the number of bars is increased, to augment their length also, and the dimensions of the parallelopipeds of iron which serve for the armour. It would be easy to ascertain the different dimensions which the magnets ought to have, in a manner sufficiently accurate for practice, from the laws of magnetism, and the position of the centre of action of the bars of steel of different lengths and thicknesses.\n\n2. Iron or steel is rendered magnetical by being placed in a position corresponding to the magnetic meridian.\n\nIt has been often observed, that a bar of iron which has stood for a long time exactly or nearly in the magnetic direction, has acquired a degree of magnetic power, the extremities possessing opposite polarity. In this and other northern parts of Europe, old vanes of turrets, window bars, and even pokers that have stood long inclined in the chimney corner, are often very feebly magnetic, their lower extremity becoming a north, and the upper a south pole. In the highest part of the fleepole of St Giles's church in Edinburgh, on the north side, the upper bar of a hand-rail leading to a stair is very magnetical. It is worthy of remark, that those parts of such old bars which have become foliated and crumbly by exposure to the air are the most magnetical. This magnetic state of perpendicular iron bars was, as we are informed by Dr Gilbert, first observed in the vane spindle of the Augustine church at Mantua.\n\n3. A bar of steel long hammered or exposed to violent friction, while lying in the magnetic meridian, becomes magnetic.\n\nThis fact was well known to Dr Gilbert, who in a plate represents a blacksmith hammering a bar of steel in the magnetic position. Many smiths tools, such as long drills, that receive great pressure while in motion, broaches that are worked with a long lever, so as to act very fast, become very feebly magnetical; the lower end, in these latitudes, being always a north pole. When a steel punch is driven hard into a piece of iron, the punch has sometimes been rendered magnetical by a single blow. There is scarcely a cutting or boring tool in a smith's shop that does not possess some degree of magnetic power. Even soft steel and iron will acquire it by being violently twisted or exposed to great friction, and the magnetism thus acquired\nMagnetism.\n\nExperiments required is commonly permanent. From this circumstance it is difficult to procure for nice experiments pieces of iron that do not possess some degree of magnetism, and hence these experiments do not always succeed. It is therefore convenient to know how to deprive iron and steel of magnetism, and the method of doing this will appear from what will be said in the next section.\n\nThe steel balances of watches are often magnetic, sometimes even shewing evident polarity; a circumstance which is found to have some effect in disturbing the proper going of such watches or time-pieces. Hence it is recommended to make the balances of brass. See a paper on this subject by Mr Varley, in the first volume of the Philosophical Magazine.\n\n4. Magnetism may be induced on substances that are susceptible of it, by heat.\n\nDr Gilbert remarks that such ores of iron as are in that particular metallic state, which he considers as most susceptible of magnetism, will acquire this power by being kept long in a red heat, while in a magnetic direction; and that their polarity corresponds to their position, that end of the mass which is opposite the north becoming a north pole. By many experiments made both by Dr Gilbert, and since his time by Dr Hooke, on iron and steel bars, it appears that these acquire permanent magnetism by being exposed to a strong heat, and suffered to cool gradually while lying in the magnetic direction; but that the magnetism thus acquired by steel rods is much stronger and more durable, if they are suddenly quenched with cold water, so as to give them a very hard temper. Dr Hooke found that the end of the bar next the north, or the lower end of a vertical bar, always became its permanent north pole, and the upper end, even when quenched, while the rest was suffered to cool gradually, became a very sensible south pole. If these operations were performed on bars placed in a position at right angles to the magnetic direction, no magnetism was acquired. Dr Gilbert makes a remarkable observation respecting the position of a magnetic needle brought near an ignited bar of iron, which was some years ago repeated in the Philosophical Transactions as a new discovery. \"Bacillum ferreum, validis ignitione appone veriora excitò: flat veriorum, nec ad tale ferrum convertitur: sed flatim ut primum de candore aliquantulum remissìri, confluit illuc.\" Thus it appears that iron is not susceptible of magnetism when red-hot, but that it acquires magnetic power during its cooling. Dr Gilbert ascertained the degree of heat most favourable to the production of magnetism, but from his want of proper thermometers he did not succeed. Dr Robison found that though a bright red or a white heat does not make iron susceptible of magnetism while it is exposed to such a heat, it predisposes it for becoming magnetical. He found that when a bar of steel was made to acquire magnetism by being tempered in the magnetic direction, the acquired magnetism was much stronger when the bar was first made very hot, even though allowed to acquire its most magnetical state before being quenched, than if it had been heated only to this latter degree. Nay, he always found it stronger if quenched while red hot.\n\nHe also found that when he heated a small steel bar red-hot, and quenched it while lying between two magnets, it acquired a much stronger magnetic power than it would acquire in any other way.\n\nMr Canton contrived the following method of producing magnetism in steel bars, without the assistance either of natural or artificial magnets.\n\nTake twelve bars, six of soft, and six of hard steel, the former three inches long, one-fourth of an inch broad, and one-twentieth of an inch thick; with two pieces of iron, each half the length of one of the bars, but of the same breadth and thickness. The six hard bars should be each five inches and a half long, one-half inch broad, and three-twentieths of an inch thick, with two pieces of iron of half the length, but of the same breadth and thickness as one of the hard bars; and let all the bars be marked with a line quite round them at one end; then take an iron poker and tongs, or two bars of iron, the larger they are, and the longer they have been used, the better; and fixing the poker upright, or rather in the magnetic line between the knees, hold to it, near the top, one of the soft bars, having its marked end downwards, by a piece of sewing silk, which must be pulled tight by the left hand, that the bar may not slide; then grasping the tongs with the right hand, a little below the middle, and holding them nearly in a vertical position, let the bar be stroked by the lower end from the bottom to the top about ten times on each side, which will give it a magnetic power sufficient to lift a small key at the marked end; which end, if the bar were suspended on a point, would turn towards the north, and is therefore called the north pole, and the unmarked end, for the same reason is called the south pole. Four of the soft bars being impregnated after this manner, lay the other two parallel to each other, at a quarter of an inch distant, between the two pieces of iron belonging to them, a north and a south pole against each piece of iron; then take two of the bars already made magnetic, and place them together so as to make a double bar in thickness, the north pole of the one even with the south pole of the other, and the remaining two being put to these, one on each side, so as to have two north and two south poles together, separate the north from the south poles at one end by the interposition of some hard substance (I, fig. 21.), and place them perpendicularly with that end downward on the middle of one of the parallel bars AC; the two north poles towards its south end, and the two south poles towards its north end. Slide them three or four times backward and forward the whole length of the bar; then removing them from the middle of this bar, place them on the middle of the other bar BD as before directed, and go over that in the same manner; then turn both bars the other side upwards, and repeat the former operation: this being done, take the two bars from between the pieces of iron, and placing the two outermost of the touching bars in their stead, let the other two be the outermost of the four to touch these with; and this process being repeated till each pair of bars have been touched three or four times over, will give them a considerable magnetic power.\n\nWhen the small bars have been thus rendered magnetic, in order to communicate the magnetism to the large bars, lay two of them on the table, between their iron conductors as before; then form a compound magnet with the six small bars, placing three of them with\nthe north poles downwards, and the three others with the south poles downwards. Place the two parcels at an angle, as was done with four of them, the north extremity of the one parcel being put contiguous to the south extremity of the other, and with this compound magnet stroke four of the large bars, one after another, about twenty times on each side, by which means they will acquire some magnetic power.\n\nWhen the four large bars have been so far rendered magnetic, the small bars are laid aside, and the large ones are strengthened by themselves, in the manner followed with the small bars.\n\nTo expedite the operation, the bars ought to be fixed in a groove, or between brafs pins, otherwise the attraction and friction between the bars will be continually deranging them when placed between the conductors.\n\nThis whole process may be gone through in about half an hour, and each of the large bars, if well hardened, will lift about 28 ounces troy, and they are fitted for all the purposes of magnetism in navigation and experimental philosophy. The half dozen being put into a case in such a manner as that no two poles of the same name may be together, and their irons with them as one bar, they will retain the virtue they have received; but if their power should, by making experiments, be ever so much impaired, it may be restored without any foreign affluence in a few minutes.\n\nThese bars must be kept in a wooden box, arranged in such a manner that their opposite poles may lie together, as represented at fig. 22.\n\nThere are various methods of communicating a permanent magnetism to ferruginous bodies, by means of a bar rendered magnetic, by position, of which the most simple is that described by Mr Marcel, whose experiments were made in the year 1726. Being employed in making some observations on the magnetic power which he found in great pieces of iron, he took a large vice weighing 90 pounds, in which he fixed a large anvil weighing 12 lbs. The steel to which he wished to give the magnetic power was laid upon the anvil in a north and south position, which happened to be the diagonal of the square surface of the latter. He then took a four cornered piece of iron an inch thick every way, 33 inches long, weighing about 8lbs, having one end rounded and brightly polished, the other being tapered. Holding then the steel fast upon the anvil with the one hand, he took the iron bar in the other, and holding it perpendicularly, he rubbed the steel hard with the rounded part towards him from north to south, always carrying the bar far enough round about to begin at the north. Having thus given 10 or 12 strokes, the steel was turned upside down, and rubbed as much on the other side. Proceeding in this manner till it had been rubbed 400 times, the steel was as strongly magnetic as if it had been touched by a powerful lodestone. The place where he began to rub was always the north pole. In these experiments it sometimes happened that the virtue was imparted by a few strokes; nay, by a single stroke a small needle was made to receive a very considerable power. Thus he imparted to two compass needles such a degree of magnetic power, that one lifted three-fourths, and another a whole ounce of iron, and although these needles were anointed with linseed oil to keep them from rusting, and a hard coat was thus formed upon them, they nevertheless retained their power. Thus also a knife was made so strongly magnetic, that it would take up an ounce and three-fourths of iron. Four small pieces of steel, each an inch long, and one-twelfth of an inch broad, as thin as the spring of a watch, were thus impregnated with the magnetic power, and then joined into a small artificial magnet; which at its first formation took up eight times its own weight of iron; and after being five years kept in the most careless manner, was found to have gained rather than lost anything of its power. In the course of his experiments, Mr Marcel found, that the end at which he began to rub was always the north pole, whatever position the steel was laid in. On rubbing a piece of steel from one end to the middle, and then from the other end to the middle, it acquired two north poles, one at each end, the middle being a south pole. Beginning to rub from the middle towards each end, he found a north pole in the middle, and a south pole at each extremity.\n\nMagnetism may be communicated to a small piece of soft steel in the following manner: take two iron bars of about an inch square, and upwards of three feet in length; keep them in the magnetic line, or in a perpendicular posture, as represented fig. 23. Let the piece of steel CB be either fastened to the edge of a table, or held by an assistant; and placing the lower extremity of the bar AB, and the upper extremity of the bar CD, on opposite sides, and in the middle of the steel, stroke the latter from the middle towards its extremities, moving both bars at the same time. When both are arrived at the extremities of the steel, remove them from it, and apply them again to the middle. Do so for 40 or 50 times, and the steel will be found to have a considerable degree of magnetic power. Care, however, must be taken, in removing the bars, not to draw them along the surface of the steel; or the experiment will not succeed, because the magnetism is destroyed by the contrary strokes.\n\nThe late Dr Gowin Knight possessed a surprising skill in magnetism, being able to communicate an extraordinary degree of attractive or repulsive power, and lodestones, to alter or reverse the poles at pleasure; but as he refused to discover his methods upon any terms whatever (even as he said, though he should receive in return as many guineas as he could carry), these curious and valuable secrets have died with him. In the 69th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, however, Mr Benjamin Wilson has given a process, which at least discovers one of the leading principles of Dr Knight's art, and may perhaps be a means of discovering the whole to those who shall be less reserved. The doctor's process, according to Mr Wilson, was as follows. Having provided himself with a great quantity of clean iron filings, he put them into a large tub, that was more than one-third filled with clean water; he then, with great labour, worked the tub to and fro for many hours together, that the friction between the grains of iron by this treatment might break off such smaller parts as would remain suspended in the water for a time. The obtaining of these very small particles in sufficient quantity seemed to him to be one of the principal desiderata in the experiment. The water being by this treatment rendered very muddy, he poured the same into a clean iron vessel, leaving the filings behind;\nExperimen-hind; and when the water had stood long enough to be clear, he poured it out carefully, without disturbing such of the sediment as still remained; which now appeared reduced almost to an impalpable powder. This powder was afterwards removed into another vessel in order to dry it; but as he had not obtained a proper quantity thereof by this one step, he was obliged to repeat the process many times. Having at last procured enough of this very fine powder, the next thing was to make a paste of it, and that with some vehicle which would contain a considerable quantity of the inflammable matter; for this purpose he had recourse to lintseed oil in preference to all other fluids. With these two ingredients only he made a stiff paste, and took particular care to knead it well before he moulded it into convenient shapes. Sometimes, while the paste continued in its soft state, he would put the impression of a seal upon the several pieces; one of which is in the British Museum. This paste was then put upon wood, and sometimes on tiles, in order to bake or dry it before a moderate fire, at about the distance of a foot. He found that a moderate fire was most proper, because a greater degree of heat made the composition frequently crack in many places. The time required for the baking or drying of this paste was generally about five or six hours before it attained a sufficient degree of hardness. When that was done, and the several baked pieces were become cold, he gave them their magnetic power in any direction he pleased, by placing them between the extreme ends of his large magazine of artificial magnets for a few seconds or more as he saw occasion. By this method the power they acquired was such, that when any of these pieces were held between two of his best ten guinea bars, with its poles purposely inverted, it immediately of itself turned about to recover its natural direction, which the force of those very powerful bars was not sufficient to counteract.\n\nIn the 66th volume of the Philosophical Transactions we have the following account from Dr Fothergill, of Dr Knight's method of imitating natural magnets, but which is by Mr Cavallo supposed to be some mistake or misinformation. \"I do not know, says he,\" that ever the doctor (Dr Knight) left behind him any description of a composition he had made to form artificial loadstones. I have seen in his possession, and many other of his friends have likewise seen, such a composition, which retained the magnetic virtue in a manner much more fixed than either any real loadstone, or any magnetic bar, however well tempered. In the natural ones he could change the poles in an instant, so likewise in the hardest bars, but in the composition the poles were immovable. He had several small pieces of this composition which had strong magnetic powers. The largest was about half an inch in breadth, very little longer than broad, and near one-fourth of an inch thick. It was not armed, but the ends were powerfully magnetic; nor could the poles be altered, though it was placed between two of his largest bars, and they were very strongly impregnated. The mass was not very heavy, and had much the appearance of a piece of black lead, though not quite so shining. I believe he never divulged the composition, but I think he once told me, the basis of it was filings of iron reduced by long-continued attrition to a perfectly impalpable state, and then incorporated with some pliant experimental matter to give it due confidence.\"\n\nFrom these accounts it appears that the basis of Dr Knight's artificial loadstones was the black powder to which iron filings are reduced by being shaken with water, or the black oxide of iron, formerly called martial æthiops. Hence Mr Cavallo supposes that the following receipt for imitating the natural magnets will answer the purpose.\n\nTake some martial æthiops, reduced into a very fine powder, or, which is more easily procured, black oxide of iron, the scales which fall from red-hot iron when hammered, and are found abundantly in smiths shops. Mix this powder with drying lintseed oil, so as to form it into a very stiff paste, and shape it in a mould so as to give it any form you require, whether of a terrælla, a human head, or any other. This done, put it into a warm place for some weeks, and it will dry so as to become very hard; then render it magnetic by the application of powerful magnets, and it will acquire a considerable power.\n\nSect. IV. Of the Circumstances which tend to impair or destroy the Magnetic Power.\n\nThe magnetic power in all its modifications, whether of attraction, repulsion, or polarity, is in general temporary and perishing. The best magnets, whether natural or artificial, unless carefully preserved, with attention to certain circumstances that will presently appear, are observed to have their magnetic power diminished. Natural magnets, and artificial magnets made of steel tempered as hard as possible, retain their power most obstinately, and seldom entirely lose it except under circumstances which we know to be unfavourable to its durability. Magnets of steel of a spring temper, are much sooner weakened, lose more of their force merely by keeping, and finally retain little or none of it. Soft steel and iron seldom retain magnetic power when removed from the magnet where they acquired it, unless their metallic state undergoes some change.\n\nThe following circumstances have been observed to be most powerful in diminishing or destroying the power of magnets.\n\n1. Improper position. Nothing has so much effect in impairing the power of a magnet as keeping it in an improper position, that is, too far from the magnetic line. If the axis of the magnet be placed in a direction that is at right angles with the magnetic meridian, that is, in this latitude nearly E. N. E. and W. N. W., it will soonest lose its magnetic power; and if it be placed in the magnetic line, but in a contrary position, or with the north pole where the south pole should be, if permitted to vibrate freely, it will gradually become weaker every day, and unless it be a natural magnet, or an artificial one made of very hard tempered steel, it will, in no very long time, entirely lose its magnetic power.\n\n2. Heat. The dissipation of magnetic power is greatly promoted by heating the magnet. The heat of boiling water has a sensible effect in this way; but if the magnet be exposed to a red heat, its power is entirely destroyed, as has been long known. Dr Gilbert observed that the power of magnets was destroyed by a heat\nheat that was not sufficient to make the metal visible in the dark; and Mr Canton found that the heat of boiling water weakened the power of a magnet, but that the greatest part of this was recovered as the magnet cooled. If the heat be applied when the magnet lies in a position most favourable to the diffusion of magnetism, the power is soonest destroyed; hence, the best way to deprive iron or steel of accidental magnetism is, to heat it red-hot, and allow it to cool while lying in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic line.\n\nM. Coulomb has ascertained that at 200 degrees of heat, two fifths of the magnetism of a magnet is diffused, and that at 500 degrees the whole is lost.\n\n3. By violent treatment. It is very extraordinary that the power of a magnet is impaired by rough usage. Dr Gilbert observed that a magnet which he had powerfully impregnated was greatly weakened by a single fall on the floor; and since his time it has been observed that when a magnet falls on a stone, or receives any concussion that makes it ring, it is injured much more than by being beaten with anything soft and yielding. When a natural magnet is ground with coarse powders, in order to bring it to any required form, it is considerably weakened. This shews the propriety of altering the natural form of loadstones as little as possible, and where this is necessary, of doing it as expeditiously as may be, by cutting them briskly in the thin disks of a lapidary's wheel.\n\n4. Placing them near each other with their similar poles being poles opposite. Magnets situated in this way always weaken each other, and when a powerful magnet is placed near a weaker, with their similar poles opposed, the polarity of the weaker is frequently reversed, that is, if the pole were north it becomes south, and vice versa. When the weaker magnet is a natural loadstone, or has been made of hard tempered steel, its original polarity is restored when the improper position is changed; but if it has been made of spring-tempered steel, the alteration is generally permanent, and often as complete as while the magnets were in the neighbourhood of each other.\n\nCHAP. III. Theory of Magnetism.\n\nRespecting the notions which the ancient philosophers entertained about the cause of magnetic phenomena, we know very little. One curious opinion which they entertained of the reason why a magnet was improved by the contact of iron, is worth noticing. They conceived that the magnet fed upon the iron, and hence acquired additional attractive power; and when deprived of this pabulum, it grew weak and languid.\n\n---\n\n\"Nam ferro nurruit vitam, ferrique vigore\nVeficitur; hoc dulces epulas, hoc pabula novit;\nHinc proprias renovat vires, hinc fusa per artus\nAspera fecerunt servant alimenta vigorem.\nHoc abiente perit, tritis morientia torpens\nMembra fame, venalque sitis consumit apertas.\"\n\nCLAUDIAN.\n\nIn the 16th century, the philosophers of modern times first began to speculate about the cause of magnetic polarity, a phenomenon which then became interesting on account of the difference of declination observed by navigators. Various trifling opinions were published on the subject. Some said that the needle was directed by a certain point in the heavens, which was little more than saying that it pointed one way. Others ascribed the direction of the needle to vast magnetic rocks situated in the earth; but as to the exact situation of these rocks, they did not give themselves the trouble to inquire, till Fracastor observed, that, if those rocks are supposed to be situated in any part of the globe yet visited by navigators, and if, as we must suppose, they act like loadstones, they will cause the direction to be very different from what is observed. He therefore placed them somewhere in the inaccessible polar regions, though not immediately at the poles. Norman, who, as we have seen (Dipping Needle), discovered the dip of the magnetic needle, and observed that in every part of Europe, the north pole pointed very far below the horizon, was naturally led to ascribe this effect to the influence of the earth, though he does not express himself as if he thought that the needle was attracted by any point within the earth, but only that it was always directed to such a point.\n\nFrom comparing the different positions of the compass needle, as described by Norman, with the positions theory, which he had himself observed small needles to assume in relation to a magnet, Dr Gilbert was naturally led to consider the earth as a great loadstone, or else containing a great loadstone within it, which arranged the dipping needle, or the needle of the compass, in the same manner as he observed a small needle poised on its pivot, to be arranged by a large magnet. Dr Gilbert has explained his theory at large in his Physiologia Nova de Magnete, et de Tellure Magno Magnete. It may be briefly expressed in the following terms. All the appearances of natural magnetism are similar to what would be observed in the earth, were a large magnet with its poles situated near the poles of the equator, viz. the north pole not far from Baffin's bay in North America, and the south pole in about the opposite part of the globe. If a dipping needle were exposed to the influence of such a large magnet, it must arrange itself in a plane passing through the magnetic poles, a position indicated very nearly by the mariner's needle; and the more we recede from the equator of the great magnet, the more must the dipping needle be inclined to the horizon.\n\nDr Gilbert's theory was equally ingenious and important, and affords, if firmly established, a complete explanation of all the phenomena of magnetism. At the time it was first published, however, observations were neither sufficiently numerous, nor sufficiently accurate, to enable the author to assign the real position of the great magnet, nor to ascertain its laws of action. The theory was chiefly founded on observations made by the dipping needle, and though those instruments made by Norman were more accurate than might have been expected at so early a period of the science, the observations made with them cannot, from many circumstances, be implicitly relied on. We are still in want of a numerous collection of observations on the dip, in order to perfect our knowledge of the magnetic poles. We can only say that the earth acts on the compass needle in the same manner as a large magnet would act; but the appearances do not seem to resemble the effects of what we should consider as a good loadstone having two vigorous\nIt is unfortunate that our most numerous observations of the dip have not been made in those places where they would be the most instructive. Dr. Robison was of opinion that a series of observations should be obtained, extending from New Zealand northward, across the Pacific ocean to Cape Fairweather on the western coast of North America, whence it should be continued through that part of the continent. A second series might extend from the Cape of Good Hope along the western coast of Africa to the tropic of Capricorn; thence across the interior of the African continent through Sicily, Italy, Dalmatia, the eastern part of Germany, the gulf of Bothnia, Lapland, and the western part of Greenland. This series would be nearly in a plane passing through the probable situations of the poles. A third series might extend at right angles to the last, so as to form a small circle crossing the former, passing near Japan, through the island of Borneo, and the western part of New Holland; near Mexico, and a few degrees west of Easter Island. Here and at Borneo there would be a considerable inclination of the magnetic plane to the horizon, though this cannot be found out. There are, however, other points of this circle in which the dip is considerable, where the inclination may be discovered. In short, all circumstances seem to indicate a multiplicity of poles, or what renders calculation most difficult, an irregular magnetism in which the polarity is very much diffused.\n\nPhilosophers are very much divided respecting the situation of the magnetic poles of the earth. We shall here state only a few of their opinions, referring a fuller account of some of them for the article Variation of the Compass.\n\nDr. Halley thought that the north magnetic pole was near Baffin's bay in North America.\n\nProfessor Kraft (see Pittsburgh Comment, vol. xvii.) places the north pole in N. Lat. 70° and W. Long. 23° from London; and the south pole S. Lat. 55°, and E. Long. 92°.\n\nWileke of Stockholm places the north pole in N. Lat. 75° near Baffin's bay, and in the longitude of California, while he fixes the south pole in S. Lat. 70° in the Pacific ocean.\n\nChurchman supposes the north pole to be in N. Lat. 59°, and W. Long. 133°, a little inland from Cape Fairweather; and the south in S. Lat. 59°, and E. Long. 165°, directly south of New Zealand. (See Variation).\n\nEuler (Memoirs of the Acad. of Berlin, vol. xvi.) places the north pole in N. Lat. 75°. Lemontier (Lois du Magnetisme) in N. Lat. 73°. Buffon in N. Lat. 71°.\n\nLa Lande places it in N. Lat. 77° 4', and in about W. Long. 98° from Paris. (See Connaissance des Temps, an. xii.).\n\nHowever ingenious this hypothesis of Dr. Gilbert was, it appears to have been nothing more than a sagacious conjecture. The hypothesis, however, is confirmed into a rational theory by many observations and experiments which were unknown or unthought of in Dr. Gilbert's time.\n\nMr. Hindshaw's beautiful experiment on the effect of an upright iron bar on the opposite ends of a compass needle, according as one end or the other of the bar is next the earth (see Variation of the Compass) is an abundant proof of the justness of this theory.\n\nWe can imitate that experiment in a very satisfactory manner by artificial magnetism; thus forming a just comparison between the action of the earth and that of a magnet.\n\nLet a large bar magnet, as SAN (fig. 24.) be supported so as to have its ends detached from surrounding bodies. Then place a small needle nicely poised, as B, about three inches below N, the north pole of the magnet, and so that its directive power for the magnet may be very weak. Now take a small piece of soft iron and hold it in such a position as is represented at C; its lower end becoming a north pole will attract the south pole of the needle. Now, while the needle is kept in the same position, turn round the piece of iron into the position D; the south pole of the needle will be seen to avoid it, and the north pole will be attracted. Here the magnet may be compared to the earth, and the small piece of iron to the iron bar in Mr. Hindshaw's experiment.\n\nAgain, it has been seen that magnetism may be produced in iron or steel by hammering or heating them while in a determinate position with respect to the earth. The same effect will be produced by the same processes while the iron or steel is in the neighbourhood of a powerful magnet.\n\nLastly, the circumstance of the magnetic inclination of the north pole of the dipping needle being diminished, and the horizontality of the compass needle destroyed, as we ascend above the earth, is an additional and certain evidence of the truth of this theory.\n\nIn short, we may consider it as demonstrated, that the earth is a great magnet, or contains a great magnet, by the influence of which the direction of the needle and all the magnetic power acquired by iron, when placed in a proper position, are produced.\n\nA further illustration and application of this theory will be given presently, when we have considered some other hypotheses posterior to that of Dr. Gilbert.\n\nIt was very early an object with philosophers to assign the immediate cause of magnetic attraction and repulsion, and of that faculty of mutual impregnation which so remarkably distinguishes iron from all other substances. In particular, the curious arrangement of iron filings strewed round a magnet forcibly attracted their attention. It is scarcely possible to observe this arrangement without conceiving the idea of a stream of matter issuing from one of the poles of the magnet, moving round it, entering by the other pole, and again issuing by its former outlet. Accordingly, such an idea was entertained in the earliest times; but very different notions prevailed as to the manner in which such a stream produced the effects observed. One of the simplest methods was, to conceive it acting by impulsion, like any other stream of fluid matter. This idea was entertained by Lucretius, who supposed the surrounding air to be swept out of the way by the impulsion of the fluid, which thus rushing round the magnet carried the iron filings towards it.\n\nIn the last century Euler framed an hypothesis of magnetism on this theory of impulsion. He supposed Euler's hypothesis that the two principal causes which concur in producing potheis,\nthe wonderful properties of a magnet, are. First, A particular structure of the internal pores of the magnets, and of magnetic bodies; and, Secondly, An external agent or fluid, which acts upon, and passes through these pores. This fluid he supposes to be the solar atmosphere, or that subtile matter called ether, which fills our system.\n\nIndeed, most writers on this subject agreed in supposing that there are corpules of a peculiar form and energy, which continually circulate around and through a magnet; and that a vortex of the same kind circulates around and through the earth.\n\n\"A magnet, besides the pores which it has in common with other bodies, has also other pores considerably smaller, defined only for the passage of the magnetic fluid. These pores are disposed so as to communicate one with the other, forming tubes or channels, by which the magnetic fluid passes from one end to the other. The pores are so formed, that this fluid can only pass through them in one direction, but cannot return back the same way; similar to the veins and lymphatic vessels of the animal body, which are furnished with valves for this purpose: So that the pores of the magnet may be conceived to be formed into several narrow contiguous tubes, parallel to each other, as at A, B, fig. 25., through which the finer part of the ether passes freely from A to B, but cannot return back on account of the resistance it meets with at a, a, b, b, nor overcome the resistance of the groser ether, which occasions and continues the motion. For supposing the pole A of a magnet, filled with several mouths or open ends of similar tubes, the magnetic fluid, pressed by the groser parts of the ether, will pass towards B with an inconceivable rapidity, which is proportionable to the elasticity of the ether itself; this matter which, till it arrives at B, is separated from the tubes by the groser parts, then meets with it again, and has its velocity retarded, and its direction changed; the stream, reflected by the ether, with which it cannot immediately mix, is bent on both sides towards C and D, and describes, but with less velocity, the curves DE and CFE, and approaching by the curves d' and e', falls in with the effluent matter mm, and again enters the magnet; and thus forms that remarkable atmosphere, which is visible in the arrangement of steel filings on a piece of paper that is placed over a magnet\" +.\n\nWe have already had occasion (see the article IMPULSION) to make some observations on the general doctrine of impulsion, and these need not be here repeated. Respecting the explanations afforded by the canals and dock-gates in Euler's hypothesis, opening in one direction and shutting in the other, we may observe, that as these contrivances are altered in a moment in a bar of soft iron, merely by changing the position of the magnet, it is astonishing that they should ever have been conceived by so acute a philosopher. Even supposing such circumstances to take place, the effects resulting from them should be the reverse of what are actually observed, as the impelling stream should move those bodies least which afford the readiest channels for its passage. If the iron filings were arranged by this impelling stream, they should be carried along with it, and if they are carried towards one pole of the magnet, they should be driven away from the other.\n\nÆpinus, of the academy of Pittsburgh, whose theory of electricity we have explained and illustrated at considerable length, was led by the analogy observed between the phenomena of electricity and those of magnetism, and in particular from the resemblance between the attractions and repulsions of the tourmalin and those of a magnet, to conceive the idea that both classes of phenomena might be explained in a similar manner, or that the phenomena of magnetism, like those of electricity, were to be attributed to the motions of a certain fluid existing in all bodies susceptible of magnetism. This conjecture was confirmed by observing, that when magnetism was induced on a piece of iron by its proximity to a magnet, the power of the magnet is not sensibly diminished. The following is an abstract of Mr Æpinus's hypothesis.\n\n1. There exists in all magnetic bodies a substance which may be called the magnetic fluid, the particles of which repel each other with a force that decreases as the distance increases.\n\n2. There is a mutual attraction, varying according to the same law, between the particles of the magnetic fluid, and the particles of iron.\n\n3. There is a mutual repulsion among the particles of iron, following the same law.\n\n4. The magnetic fluid is capable of moving through the pores of iron, and soft steel, without any considerable difficulty: but its motion is more and more obstructed as the steel receives a harder degree of temper; and in steel of the hardest temper, and the ores of iron, it moves with the greatest difficulty.\n\n5. From the supposed attraction between the magnetic fluid and iron, the latter may contain a certain determinate quantity of the former, and this quantity will be such that the accumulating attraction of a particle of it for the whole of the iron, balances the repulsion between the particles of the whole fluid contained in the iron; supposing the quantity of fluid competent to a particle of iron to be such, that the repulsion between it and the fluid competent to another particle of iron, is also equal to its attraction for that particle of iron. Therefore the attraction between the fluid in one iron bar A, and the iron of another bar B, is just equal to the repulsion between the iron in A and the iron in B. This determinate quantity of fluid in the iron is called its natural quantity.\n\n6. From the mobility of the fluid through the pores of iron, it may, by the agency of a proper external force, be abridged from one end of an iron bar, and condensed in the other end. This, however, is a violent state, and the mutual repulsion between the particles of condensed fluid, together with the attraction between the fluid and that part of the iron which it has quitted, tend to produce a more uniform distribution. It is evident that something of this tendency must take place in every state of condensation and rarefaction, and that a perfect equilibrium can be produced only when the fluid is diffused with perfect uniformity. This state of uniformity may be called the natural state of the body.\n\n7. The production of such a uniform distribution will depend on the nature of the resistance to the motion of the fluid, opposed by the iron in its various states. If this resistance arises merely from the communication of motion, like that which perfect fluids oppose to the motion...\nTheory of solid bodies, such resistance may be overcome by the weakest tendency to uniform diffusion; but if, as seems most likely, the obstruction is like that of a clammy fluid, or of a soft plastic body like clay, after the accumulation arising from the action of an external force, it may remain after that force is removed; and the diffusion will cease when there is a perfect equilibrium between the obstruction and the diffusing force.\n\nAs the illustration of this theory in general cases is precisely similar, mutatis mutandis, with that of electricity, so fully detailed under the article Electricity, from No. 299 to 348, we need not repeat it here, but may refer the reader to that treatise, requesting him to consider the illustration as relating to the magnetic fluid.\n\nIt is proper, however, to remark here, that the phenomena of magnetism are limited by this circumstance; that magnets always contain their natural quantity of fluid. Of course, their action on iron, and on each other, depends entirely on their unequal distribution.\n\nThe most important part of this theory is that which explains the induction of magnetism on iron and steel by juxtaposition to a magnet; but before we can properly enter on that, we must notice some other particulars respecting the theoretical part of our subject.\n\nA very material point in magnetism, as in electricity, is to ascertain the law of action, according to which this power acts on the particles of iron and other matter; and accordingly this has long been an object of attention with philosophers. The difficulty of ascertaining this law is extremely great, as will readily appear by the following consideration.\n\nIn the action of two magnets on each other, as A and B, there are four different actions to be considered that act at the same time, though with different degrees of force, and in different directions. Thus the north pole of A repels the north pole of B, and attracts its south pole, while the south pole of A exerts a repulsion on the south pole of B, and an attraction on its north pole. Now the force, which we attempt to measure, is compounded of these four forces; and these we cannot measure separately. The attraction observed is the excess of two attractions that are unequal above two unequal repulsions, and v. v. with respect to the observed repulsion. Further, if we reflect that it is possible for a mutual action to exist between every two particles of the different magnets, and that the intensity of this action may vary, not only at different distances, but at the same distance, the difficulty will be greatly increased.\n\nNumerous experiments have been made with a view of ascertaining this law. Mr Cavallo has detailed many of those made by Muffchenbroeck; but their results are so anomalous, that their inaccuracy is apparent. Indeed, the attempt to ascertain this law by observing merely the attractions and repulsions, was very unphilosophical. The method employed by Mr Hawkbee and Dr Brook Taylor, viz. observing how far the action of a magnet made a compass needle deviate from the meridian at different distances, was much more scientific, as this deviation is occasioned by the difference of the two sums of the same forces; and this may be made many times greater than the other, and must of course be much more sensible. The shape of the magnets employed by them was, however, very improper. Some experiments made by Mr Lambert of the academy of Berlin, were very judicious. He placed a magnetic bar needle at various distances from a magnet, but in the direction of its axis, and marked the declination from the magnetic line produced by the action of the magnet, and the obliquity of the magnet to the axis of the needle. Thus the action of the magnet and the natural polarity of the needle were placed in opposition and equilibrium; but the great difficulty was to discover the proportional change of these forces by their obliquity of action on this small lever.\n\nMr Lambert observed, that when the obliquity of the magnet to the axis of the needle was 30°, the needle was made to decline 15°; and when the obliquity was 75°, the needle declined 30°. Let us call the obliquity \\( \\theta \\) and the declination \\( d \\); and let us put \\( f \\) for that function of the angle which is proportional to the action. Also let us call the natural polarity of the needle \\( p \\), and the force of the magnet \\( m \\). Then it is evident that \\( p \\times f : 15 = m \\times f : 30 \\); and \\( p : m = f : 30 : f : 15 \\); and for the same reason \\( p : m = f : 75 : f : 30 \\), and therefore \\( f : 15 : f : 30 = f : 30 : f : 75 \\). But fine 15 : 30 = fine 30 : 75; hence Mr Lambert concluded, that the fine was that function of the angle which was proportional to the action of magnetism on a lever. As this point, however, could not be determined by one experiment, he compared several other obliquities and declinations with the same distances, and with different distances of the magnet, and fully proved that he was right in his conjecture.\n\nThe result of Mr Lambert's experiments fully proves the fallacy of the theories of impulsion, which pretend to explain magnetic action by the impelling power of a stream of fluid, or by pressure produced by the motion of such a stream; as in such a case the pressure on the needle must have diminished in the duplicate ratio of the fine; or with the angle 90° the directive power must have been four times as much as with the angle of 30°, whereas it is shown by observation to be only twice as much.\n\nWhen Mr Lambert had ascertained the effect of obliquity, he proceeded to examine that of distance; and he found, that if we put \\( f \\) for the force of the magnet, and \\( b \\) for the distance of the nearest pole of the magnet from the centre of the needle, and \\( a \\) for a constant quantity nearly equal to two thirds of the length of the needle, \\( f \\) will be proportional to \\((b-a)^2\\).\n\nDr Robison endeavoured to investigate this law in a very simple manner. He caused to be made some magnets consisting of two balls connected by a slender rod. By a particular mode of impregnation (which we suppose to be quenching them, after being red hot, between two magnets) he gave them a pretty good magnetism; and the force of each pole appeared to be nearly confined to the centre of the ball, which was his object in making them of such a shape, as it reduced the examination of their attractive and directive power to a very easy computation. The result of his experiments was, that the force of each pole varied inversely as the squares of the distances, or at least the error arising from such an hypothesis was very small, amounting only to one-fifteenth of the whole.\n\nDr Robison made a near approximation to the law of\nof action, by supposing that the function of the distance expressing that law, represented by the ordinates of a curve similar to the hyperbola, referred to its asymptote as an axis, towards which its curve was of course always convex. On this supposition he explained the attractions and repulsions of magnets nearly in the following manner.\n\nLet there be two magnets, A and B (fig. 26.) placed so that their four poles, S, N, s, n, may be in a straight line. Now, on the straight line Oq take Om, Op, On, Oq = Ns, Nn, ss, sn; and let MPNQ be a curve line, whose asymptotic axis is the said line Oq. Draw the ordinates mM, pP, nN, qQ to the curve, and these will represent the intensities of the forces exerted between the poles of the magnets. The distance between m, n, or between p and q = the length of the magnet A, and mp or nq = that of B, and Mm, Pp, Nn and Qq, are pairs of ordinates that are equidistant. Now, it is easy to see from the figure, that in whatever situation the pairs of equidistant ordinates may be, Mm + Qq will always exceed Pp + Nn, or the sum of the attractions will be always greater than that of the repulsions.\n\nLet the chords MQ, PN, MP, NQ be drawn. Bisect them in B, D, E, F, and join EF. Draw the ordinates Ee, Ff, and BD b (cutting EF in C). Draw Pu parallel to the axis, cutting Ee in e. Draw also Qi parallel to the axis, cutting Ff in f. Also draw FH parallel to the axis, and Po parallel to QN; and draw PL, and Pe, cutting Mm in l and x. Let each ordinate be represented by the letter at its intersection with the axis. Thus, the ordinates Mm and Qq may be represented by m and q, &c. Because MP is bisected in E, Mt is double of Et, Ml is double EL, and Mx double of Ex. Again, Pi being parallel to QN, and Pu to Qi, tu equals Ni.\n\nIf these ordinates are supposed to represent the mutual action of the magnetic poles, their tendency to or from each other, that is, their attractions or repulsions, may be expressed by \\((m+q)-(n+p)\\) which represent the excess of the sum of the actions of the nearest and most remote poles above the sum of the action of the intermediate distant poles. This tendency may often be conveniently represented by \\((m-p)-(n-q)\\) or the excess of the difference of the actions exerted by the nearest pole of A on the two poles of B, above the difference of the actions of the remote pole of A on the same poles of B. Now, 1. If we suppose the diliniar poles of A and B to front each other, m + q will represent attractions, and p + m repulsions; but m + q is greater than p + n, therefore A and B will attract each other. Again \\((m+q)-(p+n)\\) equals Mt, = 2 Ed = 2 BD = 4 CD.\n\nThe above action will be increased by any one of four circumstances, as, 1. By increasing the strength of either magnet. 2. By lessening the distance between the two magnets. 3. Increasing the length of A, the distance between it and B remaining the same. 4. By increasing the length of B, the distance between it and A remaining the same.\n\n2dly, Let us place the magnets, so that their similar poles front each other. Here it is evident that the ordinates which in the former case represented attractions, will now represent repulsions, and that the repelling forces of the magnets are equal to the former attracting forces at the same distances. As magnets are seldom perfect, the repelling forces are, however, usually weaker than the attracting.\n\nTo explain the directive power of magnets, Dr Robison supposed the magnet A not to be at liberty to approach B or recede from it, but to be supported at its centre B, so as to turn round it. Now, its south pole s being more attracted by N than it is repelled by S, B is on the whole attracted by A, and by this attraction would vibrate like a pendulum supported at the centre B. Again, the north pole n being repelled by N more than it is attracted by S, will be on the whole repelled, and B n would also vibrate round B. Thus B would be kept in the position s B n. This will be more evident if we suppose the magnet B arranged at right angles to the line AB, as in the dotted representation s' B n'; for now s' and n' are urged in opposite conspiring directions with equal forces, which, if the magnet be very small, will act nearly at right angles to n' s'. If the position were oblique, the forces would be somewhat unequal; and allowances must be made for the obliquity of the action, that we may know the precise rotational momentum. This modification of the action of A on B, we call the directive power of A; and the modification of B, by which it tends to or from A, we call the polarity of B.\n\nNow, the directive power of A and the polarity of B may be increased, 1. By increasing the strength of either A or B, or both; 2. By diminishing the distance between A and B; 3. By increasing the length of A; and, 4. By diminishing the length of B the distance between them remaining the same.\n\nWe may remark, that the directive power of A is always greater than its attractive power, by a certain measure which we may represent by the formula \\(2(p-q)\\) which is thus derived. The difference between them may be expressed by \\(t = 2oL\\); but \\(t = Pp - pp = Ff - Ff = Qq - Qq = Pp - Qq = oL\\); therefore \\(oL = Pp - Qq\\), and \\(t = 2(Pp - Qq) = 2(p-q)\\).\n\nThis picture of the forces, attentively examined, will suggest to the reader many interesting and instructive particulars. Dr Robison used to relate a curious and instructive phenomenon that he was long puzzled to explain, respecting the mutual action of large magnets. Amusing himself with some experiments on magnetism, with two large strong magnets, as AB, fig. 27. which were placed at about the distance of three inches with their opposite poles facing each other, he had placed a small needle balanced on a point between them as at D, which arranged itself in the same line with the magnets; but happening to let it off to a considerable distance on the table, as at E, he was surprised to see it instantly turn round on the point, and arrange itself in an opposite direction. When brought back to D, it reaffirmed its former position, but when he carried it cut gradually along the line DF, perpendicular to NS, he found it grow sensibly more feeble, vibrating more slowly; and when arrived at a certain point E, it showed no polarity towards either A or B, but retained any position given it: but when carried farther out, it again acquired polarity to the magnets, though in a contrary direction, arranging itself parallel to NS, with its north pole next to N, and south pole next to S. Being interrupted\nTheory interrupted in the prosecution of this experiment, but having marked the line DF on the table, he afterwards replaced the magnets and needle, placing the latter at E, where he expected it to be neutral; but it now turned its north pole towards B, and did not become neutral till carried further out. When standing there, something happened to move the magnets A and B, which instantly rushed together, and at the same instant the needle turned itself briskly, and arranged itself as before at F. In short, by gradually withdrawing the magnets from each other, he found that the needle first became weaker, then neutral, and then turned into the opposite position.\n\nDr Robison explained this curious phenomenon by what he calls primary and secondary magnetic curves, such as NHM, NEL, and SGK, SIE; but our limits do not permit us to enter here on the investigation of these curves.\n\nFrom all Dr Robison's experiments and calculations, he appears to have been fully convinced, that the true law of magnetic action is in the inverse duplicate ratio of the distances, and his opinion is still farther strengthened by the ingenious experiments of M. Coulomb related in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences at Paris for 1786 and 1787, or the Jour. de Phy. vol. xliii.\n\nWe are now prepared to examine the induction of magnetism in iron or steel by juxtaposition to a magnet, the general facts of which are mentioned and illustrated in No. 44.\n\nIt was remarked in No. 46, that the induction of magnetism in the iron by being near a magnet was not produced by a transference of something from the magnet to the iron. It follows that there must be some inherent property in iron, which is only excited, as it were, or roused into action, by the proximity of the magnet.\n\nIt has been remarked, that the magnetism of iron is momentary, but this must be understood only of the finest and purest iron, as when this metal is in the state of ore, or has undergone any change, as by exposure to the air, or by cementation, its magnetism becomes permanent, in proportion to the hardness of the metal.\n\nIt is of great importance to observe that the acquisition of induced magnetism is gradual and progressive, and that this gradation is more perceptible according as the iron is in a harder state. In soft iron the induction appears to be instantaneous throughout, unless the bar be exceedingly long; but when a magnet is brought near a bar of tempered steel, the near end acquires a contrary polarity long before the remote end appears affected, and it is a long time before the remote end acquires the same polarity with the proximate end of the magnet.\n\nFrom what has been said we may infer, that a piece of iron brought near a magnet, is attracted only because it becomes magnetical by induction, and that the attraction of a lodestone for iron, or the tendency of iron to the lodestone, is the consequence of the proper disposition of the magnetism induced in the iron.\n\nIt has already appeared, that this phenomenon arises from the excess of two attractions above two repulsions, and this is farther proved by the following considerations: 1. That the magnetism of the two poles is evidently of an opposite nature, the one attracting what the other repels, and vice versa. If a piece of iron is attracted by one, it ought therefore to be repelled by the other; but each pole, by inducing on the near end of the iron a magnetism opposite to its own, and on the remote end a similar magnetism, and its action diminishing as the distance increases, the attraction must always be in excess, and the iron must on the whole be attracted. 2. When we have two magnets placed in a parallel position, with their opposite poles together, if a piece of common iron be brought near their extremities, the different poles counteracting each other, the piece of iron will not be supported by the two magnets together, unless there is an inequality of action; but it is evident that either of them alone would be capable of supporting the iron. 3. In all the cases where the induction of magnetism is slow, the attraction is proportionally weak, and the attraction increases exactly according to the increase of the progressive induction. 4. An ore of iron that is not capable of acquiring magnetism, is not attracted by the magnet, and on the other hand it is an universal fact, that no substance which is not attracted by the magnet, can be rendered magnetical.\n\nThe induction of magnetism by juxtaposition affords a complete explanation of the curious arrangement of iron filings round a magnet. Let us suppose a great number of small oblong pieces of iron to be lying near each other on the surface of mercury, and that a strong magnet be brought into the midst of them. They are all immediately rendered magnetical by induction; anyone that is nearest the north pole of the magnet acquiring two poles, one a north and the other a south pole, turns the fourth pole towards the north pole of the magnet, and the north pole away from it; a similar effect is produced on another piece or filing that lies near the first, and so on of the rest. All those that lie near each other must mutually attract, as the magnetism of each is so disposed that both ends of it are in a state of attraction towards one or other of its neighbours. They will therefore arrange themselves by coalescence in a particular manner; if they are near enough, they will unite by their extremities, and if they are at some distance they will point towards each other, forming curved lines.\n\nIt is found that the magnetism of magnets, whether natural or artificial, is continually tending to decay, can be verified merely by the approach of a magnet, and as we know that in producing magnetism, magnets may oppose each other, it is reasonable to conclude, that when a slight though permanent magnetism has been acquired by a piece of iron by its vicinity to a magnet, it may be destroyed, and the contrary magnetism induced, by applying a magnet in the opposite direction. Accordingly it is a well-known fact, that the poles of magnets made of soft steel can be reversed at pleasure.\n\nThis explains why magnetic repulsion is always weaker than attraction at the same distance, as magnets, when placed with their similar poles facing each other, in order to try their repulsion, are thereby weakened; whereas, on the contrary, magnets applied with their opposite poles, so as to attract each other, are thereby improved, and their attractive powers are made to appear greater than they really are.\n\nIt has been observed that a magnet is not weakened by inducing magnetism on iron. In fact, it is rather improved.\nimproved by such induction, and this will increase the effect; for as the magnet is improved, the induced magnetism of the iron will be thereby increased, and thus the magnet will be thus farther improved.\n\nAfter what has been said, we need not enter further into an explanation of the phenomena, or of the processes employed in making artificial magnets. They are all referable to this one fact of the induction of magnetism by juxtaposition, and explanations will readily suggest themselves to readers who carefully consider the preceding facts, and compare them with Dr Gilbert's theory of terrestrial magnetism.\n\nIt is now time for us to return to Dr Gilbert's hypothesis, and consider an objection that has been strongly urged against it.\n\nThere is observed no tendency in the magnetic needle towards the great terrestrial magnet, that is, though, when made to float on water, it speedily acquires directive power, it does not in these latitudes approach the north side of the vessel, nor does an iron bar appear heavier when its south pole is uppermost, as ought to be the case on account of the attraction of the great magnet. Dr Gilbert saw this objection, and it appears to have given him some concern. He attempted to get rid of it by observing that the directive power of a magnet is greater than its attractive force; a fact in support of which he brings many experiments. A much more satisfactory answer may be derived from what has been stated respecting the actions of the four poles. We thence find, that the polarity of the needle depends on the difference of the sums of the actions of each pole of the magnet on both poles of the needle; whereas its tendency towards the magnet arising from the attraction between them, depends on the difference of the differences of the same actions. Hence the former may be very great while the latter is very small. We find that small iron filings are much less forcibly attracted by magnets than coarse ones, and, if we consider that the largest magnets which we employ do not bear so great a proportion to the earth, as the finest iron filings to an ordinary magnet, we shall not wonder that the attractive power of the earth is not very sensible.\n\nAs this objection is one of the strongest that can be brought against the theory, and as we may consider this as done away, we may now receive the theory as just so far as it goes. We must remark, that though we call that pole of a magnet which inclines towards the earth in the northern latitudes, a north pole, it is properly speaking a south pole; for as we must call that pole of the great magnet the north pole which is in the north, and as this pole produces the contrary polarity in the proximate end of a needle, that end must be possessed of south polarity. We shall return to this subject in the article VARIATION.\n\nSome valuable observations on terrestrial magnetism have lately been made in France by M. M. Humboldt and Biot, and as they would suffer materially by abridgement, we shall present our readers with the greatest part of the memoir nearly as translated in the Philosophical Magazine, vol. xxii.\n\nAfter explaining the object of the memoir, and giving an account of the share that he had in conducting the observations, M. Biot proceeds as follows.\n\nIt is necessary to consider the action of terrestrial magnetism under different points of view, corresponding to the different classes of the phenomena which it produces.\n\nIf we consider it first in general, we find that it acts on the whole surface of the globe, and that it extends beyond it. This fact, which was doubted, has been lately proved by M. Guy-Lussac, during his two globes' zoological voyages. And if these observations, made with all the care possible, have not thrown the least sensible diminution in the intensity of the magnetic force, at the greatest height to which man can attain, we have a right to conclude that this force extends to an indefinite distance from the earth, where it decreases, perhaps, in a very rapid manner, but which at present is unknown to us.\n\nIf we now consider magnetism at the surface even of the earth, we shall find three grand classes of phenomena which it is necessary to study separately, in order to have a complete knowledge of its mode of action. These phenomena are, the declination of the magnetic needle, its inclination, and the intensity of the magnetic force, considered either comparatively in different places or in themselves, paying attention to the variations which they experience. It is thus that, after having discovered the action of gravity as a central force, its variation, resulting from the figure of the earth, was afterwards ascertained in different latitudes.\n\nThe declination of the magnetic needle appears to be that phenomenon which hitherto has more particularly fixed the attention of philosophers, on account, no doubt, of the assistance which they hoped to derive from it in determining the longitude; but when it was known that the declination changes in the same place, in the course of time, when its diurnal variations were remarked, and its irregular traversing occasioned by different meteors, in a word, the difficulty of observing it at sea, within one degree nearly, it was necessary to abandon that hope, to consider the cause of these phenomena as much more complex and arbitrary than had been at first imagined.\n\nIn regard to the intensity of the magnetic power in different parts of the earth, it has never yet been measured in a comparative manner. The observations of M. Humboldt on this subject have discovered a very remarkable phenomenon; it is the variation of the intensity in different latitudes, and its increase proceeding from the equator to the poles.\n\nThe compass, indeed, which at the departure of M. Humboldt gave at Paris 245 oscillations in 10 minutes, gave no more in Peru than 211, and it constantly varied in the same direction; that is to say, the number of the oscillations always decreased in approaching the equator, and always increased in advancing towards the north.\n\nThese differences cannot be ascribed to a diminution of the force in the magnetism of the compass, nor can we suppose that it is weakened by the effect of time and of heat; for after three years residence in the warmest countries of the earth, the same compass gave again in Mexico oscillations as rapid as at Paris.\n\nThere is no reason to doubt the judgments of M. Humboldt's observations, for he often observed the oscillations in the vertical plane perpendicular to that meridian; and by decomposing the magnetic force in\nChap. III.\n\nMagnetism.\n\nTheory. The latter plane, and comparing it with its total action, which is exercised in the former, we may from these data calculate its direction, and consequently the direction of the needle (c). This inclination, thus calculated, is found always conformable to that which M. Humboldt observed directly. When he made his experiments, however, he could not foresee that they would be subjected to this proof by which M. Laplace verified them.\n\nAs the justness of these observations cannot be contested, we must allow also the truth of the result which they indicate, and which is the increase of the magnetic force proceeding from the equator to the poles.\n\nTo follow these results with more facility, it will be proper to set out from a fixed term; and it appears natural to make choice for that purpose of the points where the inclination of the magnetic needle is null, because they seem to indicate the places where the opposite action of the two terrestrial hemispheres is equal. The series of these points forms on the surface of the earth a curved line, which differs very sensibly from the terrestrial equator, deviating from it to the south of the Atlantic ocean, and to the north in the fourth sea. M. Humboldt found this equator in Peru about 7° 1' S. Lat., which for that part of the earth places it nearly in the spot where Wilke and Lemoine had fixed it.\n\nThe places situated to the north of that point may be divided into four zones, the three first of which, being nearer the equator, are about 4° of latitude, while the latter, more extensive and more variable, is 14°. So that the system of these zones extends in America from the magnetic equator to 23° of north latitude, and comprehends in longitude an interval of about 50°.\n\nThe first zone extends from 7° 1' of south latitude to 2° 54'. The mean number of the oscillations of the needle in the magnetic meridian in 10' of time is there 211.9; no observation gives less than 211, or more than 214. From M. Humboldt's observations one might form a similar zone on the south side of the magnetic equator, which would give the same results.\n\nThe second zone extends from 2° 13' of south latitude to 3° 15' of north latitude. The mean term of the oscillations is there 217.9; they are never below 220, nor above 226.\n\nThe fourth zone, broader than the other two, extends from 9° 15' to 23° 8' of north latitude. Its mean term is 237; it never presents any observation below 229, nor above 240.\n\nWe are unacquainted, in regard to this part of the earth with the intensity of the magnetic force beyond the latitude of 23° north; and on the other hand, in Europe, where we have observations made in high latitudes, we have none in the neighbourhood of the equator; but we will not venture to compare these two classes of observations, which may belong to different systems of forces, as will be mentioned hereafter.\n\nHowever, the only comparison of results, collected in America by M. Humboldt, appears to us to establish with certainty the increase of the magnetic force from the equator to the poles; and, without wishing to connect them too closely with the experiments made in Europe, we must remark, that the latter accord so far also with the preceding as to indicate the phenomenon.\n\nIf we have thus divided the observations into zones parallel to the equator, it is in order that we may more easily show the truth of the fact which results from them, and in particular to render the demonstration independent of those small anomalies which are inevitably mixed with these results.\n\nThough these anomalies are very trifling, they are however, so sensible, and so frequently occur, that they cannot be ascribed entirely to errors in the observations. It appears more natural to ascribe them to the influence of local circumstances, and the particular attractions exercised by collections of ferruginous matters, chains of mountains, or by the large masses of the continents.\n\nOne of them, indeed, having carried to the Alps the magnetic needle employed in an aerial excursion, he found that its tendency to return to the magnetic meridian was constantly stronger in these mountains than it was at Paris before his departure, and than it has been found since his return. This needle, which made at Paris 83.9° in 10' of time, has varied in the following manner in the different places to which it was carried.\n\n(c) Let HOC (fig. 28.) be the plane of the magnetic meridian passing through the vertical OC; let OL be the direction of the needle situated in that plane, and OH a horizontal. The angle LOH will be the inclination of the needle, which we shall denote by I. If F represent the total magnetic force which acts in the direction OL, the part of this force which acts according to OC, will be F sine of I; but the magnetic forces which determine the oscillations of the needle in any plane, are to each other as the squares of the oscillations made in the same time. If we denote them by M, the number of oscillations made in 10' of time in the magnetic meridian, and by P, the number of oscillations made also in 10', in the perpendicular plane, we shall have the following proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{F \\sin I}{F} = \\frac{P^2}{M^2}\n\\]\n\nfrom whence we deduce\n\n\\[\n\\sin I = \\frac{P^2}{M^2}.\n\\]\n\nThe inclination then may be calculated by this formula when we have oscillations made in the same planes.\n\nIn like manner, by making a needle oscillate successively in several vertical planes, we might determine the direction of the magnetic meridian.\nThe experiments were made with the greatest care, conjointly with excellent observers, and always employing the same watch verified by small pendulums, and taking the mean terms between several series of observations, which always differed very little from each other. It appears thence to result, that the action of the Alps has a sensible influence on the intensity of the magnetic force. M. Humboldt observed analogous effects at the bottom of the Pyrenees; for example, at Perpignan. It is not improbable that they arose from the mists of these mountains, or the ferruginous matters contained in them; but whatever may be the cause, it is seen by these examples that the general action of terrestrial magnetism is sensibly modified by local circumstances, the differences of which may be perceived in places very little distant from each other. This truth will be further confirmed by the following observations.\n\nIt is to causes of this kind, no doubt, that we must ascribe the diminution of the magnetic forces observed in some mountains; a diminution which, on the first view, might appear contrary to the results obtained during various aerial voyages. This conjecture is supported by several observations of M. Humboldt. By making his needle to oscillate on the mountain of Guadalupe, which rises 338 toises above Santa-Fé, he found it in 10' of time give two oscillations less than in the plain. At Silla, near Caracas, at the height of 1316 toises above the coast, the diminution went so far as five oscillations; and on the other hand, on the volcano of Antifana, at the height of 2467 toises, the number of oscillations in 10 minutes was 230; though at Quito it was only 218, which indicates an increase of intensity. A similar effect was observed on the summit of Mount Genevre, at the height of 800 or 900 toises, as may be seen from the numbers already given; and on this mountain M. Biot found the greatest intensity of the magnetic force. He saw on the hill of La Superga, in the neighbourhood of Turin, an example of these variations equally striking. Observing, with Vafall, on this hill, at the elevation of 300 toises, they found 87 oscillations in 10 minutes of time. On the side of the hill they had 88.8 oscillations, and at the bottom, on the bank of the Po, they obtained 87.3. Though these results approach very near to each other, their difference is, however, sensible, and fully shows that their small variations must be considered as slight anomalies produced by local circumstances.\n\nThis examination leads us to consider the intensity of magnetism on the different points of the surface of the globe, as subject to two sorts of differences. One kind are general; they depend merely on the situation of the places in regard to the magnetic equator, and belong to a general phenomenon, which is the increase of the intensity of the magnetic forces in proportion as we remove from the equator; the other kind of variations, which are much smaller and altogether irregular, seem to depend entirely on local circumstances, and modify either more or less the general results.\n\nIf we consider terrestrial magnetism as the effect of an attractive force inherent in all the material particles of the globe, or only in some of these particles, which we are far from determining, the general law will be, the total result of the system of attraction of all the particles, and the small anomalies will be produced by the particular attractions of the partial systems of the magnetic molecules diffused irregularly around each point; attractions rendered more sensible by the diminution of the distance.\n\nIt now remains to consider the inclination of the magnetic needle in regard to the horizontal plane. It has been long known that this inclination is not everywhere the same; in the northern hemisphere the needle inclines towards the north; in the southern towards the south; the places where it becomes horizontal form the magnetic equator; and those where the inclination is equal, but not null, form on each side of that equator curved lines, to which the name of magnetic parallels has been given, from their analogy to the terrestrial parallels. One may see in several works, and particularly in that of Lemaire, entitled Lois du Magnétisme, the figure of these parallels, and their disposition on the face of the earth.\n\nIt evidently results from this disposition, that the inclination is in proportion as we recede from the magnetic equator; but the law which it follows in its increase, as has not yet, as far as appears to us, been given. To proceed to ascertain this law, however, would be of great utility; for the inclination seems to be the most constant of all the magnetic phenomena, and it exhibits much fewer anomalies than the intensity. Besides, if any rule well confirmed could be discovered on this subject, it might be employed with advantage at sea to determine the latitude, when the weather does not admit an observation of the sun; which is the case in various places during the greater part of the year. We have some reason to expect this application, when we see the delicacy of that indication in the observations of M. Humboldt, where we find 35' 6\" of difference between two towns so near each other as Nîmes and Montpellier. These motives have induced us to study with great interest the series of observations made by M. Humboldt in regard to the inclination; and it appears to us that they may be represented very exactly by a mathematical hypothesis, to which we are far from attaching any reality in itself, but which we offer merely as a commodious and sure mode of connecting the results.\n\nTo discover this law, we must first exactly determine the position of the magnetic equator, which is as an intermediate line between the northern and the southern inclinations. For this purpose we have the advantage of being able to compare two direct observations, one of La Pérouse, and the other of M. Humboldt. The former found the magnetic equator on the coasts of Brazil at 10° 57' of south latitude, and 25° 25' of west longitude, counted from the meridian of Paris. The latter found the same equator in Peru at 7° 1' of south latitude, and 80° 41' of west longitude, also reckoning from the same meridian. These data are sufficient\ncient to calculate the position of the magnetic equator, supposing it to be a great circle of the terrestrial sphere; an hypothesis which appears to be conformable to observations. The inclination of this plane to the terrestrial equator is thus found to be equal to $12^\\circ 58' 56''$, and its occidental node on that equator is at $120^\\circ 2' 5''$ west from Paris, which places it a little beyond the continent of America, near the Gallipagos, in the South sea; the other node is at $59^\\circ 57' 55''$ to the east of Paris, which places it in the Indian seas.\n\n\"We do not give this determination as rigorously exact; some corrections might no doubt be made to it, had we a greater number of observations equally precise; but we are of opinion that these corrections would be very small, and it will be seen afterwards that, independently of the confidence which the two observations we have employed deserve, we have other reasons for entertaining this opinion.\"\n\n\"It is very remarkable that this determination of the magnetic equator agrees almost perfectly with that given long ago by Wilke and Lemouiner. The latter in particular, who for want of direct observations had discussed a great number of corresponding observations, indicates the magnetic equator in Peru towards $7^\\circ 20'$ of south latitude, and M. Humboldt found it in the same place at $7^\\circ 1'$; besides, Lemouiner's chart, as well as that of M. Wilke, indicates for the inclination of the magnetic meridian about $11^\\circ$, and they place the node about $140^\\circ$ of west longitude, reckoned from the meridian of Paris.\n\n\"Can it be by chance, then, that these elements, found more than 40 years ago, should accord so well with ours founded on recent observations? or does the inclination of the magnetic equator experience only very small variations, while all the other symptoms of terrestrial magnetism change so rapidly? We should not be far from admitting the latter opinion, when we consider that the inclination of the magnetic needle has changed at Paris $3^\\circ$ in 60 years since it has been observed; and that at London, according to the observations of Mr Graham, it has not changed $2^\\circ$ in 250 years, while the declination has varied more than $2^\\circ$ in the same interval, and has passed from east to west; but on the other hand the observation of the inclination is so difficult to be made with exactness, and it is so short a time since the art of measuring it with precision was known, that it is perhaps more prudent to abstain from any premature opinion on phenomena, the cause of which is totally unknown to us.\"\n\nTo employ the other observations of M. Humboldt in regard to the inclination, the terrestrial latitudes and longitudes reckoned from the magnetic equator were first reduced. The latter, being reckoned from the node of that equator in the South sea, M. Riot first perceived by these calculations that the position of that plane determined by preceding researches was pretty exact; for some of the places, such as Santa-Fé and Javita, where M. Humboldt observed inclinations almost equal, were found nearly on the magnetic parallel, though distant from each other more than $60^\\circ$ of longitude.\n\nWhen these reductions were made, M. Riot endeavoured to represent the signs of the inclinations observed, and to leave as little to chance as possible. He first tried a mathematical hypothesis conformable enough to the idea which has hitherto been entertained in regard to terrestrial magnetism.\n\nHe supposed in the axis of the magnetic equator, and at an equal distance from the centre of the earth, two centres of attractive forces, the one austral and the other boreal, in such a manner as to represent the two opposite magnetic poles of the earth. He then calculated the effect which ought to result from the action of\n\n(d) To calculate this position, let NEE' (fig. 29.) be the terrestrial equator; NHL the magnetic equator, supposed also to be a great circle, and HL the two points of that equator, observed by Messrs Humboldt and La Perouse. The latitudes HE, LE', and the arc EE', which is the difference of longitude of these two points, is known; consequently, if we suppose HE = b, LE' = b', EE' = v, EN = x, and the angle ENH = y, we shall have two spherical triangles NEH, NEL, which will give the following equations:\n\n$$\\tan x = \\frac{\\tan b \\cot y}{R}$$\n\n$$\\tan (x + v) = \\frac{\\tan b' \\cot y}{R}$$\n\nfrom which we deduce\n\n$$\\tan (x + v) = \\frac{\\tan b'}{\\tan b}$$\n\nand developing\n\n$$\\cot x = \\frac{\\tan b \\sin v}{\\tan b'} - \\cot v$$\n\nLet us now take an auxiliary angle $\\phi$ so that we may have\n\n$$\\tan \\phi = \\frac{\\tan b \\sin v}{\\tan b'}$$\n\nand we shall have\n\n$$\\tan x = \\frac{\\tan \\phi}{\\tan (v - \\phi)}$$\n\nBy these equations we may find x, and then y, by any of the first two.\n\n(e) La Perouse, after having doubled Cape Horn, fell in a second time with the magnetic equator in $18^\\circ$ north latitude, and $119^\\circ$ of longitude west from Paris. He was therefore very near the node of the magnetic equator, such as we have deduced it from observations. This fact establishes in a positive manner two important consequences: First, that the preceding determinations require only very slight corrections; and the second, that the magnetic equator is really a great circle of the earth, if not exactly, at least very nearly.\nof these centres in any point of the surface of the earth, making their attractive force reciprocally vary as the square of the distance; and in this manner he obtained the direction of the result of their forces, which ought to be that also of the magnetic needle in that latitude.\n\nHe supposes that the point B (fig. 30.) is the north magnetic pole of the earth, and that the point A is the south magnetic pole; he supposes also that there is in the point M, at the surface of the earth, a molecule of the auroral fluid which is attracted by B and repelled by A in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance; and he requires what will be the direction of the power resulting from these two forces acting on that molecule. It is evident that this direction will be that also which would be assumed in the point M by the needle of a compass freely suspended; for, in consequence of the smallness of the needle in comparison of the radius of the earth, the lines drawn from its points to one centre, B or A, may be considered as parallel, especially if the points A and B are near the centre of the earth, which is the case with nature, as may be seen.\n\nHe first supposes that the earth has a spherical figure, and that the two poles A and B are equal in force, and he then examines how far the latter supposition agrees with the results observed.\n\nLet AM then = D', BM = D, CP = x, PM = y, the angle MCP = u, CA = CB = a. He then makes a = Kr; r being = the radius of the earth, and K a constant but indeterminate quantity.\n\nLet X, Y, also be the forces which attract M in the direction of the axes of the co-ordinates, and β the angle which the resulting force makes with the axis ABC.\n\n\\[ \\tan \\beta = \\frac{x + a}{D^3} = \\frac{y(D^3 - D^3)}{(D^3 - D^3) - a(D^3 + D^3)} \\]\n\nand by putting for x, y and a, their values, cof. u; r fin. u, Kr;\n\n\\[ \\tan \\beta = \\frac{\\text{fin. } u}{\\text{cof. } u - K(D^3 + D^3)} \\]\n\n\\[ D^3 = r^3(1 + 2K \\text{ cof. } u + K^2); \\]\n\\[ D^3 = r^3(1 - 2K \\text{ cof. } u + K^2); \\]\n\nwhich gives the system of the two equations,\n\n\\[ \\text{fin. } u = K(D^3 + D^3), \\]\n\\[ \\text{cof. } u = K(D^3 - D^3). \\]\n\nThese equations determine the direction of the magnetic needle in regard to each point M, the distance of which from the magnetic equator is known; but it is seen that this direction depends on the quantity K, which represents the distance of the magnetic centres from the centre of the earth; this distance being expressed in parts of the terrestrial radius, we must therefore first determine this quantity from observations.\n\nTo do it in the manner of approximation, and thus acquire a first idea of the value of K, M. Biot chose an observation made by M. Humboldt at Carichiana in 6° 34' 5\" of north latitude counted from the terrestrial equator, and 79° 18' west longitude reckoned from the meridian of Paris, which gives 14° 5' 25\" of longitude counted from the magnetic equator, and 48° 51' 53\" of west longitude, proceeding from the node formed by that equator with the equator of the earth. The inclination of the magnetic needle was observed in that place by M. Humboldt in the month of Messidor, year 8, and found to be equal to 33° 78' of the centigrade division. A comparison of this result with the other observations of M. Humboldt, shows that it may indeed be considered as agreeing to that latitude.\n\nHe then gives the following equations, in which F is the magnetic force, at a distance equal to unity.\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{F}{D^3} \\text{ cof. } MBD - \\frac{F}{D^3} \\text{ cof. } MAD; \\]\n\\[ D^3 = y^3 + (x + a)^3 = r^3 + 2 \\text{ axis } + a^3; \\]\n\\[ Y = \\frac{F}{D^3} \\text{ fin. } MBD - \\frac{F}{D^3} \\text{ fin. } MAD; \\]\n\n\\[ D^3 = y^3 + (x - a)^3 = r^3 - 2 \\text{ axis } - a^3; \\]\n\nor, by putting for the cosines their values:\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{F(x - a)}{D^3} - \\frac{F(x + a)}{D^3}; \\]\n\\[ Y = \\frac{Fy}{D^3} - \\frac{Fy}{D^3}; \\]\n\nand as we have\n\n\\[ \\tan \\beta = \\frac{Y}{X}, \\]\n\nwe shall have also\n\n\\[ \\tan \\beta = \\frac{Y}{D^3} - \\frac{Y}{D^3}. \\]\n\n\\[ \\tan \\beta = \\frac{x + a}{D^3} = \\frac{y(D^3 - D^3)}{(D^3 - D^3) - a(D^3 + D^3)} \\]\n\nand by putting for x, y and a, their values, cof. u; r fin. u, Kr;\n\n\\[ \\tan \\beta = \\frac{\\text{fin. } u}{\\text{cof. } u - K(D^3 + D^3)} \\]\n\n\\[ D^3 = r^3(1 + 2K \\text{ cof. } u + K^2); \\]\n\\[ D^3 = r^3(1 - 2K \\text{ cof. } u + K^2); \\]\n\nwhich gives the system of the two equations,\n\n\\[ \\text{fin. } u = K(D^3 + D^3), \\]\n\\[ \\text{cof. } u = K(D^3 - D^3). \\]\n\nTo make use of it, M. Biot successively gave to K different values in the formula; he calculated the inclinations resulting from that latitude; and comparing these results with that which M. Humboldt really observed, the progress of the errors naturally led him to the most proper supposition. The following is a table of these trials.\n\n| Values of K | Inclinations of the Needle | Errors |\n|------------|---------------------------|--------|\n| K=1        | 7.73°                     | 26.04  |\n| K=0.6      | 18.80                     | 14.97  |\n| K=0.5      | 22.04                     | 11.73  |\n| K=0.2      | 29.38                     | 4.39   |\n| K=0.1      | 30.64                     | 3.13   |\n| K=0.01     | 31.04                     | 2.73   |\n| K=0.001    | 31.07                     | 2.7    |\n\nThe first value of K would place the centre of the magnetic forces at the surface of the earth and the poles of the magnetic equator. It is seen that this supposition cannot be admitted, because it would give an increase of inclination much less rapid than that indicated by observations. The case is the same with the following\nfollowing results, which place the centres of action on the terrestrial radius at different distances from the centre of the earth; but it is seen also in general, that they approach more and more to the truth in proportion as this distance becomes less; which evidently shows that the two centres of action of the magnetic forces are situated near the centre of the earth. All the other observations of M. Humboldt would also lead to the same consequence.\n\nThe most proper supposition would be to make K null, or so small that it would be needless to pay attention to it; which amounts to the same thing as to consider the two centres of action placed, as we may say, in the same molecule. The result, indeed, obtained in this manner is the most exact of all; it is $=31.0843^\\circ$; this value is still a little less than that which M. Humboldt observed, and the difference is $=2.69^\\circ$; but it must be considered also that the formula from which we derive these values supposes the position of the magnetic equator is perfectly determined; but it may not be so with the utmost exactness, according to the two only observations of La Perouse and Humboldt, which we have employed. It is therefore by studying the progress of the formula, and comparing it with the observations, that we are able to appreciate it justly; after which we may think of remedying the small errors with which it may be accompanied.\n\nTo obtain the result here mentioned, and which is, as it were, the limit of all those which may be obtained by giving to K different values, it is to be remarked that the quantity\n\n$$K \\left( \\frac{D^3 + D^3}{D^3 - D^3} \\right),$$\n\nor,\n\n$$K \\left( \\frac{(1 + 2K \\cos u + K^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} + (1 - 2K \\cos u + K^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{(1 + 2K \\cos u + K^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} - (1 - 2K \\cos u + K^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\right)$$\n\nbecomes $\\frac{O}{O}$ when K is null; but by applying to it the methods of known quantities, it will be found that its value in this supposition is really determinate and\n\n$$\\frac{1}{3 \\cos u}.$$ By substituting this in the formula we shall have\n\n$$\\tan \\beta = \\frac{\\sin u}{\\cos u - \\frac{1}{3 \\cos u}},$$\n\nan equation which may be reduced to this form:\n\n$$\\tan \\beta = \\frac{\\sin u}{\\cos 2u + \\frac{1}{3}},$$\n\nwhich will easily give the value of $\\beta$; and when this value is known, we shall have the inclination I, by the following formula:\n\n$$I = 100 + u - \\beta,$$\n\nwhich will serve throughout the whole extent of the two hemispheres.\n\nFrom the progress thus traced out, it is seen that the preceding formula is not merely an empirical construction of observations; on the contrary, it is totally independent, and only supposes the inclination of the magnetic needle to be produced by a magnet infinitely small, placed in the centre of the terrestrial surface; but by calculating from this formula the inclination for the different latitudes, M. Biot found precisely the same numbers as M. Humboldt observed either in Europe or America; and it is not his observations only that are represented in this manner; but those which have been made in Russia, and at Kola in Lapland, during the last transit of Venus, are also comprehended under the same law.\n\nIt is seen that the results of the formula deviate very little from the observations; but these differences may be rendered still smaller. By examining, indeed, the progress of the errors, it is seen that the numbers given by calculation are a little too small in America for the low latitudes, and a little too great for the high latitudes, which shows that the whole may be allowed, with some slight modifications, either by changing, however little, the node and inclination of the magnetic equator, which two observations cannot determine with the utmost exactness, or by displacing ever so little our small magnet, leaving, however, its centre in the plane of the magnetic equator, and placing it in such a manner that it shall be a little nearer America than Europe. It is by these observations themselves, when we shall have a greater number, that we must be guided in these small corrections.\n\nIn a word, it must not be expected that we can represent in a rigorous manner, by a mathematical law, all the inclinations observed; for the phenomenon of the inclination, though more regular than the other magnetic effects, is not free from some anomalies; this may be easily seen on constructing the curve given by the observations themselves. Thus, for example, the inclination observed at Popayan is $9^\\circ 10'$ greater than at St Carlos del Rio Negro, though the magnetic latitude of the latter is $3^\\circ 57'$ greater. The case is the same with observations made at Javita and Santa Fe. Other anomalies are discovered in the comparative progress of the observations and formula. This is the case in regard to Carichana, St Thomas de la Guyane, and Cartagena. The increase of the inclination from the first to the second of these points is by no means in harmony with the increase from the second to the third; and if we compare together the intensities observed in these different places, the anomalies they exhibit announce in some measure those which the inclination ought to experience.\n\nThe cause of these anomalies becomes evident from what has been already remarked; they are merely the effect of local circumstances, and arise from the small systems of attraction by which the general phenomena are modified. This must be sensible in particular for that part of America which M. Humboldt travelled over, and which is traversed throughout its whole length by the grand chain of the cordillera of the Andes. It is also in these places that the most considerable differences exist. Popayan, for example, is situated near the volcanoes of Sotara and Porce; it is joined to basaltic mountains abounding with magnetic iron. Near Sulumito, to the east of Popayan, these basaltic columns have very striking poles: in like manner Mexico is situated at the height of $1160$ toises on the ridge of the grand cordillera of Lenfchitlan; the ground there is covered with porous basaltes and amygdaloids.\ndaloids, which are almost all charged with magnetic iron. Must not all these causes have a sensible influence on the inclination of the magnetic needle; and must not the different dispositions of the ferruginous masses, or their change of state, in consequence of the action of nature, produce also variations? M. Humboldt made on this point a decisive observation: the earthquake of the 4th of November 1799 changed at Cumana the inclination of the needle. On the 1st of November it was $43^\\circ 6'$; on the 7th it was only $42^\\circ 75'$, and ten months after it returned to $42^\\circ 85'$, but it did not regain its former value; the intensity of the magnetic force was not changed by the effect of this earthquake.\n\nIt is proved, then, by these observations, that local circumstances may have on the inclination a sensible influence; and this influence is remarked in the countries traversed by M. Humboldt.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that the mathematical hypothesis which we have employed really expresses the law of nature, at least to the north of the magnetic equator; for, though the first results observed towards the south seem to bend to it also, the uncertainty under which we are, in regard to the true cause of these phenomena must stop our conjectures, and prevent us from extending too far the consequences of the laws which we observe (r).\n\nFrom the preceding results, we may calculate the points where the axis of the magnetic equator pierces the terrestrial surface; for their latitudes are equal to the complements of the obliquity of that equator, and their meridian is at $100^\\circ$ of longitude from its nodes. The north magnetic pole is found also at $70^\\circ 1' 4\"$ of north latitude, and at $30^\\circ 2' 5\"$ of longitude west from Paris, which places it to the north of America. The other magnetic pole, symmetric to the preceding, is situated in the same latitude south, and at $140^\\circ 67' 55\"$ of longitude east from Paris, which places it amidst the eternal ice; indications entirely analogous to those of Wilke and Lemounier.\n\nIf we could reach these poles, the compass would be seen vertical; but if any confidence can be placed in the law which we have discovered, this would be the only difference which would be observed in regard to the inclination, and we should be still as far distant as in Europe from the real centres which produce it. This result might appear to be of such a nature as to diminish the interest one might have in visiting these horrid regions, had we not also the hope of discovering there new phenomena in regard to the intensity of the magnetic force, and the influence of meteors.\n\nThese consequences do not entirely accord with the opinion pretty generally received, and which ascribes the increase of the magnetic effects towards the north to the great quantity of iron dispersed throughout these regions; but it appears to us that this opinion is not agreeable to the truth. The cordillera of the Andes contains an enormous quantity of magnetic iron; the native iron of Chaco, that problematic mass analogous to that of Pellas, and those of Xacatanes in Mexico, is found even under the tropics.\n\nOn seeing the inclinations of the compass so exactly represented in the hypothesis, they endeavoured to discover whether it could be applied to the intensities observed by M. Humboldt; but they found that it did not apply. It gives indeed, an increase of the magnetic forces from the equator to the pole; but this increase, which at first is too slow, becomes afterwards too rapid. M. Biot has not yet been able to try whether the final displacement of the terrestrial magnet will contribute towards representing them better; but it must be remarked, that the series of the intensities is extremely whimsical, and contains an infinite number of anomalies, so that local phenomena may have on this phenomenon a much more sensible influence than on the inclination.\n\nOn reviewing the results which have been given, it is seen that we have first determined the position of the magnetic equator by direct observations, which had never been done before; we have then proved that the magnetic force increases in proceeding from that equator to the poles; in the last place, we have given a mathematical hypothesis, which, when reduced to a formula, satisfies all the inclinations hitherto observed.\n\nSupposing, as has been done in this formula, the small corrections of which it is susceptible, its utility becomes evident, either for making known, in the course of time, the variations which may take place in the action of the terrestrial magnetism, or to ascertain or even foresee the value of the inclination, which in a great many cases is of the utmost importance.\n\nFor example, near the magnetic equator, the increase or diminution of the inclination will indicate to a vessel on a voyage whether she has gained or lost in latitude by currents. This knowledge of the latitude is sometimes as important as that of longitude. On the coasts of Peru, for example, the currents tend from Chiloé to the north and north-east with such force, that one may go from Lima to Guayaquil in three or four days, and two, three, and sometimes five months are necessary to return. It is consequently of the greatest importance for vessels coming from Chili which stretch along the coast of Peru, to know their latitude. If they go beyond the port to which they are bound, they must work to the southward, and every day's progress requires often a month of return. Unfortunately, the fogs which prevail during four or five months on the coast of Peru, prevent\n\n(r) Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope, Cape Horn, and New Holland, by different navigators, are very exactly represented by the above-mentioned formula; and it follows, that it extends also to the austral hemisphere. We hope soon to have numerous and very exact observations on the inclination of the needle in that part of the earth. But we have thought it our duty to add to our table such results as relate to it, and which we have been able to procure. We have inserted also two observations on the intensity, made with great care by M. Roffel, during the expedition of d'Entrecasteaux, which are very important, as they prove that the terrestrial magnetic force increases also in the austral hemisphere in proportion as one removes from the equator.\nTheory. prevent navigators from distinguishing the form of the coast; nothing is seen but the summits of the Andes, and that of the peaks which rise above that stratum of vapours; but the figure of it is so uniform that pilots fall into mistakes. They often remain 12 or 15 days without seeing the sun or stars, and during that interval they come to anchor, being afraid of overshooting their port; but if we suppose that the inclination of the magnetic needle in the ports to the south of Lima is known, for example at Chancay, Huaura, and Santa, the dipping needle will show whether it be, in regard to Lima, to the south or to the north. It will show at the same time opposite what point of the coast a vessel is; and this indication will be attended with more exactness than one could hope for, because in these seas the inclination varies with extraordinary rapidity. M. Humboldt, to whom we are indebted for these remarks, observed in these seas the following values.\n\n| Places | South Latitudes | Inclinations |\n|--------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Huaccey | 1° 0'           | 6.8°        |\n| Huaura  | 1° 3            | 9.00        |\n| Chancay | 1° 33           | 10.35       |\n\nThese observations prove that the error of three or four degrees in the inclination in these seas would produce but a degree of error in latitude; and, on account of the tranquillity of the Pacific ocean, the inclination may be observed to within a degree nearly. Frequent instances of such results may be seen in books of voyages. In like manner, if one knew exactly the inclination at the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, it would be very useful to navigators, who, when the Pamperos blow, remain 15 or 18 days without seeing the heavenly bodies, and go on different tracks for fear of losing the parallel of the mouth of that river.\n\nIn a word, the inclination may indicate also the longitude in these seas; and this method may be employed when others fail. A vessel which sails there in the direction of a parallel could not find its longitude either by a chronometer or the declination of Halley, unless a star could be seen, in order to take a horary angle or the magnetic azimuth. The dipping needle then throws light on the longitude amidst the thickest fogs. We point out this method as one of those which have only a local application; but hitherto little attention has been paid to it. These ideas may be extended and rectified by able navigators.\n\nIn general, if the inclination of the needle, and the law we have tried to establish, could be depended on, to observe the inclination and the terrestrial latitude would also be sufficient to determine the longitude; but we have not yet examined the extent of the errors of which this method may be susceptible, and consequently we confine ourselves to a mere indication of it.\n\nThe phenomenon of the inclination has in maritime observations a peculiar and very remarkable advantage, namely, that of not being subject to those great progressive variations which affect the declination. Without repeating what we have already said above on the supposed constancy of this phenomenon, it may be remarked that our formula even affords a new proof that it may comprehend in the same law the observations made many years ago in Lapland, those which La Caille brought back in 1751 from the Cape of Good Hope, Vol. XII. Part I.\n\nand those which M. Humboldt has lately made in America.\n\nIn short, when we tried to represent the inclinations in different latitudes by the supposition of a magnet infinitely small, very near the centre of the earth, and perpendicular to the magnetic equator, we did not pretend to consider that hypothesis as any thing real, but only as a mathematical abstraction useful to connect the results, and proper to ascertain in future whether any changes exist. In regard to the declination and intensity, we freely confess that we are entirely unacquainted with their laws or their causes; and if any philosopher is so fortunate as to bring them to one principle, which explains at the same time the variations of the inclination, it will no doubt be one of the greatest discoveries ever made. But this research, exceedingly difficult, requires, perhaps, before it be attempted, more observations, and in particular more precise observations, than have hitherto been collected. For this reason we have presented the preceding researches, imperfect as they are, hoping our readers will receive them with indulgence.\n\nWe would willingly have entered into a more full illustration of the theory of Epinus, and compared it with the phenomena noticed in Chap. II., but the important paper just given has taken up so much room, that this article is already extended to very nearly the utmost limits assigned to it. We must therefore content ourselves with giving some idea of the induction of magnetism by juxtaposition according to Epinus's hypothesis, and must refer for the rest to his Tentamen Theorie Electricitatis et Magnetismi, or to the abridgment of it in Van Swinden's work Sur l'Analogie de l'Electricité et du Magnetisme, tom. ii.\n\nLet NAS (fig. 31.) be a magnet, of which the part Induced next the north pole AN is overcharged, and let a bar magnetum of iron s B n be brought near the north pole of the magnet, so that their axes are in the same straight line. Now, in this theory, the overcharged pole N acts on the iron only by its redundant fluid, for that part of the fluid which is merely sufficient to saturate the iron will repel the fluid in B as much as the iron in AN attracts it, and of course can produce no change in B. In the same way SA acts on B merely by its redundant iron. Now, were the fluid in s B n immovable, no sensible effect would be produced on it; but as it is supposed to be easily moveable, the redundant fluid in AN will have the effect of repelling it towards n, till the resistance met with there, added to its own tendency to diffuse itself uniformly, just balances the repulsion of AN. In the mean time, however, an attraction exists between the redundant iron in AS, and the fluid in B, by which the latter would be drawn from B n, and condensed in B s, the attraction opposing the repulsion above mentioned; but since AS is more distant from every point of B than AN from the same point, the redundant fluid will prevail, and on the whole the fluid will be condensed towards n, and rarefied towards s. The more diffused we suppose the fluid and iron in the magnet to be, the more removed will be the centres of effort of its poles from their extremities, the smaller will be the action, and the difference of action of AN and AS, and of course the smaller the condensation towards n, and the rarefaction towards s. From this we learn...\nthat, according as the poles of a magnet are more counteracted, the greater will be its power of action; and as this is agreeable to observation, it gives additional credit to the hypothesis.\n\nNow, we see that the piece of iron \\( nB \\) is attracted in consequence of its fluid being repelled towards its remote extremity, and distributed something like the fluid in NAS. In this hypothesis magnetism is supposed to depend entirely on the diffusion of magnetic fluid. The iron \\( B \\) has become a magnet, and by having magnetism induced on it, is attracted by the magnet \\( A \\). In a similar way we might explain the action of the magnet, if its south or deficient pole were presented opposite to \\( B \\).\n\nWhen the notion of a magnetic fluid was once entertained, it is not surprising that philosophers, reasoning from the analogy between electricity and magnetism, and the different effects arising from the south and north pole of a magnet, should be led to the idea of the magnetic fluid being compounded of two fluids. Accordingly the hypothesis of two magnetic fluids has long been a favourite on the continent, where it has been chiefly supported by Coulomb and Haüy. As the experiments and observations of the former philosopher entitle him to the highest respect, we shall here give a sketch of his theory of magnetism.\n\n1. Coulomb admits of two magnetic fluids, one of which may be called the northern, and the other the southern fluid.\n\n2. The particles of each of these two fluids are mutually repulsive of each other; that is, the particles of the fluid \\( N \\) mutually repel each other, and the particles of the fluid \\( S \\) repel each other.\n\n3. There is a mutual attraction between the particles of one of these fluids and the particles of the other; or the particles of the fluid \\( N \\) attract and are attracted by the particles of the fluid \\( S \\).\n\n4. In the ordinary state of iron not magnetized, these two fluids are found mixed together, and hence a piece of ordinary iron under the usual circumstances exhibits no signs of magnetism.\n\n5. In a magnetized body these two fluids are separated, and this separation takes place as soon as we begin to magnetize the body; one of the fluids \\( N \\), retiring towards one extremity, and the other fluid \\( S \\) to the other extremity of the magnetized body.\n\n6. The attraction and repulsion of two magnetic bodies, when they approach each other, is the result of the mutual action of the two fluids.\n\nSuppose we have two needles \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). If we make them approach each other on the side of the two poles of the same name, \\( N \\) or \\( S \\), they will repel each other; but if they are made to approach on the side of different poles, as when the needle \\( A \\) presents its north pole to the south pole of the needle \\( B \\), they will attract each other. Here there are four forces in action; 1. the fluid \\( N \\) of the needle \\( A \\) repels the fluid \\( N \\) of the needle \\( B \\); 2. The same fluid \\( N \\) of the needle \\( A \\) attracts the fluid \\( S \\) of the needle \\( B \\); 3. The fluid \\( S \\) of the needle \\( A \\) repels the fluid \\( S \\) of the needle \\( B \\); and 4. The fluid \\( S \\) of the needle \\( A \\) attracts the fluid \\( N \\) of the needle \\( B \\). Now, if the extremity \\( N \\) of the needle \\( A \\) be very near the extremity \\( S \\) of the needle \\( B \\), the mutual attraction between the two fluids \\( N \\) and \\( S \\), will be stronger than the mutual repulsion between the two fluids \\( N, N \\), and the two fluids \\( S, S \\), and consequently the two needles will approach each other.\n\n7. The attraction and repulsion of the two magnetic fluids is in the direct ratio of the masses, and in the inverse ratio of the distances.\n\nThis important part of the theory Coulomb deduces from a series of very delicate experiments made with his magnetic bars, similar to those by which he proved the same law to take place with respect to the action of the electric fluid. See Electricity, Part IV. chap. ii.\n\n8. The magnetic fluid is entirely in the interior of magnetic bodies, for as the magnetic fluid moves with difficulty in the interior of a magnetic body, it cannot diffuse itself over the surface, which is the reason why filings of iron brought near a magnetic bar, remain attached to it.\n\n9. Consequently magnetic bodies can have no magnetic atmosphere.\n\n10. In a magnetic needle, the centres of magnetic action are near the extremities of the needle.\n\n11. A magnetic needle being broken in any place, each of its parts is found to have two poles.\n\n12. The forces which attract a needle towards one pole, are equal to those which draw it toward the other pole.\n\n13. Magnetic bodies do not act on other bodies susceptible of magnetism, in any other way than by attraction or repulsion; for the magnetic fluid remains entirely within the interior of these bodies.\n\n14. Magnetic attraction ought to be regarded as a particular power, analogous, however, to the power which we call universal gravitation, the only difference being, that gravitation acts very sensibly on all bodies, whereas magnetism acts most powerfully on iron.\n\n15. This magnetic power or attraction is therefore a particular power produced neither by impulsion, nor by the action of any other fluid.\n\nThough the instrument which is usually employed to measure the inclination of the magnetic needle is very simple in its construction, it is nevertheless liable to great errors, which in general arise from the almost absolute impossibility of placing the needle in all the positions it can take in equilibrium with regard to the effect of gravitation, that is to say, so that its centre of gravity may always exactly agree with the point on which it turns. When the dimensions are considerable, a new inconvenience arises from a degree of flexure, which, though scarcely sensible, is nevertheless productive of very great effects from the slightest displacement of the centre of gravity producing a combination of the power of gravitation with that of magnetism.\n\nTo obviate these difficulties, Citizen Coulomb, instead of endeavouring to ascertain immediately, as has been hitherto done, the direction of the magnetic needle in the vertical plane which passes through the magnetic pole, conceives the force of this pole to be decomposed or resolved into two others in the same plane, the one acting in a horizontal, and the other in a vertical direction. He determines separately the intensity of each of these last forces, and the result gives the direction in which the magnetic force acts, and which a needle governed singly by this force would take.\n\nCitizen\nCitizen Coulomb has proved, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for the year 1789, that the magnetic needle suspended by its centre of gravity is incessantly brought back to its true direction by a constant force at the same place and time. It thence follows, that by observing the number of oscillations made in a given time by a needle horizontally suspended, the ratio of the horizontal component part of the magnetic power with gravity may be obtained. As to the vertical component part, it is measured by determining with care the weight necessary to be added to the southern part of the magnetic needle, to maintain it in a perfectly horizontal position. That being done, if A and B represent the respective measures of the horizontal and vertical component parts of the magnetic power, \\( \\frac{B}{A} \\) will be the tangent of the angle made by their result with the horizontal force, and consequently, it will be the inclination of the magnetic needle.\n\nIn the experiments made by Citizen Coulomb, the needle had the form of a right angled parallelopipedon, very thin in proportion to its breadth, and always suspended so that its breadth was kept in a vertical plane. Let P represent the weight of the needle, \\( l \\) the half of its length, \\( \\lambda \\) the length of a pendulum that performs its oscillations in the same time as the needle when it obeys the magnetic power in a horizontal plane. Coulomb then gives the formula\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P}{3 \\lambda}\n\\]\n\nto calculate the momentum of the magnetic force referred to the arm of a lever of one millimeter in length. The length of the needle was 427 millimeters, its breadth 13, and its weight 88,753 milligrammes. It was suspended horizontally by a thread of silk in a box well closed, and it made 30 oscillations in 286 seconds, and by applying these data to the preceding formula, Coulomb found that the logarithm of the momentum of the horizontal magnetic force is 4.1742.\n\nCoulomb having placed his needle in a clip, having knife edges, which rested on two cylinders of glass, in the manner of the beam of a balance, endeavoured first to bring it to an equilibrium in a horizontal situation coinciding with the magnetic meridian, by placing the edges in a proper manner, and when they were sufficiently near the point where the equilibrium took place, he completed it by the addition of small weights. He then reversed the poles of the needle by the magnetic touch, but without altering the position of the clip, and again bringing it to an equilibrium in this new state, the sum of the momenta of the additional weights placed in these two operations gave him the double of the momentum of the vertical component parts of the magnetic force, valued at \\( \\frac{74467}{2} \\). The result of this force, and of the horizontal force, is inclined 68° 9'.\n\nIn repeating these operations three times, Coulomb found successively 68° 9', 68° 13', and 68° 11'. Though the differences of these results are very trifling, he thinks they are to be entirely attributed to errors in the observation; for he is assured they do not amount to so much. It is possible that the needle is subject to variations in the vertical similar to those which are known to take place in the horizontal plane.\n\nDaniel Bernoulli contrived an ingenious dipping needle that may answer the purpose of an universal instrument for making accurate observations on the dip. It depends on the following principle. If a dipping needle be made by an ordinary workman, and balanced dipping with some care, so that when impregnated with magnetism, it may show nearly the true dip, and if it be touched, and the dip observed, then its magnetism destroyed, and its balance so altered, that without any magnetism it will take nearly the inclination of the true dip; and if it be then touched again, giving it the same polarity as it had before, it is evident that it will now approach very nearly to the true dip, since, by its want of perfect equilibrium it was deranged only a few degrees from its proper direction. If the second observation of the dip should, from the inaccurate formation of the needle, differ considerably from the first, the operation must be repeated; and in this third observation there will very seldom be an error of more than half a degree.\n\nBernoulli's instrument is as follows. A very light graduated brass circle EFG (fig. 32.) is fixed on one side of the dipping needle, so as to be concentric with its axis, and the whole is balanced with as much nicety as may be, before being impregnated. CD is a very light index fixed to the axis in such a manner as to turn on it with some difficulty. By this the equilibrium of the needle will be destroyed. If great care has been taken in forming the instrument, and if it has been balanced with great accuracy, it will, by the addition of the index, be made to settle so as to have the index perpendicular to the horizon, at whatever degree of the circle the needle may happen to point. As such accuracy, however, is scarcely to be expected, let the index be set to several different degrees of the circle, and note the inclination taken by the needle before being magnetized, corresponding to each position of the index, and let all these be written down. For example, let us suppose that when the index is at 50°, the needle inclines 46° from the horizon; if we observe at any place that the needle, after being magnetized, inclines 46°, when the index is at 50°, we may be sure that the former is the true magnetic dip at that place, as the needle is not deranged by the magnetism that has been given it, from the situation it would assume by gravity alone. We usually know something of the dip that may be expected at any place. If we set the index accordingly, and if the needle does not then point out the expected dip, change the position of the index, and again observe the dip; examine whether this second position of the index and the second dip form a corresponding pair of numbers, such as we have written down; if they do, we have got the true dip; but if not, another position of the index must be tried. Thus, by noticing whether the agreement of this last pair be greater or less than that of the former pair of numbers, we learn whether we are to change the position of the index in the same or in the opposite direction.\n\nA close analogy has long been remarked between the phenomena of magnetism and those of induced electricity, especially those of attraction and repulsion. The mechanical composition of these actions produces a directive power and polarity, both in electrical and magnetical bodies. It is easy to form an electrical needle that will arrange itself with respect to the overcharged and undercharged ends of a body electrified by position, just as a magnetic...\nmagnetic needle arranges itself with respect to the magnet. A stick of sealing wax may be touched in a manner similar to the double magnetic touch, so as to acquire poles of considerable force, and very durable. Again, melted sealing wax, when cooled in the neighbourhood of a positive and negative electric, acquires permanent poles, just as a red hot steel bar acquires them by being quenched near a magnet. Lastly, lightning sometimes gives polarity to needles, sometimes destroys it, and sometimes reverses their polarity.\n\nFrom these various circumstances of resemblance, some have supposed that both phenomena originate from the same cause, but there are several circumstances which show their original causes to be different. Thus, we find that electricity is common to all bodies, and can be excited or induced on all in a degree that is pretty nearly equal. Magnetism, on the contrary, though from Coulomb's experiments, it appears in some degree to affect all terrestrial bodies, acts, however, very imperceptibly on all but iron and its compounds. The action of lightning must not be considered as a proof of their identity, since that is accompanied with a great degree of heat, and we have already seen that this power, under favourable circumstances, is a very active agent, both in producing and destroying magnetism. Again, there is nothing in magnetism like a body being entirely overcharged, or entirely undercharged, as in electricity; but a magnetic body having two poles, must always be overcharged at one extremity, and undercharged at the other. There is nothing in magnetism resembling that inconceivably rapid motion which we see in electricity. In fine, the only perfect resemblance is between the induced magnetism of common iron, and the induced electricity of a conductor. On the arguments that have been employed for and against the identity of magnetism and electricity, our readers may consult Van Swinden, Sur l'Analogie de l'Electricité, et du Magnétisme, and a tract by Æpinus De Similitudine Electricitatis et Magnetismi.\n\nSome late experiments of Ritter tend to show a greater analogy than has yet been supposed, between magnetism and that modification of electricity which we call galvanism.\n\nMr Ritter's first experiments with the magnet were on frogs. He found that a magnetic iron wire, with another not magnetic, excited a galvanic palpitation in these animals. Presently he observed, that the south pole excited stronger palpitations, and the north pole weaker, than the iron not magnetic. Having constantly noticed, that the metals most susceptible of oxidation excited the strongest palpitations, he inferred, that the south pole possesses a greater affinity for oxygen than simple iron, and the north pole less.\n\nThis supposition he confirmed by means of several chemical reagents. He placed a magnetic iron wire on pieces of glass in a plate of earthen ware, and poured upon it a very weak nitric acid. The south pole was attacked by the acid much more powerfully than the north; and was soon surrounded by a deposition of oxygen, the quantity of which greatly exceeded that of the other pole.\n\nThe different oxidability of the magnetic poles is very well exhibited likewise, by taking three small bottles of equal size, filled with water, either pure or slightly acidulated, and putting into one the south polar end of a magnetic wire, into a second the north polar end of a similar wire, and into the third the end of an equal wire not magnetic; the south pole will first begin to deposit oxide, the unmagnetic iron a little after, and the north pole last. This experiment requires considerable care. The surface of the water must be covered with very fresh oil of almonds, to exclude all access of air. Care must be taken too, that one of the bottles is not more exposed to the sun than the others, because light accelerates oxidation. Ritter convinced himself of this by direct experiments; exposing two iron wires in water to the sun, but covering one of the phials with black paper, when that in the phial left uncovered was oxidated much more quickly.\n\nIf infusion of litmus be substituted instead of the water in the three phials in the preceding experiment, the relative oxidations will be the same, but they will be attended with a change of colour, showing that an acid is produced proportional to each oxidation; so that the south pole not only undergoes the greatest oxidation, but likewise reddens the infusion of litmus most. The action that takes place in this experiment is very feeble, and frequently requires a week to produce a distinct effect; and indeed to accelerate it so much as this, it is necessary to add, previously to the infusion, as much acetic acid as will incline it to red, without completely changing its colour. The infusion reddened in this experiment resumes its blue colour on exposure to the air; but we must not hence conclude, that the acid produced by the action of the magnet is very volatile, for infusion of litmus reddened by phosphoric acid, or any other, exhibits the same phenomenon.\n\nThe following experiment exhibits some things peculiar, and therefore we shall give it more at large. It has not been repeated, but the harmony of its results is in favour of its accuracy. Sixteen magnetic wires, of equal size and power, were placed in six vessels, all equally full of a mixture of one part nitric acid, and 36 parts water, in the following manner: in the first glass were placed two wires, one with the north pole immersed in the fluid, the other with the south, and not more than half a line asunder; in the second, the same, but the wires an inch and three-fourths apart; in the third and fourth were each three wires, with the south poles of all immersed, but their distances in the two glasses different, as in the first and second; in the fifth and sixth were wires similarly arranged, but with the north poles immersed. Different quantities of oxide were gradually depoised, and to express the whole in few words, we will call the south pole S, the north pole N, their greater distance g, and their less p, and we will express the order of oxidations as follows: SN g > SN p > 3 SP > 3 SG > 3 NP > 3 NG > . On the nineteenth day it was observed, that the loss of fluid by evaporation had not been equal in all the vessels, but took place in the inverse order of the oxidations. All the magnetic wires were weakened in power; NS g least; NS p more; of the wires 3 SP, two had lost less power than the third; and in like manner 3 SG, 3 NP, 3 NG, had each two left more powerful than the third; the strongest were equal to NS p.\n\nIn another experiment, where two little vessels filled with infusion of litmus were employed, one of them containing two magnetic wires, the south poles of which were immersed in the fluid; the other two similar wires,\nof which the opposite poles were immersed; the oxidation was greatest in the latter vessel.\n\nThe analogy between galvanism and magnetism is still farther proved by other experiments of Ritter on galvanizing metals, which he does by placing them in a stream of galvanic fluid proceeding from a strong pile. He found that a golden needle thus galvanized and balanced on a pivot, exhibited, like a magnetized iron needle, both directive power and horizontal inclination.\n\nSome late experiments of Ritter, referring still more directly to the analogy between magnetism and galvanism, were communicated to the Royal Academy of Sciences of Munich, and the following are their general results.\n\n1. Every magnet is equivalent to a pair of heterogeneous metals united together; its different poles represent as it were different metals.\n\n2. Like them, it gives electricity; that is to say, one of the two poles, the positive electricity, and the other the negative.\n\n3. By following the same process, a certain number of magnets, as well as a certain number of pairs of metals, afforded electricity; and in this manner the electricities afforded by the poles of different magnets, have been successfully indicated by the electrometer.\n\n4. By means of these electricities, one of these batteries of magnets, accordingly as it is more or less strong, produces upon dead and living bodies, all the phenomena which are produced by a pile of Volta, of the common kind, and of the same force.\n\nErratum.—Page 376, column 2d. line 19.

M. Mesmer, a physician of the same country, by adopting the principles of Hehl, became the direct founder of the system; but, afterwards deviating from the tenets of his instructor, he lost his patronage, as well as that of Dr Ingenhousz, which he had formerly enjoyed. Mesmer had already distinguished himself by \"A dissertation on the influence of the Stars upon the human body,\" which he publicly defended in a thesis before the university of Vienna; but he\nAnimal Magnetism and Ingenhouz, that his system fell almost instantly into disrepute. Mesmer appealed to the Academy of Sciences at Berlin; but they rejected his principles as delusive of foundation, and unworthy of the smallest attention. He then made a tour through Germany, publishing everywhere the great cures he performed by means of his animal magnetism, while his enemies everywhere pursued him with detections of the falsehood of his assertions.\n\nMesmer, still undaunted by so many defeats, returned to Vienna; but meeting there with no better success than before, he retired to Paris in the beginning of the year 1778. Here he met with a very different reception. He was first patronized by the author of the Dictionnaire des Merveilles de la Nature; in which work a great number of his cures were published, Mesmer himself receiving likewise an ample testimony of his candour and solid reasoning. Our physician soon collected some patients; and in the month of April 1778 retired with them to Creteil, from whence he in a short time returned with them perfectly cured. His success was now as great as his former disappointment. Patients increased so rapidly that the doctor was soon obliged to take in pupils to assist him in his operations. These pupils succeeded equally well as Mesmer himself; and so well did they take care of their own emoluments, that one of them named M. Delon realized upwards of 100,000l. sterling. In 1779 Mesmer published a memoir on the subject of Animal Magnetism, promising afterwards a complete work upon the same, which should make as great a revolution in philosophy as it had already done in medicine.\n\nThe new system now gained ground daily; and soon became so fashionable, that the jealousy of the faculty was roused, and an application concerning it was made to government. In consequence of this a committee was appointed to inquire into the matter, consisting partly of physicians and partly of members of the Royal Academy of Sciences, with Dr Benjamin Franklin at their head. This was a thunderstroke to the supporters of the new doctrine.—Mesmer himself refused to have any communication with the committee; but his most celebrated pupil Delon was less scrupulous, and explained the principles of his art in the following manner:\n\n1. Animal magnetism is an universal fluid, constituting an absolute plenum in nature, and the medium of all mutual influence between the celestial bodies, and betwixt the earth and animal bodies.\n\n2. It is the most subtle fluid in nature; capable of a flux and reflux, and of receiving, propagating, and continuing all kinds of motion.\n\n3. The animal body is subjected to the influences of this fluid by means of the nerves, which are immediately affected by it.\n\n4. The human body has poles and other properties analogous to the magnet.\n\n5. The action and virtue of animal magnetism may be communicated from one body to another, whether animate or inanimate.\n\n6. It operates at a great distance without the intervention of any body.\n\n7. It is increased and reflected by mirrors; communicated, propagated, and increased by sound; and may be accumulated, concentrated, and transported.\n\n8. Notwithstanding the universality of this fluid, all animal bodies are not equally affected by it; on the other hand, there are some, though but few in number, the presence of which destroys all the effects of animal magnetism.\n\n9. By means of this fluid nervous disorders are cured immediately, and others mediately; and its virtues, in short, extend to the universal cure and preservation of mankind.\n\nFrom this extraordinary theory, Mesmer or M. Delon, had fabricated a paper, in which he stated that there was in nature but one disease and one cure, and that this cure was animal magnetism: and lastly, M. Delon engaged, 1. To prove to the commissioners, that such a thing as animal magnetism existed; 2. To prove the utility of it in the cure of diseases; after which he was to communicate to them all that he knew upon the subject. The commissioners accordingly attended in the room where the patients underwent the magnetical operations. The apparatus consisted of a circular platform made of oak, and raised about a foot and a half from the ground; which platform was called the banquet. At the top of it were a number of holes, in which were iron rods with moveable joints for the purpose of applying them to any part of the body. The patients were placed in a circle round, each touching an iron rod, which he could apply to any part of the body at pleasure; they were joined to one another by a cord passing round their bodies, the design being to increase the effect by communication. In the corner of the room was a piano forte, on which some airs were played, occasionally accompanied with a song. Each of the patients held in his hand an iron rod ten or twelve feet long; the intention of which, as Delon told the commissioners, was to concentrate the magnetism in its point, and thus to render its effects more sensible. Sound is another conductor of this magnetism; and in order to communicate the magnetism to the piano forte, nothing more is necessary than to bring the iron rod near it. Some magnetism is also furnished by the person who plays it; and this magnetism is transmitted to the patients by the sounds. The internal part of the platform was said to be so contrived as to concentrate the magnetism, and was the reservoir whence the virtue diffused itself among the patients. Its structure, however, is not mentioned; but the committee satisfied themselves, by means of a needle and electrometer, that neither common magnetism nor electricity was concerned.\n\nBesides the different ways of receiving the magnetism already mentioned, viz. by the iron, cord, and piano forte, the patients also had it directly from the doctor's finger, and a rod which he held in his hand, and which he carried about the face, head, or such parts of the patient as were diseased; observing always the direction of what he called the poles. The principal application of magnetism, however, was by pressure of the hands or fingers on the hypochondria or lower regions of the stomach.\n\nThe effects of these operations upon Delon's patients were very different. Some felt nothing, neither had the magnetism any effect whatever upon them.\nSome spit, coughed, fweat, and felt, or pretended to feel, extraordinary heats in different parts of the body. Many women, but very few men, had convulsions, which Deflon called their crises, &c.—The commissioners at last found that they could come to no satisfactory conclusion while they attended in this public way, and therefore determined to try the experiments themselves privately. As the fluid itself, however, was totally imperceptible by any of the senses, they could only ascertain themselves of its existence by ultimately curing diseases, or by its observable effects upon the human body. Being well assured, however, that though many diseases were cured, it would not amount to any proof of the existence of animal magnetism, they determined to observe its effects on the animal economy. For this purpose they made the following experiments:\n\n1. They tried it upon themselves, and felt nothing.\n2. Seven of Deflon’s patients were magnetized at Dr Franklin’s house, four of whom felt nothing; three felt, or affected to feel, something.\n3. Several persons in a higher sphere of life were magnetized, and felt nothing.\n4. The commissioners, now determined to discover what share imagination had in this business, blindfolded several of the common people, and made them sometimes think that they were magnetized, at other times they magnetized them without letting them know that they did so: the consequence was, that when they supposed themselves magnetized, the patients likewise thought they felt something, and vice versa.\n\n5. A magnetized tree was said to produce convulsions; a young man, blindfolded, fell into convulsions when he imagined himself near the tree, though he was really at a considerable distance from it. Deflon accounted for this on the principle of all trees being magnetic: but in this case, every one, susceptible of magnetism, would be seized with convulsions when he approached a tree. The same influence of imagination was observed in a woman accustomed to have convulsions when magnetized. They came on when nothing was done to her, on being told, when blinded, that she was magnetized.\n\nOther instances are given, from which it was evident, either that the patients were impostors, or in such a most wretched state of debility both of mind and body, that the most trifling effects of the former had the most powerful effects on the latter. The commissioners therefore entirely disapproved of the whole. The touch, imitation, and imagination, they concluded, were the great causes of the effects produced by M. Deflon’s operations; and by means of these they supposed, that convulsions, which in themselves are a very violent disorder, might be spread much farther than could be wished, even through a whole city. It was observed that the operator sometimes pressed strongly, and for a length of time, upon different parts of the body, particularly the hypochondria and pit of the stomach; and it is well known that a strong pressure on these parts will produce disagreeable sensations in those who enjoy perfect health.\n\nIt is needless to add more upon this subject, than that Mesmer complained of the report of the commissioners, petitioned parliament, was by them commanded to disprove the mysteries of his doctrine; and that it is now exploded by every man of sense.—The conclusion of the academicians concerning it was, that it is not entirely useless even to philosophy; as it is one fact more to be confounded to the history of the errors and illusions of the human mind, and a signal instance of the power of imagination.\n\nMAGNIFYING, the making of objects appear larger than they would otherwise do; whence convex lenses, which have the power of doing this, are called magnifying glasses.
