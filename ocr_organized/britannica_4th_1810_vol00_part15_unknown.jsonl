It fees both hemispheres, has two summers and a double winter, and enjoys all the variety of climates which the earth affords. It is washed by the two great oceans. To the eastward it has the Atlantic, which divides it from Europe and Africa; to the west it has the Pacific or Great South Sea, by which it is separated from Asia. By these seas it may, and does, carry on a direct commerce with the other three parts of the world.\n\nAmerica is not of equal breadth throughout its whole extent; but is divided into two great continents, called North and South America, by an isthmus 1500 miles long, and which at Darien, about Lat. 9° N. is only 60 miles over. This isthmus forms with the northern and southern continents, a vast gulf, in which lie a great number of islands, called the West Indies, in contradiction to the eastern parts of Asia, which are called the East Indies.\n\nBetween the New World and the Old, there are several very striking differences; but the most remarkable is the general predominance of cold throughout the whole extent of America. Though we cannot, in any country, determine the precise degree of heat merely by the distance of the equator, because the elevation above the sea, the nature of the soil, &c. affect the climate; yet, in the ancient continent, the heat is much more in proportion to the vicinity to the equator than in any part of America. Here the rigour of the frigid zone extends over half that which should be temperate by its position. Even in those latitudes where the winter is scarcely felt on the old continent, it reigns with great severity in America, though during a short period. Nor does this cold, prevalent in the new world, confine itself to the temperate zones; but extends its influence to the torrid zone also, considerably mitigating the excess of its heat. Along the eastern coast, the climate, though more similar to that of the torrid zone in other parts of the earth, is nevertheless considerably milder than in those countries of Asia and Africa which lie in the same latitude. From the southern tropic to the extremity of the American continent, the cold is said to be much greater than in parallel northern latitudes even of America itself.\n\nFor this so remarkable difference between the climate of the new continent and the old, various causes have been assigned by different authors. The following is the opinion of the learned Dr Robertson on this subject. \"Though the utmost extent of America towards the north be not yet discovered, we know that its rear advances nearer to the pole than either Europe or Asia. The latter have large seas to the north, which are open during part of the year; and, even when covered with ice, the wind that blows over them is less intense than that which blows over land in the same latitudes. But, in America, the land stretches from the river St Lawrence towards the pole, and spreads out immensely to the west. A chain of enormous mountains, covered with snow and ice, runs through all this dreary region. The wind passing over such an extent of high and frozen land, becomes so impregnated with cold, that it acquires a piercing keenness, which it retains in its progress through warmer climates; and is not entirely mitigated until it reach the gulf of Mexico. Over all the continent of North America, a north-westerly wind and excessive cold are synonymous terms. Even in the most sultry weather, the moment that the wind veers to that quarter, its penetrating influence is felt in a transition from heat to cold no less violent than sudden. To this powerful cause we may ascribe the extraordinary dominion of cold, and its violent inroads into the southern provinces in that part of the globe.\n\nOther causes, no less remarkable, diminish the active power of heat in those parts of the American continent which lie between the tropics. In all that portion of the globe, the wind blows in an invariable direction from east to west. As this wind holds its course across the ancient continent, it arrives at the countries which stretch along the western shore of Africa, inflamed with all the fiery particles which it hath collected from the sultry plains of Asia, and the burning sands in the African deserts. The coast of Africa is accordingly...\nAmerica. ingly the region of the earth which feels the most fervent heat, and is exposed to the unmitigated ardour of the torrid zone. But this same wind, which brings such an accession of warmth to the countries lying between the river of Senegal and Caffraria, traverses the Atlantic ocean before it reaches the American shore. It is cooled in its passage over this vast body of water; and is felt as a refreshing gale along the coasts of Brazil and Guiana, rendering those countries, though amongst the warmest in America, temperate, when compared with those which lie opposite to them in Africa. As this wind advances in its course across America, it meets with immense plains covered with impenetrable forests; or occupied by large rivers, marshes, and stagnating waters, where it can recover no considerable degree of heat. At length it arrives at the Andes, which run from north to south through the whole continent. In passing over their elevated and frozen summits, it is so thoroughly cooled, that the greater part of the countries beyond them hardly feel the ardour to which they seem exposed by their situation. In the other provinces of America, from Terra Firme westward to the Mexican empire, the heat of the climate is tempered, in some places, by the elevation of the land above the sea; in others, by their extraordinary humidity; and in all, by the enormous mountains scattered over this tract. The islands of America in the torrid zone are either small or mountainous, and are fanned alternately by refreshing sea and land breezes.\n\n\"The causes of the extraordinary cold towards the southern limits of America, and in the seas beyond it, cannot be ascertained in a manner equally satisfying. It was long supposed, that a vast continent, distinguished by the name of Terra Australis Incognita, lay between the southern extremity of America and the antarctic pole. The same principles which account for the extraordinary degree of cold in the northern regions of America, were employed in order to explain that which is felt at Cape Horn and the adjacent countries. The immense extent of the southern continent, and the rivers which it poured into the ocean, were mentioned and admitted by philosophers as causes sufficient to occasion the unusual sensation of cold, and the still more uncommon appearances of frozen seas in that region of the globe. But the imaginary continent to which such influence was ascribed having been searched for in vain, and the space which it was supposed to occupy having been found to be an open sea, new conjectures must be formed with respect to the causes of a temperature of climate, so extremely different from that which we experience in countries removed at the same distance from the opposite pole.\n\n\"The most obvious and probable cause of this superior degree of cold towards the southern extremity of America, seems to be the form of the continent there. Its breadth gradually decreases as it stretches from St Antonio southwards; and from the bay of St Julian to the straits of Magellan its dimensions are much contracted. On the east and west sides, it is washed by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. From its southern point, it is probable that an open sea stretches to the antarctic pole. In whichever of these directions the wind blows, it is cooled before it approaches the Magellanic regions, by passing over a vast body of water; nor is the land there of such extent, that it can recover any considerable degree of heat in its progress over it. These circumstances concur in rendering the temperature of the air in this district of America more similar to that of an infral, than to that of a continental climate; and hinder it from acquiring the same degree of summer heat with places in Europe and Asia, in a corresponding northern latitude. The north wind is the only one that reaches this part of America, after blowing over a great continent. But, from an attentive survey of its position, this will be found to have a tendency rather to diminish than augment the degree of heat. The southern extremity of America is properly the termination of the immense ridge of the Andes, which stretches nearly in a direct line from north to south, through the whole extent of the continent. The most fruitful regions in South America, Guiana, Brazil, Paraguay, and Tucuman, lie many degrees to the east of the Magellanic regions. The level country of Peru, which enjoys the tropical heats, is situated considerably to the west of them. The north wind, then, though it blows over land, does not bring to the southern extremity of America an increase of heat collected in its passage over torrid regions; but, before it arrives there, it must have swept along the summits of the Andes, and become impregnated with the cold of that frozen region.\"\n\nAnother particularity in the climate of America, is extreme its excessive moisture in general. In some places, in moisture of deed, on the western coast, rain is not known; but, in all other parts, the moistness of the climate is as remarkable as the cold. The forests wherewith it is everywhere covered, no doubt, partly occasion the moisture of its climate; but the most prevalent cause is the vast quantity of water in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, with which America is environed on all sides. Hence those places where the continent is narrowest are deluged with almost perpetual rains, accompanied with violent thunder and lightning, by which some of them, particularly Porto Bello, are rendered in a manner uninhabitable.\n\nThis extreme moisture of the American climate is large reproductive of much larger rivers there than in any vers, and other part of the world. The Danube, the Nile, the luxuriance Indus, or the Ganges, are not comparable to the Mif of vegetation, the river St Lawrence, or that of the Amazons; nor are such large lakes to be found anywhere as those which North America affords. To the same cause we are also partly to ascribe the excessive luxuriance of all kinds of vegetables in almost all parts of this country. In the southern provinces, where the moisture of the climate is aided by the warmth of the sun, the woods are almost impervious, and the surface of the ground is hid from the eye, under a thick covering of shrubs, herbs, and seeds. In the northern provinces, the forests are not encumbered with the same luxuriance of vegetation; nevertheless, they afford trees much larger of their kind than what are to be found anywhere else.\n\nFrom the coldness and the moisture of America, an Malignity extreme malignity of climate has been inferred, and as of climate inferred by M. de Pauw, in his Recherches Philosophiques. Hence, according to his hypothesis, the smallness and irregularity of the nobler animals, and the size and enormous multiplication of reptiles and insects.\n\nBut the supposed smallness and less ferocity of the American\nAmerican animals, the Abbé Clavigero observes, instead of the malignity, demonstrate the mildness and bounty of the climate, if we give credit to Buffon, at whose fountain M. de Paw has drank, and of whose testimony he has availed himself against Don Pernetty; Buffon, who in many places of his Natural History produces the smallness of the American animals as a certain argument of the malignity of the climate of America, in treating afterwards of savage animals, in tom. ii. speaks thus: \"As all things, even the most free creatures, are subject to natural laws, and animals as well as men are subjected to the influence of climate and soil, it appears that the same causes which have civilized and polished the human species in our climates, may have likewise produced similar effects upon other species. The wolf, which is perhaps the fiercest of all the quadrupeds of the temperate zone, is however incomparably less terrible than the tiger, the lion, and the panther, of the torrid zone; and the white bear and hyena of the frigid zone. In America, where the air and the earth are more mild than those of Africa, the tiger, the lion, and the panther, are not terrible but in the name. They have degenerated, if fierceness, joined to cruelty, made their nature; or, to speak more properly, they have only suffered the influence of the climate: under a milder sky, their nature also has become more mild. From climes which are immoderate in their temperature, are obtained drugs, perfumes, poisons, and all those plants whose qualities are strong. The temperate earth, on the contrary, produces only things which are temperate; the mildest herbs, the most wholesome pulse, the sweetest fruits, the most quiet animals, and the most humane men, are the natives of this happy clime. As the earth makes the plants, the earth and plants make animals; the earth, the plants, and the animals, make man. The physical qualities of man, and the animals which feed on other animals, depend, though more remotely, on the same causes which influence their dispositions and customs. This is the greatest proof and demonstration, that in temperate climes every thing becomes temperate, and that in intemperate climes every thing is excessive; and that size and form, which appear fixed and determinate qualities, depend, notwithstanding, like the relative qualities, on the influence of climate. The size of our quadrupeds cannot be compared with that of an elephant, the rhinoceros, or sea horse. The largest of our birds are but small, if compared with the ostrich, the condore, and eagles.\" So far M. Buffon, whose text we have copied, because it is contrary to what M. de Paw writes against the climate of America, and to Buffon himself in many other places.\n\nIf the large and fierce animals are natives of intemperate climes, and small and tranquil animals of temperate climes, as M. Buffon has here established; if mildness of climate influences the disposition and customs of animals, M. de Paw does not well deduce the malignity of the climate of America from the smaller size and less fierceness of its animals; he ought rather to have deduced the gentleness and sweetness of its climate from this antecedent. If, on the contrary, the smaller size and less fierceness of the American animals, with respect to those of the old continent, are a proof of their degeneracy, arising from the malignity of the climate, as M. de Paw would have it, we ought in like manner to argue the malignity of the climate of Europe from the smaller size and less fierceness of its animals, compared with those of Africa. If a philosopher of the country of Guinea should undertake a work in imitation of M. de Paw, with this title, Recherches Philosophiques sur les Européens, he might avail himself of the same argument which M. de Paw uses, to demonstrate the malignity of the climate of Europe, and the advantages of that of Africa. The climate of Europe, he would say, is very unfavourable to the production of quadrupeds, which are found incomparably smaller, and more cowardly than ours. What are the horse and the ox, the largest of its animals, compared with our elephants, our rhinoceroses, our sea horses, and our camels? What are its lizards, either in size or intrepidity, compared with our crocodiles? Its wolves, its bears, the most dreadful of its wild beasts, when beside our lions and tigers? Its eagles, its vultures, and cranes, if compared with our ostriches, appear only like hens.\n\nAs to the enormous size and prodigious multiplication of the insects and other little noxious animals, infected by putrefaction, was overrun with lizards, serpents, reptiles, and insects monstrous for size, and the activity of their poison, which they drew from the copious juices of this uncultivated soil, that was corrupted and abandoned to itself, where the nutritive juice became sharp, like the milk in the breast of animals which do not exercise the virtue of propagation. Caterpillars, crabs, butterflies, beetles, spiders, frogs, and toads, were for the most part of an enormous corpulence in the species, and multiplied beyond what can be imagined. Panama is infested with serpents, Carthagena with clouds of enormous bats, Porto Bello with toads, Surinam with kakaracuas, or cucarachas, Guadaloupe, and the other colonies of the islands, with beetles, Quito with nigus or chogos, and Lima with lice and bugs. The ancient kings of Mexico, and the emperors of Peru, found no other means of ridding their subjects of these insects which fed upon them, than the imposition of an annual tribute of a certain quantity of lice. Ferdinand Cortes found bags full of them in the palace of Montezuma.\" But this argument, exaggerated as it is, proves nothing against the climate of America in general, much less against that of Mexico. There being some lands in America, in which, on account of their heat, humidity, or want of inhabitants, large insects are found, and excessively multiplied, will prove at most, that in some places the surface of the earth is infected, as he says, with putrefaction; but not that the soil of Mexico, or that of all America, is stinking, uncleaned, vitiated, and abandoned to itself. If such a deduction were just, M. de Paw might also say, that the soil of the old continent is barren, and stinks; as in many countries of it there are prodigious multitudes of monstrous insects, noxious reptiles, and vile animals, as in the Philippine isles, in many of those of the Indian archipelago, in several countries of the south of Asia, in many of Africa, and even in some of Europe. The Philippine isles are infested with enormous ants and monstrous butterflies, Japan with scorpions, the south of Asia and Africa with serpents, Egypt with apes, Guinea and Ethiopia with armies of ants, Holland with field rats, Ukrania with toads,\nAmerica, as M. de Paw himself affirms; in Italy, the Campagna di Roma (although peopled for so many ages) with vipers, Calabria with tarantulas, the shores of the Adriatic sea with clouds of gnats; and even in France, the population of which is so great and so ancient, whose lands are so well cultivated, and whose climate is so celebrated by the French, there appeared, a few years ago, according to M. Buffon, a new species of field mice, larger than the common kind, called by him *surnolos*, which have multiplied exceedingly, to the great damage of the fields. M. Bazin, in his Compendium of the History of Insects, numbers 77 species of bugs which are all found in Paris and its neighbourhood. That large capital, as M. Bomare says, swarms with those disgusting insects. It is true, that there are places in America, where the multitude of insects and filthy vermin make life irksome; but we do not know that they have arrived to such excesses of multiplication as to depopulate any place, at least there cannot be so many examples produced of this cause of depopulation in the new as in the old continent, which are attested by Theophrastus, Varro, Pliny, and other authors. The frogs depopulated one place in Gaul, and the locusts another in Africa. One of the Cyclades was depopulated by mice; Amicus, near to Taracina, by serpents; another place, near to Ethiopia, by scorpions and poisonous ants; and another by scolopendras; and not so distant from our own times, the Mauritius was going to have been abandoned on account of the extraordinary multiplication of rats, as we can remember to have read in a French author.\n\nWith respect to the size of the insects, reptiles, and such animals, M. de Paw makes use of the testimony of M. Dumont, who, in his Memoirs on Louisiana, says, that the frogs are so large there that they weigh 37 French pounds, and their horrid croaking imitates the bellowing of cows. But M. de Paw himself says (in his answer to Don Fernetty, cap. 17.), that all those who have written about Louisiana, from Hennepin, Le Clerc, and Cav. Tonti, to Dumont, have contradicted each other, sometimes on one and sometimes on another subject. In fact, neither in the old or the new continent are there frogs of 37 pounds in weight; but there are in Asia and Africa serpents, butterflies, ants, and other animals, of such monstrous size, that they exceed all those which have been discovered in the new world. We know very well, that some American historians say, that a certain gigantic species of serpents is to be found in the woods, which attract men with their breath, and swallow them up; but we know also, that several historians, both ancient and modern, report the same thing of the serpents of Asia, and even something more. Megasthenes, cited by Pliny, said, that there were serpents found in Asia, so large, that they swallowed entire stags and bulls. Metrodorus cited by the same author, affirms, that in Asia there were serpents which, by their breath, attracted birds, however high they were, or quick their flight. Among the moderns, Gemelli, in vol. v. of his Tour of the World, when he treats of the animals of the Philippine islands, speaks thus: There are serpents in these islands of immoderate size; there is one called *ibin*, very long, which suspending itself by the tail from the trunk of a tree, waits till stags, bears, and alfo men pass by, in order to attract them with its breath, and devour them at once entirely.\" From whence it is evident, that this very ancient fable has been common to both continents.\n\nFurther, it may be asked, In what country of America could M. de Paw find ants to equal those of the Philippine islands, called *situm*, respecting which Hernandez affirms, that they were six fingers breadth in length and one in breadth? Who has ever seen in America butterflies so large as those of Bourbon, Ternate, the Philippine islands, and all the Indian Archipelago? The largest bat of America (native to hot shady countries), which is that called by Buffon *vampiro*, is, according to him, of the size of a pigeon. *La rougete*, one of the species of *Afia*, is as large as a raven; and the *rougete*, another species of *Afia*, is as big as a large hen. Its wings, when extended, measure from tip to tip three Parian feet, and according to Gemelli, who measured it in the Philippine islands, five palms. M. Buffon acknowledges the excess in size of the Asiatic bat over the American species, but denies it as to number. Gemelli says, that those of the island of Luzon were so numerous that they darkened the air, and that the noise which they made with their teeth, in eating the fruits of the woods, was heard at the distance of two miles. M. de Paw says, in talking of serpents, \"It cannot be affirmed that the new world has shown any serpents larger than those which Mr. Adanson saw in the deserts of Africa.\" The greatest serpent found in Mexico, after a diligent search made by Hernandez, was 18 feet long: but this is not to be compared with that of the Moluccas, which Bomare says is 33 feet in length; nor with the *anacondaja* of Ceylon, which the same author says is more than 33 feet long; nor with others of Asia and Africa mentioned by the same author. Lastly, the argument drawn from the multitude and size of the American insects is fully as weighty as the argument drawn from the smallness and scarcity of quadrupeds, and both detect the same ignorance, or rather the same voluntary and studied forgetfulness, of the things of the old continent.\n\nWith respect to what M. de Paw has said of the tribute of lice in Mexico, in that as well as in many other things he discovers his ridiculous credulity. It is true that Cortes found bags of lice in the magazines of the palace of King Axajacatl. It is also true, that Montezuma imposed such a tribute, not on all his subjects, however, but only on those who were beggars; not on account of the extraordinary multitude of those insects, as M. de Paw affirms, but because Montezuma, who could not suffer idleness in his subjects, resolved that that miserable lot of people, who could not labour, should at least be occupied in lousing themselves. This was the true reason of such an extravagant tribute, as Torquemada, Betancourt, and other historians relate; and nobody ever before thought of that which M. de Paw affirms, merely because it suited his preposterous system. Those disgusting insects possibly abound as much in the hair and clothes of American beggars as of any poor and uncleanly low people in the world: but there is not a doubt, that if any sovereign of Europe was to exact such a tribute from the poor in his dominions, not only bags, but great vellies, might be filled with them.\n\nAt the time America was discovered, it was found inhabited\nAmerica inhabited by a race of men no less different from those in the other parts of the world, than the climate and natural productions of this continent are different from those of Europe, Asia, or Africa. One great peculiarity in the native Americans is their colour, and the identity of it throughout the whole extent of the continent. In Europe and Asia, the people who inhabit the northern countries are of a fairer complexion than those who dwell more to the southward. In the torrid zone, both in Africa and Asia, the natives are entirely black, or the next thing to it. This, however, must be understood with some limitation. The people of Lapland, who inhabit the most northerly part of Europe, are by no means so fair as the inhabitants of Britain; nor are the Tartars so fair as the inhabitants of Europe who lie under the same parallels of latitude. Nevertheless, a Laplander is fair when compared with an Abyssinian, and a Tartar, if compared with a native of the Molucca islands. In America, this distinction of colour was not to be found. In the torrid zone there were no negroes, and in the temperate and frigid zones there were no white people. All of them were of a kind of red copper colour, which Mr Forster observed, in the Pefferys of Terra del Fuego, to have something of a gloo resembling that metal. It doth not appear, however, that this matter hath ever been inquired into with sufficient accuracy. The inhabitants of the inland parts of South America, where the continent is widest, and consequently the influence of the sun the most powerful, have never been compared with those of Canada, or more northerly parts, at least by any person of credit. Yet this ought to have been done, and that in many instances too, before it could be asserted positively as most authors do, that there is not the least difference of complexion among the natives of America. Indeed, so many systems have been formed concerning them, that it is very difficult to obtain a true knowledge of the most simple facts. If we may believe the Abbé Raynal, the Californians are swarthier than the Mexicans; and so positive is he in his opinion, that he gives a reason for it. \"This difference of colour,\" says he, \"proves, that the civilized life of society subverts, or totally changes, the order and laws of nature, since we find, under the temperate zone, a savage people that are blacker than the civilized nations of the torrid zone.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Dr Robertson clasps all the inhabitants of Spanish America together with regard to colour, whether they are civilized or uncivilized; and when he speaks of California, takes no notice of any peculiarity in their colour more than others. The general appearance of the indigenous Americans in various districts is thus described by the Chevalier Pinto: \"They are all of a copper colour, with some diversity of shade, not in proportion to their distance from the equator, but according to the degree of elevation of the territory in which they reside. Those who live in a high country are fairer than those in the marshy low lands on the coast. Their face is round; farther removed, perhaps, than that of any people from an oval shape. Their forehead is small; the extremity of their ears far from the face; their lips thick; their nose flat; their eyes black, or of a chestnut colour, small, but capable of discerning objects at a great distance. Their hair is always thick and flecked, and without any tendency to curl. At the first aspect, a South American appears to be mild and innocent; but, on a more attentive view, one discovers in his countenance something wild, distrustful, and full.\"\n\nThe following account of the native Americans is Don Ulloa's given by Don Antonio Ulloa, in a work entitled Mémoires philosophiques, historiques, et physiques, concernant la découverte de l'Amérique, lately published.\n\nThe American Indians are naturally of a colour bordering upon red. Their frequent exposure to the sun and wind changes it to their ordinary dusky hue. The temperature of the air appears to have little or no influence in this respect. There is no perceptible difference in complexion between the inhabitants of the high and those of the low parts of Peru; yet the climates are of extreme difference. Nay, the Indians who live as far as 40 degrees and upwards south or north of the equator, are not to be distinguished, in point of colour, from those immediately under it.\n\nThere is also a general conformation of features and person, which more or less characterizes them all. Their chief distinctions, in these respects, are a small forehead, partly covered with hair to the eyebrows, little eyes; the nose thin, pointed, and bent towards the upper lip; a broad face; large ears; black, thick, and lank hair; the legs well formed, the feet small, the body thick and muscular; little or no beard on the face, and that little never extending beyond a small part of the chin and upper lip. It may easily be supposed that this general description cannot apply, in all its parts, to every individual; but all of them partake so much of it, that they may be easily distinguished even from the mulattoes, who come nearest to them in point of colour.\n\nThe resemblance among all the American tribes is not less remarkable in respect to their genius, character, manners, and particular customs. The most distant tribes are, in these respects, as similar as though they formed but one nation.\n\nAll the Indian nations have a peculiar pleasure in painting their bodies of a red colour, with a certain species of earth. The mine of Guancavelica was formerly of no other use than to supply them with this material for dyeing their bodies; and the cinnabar extracted from it was applied entirely to this purpose. The tribes in Louisiana and Canada have the same passion; hence mimium is the commodity most in demand there.\n\nIt may seem singular that these nations, whose natural colour is red, should affect the same colour as an artificial ornament. But it may be observed, that they do nothing in this respect but what corresponds to the practice of Europeans, who also study to heighten and display to advantage the natural red and white of their complexions. The Indians of Peru have now indeed abandoned the custom of painting their bodies; but it was common among them before they were conquered by the Spaniards; and it still remains the custom of all those tribes who have preserved their liberty. The northern nations of America, besides the red colour which is predominant, employ also black, white, blue, and green, in painting their bodies.\n\nThe adjustment of these colours is a matter of great consideration with the Indians of Louisiana and in regard to ornaments of dress among the most polished nations. The business\nAmerica, business itself they call mañacher, and they do not fail to apply all their talents and affluency to accomplish it in the most finished manner. No lady of the greatest fashion ever consulted her mirror with more anxiety, than the Indians do while painting their bodies. The colours are applied with the utmost accuracy and adroitness. Upon the eyelids, precisely at the root of the eyelashes, they draw two lines as fine as the smallest thread; the same upon the lips, the openings of the nostrils, the eyebrows, and the ears; of which last they even follow all the inflexions and finuities. As to the rest of the face, they distribute various figures, in all which the red predominates, and the other colours are afforded so as to throw it out to the best advantage. The neck also receives its proper ornaments; a thick coat of vermilion commonly distinguishes the cheeks. Five or six hours are requisite for accomplishing all this with the nicety which they affect. As their first attempts do not always succeed to their wish, they efface them, and begin anew upon a better plan. No coquette is more fastidious in her choice of ornament, none more vain when the important adjustment is finished. Their delight and self-satisfaction are then so great, that the mirror is hardly ever laid down. An Indian mañachered to his mind is the vainest of all the human species. The other parts of the body are left in their natural state, and, excepting what is called a cachecol, they go entirely naked.\n\nSuch of them as have made themselves eminent for bravery, or other qualifications, are distinguished by figures painted on their bodies. They introduce the colours by making punctures on their skin, and the extent of surface which this ornament covers is proportioned to the exploits they have performed. Some paint only their arms, others both their arms and legs, others again their thighs; while those who have attained the summit of warlike renown, have their bodies painted from the waist upwards. This is the heraldry of the Indians; the devices of which are probably more exactly adjusted to the merits of the persons who bear them than those of more civilized countries.\n\nBesides these ornaments, the warriors also carry plumes of feathers on their heads, their arms, and ankles. These likewise are tokens of valour, and none but such as have been thus distinguished may wear them.\n\nThe propensity to indolence is equal among all the tribes of Indians, civilized or savage. The only employment of those who have preserved their independence is hunting and fishing. In some districts the women exercise a little agriculture in raising Indian corn and pumpkins, of which they form a species of aliment by bruising them together; they also prepare the ordinary beverage in use among them, taking care, at the same time, of the children, of whom the fathers take no charge.\n\nThe female Indians of all the conquered regions of South America practise what is called the urcu (a word which among them signifies elevation.) It consists in throwing forward the hair from the crown of the head upon the brow, and cutting it round from the ears to above the eye; so that the forehead and eyebrows are entirely covered. The same custom takes place in the northern countries. The female inhabitants of both regions tie the rest of their hair behind, to exactly in the same fashion, that it might be supposed the effect of mutual imitation. This, however, being impossible, from the vast distance that separates them, is thought to countenance the supposition of the whole of America being originally planted with one race of people.\n\nThis custom does not take place among the males. Those of the higher parts of Peru wear long and flowing hair, which they reckon a great ornament. In the lower parts of the same country they cut it short, on account of the heat of the climate; a circumstance in which they imitate the Spaniards. The inhabitants of Louisiana pluck out their hair by the roots from the crown of the head forwards, in order to obtain a large forehead, otherwise denied them by nature. The rest of their hair they cut as short as possible, to prevent their enemies from seizing them by it in battle, and also to prevent them from easily getting their scalp, should they fall into their hands as prisoners.\n\nThe whole race of American Indians is distinguished Remarkably by thickness of skin and hardness of fibres; circumstances which probably contribute to that inflexibility to bodily pain for which they are remarkable. An instance of this inflexibility occurred in an Indian who was under the necessity of submitting to be cut for the stone. This operation, in ordinary cases, seldom lasts above four or five minutes. Unfavourable circumstances in his case prolonged it to the uncommon period of twenty minutes. Yet all this time the patient gave no tokens of the extreme pain commonly attending this operation: he complained only as a person does who feels some slight uneasiness. At last the stone was extracted. Two days after, he expressed a desire for food, and on the eighth day from the operation he quitted his bed, free from pain, although the wound was not yet thoroughly closed. The same want of sensibility is observed in cases of fractures, wounds, and other accidents of a similar nature. In all these cases their cure is easily effected, and they seem to suffer less prevalent pain than any other race of men. The skulls that have been taken up in their ancient burying-grounds are of a greater thickness than that bone is commonly found, being from six to seven lines from the outer to the inner superficies. The same is remarked as to the thickness of their skins.\n\nIt is natural to infer from hence, that their comparative insensibility to pain is owing to a coarser and stronger organization than that of other nations. The ease with which they endure the severities of climate is another proof of this. The inhabitants of the higher parts of Peru live amidst perpetual frost and snow. Although their clothing is very light, they support and to this inclement temperature without the least inconvenience. Habit, it is to be confessed, may contribute a good deal to this, but much also is to be ascribed to the compact texture of their skin, which defends them from the impression of cold through their pores.\n\nThe northern Indians resemble them in this respect. The utmost rigours of the winter season do not prevent them from following the chase almost naked. It is true, they wear a kind of woollen cloak, or sometimes the skin of a wild beast, upon their shoulders; but besides that it covers only a small part of their body, it would appear that they use it rather for ornament than warmth. In fact, they wear it indiscriminately, in the severities of winter and in the most sultry heats of summer.\nAmerica, summer, when neither Europeans nor Negroes can suffer any but the lightest clothing. They even frequently throw aside this cloak when they go a hunting, that it may not embarrass them in traversing their forests, where they lay the thorns and undergrowth would take hold of it; while, on the contrary, they slide smoothly over the surface of their naked bodies. At all times they go with their heads uncovered, without suffering the least inconvenience, either from the cold, or from those coups de soleil, which in Louisiana are so often fatal to the inhabitants of other climates.\n\nThe Indians of South America distinguish themselves by modern dresses, in which they affect various tints. Those of the high country, and of the valleys in Peru, dress partly in the Spanish fashion. Instead of hats they wear bonnets of coarse double cloth, the weight of which neither seems to incommode them when they go to warmer climates, nor does the accidental want of them seem to be felt in situations where the most piercing cold reigns. Their legs and feet are always bare, if we except a sort of sandals made of the skins of oxen. The inhabitants of South America, compared with those of North America, are described as generally more feeble in their frame, less vigorous in the efforts of their mind, of gentler dispositions, more addicted to pleasure, and sunk in indolence.—This, however, is not universally the case. Many of their nations are as intrepid and enterprising as any others on the whole continent. Among the tribes on the banks of the Orinoco, if a warrior aspires to the post of captain, his probation begins with a long fast, more rigid than any ever observed by the most abstemious hermit. At the close of this the chiefs assemble; and each gives him three lashes with a large whip, applied so vigorously, that his body is almost flayed. If he betrays the least symptom of impatience, or even of sensibility, he is disgraced for ever, and rejected as unworthy of the honour. After some interval, his constancy is proved by a more excruciating trial. He is laid in his hammock with his hands bound fast; and an innumerable multitude of venomous ants, whose bite occasions a violent pain and inflammation, are thrown upon him. The judges of his merit stand around the hammock; and whilst these cruel insects fall upon the most sensible parts of his body, a sigh, a groan, or an involuntary motion expressive of what he suffers, would exclude him from the dignity of which he is ambitious. Even after this evidence, his fortitude is not deemed to be sufficiently ascertained, till he has stood another test more severe, if possible, than the former. He is again suspended in his hammock, and covered with the leaves of the palmetto. A fire of flaming herbs is kindled underneath, so as he may feel its heat, and be involved in smoke. Though scorched and almost suffocated, he must continue to endure this with the same patient insensibility. Many perish in this essay of their firmness and courage; but such as go through it with applause, receive the ensigns of their new dignity with much solemnity, and are ever after regarded as leaders of approved resolution, whose behaviour, in the most trying situations, will do honour to their country. In North America, the previous trial of a warrior is neither so formal nor so severe: Though, even there, before a youth is permitted to bear arms, his patience and fortitude are proved by blows, by fire, and by insults, more intolerable to a haughty spirit than either.\n\nOf the manners and customs of the North Americans more particularly, the following is the most complete account that can be collected from the best informed and most impartial writers.\n\nWhen the Europeans first arrived in America, they found the Indians quite naked, except those parts which even the most uncultivated people usually conceal. Since that time, however, they generally use a coarse blanket, which they buy of the neighbouring planters.\n\nTheir huts or cabins are made of stakes of wood driven into the ground, and covered with branches of trees or reeds. They lie on the floor either on mats or the skins of wild beasts. Their dishes are of timber; but their spoons are made of the skulls of wild oxen, and their knives of flint. A kettle and a large plate constitute almost the whole utensils of the family. Their diet consists chiefly in what they procure by hunting; and sagamite, or potage, is likewise one of their most common kinds of food. The most honourable furniture among them are the scalps of their enemies; with these they ornament their huts, which are esteemed in proportion to the number of this sort of spoils.\n\nThe character of the Indians is altogether founded upon their circumstances and way of life. A people who are constantly employed in procuring the means of a precarious subsistence, who live by hunting the wild animals, and who are generally engaged in war with their neighbours, cannot be supposed to enjoy much gaiety of temper, or a high flow of spirits. The Indians therefore are in general grave even to sadness: they have nothing of that giddy vivacity peculiar to some nations of Europe, and they despise it. Their behaviour to those about them is regular, modest, and taciturn, respectful. Ignorant of the arts of amusement, of which that of playing trifles agreeably is one of the most considerable, they never speak, but when they have something important to observe; and all their actions, words, and even looks, are attended with some meaning. This is extremely natural to men who are almost continually engaged in pursuits which to them are of the highest importance. Their subsistence depends entirely on what they procure with their hands; and their lives, their honour, and every thing dear to them, may be lost by the smallest inattention to the designs of their enemies. As they have no particular object to attach them to one place rather than another, they fly wherever they expect to find the necessaries of life in greatest abundance. Cities, which are the effects of agriculture and arts, they have none. The different tribes or nations are for the same reason extremely small, when compared with civilized societies, in which industry, arts, agriculture, and commerce, have united a vast number of individuals, whom a complicated luxury renders useless to one another. These small tribes live at an immense distance; they are separated by a desert frontier, and hid in the bosom of impenetrable and almost boundless forests.\n\nThere is established in each society a certain species of government, which over the whole continent of America prevails with exceeding little variation; because over the whole of this continent the manners and way...\nof life are nearly similar and uniform. Without arts, riches, or luxury, the great instruments of subjection in polished societies, an American has no method by which he can render himself considerable among his companions, but by superiority in personal qualities of body or mind. But as Nature has not been very lavish in her personal distinctions, where all enjoy the same education, all are pretty much equal, and will desire to remain so. Liberty, therefore, is the prevailing passion of the Americans; and their government, under the influence of this sentiment, is better secured than by the wisest political regulations. They are very far, however, from despising all sort of authority; they are attentive to the voice of wisdom, which experience has conferred on the aged, and they enlist under the banners of the chief in whose valour and military address they have learned to repose their confidence. In every society, therefore, there is to be considered the power of the chief and of the elders; and, according as the government inclines more to the one or to the other, it may be regarded as monarchical, or as a species of aristocracy. Among those tribes which are most engaged in war, the power of the chief is naturally predominant; because the idea of having a military leader was the first source of his superiority, and the continual exigencies of the state requiring such a leader, will continue to support, and even to enhance it. His power, however, is rather persuasive than coercive; he is reverenced as a father, rather than feared as a monarch. He has no guards, no prisons, no officers of justice, and one act of ill-judged violence would pull him from the throne. The elders, in the other form of government, which may be considered as an aristocracy, have no more power. In some tribes, indeed, there are a kind of hereditary nobility, whose influence being constantly augmented by time, is more considerable. (See the article NIAGARA.) But this source of power which depends chiefly on the imagination, by which we annex to the merit of our contemporaries that of their forefathers, is too refined to be very common among the natives of America. In most countries, therefore, age alone is sufficient for acquiring respect, influence, and authority. It is age which teaches experience, and experience is the only source of knowledge among a barbarous people. Among those persons business is conducted with the utmost simplicity, and which may recall to those who are acquainted with antiquity a picture of the most early ages. The heads of families meet together in a house or cabin appointed for the purpose. Here the business is discussed; and here those of the nation, distinguished for their eloquence or wisdom, have an opportunity of displaying those talents. Their orators, like those of Homer, express themselves in a bold figurative style, stronger than refined, or rather softened, nations can well bear, and with gestures equally violent, but often extremely natural and expressive. When the business is over, and they happen to be well provided with food, they appoint a feast upon the occasion, of which almost the whole nation partakes. The feast is accompanied with a song, in which the real or fabulous exploits of their forefathers are celebrated. They have dances too, though, like those of the Greeks and Romans, chiefly of the military kind; and their music and dancing accompany every feast.\n\nTo assist their memory, they have belts of small shells or beads, of different colours, each representing a particular object, which is marked by their colour and arrangement. At the conclusion of every subject on which they discourse, when they treat with a fo-Wampum reign state, they deliver one of those belts; for if this ceremony should be omitted, all that they have laid paffes for nothing. Those belts are carefully deposited in each town, as the public records of the nation; and to them they occasionally have recourse, when any public contest happens with a neighbouring tribe. Of late, as the materials of which those belts are made have become scarce, they often give some skin in place of the wampum (the name of the beads), and receive in return presents of a more valuable kind from our commissioners; for they never consider a treaty as of any weight, unless every article in it be ratified by such a gratification.\n\nIt often happens, that those different tribes or nations, scattered as they are at an immense distance from one another, meet in their excursions after prey. If there subsists no animosity between them, which seldom is the case, they behave in the most friendly and courteous manner; but if they happen to be in a state of war, or if there has been no previous intercourse between them, all who are not friends are deemed enemies, and they fight with the most savage fury.\n\nWar, if we except hunting, is the only employment of the men; as to every other concern, and even the little agriculture they enjoy, it is left to the women. Their most common motive for entering into war, when it does not arise from an accidental encounter or interference, is either to revenge themselves for the death of some lost friends, or to acquire prisoners who may assist them in their hunting, and whom they adopt into their society. These wars are either undertaken by some private adventurers, or at the instance of the whole community. In the latter case, all the young men who are disposed to go out to battle (for no one is compelled contrary to his inclination), give a bit of wood to the chief, as a token of their design to accompany him; for every thing among those people is transacted with a great deal of ceremony and many forms. The chief who is to conduct them fasts several days, during which he converses with no one, and before setting out is particularly careful to observe his dreams; which the presumption natural to savages generally renders as favourable as he could desire. A variety of other superstitions and ceremonies are observed. One of the most hideous is setting the war-kettle on the fire, as an emblem that they are going out to devour their enemies; which among some nations must formerly have been the case, since they still continue to express it in clear terms, and use an emblem significant of the ancient usage. Then they despatch a porcelain, or large shell, to their allies, inviting them to come along, and drink the blood of their enemies. For with the Americans, as with the Greek of old,\n\n\"A generous friendship no cold medium knows;\n\"But with one love, with one resentment, glows.\"\n\nThey think that those in their alliance must not only adopt their enmities, but have their resentment wound up to the same pitch with themselves. And indeed no people carry their friendship or their resentment so far.\nAmerica, far as they do; and this is what should be expected from their peculiar circumstances; that principle in human nature which is the spring of the social affections, acts with so much the greater force the more it is retrained. The Americans, who live in small societies, who see few objects and few persons, become wonderfully attached to these objects and persons, and cannot be deprived of them without feeling themselves miserable. Their ideas are too confined to enable them to entertain just sentiments of humanity, or universal benevolence. But this very circumstance, while it makes them cruel and savage to an incredible degree towards those with whom they are at war, adds a new force to their particular friendships, and to the common tie which unites the members of the same tribe, or of those different tribes which are an alliance with one another. Without attending to this reflection, some facts we are going to relate would excite our wonder without informing our reason, and we should be bewildered in a number of particulars, seemingly opposite to one another, without being sensible of the general cause from which they proceed.\n\nHaving finished all the ceremonies previous to the war, and the day appointed for their setting out on the expedition being arrived, they take leave of their friends, and exchange their clothes, or whatever moveables they have, in token of mutual friendship; after which they proceed from the town, their wives and female relations walking before, and attending them to some distance. The warriors march all drest in their finest apparel and most showy ornaments, without any order. The chief walks slowly before them, fingering the war-song, while the rest observe the most profound silence. When they come up to their women, they deliver them all their finery, and putting on their worst clothes, proceed on their expedition.\n\nEvery nation has its peculiar ensign or standard, which is generally some beast, bird, or fish. Those among the Five Nations are the bear, otter, wolf, tortoise, and eagle; and by these names the tribes are usually distinguished. They have the figures of those animals pricked and painted on several parts of their bodies; and when they march through the woods, they commonly, at every encampment, cut the representation of their ensign on trees, especially after a successful campaign; marking at the same time the number of scalps or prisoners they have taken. Their military dress is extremely singular. They cut off or pull out all their hair, except a spot about the breadth of two English crown pieces, near the top of their heads, and entirely destroy their eyebrows. The lock left upon their heads is divided into several parcels, each of which is stiffened and adorned with wampum, beads, and feathers of various kinds, the whole being twisted into a form much resembling the modern pompon. Their heads are painted red down to the eyebrows, and sprinkled over with white down. The gristles of their ears are split almost quite round, and distended with wires or splinters so as to meet and tie together on the nape of the neck. These are also hung with ornaments, and generally bear the representation of some bird or beast. Their noses are likewise bored and hung with trinkets of beads, and their faces painted with various colours, so as to make an awful appearance. Their breasts are adorned with a gorget or medal, of brass, copper, or some other metal; and America that dreadful weapon the falching knife hangs by a string from their neck.\n\nThe great qualities in an Indian war are vigilance and attention, to give and to avoid a surprize; and indeed in these they are superior to all nations in the world. Accustomed to continual wandering in the forests, having their perceptions sharpened by keen necessity; and living in every respect according to nature, their external senses have a degree of acuteness which at first view appears incredible. They can trace out their enemies at an immense distance by the smoke of their fires, which they smell, and by the tracks of their feet on the ground, imperceptible to an European eye, but which they can count and distinguish with the utmost facility. They can even distinguish the different nations with whom they are acquainted, and can determine the precise time when they passed, where an European could not, with all his glances, distinguish footsteps at all. These circumstances, however, are of small importance, because their enemies are not less acquainted with them. When they go out, therefore, they take care to avoid making use of any thing by which they might run the danger of a discovery. They light no fire to warm themselves or to prepare their victuals; they lie close to the ground all day, and travel only in the night; and marching along in files, he that closes the rear diligently covers with leaves the tracks of his own feet and of theirs who preceded him. When they halt to refresh themselves, scouts are sent out to reconnoitre the country and beat up every place where they suspect an enemy to be concealed. In this manner they enter unawares the villages of their foes; and, while the flower of the nation are engaged in hunting, massacre all the children, women, and helpless old men, or make prisoners of as many as they can manage, or have strength enough to be useful to their nation. But when the enemy is apprised of their design, and coming on in arms against them, they throw themselves flat on the ground among the withered herbs and leaves, which their faces are painted to resemble. Then they allow a part to pass unmolested, when all at once, with a tremendous shout, rising up from their ambush, they pour a storm of musket bullets on their foes. The party attacked returns the same cry. Every one shelters himself with a tree, and returns the fire of the adverse party, as soon as they raise themselves from the ground to give a second fire. Thus does the battle continue until the one party is so much weakened as to be incapable of farther resistance. But if the force on each side continues nearly equal, the fierce spirits of the savages, inflamed by the loss of their friends, can no longer be restrained. They abandon their distant war; they rush upon one another with clubs and hatchets in their hands, magnifying their own courage, and insulting their enemies with the bitterest reproaches. A cruel combat ensues, death appears in a thousand hideous forms, which would congeal the blood of civilized nations to behold, but which rouse the fury of savages. They trample, they insult over the dead bodies, tearing the scalp from the head, wallowing in their blood like wild beasts, and sometimes devouring their flesh. The flame rages on till it meets with no resistance; then the prisoners are secured, those unhappy men whose\nAME\n\nAmerica, whose fate is a thousand times more dreadful than theirs who have died in the field. The conquerors set up a hideous howling to lament the friends they have lost. They approach in a melancholy and feverish gloom to their own village; a messenger is sent to announce their arrival, and the women, with frightful shrieks, come out to mourn their dead brothers or their husbands. When they are arrived, the chief relates in a low voice to the elders a circumstantial account of every particular of the expedition. The orator proclaims aloud this account to the people; and as he mentions the names of those who have fallen, the shrieks of the women are redoubled. The men too join in these cries, according as each is most connected with the deceased by blood or friendship. The last ceremony is the proclamation of the victory; each individual then forgets his private misfortunes, and joins in the triumph of his nation; all tears are wiped from their eyes, and by an unaccountable transition, they pass in a moment from the bitterness of sorrow to an extravagance of joy. But the treatment of the prisoners, whose fate all this time remains undecided, is what chiefly characterizes the savages.\n\nWe have already mentioned the strength of their affections or resentments. United as they are in small societies, connected within themselves by the firmest ties, their friendly affections, which glow with the most intense warmth within the walls of their own village, seldom extend beyond them. They feel nothing for the enemies of their nation; and their resentment is easily extended from the individual who has injured them to all others of the same tribe. The prisoners, who have themselves the same feelings, know the intentions of their conquerors, and are prepared for them. The person who has taken the captive attends him to the cottage, where, according to the distribution made by the elders, he is to be delivered to supply the loss of a citizen. If those who receive him have their family weakened by war or other accidents, they adopt the captive into the family, of which he becomes a member. But if they have no occasion for him, or their resentment for the loss of their friends be too high to endure the sight of any connected with those who were concerned in it, they sentence him to death. All those who have met with the same severe sentence being collected, the whole nation is assembled at the execution, as for some great solemnity. A scaffold is erected, and the prisoners are tied to the stake, where they commence their death-song, and prepare for the ensuing scene of cruelty with the most undaunted courage. Their enemies, on the other side, are determined to put it to the proof, by the most refined and exquisite tortures. They begin at the extremity of his body, and gradually approach the more vital parts. One plucks out his nails by the roots, one by one; another takes a finger into his mouth, and tears off the flesh with his teeth; a third thrusts the finger, mangled as it is, into the bowl of a pipe made red hot, which he smokes like tobacco; then they pound his toes and fingers to pieces between two stones; they cut circles about his joints, and gashes in the fleshy parts of his limbs, which they tear immediately with red-hot irons, cutting, burning, and pinching them alternately; they pull off his flesh, thus mangled and roasted, bit by bit, devouring it with greediness, and smeared their faces with the blood in an enthusiasm of horror and fury. When they have thus torn off the flesh, they twist the bare nerves and tendons about an iron, tearing and snapping them, whilst others are employed in pulling and extending their limbs in every way that can increase the torment. This continues often five or six hours; and sometimes, such is the strength of the fates, days together. Then they frequently unbind him, to give a breathing to their fury, to think what new torments they shall inflict, and to refresh the strength of the sufferer, who, wearied out with such a variety of unheard-of torments, often falls into profound sleep, that they are obliged to apply the fire to awake him, and renew his sufferings. He is again fastened to the stake, and again they renew their cruelty; they stick him all over with small matches of wood that easily take fire, but burn slowly; they continually run sharp reeds into every part of his body; they drag out his teeth with pincers, and thrust out his eyes; and lastly, after having burned his flesh from the bones with slow fires; after having so mangled the body that it is all but one wound; after having mutilated his face in such a manner as to carry nothing human in it; after having peeled the skin from the head, and poured a heap of red-hot coals or boiling water on the naked skull—they once more unbind the wretch; who, blind, and staggering with pain and weakness, assaulted and pelleted upon every side with clubs and stones, now up, now down, falling into their fires at every step, runs hither and thither, until one of the chiefs, whether out of compassion, or weary of cruelty, puts an end to his life with a club or dagger. The body is then put into a kettle, and this barbarous employment is succeeded by a feast as barbarous.\n\nThe women, forgetting the human as well as the female nature, and transformed into something worse than furies, even outdo the men in this scene of horror; while the principal persons of the country sit round the stake, smoking and looking on without the least emotion. What is most extraordinary, the sufferer himself, in the little intervals of his torments, smokes too, appears unconcerned, and converses with the torturers about indifferent matters. Indeed, during the whole time of his execution, there seems a contest which shall exceed, they in inflicting the most horrid pains, or he in enduring them with a firmness and constancy almost above human: not a groan, not a sigh, not a distortion of countenance, escapes him; he professes his mind entirely in the midst of his torments; he recounts his own exploits; he informs them what cruelties he has inflicted upon their countrymen, and threatens them with the revenge that will attend his death; and, though his reproaches exasperate them to a perfect madness of rage and fury, he continues his insults even of their ignorance of the art of tormenting, pointing out himself more exquisite methods, and more sensible parts of the body to be afflicted. The women have this part of courage as well as the men; and it is as rare for an Indian to behave otherwise, as it would be for any European to suffer as an Indian. Such is the wonderful power of an early institution, and a ferocious thirst of glory. \"I am brave and intrepid (exclaims the savage in the face of his tormentors); I do not fear death, nor any kind of tortures; those who fear them are cowards; they are less than women.\"\nAmerica. women: life is nothing to those that have courage: May my enemies be confounded with despair and rage! Oh! that I could devour them, and drink their blood to the last drop.\"\n\nSurprising contrast in flexibility on the other, are among themselves matters of astonishment: for vengeance, and fortitude in the midst of torment, are duties which they consider as sacred; they are the effects of their earliest education, and depend upon principles instilled into them from their infancy. On all other occasions they are humane and compassionate. Nothing can exceed the warmth of their affection towards their friends, who consist of all those who live in the same village, or are in alliance with it. Among these all things are common; and thus, though it may in part arise from their not possessing very distinct notions of separate property, is chiefly to be attributed to the strength of their attachment; because in every thing else, with their lives as well as their fortunes, they are ready to serve their friends. Their houses, their provisions, even their young women, are not enough to oblige a guest. Has any one of these succeeded ill in his hunting; has his harvest failed; or is his house burned—he feels no other effect of his misfortunes, than that it gives him an opportunity to experience the benevolence and regard of his fellow-citizens. On the other hand, to the enemies of his country, or to those who have privately offended, the American is implacable. He conceals his sentiments, he appears reconciled, until by some treachery or surprise he has an opportunity of executing a horrible revenge. No length of time is sufficient to allay his resentment; no distance of place great enough to protect the object: he crosses the steppes mountains, he pierces the most impracticable forests, and traverses the most hideous bogs and deserts for several hundreds of miles; bearing the inclemency of the seasons, the fatigue of the expedition, the extremes of hunger and thirst, with patience and cheerfulness, in hopes of surprising his enemy, on whom he exercises the most shocking barbarities, even to the eating of his flesh.\n\nTo such extremes do the Indians push their friendship or their enmity; and such indeed, in general, is the character of all strong and uncultivated minds.\n\nBut what we have said respecting the Indians would be a faint picture, did we omit observing the force of their friendship, which principally appears by the treatment of their dead. When any one of the society is cut off, he is lamented by the whole. On this occasion a thousand ceremonies are practised, denoting the most lively sorrow. No business is transacted, however pressing, till all the pious ceremonies due to the dead are performed. The body is washed, anointed, and painted. Then the women lament the loss with hideous howlings, intermixed with songs which celebrate the great actions of the deceased and his ancestors. The men mourn in a less extravagant manner. The whole village is present at the interment, and the corpse is habited in their most sumptuous ornaments. Close to the body of the deceased are placed his bows and arrows, with whatever he valued most in his life, and a quantity of provisions for his subsistence on the journey which he is supposed to take. This solemnity, like every other, is attended with feasting. The funeral being ended, the relations of the deceased confine themselves to their huts for a considerable time to indulge their grief. After an interval of some weeks they visit the grave, repeat their sorrow, new clothe the remains of the body, and act over again all the solemnities of the funeral.\n\nAmong the various tokens of their regard for their deceased friends, the most remarkable is what they call the feast of the dead, or the feast of souls. The day for this ceremony is appointed in the council of their chiefs, who give orders for everything which may enable them to celebrate it with pomp and magnificence; and the neighbouring nations are invited to partake of the entertainment. At this time, all who have died since the preceding feast of the kind are taken out of their graves. Even those who have been interred at the greatest distance from the villages are diligently sought for, and conducted to this rendezvous of the dead, which exhibits a scene of horror beyond the power of description. When the feast is concluded, the bodies are draped in the finest skins which can be procured, and after being exposed for some time in this pomp, are again committed to the earth with great solemnity, which is succeeded by funeral games.\n\nTheir taste for war, which forms the chief ingredient in their character, gives a strong bias to their religion. Arekou, or the god of battle, is revered as the great god of the Indians. Him they invoke before they go into the field; and according as his disposition is more or less favourable to them, they conclude they will be more or less successful. Some nations worship the sun and moon; among others there are a number of traditions, relative to the creation of the world and the history of the gods: traditions which resemble the Grecian fables, but which are still more absurd and inconsistent. But religion is not the prevailing character of the Indians; and except when they have some immediate occasion for the assistance of their gods, they pay them no sort of worship. Like all rude nations, however, they are strongly addicted to superstition. They believe in the existence of a number of good and bad genii or spirits, who interfere in the affairs of mortals, and produce all our happiness or misery. It is from the evil genii, in particular, that our diseases proceed; and it is to the good genii we are indebted for a cure. The ministers of the genii are the jugglers, who are also the only physicians among the savages. These jugglers are supposed to be inspired by the good genii, most commonly in their dreams, with the knowledge of future events; they are called in to the assistance of the sick, and are supposed to be informed by the genii whether they will get over the disease, and in what way they must be treated. But these spirits are extremely simple in their system of physic, and, in almost every disease, direct the juggler to the same remedy. The patient is enclosed in a narrow cabin, in the midst of which is a stone red hot: on this they throw water, until he is well soaked with the warm vapour and his own sweat. Then they hurry him from this bath, and plunge him suddenly into the next river. This coarse method, which costs many their lives, often performs very extraordinary cures. The jugglers have likewise the use of some specifics of wonderful efficacy; and all the savages are dexterous in curing wounds by the application of herbs. But the power of these remedies is always...\nAmerica, ways attributed to the magical ceremonies with which they are administered.\n\nThough the women generally bear the laborious part of their work of domestic economy, their condition is far from being so flaxen as it appears. On the contrary, the greatest respect is paid by the men to the female sex. The women even hold their councils, and have their share in all deliberations which concern the state. Polygamy is practised by some nations, but is not general. In most, they content themselves with one wife; but a divorce is admitted in case of adultery. No nation of the Americans is without a regular marriage, in which there are many ceremonies; the principal of which is, the bride's presenting the bridegroom with a plate of their corn. The women, though before continent, are remarkable for chastity after marriage.\n\nLiberty, in its full extent, being the darling patron of the Indians, their education is directed in such a manner as to cherish this disposition to the utmost. Hence children are never upon any account chastised with blows, and they are seldom even reprimanded. Reason, they say, will guide their children when they come to the use of it, and before that time their faults cannot be very great; but blows might damp their free and martial spirit, by the habit of a flaxen motive to action. When grown up, they experience nothing like command, dependence, or subordination; even strong persuasion is indifferently withheld by those who have influence among them.—No man is held in great esteem, unless he has increased the strength of his country with a captive, or adorned his hut with a scalp of one of his enemies.\n\nControversies among the Indians are few, and quickly decided. When any criminal matter is so flagrant as to become a national concern, it is brought under the jurisdiction of the great council; but in ordinary cases, the crime is either revenged or compromised by the parties concerned. If a murder be committed, the family which has lost a relation prepares to retaliate on that of the offender. They often kill the murderer; and when this happens, the kindred of the last person slain look upon themselves to be as much injured, and to have the same right to vengeance, as the other party. In general, however, the offender absents himself; the friends send compliments of condolence to those of the person that has been murdered. The head of the family at length appears with a number of presents, the delivery of which he accompanies with a formal speech. The whole ends, as usual, in mutual featings, songs, and dances. If the murder is committed by one of the same family or cabin, that cabin has the full right of judgment within itself, either to punish the guilty with death, or to pardon him, or to oblige him to give some recompense to the wife or children of the slain. Instances of such a crime, however, very seldom happen; for their attachment to those of the same family is remarkably strong, and is said to produce such friendships as may vie with the most celebrated in fabulous antiquity.\n\nSuch, in general, are the manners and customs of the Indian nations; but every tribe has something peculiar to itself. Among the Hurons and Natches, the dignity of the chief is hereditary, and the right of succession in the female line. When this happens to be extinct, the most respectable matron of the tribe makes choice of whom she pleases to succeed.\n\nThe Cherokees are governed by several sachems or chiefs, elected by the different villages; as are also the Creeks and Choctaws. The two latter punish adultery in a woman by cutting off her hair, which they will not suffer to grow till the corn is ripe the next season; but the Illinois, for the same crime, cut off the women's noses and ears.\n\nThe Indians on the lakes are formed into a fort of empire; and the emperor is elected from the eldest tribe, which is that of the Ottowawas. He has the greatest authority of any chief that has appeared on the continent since our acquaintance with it. A few years ago, the person who held this rank formed a design of uniting all the Indian nations under his sovereignty; but he miscarried in the attempt.\n\nIn general, the American Indians live to a great age, longevity although it is not possible to know from themselves the exact number of their years. It was asked of an Indian, who appeared to be extremely old, what age he was of? I am above twenty, was his reply. Upon putting the question in a different form, by reminding him of certain circumstances in former times, Mymachu, said he, spoke to me when I was young of the Incas; and he had been these princes. According to this reply, there must have elapsed, from the date of his machu's (his grandfather's) remembrance to that time, a period of at least 232 years. The man who made this reply appeared to be 120 years of age: for, besides the whiteness of his hair and beard, his body was almost bent to the ground; without, however, showing any other marks of debility or suffering. This happened in 1764. This longevity, attended in general with uninterrupted health, is probably the consequence in part of their vacancy from all ferocious thought and employment, joined also with the robust texture and conformation of their bodily organs. If the Indians did not destroy one another in their almost perpetual wars, and if their habits of intoxication were not so universal and incurable, they would be, of all the races of men who inhabit the globe, the most likely to prolong, not only the bounds, but the enjoyments, of animal life to their utmost duration.\n\nLet us now attend to other pictures which have been given of the aboriginal inhabitants of the new world. The vices and defects of the American Indians have by several writers been most unaccountably aggravated, and every virtue and good quality denied them. Their cruelties have been already described and accounted for. The following anecdote of an Algonquin woman we find adduced as a remarkable proof of their innate thirst of blood. That nation being at war with the Iroquois, she happened to be made prisoner, and was carried to one of the villages belonging to them. Here she was stripped naked, and her hands and feet bound with ropes in one of their cabins. In this condition she remained ten days, the savages sleeping round her every night. The eleventh night, while they were asleep, she found means to disengage one of her hands, with which she immediately freed herself from the ropes, and went to the door. Though she had now an opportunity of escaping unperceived,\nAmerica received, her revengeful temper could not let slip so favourable an opportunity of killing one of her enemies. The attempt was manifestly at the hazard of her own life; yet, snatching up a hatchet, she killed the savage that lay next her; and, springing out of the cabin, concealed herself in a hollow tree which she had observed the day before. The groans of the dying person soon alarmed the other savages, and the young ones immediately set out in pursuit of her.—Perceiving from her tree, that they all directed their course one way, and that no savage was near her, she left her sanctuary, and, flying in an opposite direction, ran into a forest without being perceived. The second day after this happened, her footsteps were discovered, and they pursued her with such expedition, that the third day she discovered her enemies at her heels. Upon this she threw herself into a pond of water; and, diving among some weeds and bulrushes, she could just breathe above water without being perceived. Her pursuers, after making the most diligent search, were forced to return.—For 35 days this woman held on her course through woods and deserts, without any other sustenance than roots and wild berries. When she came to the river St Lawrence, she made with her own hands a kind of a wicker raft, on which she crossed it. As she went by the French fort Trois Rivières, without well knowing where she was, she perceived a canoe full of savages; and, fearing they might be Iroquois, ran again into the woods, where she remained till sunset.—Continuing her course, soon after she saw the Trois Rivières; and was then discovered by a party whom she knew to be Hurons, a nation in alliance with the Algonquins. She then squatted down behind a bush, calling out to them that she was not in a condition to be seen, because she was naked. They immediately threw her a blanket, and then conducted her to the fort, where she recounted her story.\n\nPersonal courage has been denied them. In proof of their pusillanimity, the following incidents are quoted from Charlevoix by Lord Kames, in his Sketches of the History of Man. \"The fort de Vercheres in Canada, belonging to the French, was, in the year 1692, attacked by some Iroquois. They approached silently, preparing to scale the pallade, when some musket-shot made them retire. Advancing a second time, they were again repulsed, wondering that they could discover none but a woman who was seen everywhere. This was Madame de Vercheres, who appeared as resolute as if supported by a numerous garrison. The hopes of forming a place without men to defend it occasioned reiterated attacks. After two days' siege, they retired, fearing to be intercepted in their retreat. Two years after, a party of the same nation appeared before the fort unexpectedly, that a girl of fourteen, daughter of the proprietor, had but time to shut the gate. With the young woman there was not a foul but one raw folder. She showed herself with her afflatus, sometimes in one place and sometimes in another; changing her dress frequently, in order to give some appearance of a garrison; and always fired opportunely. The faint-hearted Iroquois decamped without success.\"\n\nThere is no instance, it is said, either of a single Indian facing an individual of any other nation in fair and open combat, or of their jointly venturing to try the fate of battle with an equal number of any foes. Even with the greatest superiority of numbers, they dare not meet an open attack. Yet, notwithstanding this want of courage, they are still formidable; nay, it has been known, that a small party of them has routed a much superior body of regular troops: but this can only happen when they have surprised them in the fastnesses of their forests, where the covert of the wood may conceal them until they take their aim with the utmost certainty. After one such discharge they immediately retreat, without leaving the smallest trace of their route. It may easily be supposed, that an onset of this kind must produce confusion even among the stoutest troops, when they can neither know the number of their enemies, nor perceive the place where they lie in ambush.\n\nPerfidy combined with cruelty has been also made a part of their character. Don Ulloa relates, that the Indians of the country called Natches, in Louisiana, laid a plot for massacring in one night every individual belonging to the French colony established there. This plot they actually executed, notwithstanding the seeming good understanding that subsisted between them and these European neighbours. Such was the secrecy which they observed, that no person had the least suspicion of their design until the blow was struck. One Frenchman alone escaped, by favour of the darkness, to relate the disaster of his countrymen. The compassion of a female Indian contributed also in some measure to his exemption from the general massacre. The tribe of Natches had invited the Indians of other countries, even to a considerable distance, to join in the same conspiracy. The day, or rather the night, was fixed, on which they were to make an united attack on the French colonists. It was intimated by sending a parcel of rods, more or less numerous according to the local distance of each tribe, with an injunction to abstract one rod daily; the day on which the last fell to be taken away being that fixed for the execution of their plan. The women were partners of the bloody secret. The parcels of rods being thus distributed, that belonging to the tribe of Natches happened to remain in the custody of a female. This woman, either moved by her own feelings of compassion, or by the commiseration expressed by her female acquaintances in the view of the proposed scene of bloodshed, abstracted one day three or four of the rods, and thus anticipated the term of her tribe's proceeding to the execution of the general conspiracy. The consequence of this was, that the Natches were the only actors in this carnage; their distant associates having still several rods remaining at the time when the former made the attack. An opportunity was thereby given to the colonists in those quarters to take measures for their defence, and for preventing a more extensive execution of the design.\n\nIt was by conspiracies similar to this that the Indians of the province of Macas, in the kingdom of Quito, destroyed the opulent city of Logroño, the colony of Guambaya, and its capital Sevilla del Oro; and that so completely, that it is no longer known in what place these settlements existed, or where that abundance of gold was found from which the last mentioned city took the addition to its name. Like ravages have been committed upon l'Imperiale in Chili, the colonies of the Millions of Chuncas, those of Darien in Terra Firma, and...\nAmerica, and many other places which have afforded scenes of this barbarous ferocity. These conspiracies are always carried on in the same manner. The secret is inviolably kept, the actors assemble at the precise hour appointed, and every individual is animated with the same sanguinary purposes. The males that fall into their hands are put to death with every shocking circumstance that can be suggested by a cool and determined cruelty. The females are carried off, and preserved as monuments of their victory, to be employed as their occasions require.\n\nNor can this odious cruelty and treachery, it is said, be justly ascribed to their subjection to a foreign yoke, seeing the same character belongs equally to all the original inhabitants of this vast continent, even those who have preserved their independence most completely. Certain it is, continues he, that these people, with the most limited capacities for everything else, display an astonishing degree of penetration and subtlety with respect to every object that involves treachery, bloodshed, and rapine. As to these, they seem to have been all educated at one school; and a secret, referring to any such plan, no consideration on earth can extort from them.\n\nTheir understandings also have been represented as not less contemptible than their manners are gross and brutal. Many nations are neither capable of forming an arrangement for futurity; nor do their solicitude or foresight extend so far. They set no value upon those things of which they are not in some immediate want. In the evening, when a Carib is going to rest, no consideration will tempt him to sell his hammock; but in the morning he will part with it for the slightest trifle. At the close of winter, a North American, mindful of what he has suffered from the cold, sets himself with vigour to prepare materials for erecting a comfortable hut to protect him against the inclemency of the succeeding season; but as soon as the weather becomes mild, he abandons his work, and never thinks of it more till the return of the cold compels him to resume it.—In short, to be free from labour seems to be the utmost wish of an American. They will continue whole days stretched in their hammocks, or feasted on the earth, without changing their posture, raising their eyes, or uttering a single word. They cannot compute the succession of days nor of weeks. The different aspects of the moon alone engage their attention as a measure of time. Of the year they have no other conception than what is suggested to them by the alternate heat of summer and cold of winter; nor have they the least idea of applying to this period the obvious computation of the months which it contains. When it is asked of any old man in Peru, even the most civilized, what age he is of; the only answer he can give is the number of caciques he has seen. It often happens, too, that they only recollect the most distant of these princes in whose time certain circumstances had happened peculiarly memorable, while of those that lived in a more recent period they have lost all remembrance.\n\nThe same gross stupidity is alleged to be observable in those Indians who have retained their original liberty. They are never known to fix the dates of any events in their minds, or to trace the succession of circumstances that have arisen from such events. Their imagination takes in only the present, and in that only what intimately concerns themselves. Nor can discipline or instruction overcome this natural defect of apprehension. In fact, the subjected Indians in Peru, who have a continual intercourse with the Spaniards, who are furnished with curates perpetually occupied in given them lessons of religion and morality, and who mix with all ranks of the civilized society established among them, are almost as stupid and barbarous as their countrymen who have had no such advantages. The Peruvians, while they lived under the government of their Incas, preserved the records of certain remarkable events. They had also a kind of regular government, described by the historians of the conquest of Peru. This government originated entirely from the attention and abilities of their princes, and from the regulations enacted by them for directing the conduct of their subjects. This ancient degree of civilization among them gives ground to presume, that their legislators sprung from some race more enlightened than the other tribes of Indians; a race of which no individual seems to remain in the present times.\n\nVanity and conceit are said to be blended with their vainglory and treachery. Notwithstanding all their vanity and suffer from Europeans, they fill, it is said, consider conceit, themselves as a race of men far superior to their conquerors. This proud belief, arising from their perverted ideas of excellence, is universal over the whole known continent of America. They do not think it possible that any people can be so intelligent as themselves. When they are detected in any of their plots, it is their common observation, that the Spaniards, or Viracochas, want to be as knowing as they are. Those of Louisiana, and the countries adjacent, are equally vain of their superior understanding, confounding that quality with the cunning which they themselves constantly practise. The whole object of their transactions is to overreach those with whom they deal. Yet though faithless themselves, they never forgive the breach of promise on the part of others. While the Europeans seek their amity by presents, they give themselves no concern to secure a reciprocal friendship. Hence, probably, arises their idea, that they must be a superior race of men, in ability and intelligence, to those who are at such pains to court their alliance and avert their enmity.\n\nTheir natural eloquence has also been decried. The free tribes of savages who enter into conventions with quince the Europeans, it is observed, are accustomed to make harangues, long, pompous, and, according to their own notions, sublime harangues, but without any method or connection. The whole is a collection of disjointed metaphors and comparisons. The light, heat, and course of the sun, form the principal topic of their discourse; and these unintelligible reasonings are always accompanied with violent and ridiculous gestures. Numberless repetitions prolong the oration, which, if not interrupted, would last whole days: At the same time, they meditate very accurately beforehand, in order to avoid mentioning anything but what they are desirous to obtain. This pompous faculty of making speeches is also one of the grounds on which they conceive themselves to be superior to the nations of Europe: They imagine that it is their eloquence that procures them the favours they ask. The subjected Indians converse precisely\nAmerica, precisely in the same style. Prolific and tedious, they never know when to stop; so that, excepting by the difference in language, it would be impossible, in this respect, to distinguish a civilized Peruvian from an inhabitant of the most savage districts to the northward.\n\nBut such partial and detached views as the above, were they even free from misrepresentation, are not the just ground upon which to form an estimate of their character. Their qualities, good and bad (for they certainly possess both), their way of life, the state of society among them, with all the circumstances of their condition, ought to be considered in connexion, and in regard to their mutual influence. Such a view has been given in the preceding part of this article: from which, it is hoped, their real character may be easily deduced.\n\nMany of the disagreeable traits exhibited in the anecdotes just quoted, are indeed extracted from Don Ulloa, an author of credit and reputation, but a Spaniard, and evidently biased in some degree by a desire to palliate the enormities of his countrymen in that quarter of the globe. And with regard to the worst and least equivocal parts of the American character, cruelty and revenge, it may be fairly questioned, whether the instances of these, either in respect of their cause or their atrocity, be at all comparable to those exhibited in European history, and staining the annals of Christendom:—to those, for instance, of the Spaniards themselves, at their first discovery of America; to those indicated by the engines found on board their mighty Armada; to those which, in cold blood, were perpetrated by the Dutch at Amboyna; to the dragoonnings of the French; to their religious massacres; or even to the tender mercies of the Inquisition!\n\nStill harsher, however, are the descriptions given by Buffon and De Paw of the natives of this whole continent, in which the most mortifying degeneracy of the human race, as well as of all the inferior animals, is asserted to be conspicuous. Against those philosophers, or rather theorists, the Americans have found an able advocate in the Abbé Clavigero; an historian whose situation and long residence in America afforded him the best means of information, and who, though himself a subject of Spain, appears superior to prejudice, and disdains in his description the glosses of policy.\n\nConcerning the stature of the Americans, M. de Paw says in general, that although it is not equal to the stature of the Carthaginians, there is but little difference between them. But the Abbé Clavigero evinces that the Indians who inhabit those countries lying between 9 and 40 degrees of north latitude, which are the limits of the discoveries of the Spaniards, are more than five Parisian feet in height, and that those who do not reach that stature are as few in number among the Indians as they are amongst the Spaniards. It is besides certain, that many of those nations, as the Apaches, the Iñagüeños, the Pinéos, and Cochimíes, are at least as tall as the tallest Europeans; and that, in all the vast extent of the new world, no race of people has been found, except the Esquimaux, so diminutive in stature as the Laplanders, the Samojesds, and Tartars, in the north of the old continent. In this respect, therefore, the inhabitants of the two continents are upon an American equality.\n\nOf the shape and character of the Mexican Indians, the Abbé gives a most advantageous description; which he affords no one who reads it in America will contradict, unless he views them with the eye of a prejudiced mind. It is true, that Ulloa says, in speaking of the Indians of Quito, he had observed, \"that imperfect people abounded among them; that they were either irregularly diminutive, or monstrous in some other respect; that they became either infensible, dumb, or blind, or wanted some limb of their body.\" Having therefore made some inquiry respecting this singularity of the Quitans, the Abbé found that such defects were neither caused by bad humours, nor by the climate, but by the mistaken and blind humanity of their parents, who, in order to free their children from the hardships and toils to which the healthy Indians are subjected by the Spaniards, fix some deformity or weakness upon them that they may become useless: a circumstance of misery which does not happen in other countries of America, nor in those places of the same kingdom of Quito, where the Indians are under no such opprobrium. M. de Paw, and, in agreement with him, Dr Robertson, says, that no deformed persons are to be found among the savages of America; because, like the ancient Lacedemonians, they put to death those children which are born hunch-backed, blind, or defective in any limb; but that in those countries where they are formed into societies, and the vigilance of their rulers prevents the murder of such infants, the number of their deformed individuals is greater than it is in any country of Europe. This would make an exceeding good solution of the difficulty if it were true; but it, possibly, there has been in America a tribe of savages who have imitated the barbarous example of the celebrated Lacedemonians, it is certain that those authors have no grounds to impute such inhumanity to the rest of the Americans; for that it has not been the practice, at least with the far greater part of those nations, is to be demonstrated from the attestations of authors the best acquainted with their customs.\n\nNo argument against the new world can be drawn from the colour of the Americans; for their colour is less distant from the white of the Europeans than it is from the black of the Africans, and a great part of the Asiatics. The hair of the Mexicans, and of the greater part of the Indians, is, as we have already said, coarse and thick; on their face they appear to have little, and in general none on their arms and legs: but it is an error to say, as M. de Paw does, that they are entirely deftite of hair on all the other parts of their body. This is one of the many paffages of the Philosophical Researches, at which the Mexicans, and all the other nations, must smile to find an European philosopher so eager to divest them of the dress they had from nature. Don Ulloa, indeed, in the description which he gives of the Indians of Quito, says, that hair neither grows upon the men nor upon the women when they arrive at puberty, as it does on the rest of mankind; but, whatever singularity may attend the Quitans, or occasion this circumstance, there is no doubt that among the Americans in general, the period of puberty is accompanied with the same symptoms as it is among other.\nAmerica, other nations of the world. In fact, with the North Americans, it is disgraceful to be hairy on the body. They say it likens them to hogs. They therefore pluck out the hair as fast as it appears. But the traders who marry their women, and prevail on them to discontinue this practice, say, that nature is the same with them as with the whites. As to the beards of the men, had Buffon or De Paw known the pains and trouble it costs them to pluck out by the roots the hair that grows on their faces, they would have seen that nature had not been deficient in that respect. Every nation has its customs. \"I have seen an Indian Leau, with a looking-glass in his hand (says Mr Jefferson), examining his face for hours together, and plucking out by the roots every hair he could discover, with a kind of tweezer made of a piece of fine brass wire, that had been twisted round a stick, and which he used with great dexterity.\"\n\nThe very aspect of an Angolan, Mandingan, or Congan, would have shocked M. de Paw, and made him recall that censure which he passes on the colour, the make, and hair, of the Americans. What can be imagined more contrary to the idea we have of beauty, and the perfection of the human frame, than a man whose body emits a rank smell, whose skin is as black as ink, whose head and face are covered with black wool instead of hair, whose eyes are yellow and bloody, whose lips are thick and blackish, and whose nose is flat? Such are the inhabitants of a very large portion of Africa, and of many islands of Asia. What men can be more imperfect than those who measure no more than four feet in stature, whose faces are long and flat, the nose compressed, the irises yellowish black, the eyelids turned back towards the temples, the cheeks extraordinarily elevated, their mouths monstrously large, their lips thick and prominent, and the lower part of their visages extremely narrow? Such, according to Count de Buffon, are the Laplanders, the Zemblans, the Borondines, the Samogeds, and Tartars in the east. What objects more deformed than men whose faces are too long and wrinkled even in their youth, whose noses thick and compressed, their eyes small and sunk, their cheeks very much raised, their upper jaw low, their teeth long and distended, eyebrows so thick that they shade their eyes; the eyelids thick, some bristles on their faces instead of beard, large thighs and small legs? Such is the picture Count de Buffon gives of the Tartars; that is, of those people who, as he says, inhabit a tract of land in Asia 120 leagues long and upwards, and more than 750 broad. Amongst these the Calmucks are the most remarkable for their deformity; which is so great, that, according to Tavernier, they are the most brutal men of all the universe. Their faces are so broad, that there is a space of five or six inches between their eyes, according as Count de Buffon himself affirms. In Calicut, in Ceylon, and other countries of India, there is, say Pyrard and other writers on these regions, a race of men who have one or both of their legs as thick as the body of a man; and that this deformity among them is almost hereditary. The Hottentots, besides other gross imperfections, have that monstrous irregularity attending them of a callous appendage extending from the os pubis downwards, according to the testimony of the historians of the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nStruys, Gemelli, and other travellers affirm, that in the kingdom of Lambry, in the islands of Formosa and of Mindoro, men have been found with tails. Bonare says, that a thing of this kind in men is nothing else than an elongation of the os coccygis; but what is a tail in quadrupeds but the elongation of that bone, though divided into distinct articulations? However it may be, it is certain, that that elongation renders those Asiatics fully as irregular as if it was a real tail.\n\nIf we were, in like manner, to go through the nations of Asia and Africa, we should hardly find any extensive country where the colour of men is not darker, where there are not stronger irregularities observed, and grosser defects to be found in them, than M. de Paw finds fault with in the Americans. The colour of the latter is a good deal clearer than that of almost all the Africans and the inhabitants of southern Asia. Even their alleged scantiness of beard is common to the inhabitants of the Philippine islands, and of all the Indian Archipelago, to the famous Chinese, Japanese, Tartars, and many other nations of the old continent. The imperfections of the Americans, however great they may be represented to be, are certainly not comparable with the defects of that immense people, whose character we have sketched, and others whom we omit.\n\nM. de Paw represents the Americans to be a feeble and diseased set of nations; and, in order to demonstrate the weakness and disorder of their physical constitution, adduces several proofs equally ridiculous and ill-founded, and which it will not be expected we should enumerate. He alleges, among other particulars, that they were overcome in wrestling by all the Europeans, and that they sunk under a moderate burden; that by a computation made, 200,000 Americans were found to have perished in one year from carrying of baggage. With respect to the first point, the Abbé Clavigero observes, it would be necessary that the experiment of wrestling was made between many individuals of each continent, and that the victory should be attested by the Americans as well as the Europeans. It is not, however meant to insist, that the Americans are stronger than the Europeans. They may be less strong, without the human species having degenerated in them. The Swiss are stronger than the Italians; and still we do not believe the Italians are degenerated, nor do we tax the climate of Italy. The instance of 200,000 Americans having died in one year under the weight of baggage, were it true, would not convince us so much of the weaknesses of the Americans, as of the inhumanity of the Europeans. In the same manner that those 200,000 Americans perished, 200,000 Prussians would also have perished, had they been obliged to make a journey of between 300 and 400 miles, with 100 pounds of burden upon their backs; if they had collars of iron about their necks, and were obliged to carry that load over rocks and mountains; if those who became exhausted with fatigue, or wounded their feet so as to impede their progress, had their heads cut off that they might not retard the pace of the rest; and if they were not allowed but a small morsel of bread to enable them to support so severe a toil. Las Casas, from whom M. de Paw got the account of the 200,000 Americans who died under the fatigue of carrying baggage, relates also all the above-mentioned circumstances. If\nAME\n\nAmerica, that author therefore is to be credited in the last, he is also to be credited in the first. But a philosopher who vaunts the physical and moral qualities of Europeans over those of the Americans, would have done better, we think, to have suppressed facts so opprobrious to the Europeans themselves.\n\nNothing in fact demonstrates so clearly the robustness of the Americans as those various and lasting fatigues in which they are continually engaged. M. de Paw says, that when the new world was discovered, nothing was to be seen but thick woods; that at present there are some lands cultivated, not by the Americans, however, but by the Africans and Europeans; and that the soil in cultivation is to the soil which is uncultivated as 2000 to 2,000,000. These three assertions the Abbé demonstrates to be precisely as many errors. Since the conquest, the Americans alone have been the people who have supported all the fatigues of agriculture in all the vast countries of the continent of South America, and in the greater part of those of North America subject to the crown of Spain. No European is ever to be seen employed in the labours of the field. The Moors who, in comparison of the Americans, are very few in number in the kingdom of New Spain, are charged with the culture of the sugar cane and tobacco, and the making of sugar; but the soil destined for the cultivation of those plants is not with respect to all the cultivated land of that country in the proportion of one to two thousand. The Americans are the people who labour on the soil. They are the tillers, the layers, the weavers, and the reapers of the wheat, of the maize, of the rice, of the beans, and other kinds of grain and pulse; of the cacao, of the vanilla, of the cotton, of the indigo, and all other plants useful to the sustenance, the clothing, and commerce of those provinces; and without them so little can be done, that in the year 1762, the harvest of wheat was abandoned in many places on account of the sickness which prevailed, and prevented the Indians from reaping it. But this is not all; the Americans are they who cut and transport all the necessary timber from the woods; who cut, transport, and work the stones; who make lime, plaster, and tiles; who construct all the buildings of that kingdom, except a few places where none of them inhabit; who open and repair all the roads, who make the canals and sluices, and clean the cities. They work in many mines of gold, of silver, of copper, &c. they are the shepherds, herdsmen, weavers, potters, basket-makers, bakers, couriers, day-labourers, &c.; in a word, they are the persons who bear all the burden of public labours. These, says our justly indignant author, are the employments of the weak, daftardly, and useless Americans; while the vigorous M. de Paw, and other indefatigable Europeans, are occupied in writing invectives against them.\n\nThese labours, in which the Indians are continually employed, certainly affect their healthiness and strength; for if they are able to undergo such fatigues, they cannot be defeated, nor have an exhausted stream of blood in their veins, as M. de Paw intimates. In order to make it believed that their constitutions are vitiated, he copies whatever he finds written by historians of America, whether true or false, respecting the diseases which reign in some particular countries of that great continent. It is not to be denied, that in some countries in the wide compass of America, men are exposed more than elsewhere to the distempers which are occasioned by the intemperance of the air, or the pernicious quality of the aliments; but it is certain, according to the assertion of many respectable authors acquainted with the new world, that the American countries are, for the most part, healthy; and if the Americans were disposed to retaliate on M. de Paw, and other European authors who write as he does, they would have abundant subject of materials to throw discredit on the clime of the old continent, and the constitution of its inhabitants, in the endemic distempers which prevail there.\n\nLastly, The supposed feebleness and unfound bodily habit of the Americans do not correspond with the length of their lives. Among those Americans whose great fatigues and excessive toils do not anticipate their death, there are not a few who reach the age of 80, 90, and 100 or more years, as formerly mentioned; and what is more, without there being observed in them that decay which time commonly produces in the hair, in the teeth, in the skin, and in the muscles of the human body. This phenomenon, so much admired by the Spaniards who reside in Mexico, cannot be ascribed to any other cause than the vigour of their constitutions, the temperance of their diet, and the salubrity of their climate. Historians, and other persons who have sojourned there for many years, report the same thing of other countries of the new world.\n\nAs to the mental qualities of the Americans, M. de Paw has not been able to discover any other characters than a memory so feeble, that to-day they do not remember what they did yesterday; a capacity so blunt, that they are incapable of thinking, or putting their ideas in order; a disposition so cold, that they feel no excitement of love; a daftardly spirit, and a genius that is torpid and indolent. Many other Europeans, indeed, and what is still more wonderful, many of those children or descendants of Europeans who are born in America, think as M. de Paw does; some from ignorance, some from want of reflection, and others from hereditary prejudice and prepossession. But all this and more would not be sufficient to invalidate the testimonies of other Europeans, whose authority has a great deal more weight, both because they were men of great judgment, learning, and knowledge of these countries, and because they gave their testimony in favour of strangers against their own countrymen. In particular, Acosta, whose natural and moral history even M. de Paw commends as an excellent work, employs the whole fifth book in demonstrating the good sense of the Americans, by an explanation of their ancient government, their laws, their histories in paintings and knots, calendars, &c. M. de Paw thinks the Americans are befuddled; Acosta, on the other hand, reputes those persons weak and presumptuous who think them so. M. de Paw says, that the most acute Americans were inferior in industry and sagacity to the rudest nations of the old continent; Acosta extols the civil government of the Mexicans above many republics of Europe. M. de Paw finds, in the moral and political conduct of the Americans, nothing but barbarity, extravagance,\ntravagance, and brutality; and Acosta finds there, laws that are admirable, and worthy of being preserved for ever.\n\nM. de Paw denies them courage, and alleges the conquest of Mexico as a proof of their cowardice. \"Cortes (he says) conquered the empire of Mexico with 450 vagabonds and 15 horses, badly armed; his miserable artillery consisted of six falconets, which would not at the present day be capable of exciting the fears of a fortress defended by invalids. During his absence the capital was held in awe by the half of his troops. What men! what events!—It is confirmed by the depositions of all historians, that the Spaniards entered the first time into Mexico without making one single discharge of their artillery. If the title of hero is applicable to him who has the disgrace to occasion the death of a great number of rational animals, Ferdinand Cortes might pretend to it; otherwise I do not see what true glory he has acquired by the overthrow of a tottering monarchy, which might have been destroyed in the same manner by any other afflatus of our continent.\"\n\nThese palliages indicate either M. de Paw's ignorance of the history of the conquest of Mexico, or a wilful suppression of what would openly contradict his system; since all who have read that history know well, that the conquest of Mexico was not made with 450 men, but with more than 200,000. Cortes himself, to whom it was of more importance than to M. de Paw to make his bravery conspicuous, and his conquest appear glorious, confesses the excessive number of the allies who were under his command at the siege of the capital, and combated with more fury against the Mexicans than the Spaniards themselves. According to the account which Cortes gave to the emperor Charles V., the siege of Mexico began with 87 horses, 848 Spanish infantry, armed with guns, cross-bows, swords, and lances, and upwards of 75,000 allies, of Tlacalca, Huezotzinco, Cholula, and Chalco, equipped with various sorts of arms; with three large pieces of iron cannon, 15 small of copper, and 13 brigantines. In the course of the siege were assembled the numerous nations of the Otomies, the Coahuixcas, and Matlatzinca, and the troops of the populous cities of the lakes; so that the army of the besiegers not only exceeded 200,000, but amounted to 4,000,000, according to the letter from Cortes; and besides these, 3000 boats and canoes came to their assistance. Did it betray cowardice to have sustained, for full 75 days, the siege of an open city, engaging daily with an army so large, and in part provided with arms so superior, and at the same time having to withstand the ravages of famine? Can they merit the charge of cowardice, who, after having lost seven of the eight parts of their city, and about 50,000 citizens, part cut off by the sword, part by famine and sickness, continued to defend themselves until they were furiously assaulted in the last hold which was left them? See the article Mexico.\n\nAccording to M. de Paw, \"the Americans at first were not believed to be men, but rather satyrs, or large apes, which might be murdered without remorse or reproach. At last, in order to add insult to the opprobrium of those times, a pope made an original bull, in which he declared, that being desirous of founding bishoprics in the richest countries of America, it pleased him and the Holy Spirit to acknowledge the Americans to be true men: in so far, that without this decision of an Italian, the inhabitants of the new world would have appeared, even at this day, to the eyes of the faithful, a race of equivocal men. There is no example of such a decision since this globe has been inhabited by men and apes.\" Upon this passage the Abbé animadverts, as being a singular instance of calumny and misrepresentation; and gives the following history of the decision alluded to.\n\n\"Some of the first Europeans who established themselves in America, not less powerful than avaricious, the famous desirous of enriching themselves to the detriment of the bull of Paul III. Americans, kept them continually employed, and made use of them as slaves; and in order to avoid the repudiations which were made them by the bishops and missionaries who inculcated humanity, and the giving liberty to those people to get themselves instructed in religion, that they might do their duties towards the church and their families, alleged, that the Indians were by nature slaves, and incapable of being instructed; and many other falsehoods of which the chronicler Herrera makes mention against them. Those zealous ecclesiastics being unable, either by their authority or preaching, to free those unhappy converts from the tyranny of such misers, had recourse to the Catholic kings, and at last obtained from their justice and clemency those laws, as favourable to the Americans as honourable to the court of Spain, that compose the Indian code, which were chiefly due to the indefatigable zeal of the bishop de las Casas. On another side, Garces bishop of Tlacalca, knowing that those Spaniards bore, notwithstanding their perversity, a great respect to the decisions of the vicar of Jesus Christ, made application in the year 1586 to Pope Paul III., by that famous letter of which we have made mention; representing to him the evils which the Indians suffered from the wicked Christians, and praying him to interpose his authority in their behalf. The pope, moved by such heavy remonstrances, dispatched the next year the original bull, a faithful copy of which we have here subjoined (A), which was not made, as is manifest, to declare\n\n(A) Paulus papa III. universis Christi Fidelibus prefentis Literas infpecturis Salutem et Apofolicam Benedictionem—\"Veritas ipsa, qua nec falli nec fallere potest, cum Predicatores Fidei ad officium predications definiret, dixit dignificatur: Eunte docete omnes gentes: omnes, dixit, absque omni delechu, cum omnes Fidei disciplina capaces existant.

Let us hear, therefore, how celebrated admiral speaks, in his account to the Catholic sovereigns Ferdinand and Isabella, of the first satyrs he saw in the island of Haiti or Hispaniola. \"I swear,\" he says, \"to your majesties, that there is not a better people in the world than these, more affectionate, affable, or mild. They love their neighbours as themselves: their language is the sweetest, the loveliest, and the most cheerful; for they always speak smiling; and although they go naked, let your majesties believe me, their customs are very becoming; and their king, who is served with great majesty, has such engaging manners, that it gives great pleasure to see him, and also to consider the retentive faculty of that people, and their desire of knowledge, which incites them to ask the causes and the effects of things.\"\n\n\"We have had intimate commerce with the Americans (continues the Abbé); have lived for some years in a seminary destined for their instruction; saw the erection and progress of the royal college of Guadalupe, founded in Mexico by a Mexican Jesuit, for the education of Indian children; had afterwards some Indians among our pupils; had particular knowledge of many American rectors, many nobles, and numerous artists; attentively observed their character, their genius, their disposition, and manner of thinking; and having examined besides, with the utmost diligence, their ancient history, their religion, their government, their laws, and their customs: After such long experience and study of them, from which we imagine ourselves enabled to decide without danger of erring, we declare to M. de Paw, and to all Europe, that the mental qualities of the Americans are not in the least inferior to those of the Europeans; that they are capable of all, even the most abstract sciences; and that, if equal care was taken of their education, if they were brought up from childhood in seminaries under good masters, were protected and stimulated by rewards, we should feel rise among the Americans, philosophers, mathematicians, and divines, who would rival the first in Europe.\"\n\nBut although we should suppose, that, in the torrid climates of the new world, as well as in those of the old, especially under the additional deprivation of slavery, there was an inferiority of the mental powers, the Chilele and the North Americans have discovered higher rudiments of human excellence and ingenuity than have ever been known among tribes in a similar state of society in any part of the world.\n\nM. de Paw affirms, that the Americans were unacquainted with the use of money, and quotes the following well-known passage from Montefique: \"Imagine to yourself, that, by some accident, you are placed in an unknown country; if you find money there, do not doubt that you are arrived among a polished people.\" But if by money we are to understand a piece of metal with the stamp of the prince or the public, the want of it in a nation is no token of barbarity. The Athenians employed oxen for money, as the Romans did sheep. The Romans had no coined money till the time of Servius Tullius, nor the Persians until the reign of Darius Hystaspes. But if by money is understood a sign representing the value of merchandise, the Mexicans, and other nations of Anahuac, employed money in their commerce. The cacao, of which they made constant use in the market to purchase whatever they wanted, was employed for this purpose, as salt is in Abyssinia.\n\nIt has been affirmed that stone bridges were unknown in America when it was first discovered; and that the natives did not know how to form arches. But these assertions are erroneous. The remains of the ancient palaces of Tezcuco, and still more their vapour baths, show the ancient use of arches and vaults among the Mexicans. But the ignorance of this art would have been no proof of barbarity. Neither the Egyptians nor Babylonians understood the construction of arches.\n\nM. de Paw affirms, that the palace of Montezuma was nothing else than a hut. But it is certain, from the affirmation of all the historians of Mexico, that the army under Cortes, consisting of 6400 men, was all lodged in the palace; and there remained still sufficient room for Montezuma and his attendants.\n\nThe advances which the Mexicans had made in the study of astronomy is perhaps the most surprising proof science of their attention and sagacity; for it appears from Abbé Clavigero's history, that they not only counted 365 days to the year, but also knew of the excess of about six hours in the solar over the civil year, and remedied the difference by means of intercalary days.\n\nOf American morality, the following exhortation of\n\n---\n\nillis ferventia urgeant. Nos igitur, qui ejusdem Domini nostri vices, licet indigni, gerimus in terris, et Oves gregis fui nobis commissas, qua extra ejus Ovile sunt, ad ipsum Ovile totum nixu exquirimus, attendantes Indos ipsos, utpote veros homines, non folium Christianae Fidei capaces existere, sed, ut nobis innotuit, ad Fidem ipsam promptissime currere, ac volentes super his congruis remediis providere, praedictos Indos et omnes alias gentes ad notitiam Christianorum in potentiam devenerunt, licet extra fidem Christi existant, sive libertate et domino hujusmodi uti, et potiri, et gaudere libere, et licite polle, nec in servitutem redigi debere, ac quicquid fecus fieri contigerit irritum et inane, ipso facto Indos, et alias Gentes Verbi Dei predicatioe, et exemplo bona vite ad dietam Fidem Christi invitandos fore.

Pontificatus nostri anno III. Quæsta, è non altra è quella famosa bolla, per la quale s'è fatto un si grande schia-\nAmerica, a Mexican to his son may serve as a specimen. \"My son, who art come into the light from the womb of thy mother like a chicken from the egg, and like it art of their preparing to fly through the world, we know not how long Heaven will grant us the enjoyment of that precious gem which we possess in thee; but however short the period, endeavour to live exactly, praying God continually to afflict thee. He created thee: thou art his property. He is thy father, and loves thee still more than I do: repose in him thy thoughts, and day and night direct thy sighs to him. Reverence and salute thy elders, and hold no one in contempt. To the poor and distressed be not dumb, but rather use words of comfort. Honour all persons, particularly thy parents, to whom thou owest obedience, respect, and service. Guard against imitating the example of those wicked sons, who, like brutes that are deprived of reason, neither reverence their parents, listen to their instruction, nor submit to their correction; because whoever follows their steps will have an unhappy end, will die in a desperate or sudden manner, or will be killed and devoured by wild beasts.\n\n\"Mock not, my son, the aged or the imperfect. Scorn not him whom you see fall into some folly or transgression, nor make him reproaches; but restrain thyself, and beware lest thou fall into the same error which offends thee in another. Go not where thou art not called, nor interfere in that which does not concern thee. Endeavour to manifest thy good breeding in all thy words and actions. In conversation, do not lay thy hands upon another, nor speak too much, nor interrupt or disturb another's discourse. When any one discourses with thee, hear him attentively, and hold thyself in an easy attitude, neither playing with thy feet, nor putting thy mantle to thy mouth, nor spitting too often, nor looking about you here and there, nor rising up frequently, if thou art sitting; for such actions are indications of levity and low breeding.\"—He proceeds to mention several particular vices which are to be avoided, and concludes,—\"Steal not, nor give thyself to gaming; otherwise thou wilt be a disgrace to thy parents, whom thou oughtest rather to honour for the education they have given thee. If thou wilt be virtuous, thy example will put the wicked to shame. No more, my son; enough hath been said in discharge of the duties of a father. With these counsels I wish to fortify thy mind. Refuse them not, nor act in contradiction to them; for on them thy life and all thy happiness depend.\"\n\nAs ranging on the same side with the Abbé Clavigero, the ingenious Mr Jefferson deserves particular attention. This gentleman, in his Notes on the State of Virginia, &c., has taken occasion to combat the opinions of Buffon; and seems to have fully refuted them both by argument and facts. The French philosopher affirms, \"That living nature is less active, less energetic, in the new world than in the old.\" He affirms, 1. That the animals common to both continents are smaller in America. 2. That those peculiar to the new are on an inferior scale. 3. That those which have been domesticated in both have degenerated in America. And, 4. That it exhibits fewer species of living creatures. The cause of this he attributes to the diminution of heat in America, and to the prevalence of humidity from the extension of its lakes and waters over a prodigious surface. In other words, he affirms, that heat is friendly and moisture adverse to the production and development of the larger quadrupeds.\n\nThe hypothesis, that moisture is unfriendly to animal growth, Mr Jefferson shows to be contradicted by observation, that fervour and experience. It is by the affluence of moisture that vegetables are elaborated from the elements. Accordingly we find, that the more luxuriant growth, mild climates produce plants in greater profusion than considered the dry. Vegetables are immediately or remotely the food of every animal; and, from the uniform operation of Nature's laws we discern, that, in proportion to the quantity of food, animals are not only multiplied in their numbers, but improved in their size. Of this last opinion is the count de Buffon himself, in another part of his work: \"En général, il paraît que les pays un peu froids conviennent mieux à nos brevets que les pays chauds, et qu'ils font d'autant plus gros et plus grands que le climat est plus humide et plus abondans en pluies et neiges.\" Here, then, a race of animals, and one of the largest too, has been increased in its dimensions by cold and rainy main-moisture, in direct opposition to the hypothesis, which tained by supposes that these two circumstances diminish animal bulk, and that it is their contraries, heat and dryness, which enlarge it. But to try the question on more general ground, let us take two portions of the earth, Europe and America for instance, sufficiently extensive to give operation to general causes; let us consider the circumstances peculiar to each, and observe their effect on animal nature. America, running through the torrid as well as temperate zone, has more heat collectively taken, than Europe. But Europe, according to our hypothesis, is the driest. They are equally adapted then to animal productions; each being endowed with one of those causes which befriending animal growth, and with one which opposes it. Let us, then, take a comparative view of the quadrupeds of Europe and America, presenting them to the eye in three different tables; in one of which shall be enumerated those found in both countries; in a second, those found in one only; in a third, those which have been domesticated in both. To facilitate the comparison, let those of each table be arranged in gradation, according to their sizes, from the greatest to the smallest, so far as their sizes can be conjectured. The weights of the large animals shall be expressed in the English avoirdupois pound and its decimals; those of the smaller in the ounce and its decimals. Those which are marked thus *, are actual weights of particular subjects, deemed among the largest of their species. Those marked thus +, are furnished by judicious persons, well acquainted with the species, and saying, from conjecture only, what the largest individual they had seen would probably have weighed. The other weights are taken from Messrs Buffon and D'Aubenton, and are of such subjects as came casually to their hands for direction.\n\nComparative.\n### Table I.

So that the first table impeaches the first member of the assertion, that of the animals common to both countries the American are smaller, \"Et cela sans aucune exception.\" It shows it not just, in all the latitude in which its author has advanced it, and probably not to such a degree as to found a distinction between the two countries.\n\nProceeding to the second table, which arranges the animals found in one of the two countries only, M. de Buffon observes, that the tapir, the elephant of America, is but of the size of a small cow. To preserve our comparison, Mr Jefferson states the wild boar, the elephant of Europe, as little more than half that size. He has made an elk with round or cylindrical horns an animal of America, and peculiar to it; because he has seen many of them himself, and more of their horns; and because, from the best information, it is certain that in Virginia this kind of elk has abounded much, and still exists in smaller numbers. He makes the American hare or rabbit peculiar, believing it to be different from both the European animals of these denominations, and calling it therefore by its Algonquin name whabuus, to keep it distinct from these. Kalm is of the same opinion. The squirrels are denominated from a knowledge derived from daily sight of them, because with that the European appellations and descriptions seem irreconcilable. These are the only instances in which Mr Jefferson departs from the authority of M. de Buffon in the construction of this table; whom he takes for his ground-work, because he thinks him the best informed of any naturalist who has ever written. The result is, that there are 18 quadrupeds peculiar to Europe; more than four times as many, to wit 74, peculiar to America; that the first of these 74, the tapir, the largest of the animals peculiar to America, weighs more than the whole column of Europeans; and consequently this second table disproves the second member of the assertion, that the animals peculiar to the new world are on a smaller scale, so far as that assertion relied on European animals for support: and it is in full opposition to the theory which makes the animal volume to depend on the circumstances of heat and moisture.\n\nThe third table comprehends those quadrupeds only which are domestic in both countries. That some of these, in some parts of America, have become less than their original stock, is doubtless true; and the reason is very obvious. In a thinly peopled country, the spontaneous productions of the forests and waste fields are sufficient to support indifferently the domestic animals of the farmer, with a very little aid from him in the feeding and care. Therefore he finds it more convenient to receive them from the hand of Nature in that indifferent state, than to keep up their size by a care and nourishment which would cost him much labour. If, on this low fare, these animals dwindle, it is no more than they do in those parts of Europe where the poverty of the soil, or poverty of the owner, reduces them to the same scanty subsistence. It is the uniform effect of one and the same cause, whether acting on this or that side of the globe. It would be erring, therefore, against that rule of philosophy, which teaches us to ascribe like effects to like causes, should we impute this diminution of size in America to any imbecility or want of uniformity in the operations of nature. It may be affirmed with truth, that in those countries, and with those individuals of America, where necessity or curiosity has produced equal attention as in Europe to the nourishment of animals, the horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs, of the one continent are as large as those of the other. There are particular instances, well attested, where individuals of America have imported good breeders from England, and have improved their size by care in the course of some years. And the weights actually known and stated in the third table, will suffice to show, that we may conclude, on probable grounds, that, with equal food and care, the climate of America will preserve the races of domestic animals as large as the European stock from which they are derived; and consequently that the third member of Monf. de Buffon's assertion, that the domestic animals are subject to degeneration from the climate of America, is as probably wrong as the first and second were certainly so.\n\nThat the last part of it is erroneous, which affirms, that the species of American quadrupeds are comparatively few, is evident from the tables taken all together; to which may be added the proof adduced by the Abbé Clavigero. According to Buffon's latest calculation, in his Époques de la Nature, there are 300 species of quadrupeds; and America, though it does not make more than a third part of the globe, contains, according to Clavigero, almost one half of the different species of its animals.\n\nOf the human inhabitants of America, to whom the human hypothesis of degeneracy is extended, M. Buffon's inhabitant gives the following description: \"Though the American savage is nearly of the same stature with men in the same polished societies; yet this is not a sufficient exception to the general contraction of animated nature throughout the whole continent. In the savage, the organs of frugality are small and feeble. He has no hair, no beard, no ardour for the female. Though nimbler than the European, because more accustomed to running, his strength is not so great. His sensations are less acute; and yet he is more timid and cowardly. He has no vivacity, no activity of mind. The activity of his body is not so much an exercise or spontaneous motion, as a necessary action produced by want. Destroy his appetite for victuals and drink, and you will at once annihilate the active principle of all his movements: He remains in stupid repose, on his limbs or couch, for whole days. It is easy to discover the cause of the scattered\nAmerica scattered life of savages, and of their estrangement from society. They have been refused the most precious spark of Nature's fire: They have no ardour for women, and, of course, no love to mankind. Unacquainted with the most lively and most tender of all attachments, their other sensations of this nature are cold and languid. Their love to parents and children is extremely weak. The bounds of the most intimate of all societies, that of the same family, are feeble; and one family has no attachment to another. Hence no union, no republic, no social state, can take place among them. The physical cause of love gives rise to the morality of their manners. Their heart is frozen, their society cold, and their empire cruel. They regard their females as servants destined to labour, or as beasts of burden, whom they load unmercifully with the produce of their hunting, and oblige, without pity or gratitude, to perform labours which often exceed their strength. They have few children, and pay little attention to them. Everything must be referred to the first cause: They are indifferent, because they are weak; and this indifference to the sex is the original stain which disgraces Nature, prevents her from expanding, and, by destroying the germs of life, cuts the root of society. Hence man makes no exception to what has been advanced. Nature, by denying him the faculty of love, has abused and contracted him more than any other animal.\n\nA humiliating picture indeed! but than which, Mr Jefferson affirms us, never one was more unlike the original. M. Buffon grants, that their stature is the same as that of the men of Europe; and he might have admitted, that the Iroquois were larger, and the Lenape or Delawares taller, than people in Europe generally are. But he says their organs of generation are smaller and weaker than those of Europeans; which is not a fact. And as to their want of beard, this error has been already noticed (N° 49, supra.)\n\n\"They have no ardour for their females.\" It is true, they do not indulge those excesses, nor discover that fondness, which are customary in Europe; but this is not owing to a defect in nature, but to manners. Their soul is wholly bent upon war. This is what procures them glory among the men, and makes them the admiration of the women. To this they are educated from their earliest youth. When they pursue game with ardour, when they bear the fatigues of the chase, when they sustain and suffer patiently hunger and cold, it is not so much for the sake of the game they pursue, as to convince their parents and the council of the nation, that they are fit to be enrolled in the number of the warriors. The songs of the women, the dance of the warriors, the sage counsel of the chiefs, the tales of the old, the triumphant entry of the warriors returning with success from battle, and the respect paid to those who distinguish themselves in battle, and in subduing their enemies; in short, every thing they see or hear tends to inspire them with an ardent desire for military fame. If a young man were to discover a fondness for women before he has been to war, he would become the contempt of the men, and the scorn and ridicule of the women: or were he to indulge himself with a captive taken in war, and much more were he to offer violence in order to gratify his lust, he would incur indelible disgrace. The seeming frigidity of the men, therefore, is the effect of manners, and not a defect of nature. They are neither more defective in ardour, nor more impotent with the female, than are the whites reduced to the same diet and exercise.\n\n\"They raise few children.\"—They indeed raise few. Why they rear children than we do; the causes of which are to be found, not in a difference of nature, but of circumstance. The women very frequently attending the men in their parties of war and of hunting, childbearing becomes extremely inconvenient to them. It is said, therefore, that they have learned the practice of procuring abortion by the use of some vegetable; and that it even extends to prevent conception for a considerable time after. During these parties they are exposed to numerous hazards, to excessive exertions, to the greatest extremes of hunger. Even at their homes, the nation depends for food, through a certain part of every year, on the gleanings of the forest; that is, they experience a famine once in every year. With all animals, if the female be badly fed, or not fed at all, her young perish; and if both male and female be reduced to like want, generation becomes less active, less productive. To the obstacles, then, of want and hazard, which Nature has opposed to the multiplication of wild animals, for the purpose of restraining their numbers within certain bounds, those of labour and of voluntary abortion are added with the Indian. No wonder, then, if they multiply less than we do. Where food is regularly supplied, a single farm will show more of cattle than a whole country of forests can of buffaloes. The same Indian women, when married to white traders, who feed them and their children plentifully and regularly, who exempt them from excessive drudgery, who keep them stationary and exposed to accident, produce and raise as many children as the white women. Instances are known, under these circumstances, of their rearing a dozen children.\n\nNeither do they seem to be \"deficient in natural affection.\" On the contrary, their sensibility is keen, even the warriors weeping most bitterly on the loss of their children; though in general they endeavour to appear superior to human events.\n\nTheir friendships are strong, and faithful to the utmost extremity. A remarkable instance of this appeared in the case of the late Col. Byrd, who was sent to the Cherokee nation to transact some business with them. It happened that some of our disorderly people had just killed one or two of that nation. It was therefore proposed in the council of the Cherokees, that Col. Byrd should be put to death, in revenge for the loss of their countrymen. Among them was a chief, called Silouee, who, on some former occasion, had contracted an acquaintance and friendship with Col. Byrd: He came to him every night in his tent, and told him not to be afraid, they should not kill him. After many days deliberation, however, the determination was, contrary to Silouee's expectation, that Byrd should be put to death, and some warriors were despatched as executioners. Silouee attended them; and when they entered the tent, he threw himself between them and Byrd, and said to the warriors, \"This man is my friend; before you get at him, you must kill...\"\nAmerica, kill me.\" On which they returned; and the council respected the principle so much as to recede from their determination.\n\nThat \"they are timorous and cowardly,\" is a character with which there is little reason to charge them, when we recollect the manner in which the Iroquois met Mons. ———, who marched into their country; in which the old men, who scorned to fly, or to survive the capture of their town, braved death like the old Romans in the time of the Gauls, and in which they soon after revenged themselves by sacking and destroying Montreal. In short, the Indian is brave, when an enterprise depends on bravery; education with him making the point of honour consist in the destruction of an enemy by stratagem, and in the preservation of his own person free from injury: or perhaps this is nature, while it is education which teaches us to honour force more than finesse. He will defend himself against an host of enemies, always choosing to be killed rather than to surrender, though it be to the whites, who he knows will treat him well. In other situations also, he meets death with more deliberation, and endures tortures with a firmness unknown almost to religious enthusiasm among us.\n\nMuch less are they to be characterized as a people of no vivacity, and who are excited to action or motion only by the calls of hunger and thirst. Their dances, in which they take much delight, and which to a European would be the most severe exercise, fully contradict this; not to mention their fatiguing marches, and the toil they voluntarily and cheerfully undergo in their military expeditions. It is true, that when at home they do not employ themselves in labour or the culture of the soil: but this, again, is the effect of customs and manners which have assigned that to the province of the women. But it is said, \"they are averse to society and a social life.\" Can anything be more inapplicable than this to people who always live in towns or in clans? Or can they be said to have no republic, who conduct all their affairs in national councils; who pride themselves in their national character; who consider an insult or injury done to an individual by a stranger as done to the whole, and resent it accordingly?\n\nTo form a just estimate of their genius and mental powers, Mr Jefferson observes, more facts are wanting, and great allowance is to be made for those circumstances of their situation which call for a display of particular talents only. This done, we shall probably find that the Americans are formed, in mind as well as in body, on the same model with the homo sapiens Europaeus. The principles of their society forbidding all compulsion, they are to be led to duty and to enterprise by personal influence and persuasion. Hence eloquence in council, bravery and address in war, become the foundations of all consequence with them. To these acquirements all their faculties are directed. Of their bravery and address in war we have multiplied proofs, because we have been the subjects on which they were exercised. Of their eminence in oratory we have fewer examples, because it is displayed chiefly in their own councils. Some, however, we have of very superior lustre. We may challenge the whole orations of Demosthenes and Cicero, and of any more eminent orator, if Europe has furnished more eminent, to produce a single passage superior to the speech of Logan, a Mingo chief, to Lord Dunmore America when governor of this state. The story is as follows; of which, and of the speech, the authenticity is unquestionable. In the spring of the year 1774, a robbery and murder were committed on an inhabitant of the frontiers of Virginia by two Indians of the Shawanee tribe. The neighbouring whites, according to their custom, undertook to punish this outrage in a summary way. Colonel Crefap, a man infamous for the many murders he had committed on those much injured people, collected a party, and proceeded down the Kanawha in quest of vengeance. Unfortunately a canoe of women and children, with one man only, was seen coming from the opposite shore, unarmed, and unsuspecting any hostile attack from the whites. Crefap and his party concealed themselves on the bank of the river; and the moment the canoe reached the shore, singled out their objects, and at one fire killed every person in it. This happened to be the family of Logan, who had long been distinguished as a friend of the whites. This unworthy return provoked his vengeance. He accordingly signalized himself in the war which ensued. In the autumn of the same year, a decisive battle was fought at the mouth of the Great Kanawha, between the collected forces of the Shawanee, Mingoes, and Delawares, and a detachment of the Virginian militia. The Indians were defeated, and sued for peace. Logan, however, disdained to be seen among the supplicants; but, lest the sincerity of a treaty should be distrusted from which so distinguished a chief absented himself, he sent by a messenger the following speech, to be delivered to Lord Dunmore:—I appeal to any white man to say if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, of Indian and he gave him not meat; if ever he came cold and eloquent, naked, and he clothed him not. During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, Logan is the friend of white men. I had even thought to have lived with you, but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Crefap, the last spring, in cold blood, and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of Logan, not sparing even my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have fought it; I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace; but do not harbour a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\"\n\nTo the preceding anecdotes in favour of the American character, may be added the following by Dr Benjamin Franklin. The Indian men, when young, are hunters and warriors; when old, counsellors; for all their government is by the counsel or advice of the sages. Hence they generally study oratory; the best speaker having the most influence. The Indian women till the ground, dress the food, nurse and bring up the children, and preserve and hand down to posterity the memory of public transactions. These employments of men and women are accounted natural and honourable. Having few artificial wants, they have abundance of leisure for improvement by conversation. Our laborious manner of life, compared with theirs, they esteem\nAmerica, esteem flattery and base; and the learning on which we value ourselves, they regard as frivolous and useless.\n\nHaving frequent occasions to hold public councils, they have acquired great order and decency in conducting them. The old men fit in the foremost ranks, the warriors in the next, and the women and children in the hindmost. The business of the women is to take exact notice of what passes; imprint it in their memories, for they have no writing, and communicate it to their children. They are the records of the council, and they preserve tradition of the stipulations in treaties a hundred years back; which, when we compare with our writings, we always find exact. He that would speak rises. The rest observe a profound silence. When he has finished, and sits down, they leave him five or six minutes to recollect, that if he has omitted any thing he intended to say, or has any thing to add, he may rise again and deliver it. To interrupt another, even in common conversation, is reckoned highly indecent.\n\nThe politeness of these savages in conversation is, indeed, carried to excess; since it does not permit them to contradict or deny the truth of what is asserted in their presence. By this means they indeed avoid disputes; but then it becomes difficult to know their minds, or what impression you make upon them. The missionaries who have attempted to convert them to Christianity, all complain of this as one of the greatest difficulties of their mission. The Indians hear with patience the truths of the gospel explained to them, and give their usual tokens of assent and approbation; but this by no means implies conviction; it is mere civility.\n\nWhen any of them come into our towns, our people are apt to crowd round them, gaze upon them, and inconvenience them where they desire to be private; this they esteem great rudeness, and the effect of the want of instruction in the rules of civility and good manners.\n\n\"We have (say they) as much curiosity as you; and when you come into our towns, we wish for opportunities of looking at you; but for this purpose we hide ourselves behind bushes where you are to pass, and never intrude ourselves into your company.\"\n\nTheir manner of entering one another's villages has likewise its rules. It is reckoned uncivil in travelling strangers to enter a village abruptly, without giving notice of their approach. Therefore, as soon as they arrive within hearing, they stop and holla, remaining there till invited to enter. Two old men usually come out to them and lead them in. There is in every village a vacant dwelling, called the strangers' house. Here they are placed, while the old men go round from hut to hut, acquainting the inhabitants that strangers are arrived, who are probably hungry and weary; and every one lends them what he can spare of victuals, and skins to repose on. When the strangers are refreshed, pipes and tobacco are brought; and then, but not before, conversation begins, with inquiries who they are, whither bound, what news, &c., and it usually ends with offers of service; if the strangers have occasion for guides, or any necessaries for continuing their journey; and nothing is exacted for the entertainment.\n\nThe same hospitality, esteemed among them as a principal virtue, is practised by private persons; of America, which Conrad Weiser, the interpreter, gave Dr Franklin the following instance: He had been naturalized among the Six Nations, and spoke well the Mohawk language. In going through the Indian country to carry a message from our governor to the council at Onondaga, he called at the habitation of Canaftetego, an old acquaintance, who embraced him, spread furs for him to sit on, placed before him some boiled beans and venison, and mixed some rum and water for his drink. When he was well refreshed, and had lit his pipe, Canaftetego began to converse with him; asked how he had fared the many years since they had seen each other, whence he then came, what had occasioned the journey, &c. Conrad answered all his questions, and when the discourse began to flag, the Indian, to continue it, said, \"Conrad, you have lived long among the white people, and know something of their customs; I have been sometimes at Albany, and have observed, that once in seven days they flout up their thongs, and assemble all in the great house; tell me what it is for!—What do they do there?\" \"They meet there (says Conrad) to hear and learn good things.\" \"I do not doubt (says the Indian) that they tell you so; they have told me the same; but I doubt the truth of what they say, and I will tell you my reasons. I went lately to Albany to sell my skins, and buy blankets, knives, powder, rum, &c. You know I generally used to deal with Hans Hanlon; but I was a little inclined this time to try some other merchants. However, I called first upon Hans, and asked him what he would give for beaver. He said he could not give more than 4s. a-pound; but (says he) I cannot talk on business now; this is the day when we meet together to learn good things, and I am going to the meeting. So I thought to myself, since I cannot do any business today, I may as well go to the meeting too; and I went with him.\n\nThere stood up a man in black, and began to talk to the people very angrily. I did not understand what he said; but perceiving that he looked much at me and at Hanlon, I imagined he was angry at seeing me there: so I went out, sat down near the house, struck fire, and lit my pipe, waiting till the meeting should break up. I thought too, that the man had mentioned something of beaver, and I suspected that it might be the subject of their meeting. So when they came out, I accosted my merchant.—Well Hans (says I), I hope you have agreed to give more than 4s. a-pound?\"\n\n\"No (says he), I cannot give so much, I cannot give more than 3s. 6d.\"\n\n\"I then spoke to several other dealers, but they all sung the same song, three and sixpence, three and sixpence. This made it clear to me that my suspicion was right; and that whatever they pretended of meeting to learn good things, the real purpose was, to consult how to cheat Indians in the price of beaver. Consider but a little, Conrad, and you must be of my opinion. If they met so often to learn good things, they certainly would have learned some before this time. But they are still ignorant. You know our practice. If a white man, in travelling through our country, enters one of our cabins, we all treat him as I treat you; we dry him if he is wet, we warm him if he is cold, and give him meat and drink, that he may allay his thirst and hunger; and we spread furs,\nAmerica, furs for him to rest and sleep on: we demand nothing in return. But if I go into a white man's house at Albany, and ask for victuals and drink, they say, Where is your money? And if I have none, they say, Get out, you Indian dog. You see they have not yet learned those little good things that we need no meeting to be instructed in; because our mothers taught them to us when we were children; and therefore it is impossible their meetings should be, as they say, for any such purpose, or have any such effect; they are only to contrive the cheating of Indians in the price of beaver.\"\n\nThe next question that occurs is, Whether the peculiarities of the Americans, or the disparity between them and the inhabitants of Europe, afford sufficient grounds for determining them, as some have done, to be a race of men radically different from all others?\n\nIn this question, to avoid being tedious, we shall confine ourselves to what has been advanced by Lord Kames; who is of opinion, that there are many different species of men, as well as of other animals; and gives a hypothesis, whereby he pretends his opinion may be maintained in a consistency with revelation.\n\n\"If (says he) the only rule afforded by nature for clasping animals can be depended on, there are different races of men as well as of dogs: a mastiff differs not more from a spaniel, than a white man from a negro, or a Laplander from a Dane. And if we have any faith in Providence, it ought to be so. Plants were created of different kinds, to fit them for different climates; and so were brute animals. Certain it is, that all men are not fitted equally for every climate. There is scarce a climate but what is natural to some men, where they prosper and flourish; and there is not a climate but where some men degenerate. Doth not then analogy lead us to conclude, that, as there are different climates on the face of this globe, so there are different races of men fitted for these different climates?\"\n\n\"M. Buffon, from the rule, That animals which can procreate together, and whose progeny can also procreate, are of one species; concludes, that all men are of one race or species; and endeavours to support that favourite opinion, by ascribing to the climate, to food, or to other accidental causes, all the varieties that are found among men. But is he ferociously of opinion, that any operation of climate, or of other accidental cause, can account for the copper colour and smooth chin universal among the Americans; the prominence of the pudenda universal among the Hottentot women; or the black nipple no less universal among the female Samoiedes?—It is in vain to ascribe to the climate the low stature of the Esquimaux, the smallness of their feet, or the overgrown size of their heads. It is equally in vain to ascribe to climate the low stature of the Laplanders, or their ugly visage. The black colour of negroes, thick lips, flat nose, crisp'd woolly hair, and rank smell, distinguish them from every other race of men. The Abyssinians, on the contrary, are tall and well made, their complexion a brown olive, features well proportioned, eyes large and of a sparkling black, thin lips, a nose rather high than flat. There is no such difference of climate between Abyssinia and Negroland as to produce these striking differences.\n\nNor shall our author's ingenious hypothesis concerning the extremities of heat and cold, purchase him impunity with respect to the fallow complexion of the America, Samoiedes, Laplanders, and Greenlanders. The Finns, and northern Norwegians, live in a climate not less cold than that of the people mentioned; and yet are fair beyond other Europeans. I say more, there are many instances of races of people preserving their original colour, in climates very different from their own; but not a single instance of the contrary, as far as I can learn. There have been four complete generations of negroes in Pennsylvania, without any visible change of colour; they continue jet black, as originally. Those who ascribe all to the sun, ought to consider how little probable it is, that the colour is imprinted on the parents should be communicated to their infant children, who never saw the sun: I should be as soon induced to believe with a German naturalist, whose name has escaped me, that the negro colour is owing to an ancient custom in Africa, of dyeing the skin black. Let a European, for years, expose himself to the sun in a hot climate, till he be quite brown; his children will nevertheless have the same complexion with those in Europe. From the action of the sun, is it possible to explain, why a negro, like a European, is born with a ruddy skin, which turns jet black the eighth or ninth day?\"\n\nOur author next proceeds to draw some arguments for the existence of different races of men, from the various tempers and dispositions of different nations; which he reckons to be specific differences, as well as those of colour, stature, &c., and having summed up his evidence he concludes thus: \"Upon summing up the whole particulars mentioned above, would one hesitate a moment to adopt the following opinion, were there no counterbalancing evidence, viz. 'That God created many pairs of the human race, differing from each other, both externally and internally; that he fitted those pairs for different climates, and placed each pair in its proper climate; that the peculiarities of the original pairs were preserved entire in their descendants; who, having no assistance but their natural talents, were left to gather knowledge from experience: and, in particular, were left (each tribe) to form a language for itself; that signs were sufficient for the original pairs, without any language but what nature suggests; and that a language was formed gradually as a tribe increased in numbers, and in different occupations, to make speech necessary?' But this opinion, however plausible, we are not permitted to adopt; being taught a different lesson by revelation, viz. 'That God created but a single pair of the human species.' Though we cannot doubt the authority of Moses, yet his account of the creation of man is not a little puzzling, as it seems to contradict every one of the facts mentioned above. According to that account, different races of men were not formed, nor were men formed originally for different climates. All men must have spoken the same language, viz. that of our first parents. And what of all learns the most contradictory to that account, is the savage state: Adam, as Moses informs us, was endowed by his Maker with an eminent degree of knowledge; and he certainly was an excellent preceptor to his children and their progeny, among whom he lived many generations. Whence then the degeneracy of all men into the savage state? To account for that dismal catastrophe,\nAmerica, catastrophe, mankind must have suffered some terrible convulsion. That terrible convulsion is revealed to us in the history of the tower of Babel contained in the 11th chapter of Genesis, which is, \"That, for many centuries after the deluge, the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech; that they united to build a city on a plain in the land of Shinar, with a tower whose top might reach unto heaven; that the Lord, beholding the people to be one, and to have all one language, and that nothing would be restrained from them which they imagined to do, founded their language that they might not understand one another, and scattered them abroad upon the face of all the earth.\" Here light breaks forth in the midst of darkness. By confounding the language of men, and scattering them abroad upon the face of all the earth, they were rendered savages. And to harden them for their new habitations, it was necessary that they should be divided into different kinds, fitted for different climates. Without an immediate change of constitution, the builders of Babel could not possibly have subsisted in the burning region of Guinea, nor in the frozen region of Lapland; houses not being prepared, nor any other convenience to protect them against a destructive climate.\"\n\nWe may first remark, on his Lordship's hypothesis, that it is evidently incomplete; for, allowing the human race to have been divided into different species at the confusion of languages, and that each species was adapted to a particular climate; by what means were they to get to the climates proper for them, or how were they to know that such climates existed? How was an American, for instance, when languishing in an improper climate at Babel, to get to the land of the Amazons, or the banks of the Oroomoko, in his own country? or how was he to know that these places were more proper for him than others?—If, indeed we take the Scripture phrase, \"The Lord scattered them abroad upon the face of all the earth,\" in a certain sense, we may account for it. If we suppose that the different species were immediately carried off by a whirlwind, or other supernatural means, to their proper countries, the difficulty will vanish; but if this is his Lordship's interpretation, it is certainly a very singular one.\n\nBefore entering upon a consideration of the particular arguments used by our author for proving the diversity of species in the human race, it will be proper to lay down the following general principles, which may serve as axioms. (1.) When we assert a multiplicity of species in the human race; we bring in a supernatural cause to solve a natural phenomenon: for these species are supposed to be the immediate work of the Deity. (2.) No person has a right to call anything the immediate effect of omnipotence, unless by express revelation from the Deity, or from a certainty that no natural cause is sufficient to produce the effect. The reason is plain. The Deity is invincible, and so are many natural causes; when we see an effect therefore, of which the cause does not manifest itself, we cannot know whether the immediate cause is the Deity or an invisible natural power. An example of this we have in the phenomena of thunder and earthquakes, which were often ascribed immediately to the Deity, but are now discovered to be the effects of electricity.\n\n(3.) No person can assert natural causes to be insufficient to produce such and such effects, unless he perfectly knows all these causes and the limits of their power in all possible cases; and this no man has ever known or can know.\n\nBy keeping in view these principles, which we hope are self-evident, we will easily see Lord Kames's arguments to consist entirely in a petitio principii.—In substance they are all reduced to this single sentence: \"Natural philosophers have been hitherto unsuccessful in their endeavours to account for the differences observed among mankind, therefore these differences cannot be accounted for from natural causes.\"\n\nHis Lordship, however, tells us in the passages already quoted, that \"a maitiff differs not more from a Spaniard, than a Laplander from a Dane;\" that \"it is Kames's vain to ascribe to climate the low stature of the Laplanders, or their ugly visage.\"—Yet, in a note on the word Laplanders, he subjoins, that, \"by late accounts it appears, that the Laplanders are only degenerated Tartars; and that they and the Hungarians originally sprung from the same breed of men, and from the same country.\"—The Hungarians are generally handsome and well made, like Danes, or like other people. The Laplanders, he tells us, differ as much from them as a maitiff from a Spaniard. Natural causes, therefore, according to Lord Kames himself, may cause two individuals of the same species of mankind differ from each other as much as a maitiff does from a Spaniard.\n\nWhile we are treating this subject of colour, it may not be amiss to observe, that a very remarkable difference of colour may accidentally happen to individuals of the same species. In the isthmus of Darien, a singular race of men has been discovered.—They are of a low stature, of a feeble make, and incapable of enduring fatigue. Their colour is a dead milk white; not resembling that of fair people among Europeans, but without any bluish or sanguine complexion. Their skin is covered with a fine hairy down of a chalky white; the hair of their heads, their eyebrows, and eyelashes, are of the same hue. Their eyes are of a singular form, and so weak, that they can hardly bear the light of the sun; but they see clearly by moonlight, and are most active and gay in the night. Among the negroes of Africa, as well as the natives of the Indian islands, a small number of these people are produced. They are called Albinos by the Portuguese, and Kachalakes by the Dutch.\n\nThis race of men is not indeed permanent; but it is sufficient to show, that mere colour is by no means the characteristic of a certain species of mankind. The difference of colour in these individuals is undoubtedly species; owing to a natural cause. To constitute, then, a race of men of this colour, it would only be necessary that this cause, which at present is merely accidental, should become permanent, and we cannot know but it may be so in some parts of the world.\n\nIf a difference in colour is no characteristic of a different species of mankind, much less can a difference in stature be thought so. In the southern parts of America, there are said to be a race of men exceeding the common size in height and strength.* This account, however, is doubted by some: but be that as it will, it is certain that the Equimaux are as much under the common size, as the Patagonians are said to\nAmerica, be above it. Nevertheless we are not to imagine, that either of these are specific differences; seeing the Laplanders and Hungarians are both of the same species, and yet the former are generally almost a foot shorter than the latter; and if a difference of climate, or other accidental causes, can make the people of one country a foot shorter than the common size of mankind, undoubtedly accidental causes of a contrary nature may make those of another country a foot taller than other men.\n\nThough the sun has undoubtedly a share in the production of the tawny colour of those nations which are most exposed to its influence; yet the manner of living to which people are accustomed, their victuals, their employment, &c., must contribute very much to a difference of complexion. There are some kinds of colouring roots, which if mixed with the food of certain animals, will tinge even their bones of a yellow colour. It cannot be thought any great degree of credulity to infer from this, that if these roots were mixed with the food of a white man, they might, without a miracle, tinge his skin of a yellow colour. If a man and woman were both to use food of this kind for a length of time, till they became as it were radically dyed, it is impossible, without the intervention of divine power, or of some extraordinary natural cause, but their children must be of the same colour: and was the same kind of food to be continued for several generations, it is more than probable that this colour might resist the continued use of any kind of food whatever. See further the article COMPLEXION.\n\nOf this indeed we have no examples, but we have an example of changes much more wonderful. It is allowed on all hands, that it is more easy to work a change upon the body of a man, or any other animal, than upon his mind. A man that is naturally choleric may indeed learn to prevent the bad effects of his passion by reason, but the passion itself will remain as immutable as his colour. But to reason in a manner similar to Lord Kames; though a man should be naturally choleric, or subject to any other passion, why should his children be so?—This way of reasoning, however plausible, is by no means conclusive, as will appear from the following passage in Mr Forster's Voyage.\n\nJune 6th. \"The officers who could not yet relish their last provisions after the refreshments of New Zealand, had ordered their black dog, mentioned p. 135, to be killed: this day, therefore, we dined for the first time on a leg of it roasted; which tasted so exactly like mutton, that it was absolutely undistinguishable. In our cold countries, where animal food is so much used, and where to be carnivorous perhaps lies in the nature of men, or is indispensably necessary to the preservation of their health and strength, it is strange that there should exist a Jewish aversion to dogs' flesh, when hogs, the most uncleanly of all animals, are eaten without scruple. Nature seems expressly to have intended them for this use, by making their offspring so very numerous, and their increase so quick and frequent. It may be objected, that the exalted degree of instinct which we observe in our dogs, inspires us with great unwillingness to kill and eat them. But it is owing to the time we spend on the education of dogs, that they acquire those eminent qualities which attach them so much to us. The natural qualities of our dogs may receive a wonderful improvement; but education must give its assistance, without which the human mind itself, though capable of an immense expansion, remains in a very contracted state.\n\nIn New Zealand, and (according to former accounts of voyages) in the tropical isles of the South sea, the dogs are the most stupid dull animals imaginable, and do not seem to have the least advantage in point of sagacity over our sheep, which are commonly made the emblems of filthiness. In the former country they are fed upon fish, in the latter on vegetables, and both their diets may have served to alter their disposition. Education may perhaps likewise graft new instincts; the New Zealand dogs are fed on the remains of their master's meals; they eat the bones of other dogs; and the puppies become true cannibals from their birth. We had a young New Zealand puppy on board, which had certainly had no opportunity of tasting anything but the mother's milk before we purchased it; however, it eagerly devoured a portion of the flesh and bones of the dog on which we dined to-day; while several others of the European breed taken on board at the Cape, turned from it without touching it.\n\n\"On the 4th of August, a young bitch, of the terrier breed, taken on board at the Cape of Good Hope, and covered by a spaniel, brought ten young ones, one of which was dead. The New Zealand dog mentioned above, which devoured the bones of the roasted dog, now fell upon the dead puppy, and ate of it with a ravenous appetite. This is a proof how far education may go in producing and propagating new instincts in animals. European dogs are never fed on the meat of their own species, but rather seem to abhor it. The New Zealand dogs, in all likelihood, are trained up from their earliest age to eat the remains of their master's meals: they are therefore used to feed upon fish, their own species, and perhaps human flesh; and what was only owing to a habit at first, may have become instinct by length of time. This was remarkable in our cannibal dog; for he came on board so young, that he could not have been weaned long enough to have acquired a habit of devouring his own species, and much less of eating human flesh; however, one of our seamen having cut his finger, held it out to the dog, who fell to greedily, licked it, and then began to bite it.\"\n\nFrom this account it appears, that even the instincts of animals are not unchangeable by natural causes; and if these causes are powerful enough to change the dispositions of succeeding generations, much more may we suppose them capable of making any possible alteration in the external appearance.\n\nWe are not here necessitated to confine ourselves to continued observations made on brute animals. The Franks are an other example of the production of one general character, formed by some natural cause from a mixture of many different nations.—They were a motley multitude, consisting of various German nations dwelling beyond the Rhine: who, uniting in defence of their common liberty, took thence the name of Franks; the word frank signifying in their language, as it still does in ours, free. Among them the following nations were mentioned, viz. the Actuarii, Chamavi, Bructeri, Salii, Frifii, Chaufii, Amfwarii, and Catti. We cannot suppose\nAmerica, suppose one character to belong to so many different nations; yet it is certain, that the Franks were nationally characterized as treacherous; and so deeply seems this quality to have been rooted in their nature, that their descendants have not got quite free of it in 1500 years. It is in vain, then, to talk of different races of men, either from their colour, size, or prevailing dispositions, seeing we have undeniable proofs that all these may be changed, in the most remarkable manner, by natural causes, without any miraculous interposition of the Deity.\n\nThe next question, then, which presents itself is, From what part of the old world America has most probably been peopled?\n\nDiscoveries long ago made inform us, that an intercourse between the old continent and America might be carried on with facility from the north-west extremities of Europe and the north-east boundaries of Asia. In the ninth century the Norwegians discovered Greenland, and planted a colony there. The communication with that country was renewed in the last century by Moravian missionaries, in order to propagate their doctrines in that bleak and uncultivated region. By them we are informed that the north-west coast of Greenland is separated from America by a very narrow strait; that at the bottom of the bay it is highly probable that they are united; that the Eskimos of America perfectly resemble the Greenlanders in their aspect, dress, and mode of living; and that a Moravian missionary, well acquainted with the language of Greenland, having visited the country of the Eskimos, found, to his astonishment, that they spoke the same language with the Greenlanders, and were in every respect the same people. The same species of animals, too, are found in the contiguous regions. The bear, the wolf, the fox, the hare, the deer, the roebuck, the elk, frequent the forests of North America, as well as those in the north of Europe.\n\nOther discoveries have proved, that if the two continents of Asia and America be separated at all, it is only by a narrow strait. From this part of the old continent, also, inhabitants may have passed into the new; and the resemblance between the Indians of America and the eastern inhabitants of Asia, would induce us to conjecture that they have a common origin. This is the opinion adopted by Dr Robertson in his History of the Discovery of America, where we find it accompanied with the following narrative.\n\n\"While those immense regions which stretched eastward from the river Ob to the sea of Kamtchatka were unknown, or imperfectly explored, the north-east extremities of our hemisphere were supposed to be so far distant from any part of the new world, that it was not easy to conceive how any communication should have been carried on between them. But the Russians, having subjected the western part of Siberia to their empire, gradually extended their knowledge of that vast country, by advancing towards the east into unknown provinces. These were discovered by hunters in their excursions after game, or by soldiers employed in levying the taxes; and the court of Moscow estimated the importance of those countries only by the small addition which they made to its revenue. At length, Peter the Great ascended the Russian throne: His enlightened comprehensive mind, intent upon every circumstance that could aggrandize his empire, or render his reign illustrious, discerned consequences of these discoveries, which had escaped the observation of his ignorant predecessors. He perceived that, in proportion as the regions of Asia extended towards the east, they must approach nearer to America; that the communication between the continents, which had long been searched for in vain, would probably be found in this quarter; and that, by opening this intercourse, some part of the wealth and commerce of the western world might be made to flow into his dominions by a new channel. Such an object suited a genius that delighted in grand schemes. Peter drew up instructions with his own hands for prosecuting this design, and gave orders for carrying it into execution.\n\n\"His successors adopted his ideas, and pursued his plan. The officers whom the Russian court employed in this service, had to struggle with so many difficulties, that their progress was extremely slow. Encouraged by some faint traditions among the people of Siberia concerning a successful voyage in the year 1648 round the north-east promontory of Asia, they attempted to follow the same course. Vessels were fitted out, with this view, at different times, from the rivers Lena and Kolyma; but in a frozen ocean, which nature seems not to have destined for navigation, they were exposed to many disasters, without being able to accomplish their purpose. No vessel fitted out by the Russian court ever doubled this formidable cape; we are indebted for what is known of those extreme regions of Asia, to the discoveries made in excursions by land. In all those provinces, an opinion prevails, that countries of great extent and fertility lie at no considerable distance from their own coasts. These the Russians imagined to be part of America; and several circumstances concurred not only in confirming them in this belief, but in persuading them that some portion of that continent could not be very remote. Trees of various kinds, unknown in those naked regions of Asia, are driven upon the coast by an easterly wind. By the same wind floating ice is brought thither in a few days; flights of birds arrive annually from the same quarter; and a tradition obtains among the inhabitants, of an intercourse formerly carried on with some countries situated to the east.\n\n\"After weighing all these particulars, and comparing the position of the countries in Asia which they had discovered, with such parts in the north-west of America as were already known; the Russian court formed a plan, which would have hardly occurred to any nation less accustomed to engage in arduous undertakings and to contend with great difficulties. Orders were issued to build two vessels at Ochotz, in the sea of Kamtchatka, to sail on a voyage of discovery. Though that dreary uncultivated region furnished nothing that could be of use in constructing them but some larch trees; though not only the iron, the cordage, the sails, and all the numerous articles requisite for their equipment, but the provisions for victualling them, were to be carried through the immense deserts of Siberia, along rivers of difficult navigation, and roads almost impassable, the mandate of the sovereign, and the perseverance of the people, at last surmounted every obstacle. Two vessels were finished; and, under the command...\ncommand of the captains Behring and Tschirikow, fail-\ned from Kamtchatka in quest of the new world, in\na quarter where it had never been approached. They\nshaped their course towards the east; and though a storm\nsoon separated the vessels, which never rejoined, and\nmany disasters befell them, the expectations from the\nvoyage were not altogether frustrated. Each of the\ncommanders discovered land, which to them appeared\nto be part of the American continent; and, according\nto their observations, it seems to be situated within a\nfew degrees of the north-west coast of California. Each\nset some of his people ashore; but in one place the in-\nhabitants fled as the Russians approached; in another,\nthey carried off those who landed, and destroyed their\nboats. The violence of the weather, and the distresses of\ntheir crews, obliged both to quit this inhospitable coast.\nIn their return they touched at several islands, which\nstretch in a chain from east to west between the country\nwhich they had discovered and the coast of Asia. They\nhad some intercourse with the natives, who seemed to\nthem to resemble the North Americans. They pre-\nsented to the Russians the calumet, or pipe of peace,\nwhich is a symbol of friendship universal among the\npeople of North America, and a usage of arbitrary\ninstitution peculiar to them.\n\nThe more recent and accurate discoveries of the il-\nlustrious navigator Cook, and his successor Clerke,\nhave brought the matter still nearer to certainty. The\nsea, from the south of Behring's straits to the crescent\nof islands between Asia and America, is very shallow. It\ndeepens from these straits (as the British seas do from\nthose of Dover) till soundings are lost in the Pacific\nocean; but that does not take place but to the south\nof the islands. Between them and the straits is an in-\ncrease from twelve to fifty-four fathom, except only off\nSt Thaddeus Nos, where there is a channel of greater\ndepth. From the volcanic disposition, it has been\njudged probable, not only that there was a separation\nof the continents at the straits of Behring, but that the\nwhole space from the islands to that small opening had\nonce been occupied by land; and that the fury of the\nwatery element, actuated by that of fire, had, in most\nremote times, subverted and overwhelmed the tract, and\nleft the islands monumental fragments.\n\nWithout adopting all the fancies of Buffon, there\ncan be no doubt, as the Abbé Clavigero observes, that\nour planet has been subject to great vicissitudes, since\nthe deluge. Ancient and modern histories confirm the\ntruth which Ovid has sung in the name of Pythagoras:\n\n*Video ego quod fuerat quondam solidissima tellus,\nFuisse fretum; vidi factas ex aëquo terras.*\n\nAt present they plough those lands over which ships\nformerly sailed, and now they fall over lands which\nwere formerly cultivated; earthquakes have swallowed\nsome lands, and subterranean fires have thrown up\nothers; the rivers have formed new soil with their\nmud; the sea retreating from the shores has lengthened\nthe land in some places, and advancing in others\nhas diminished it; it has separated some territories\nwhich were formerly united, and formed new straits\nand gulfs. We have examples of all these revolutions\nin the past century. Sicily was united to the con-\ntinent of Naples, as the island Euboea to Boe-\notia. Diodorus, Strabo, and other ancient authors, say\nthe same thing of Spain and Africa, and affirm, that by America,\na violent irruption of the ocean upon the land between\nthe mountains Abyla and Calpé, that communication\nwas broken, and the Mediterranean sea was formed.\nAmong the people of Ceylon there is a tradition that\na similar irruption of the sea separated their island from\nthe peninsula of India. The same thing is believed by\nthose of Malabar with respect to the isles of Maldivia,\nand with the Malayans with respect to Sumatra. It\nis certain, says the count de Buffon, that in Ceylon the\nearth has lost thirty or forty leagues, which the sea has\ntaken from it; on the contrary, Tongres, a place of\nthe Low Countries, has gained 30 leagues of land from\nthe sea. The northern part of Egypt owes its existence\nto inundations of the Nile. The earth which\nthis river has brought from the inland countries of Af-\nrica, and deposited in its inundations, has formed a\nfoil of more than 25 cubits in depth. In like manner,\nadds the above author, the province of the Yellow\nRiver in China, and that of Louifiana, have only been\nformed of the mud of rivers. Pliny, Seneca, Diodorus,\nand Strabo, report innumerable examples of similar re-\nvolutions, which we omit, that our dissertation may not\nbecome too prolix; as also many modern revolutions,\nwhich are related in the theory of the earth of the comte de Buffon and other authors. In South Ameri-\nca, all those who have observed with philosophic eyes\nthe peninsula of Yucatan, do not doubt that that coun-\ntry has once been the bed of the sea; and, on the con-\ntrary, in the channel of Bahama many indications show\nthe island of Cuba to have been once united to the\ncontinent of Florida. In the strait which separates\nAmerica from Asia many islands are found, which\nprobably were the mountains belonging to that tract of\nland which we suppose to have been swallowed up by\nearthquakes; which is made more probable by the\nmultitude of volcanoes which we know of in the penin-\nsula of Kamtchatka. It is imagined, however, that the\nsinking of that land, and the separation of the two\ncontinents, has been occasioned by those great and ex-\ntraordinary earthquakes mentioned in the histories of\nthe Americans, which formed an era almost as memo-\nrable as that of the deluge. The histories of the Tol-\ntecas fix such earthquakes in the year I Tepcatl; but\nas we know not to what century that belonged, we can\nform no conjecture of the time that great calamity\nhappened. If a great earthquake should overwhelm\nthe isthmus of Suez, and there should be at the same\ntime as great a scarcity of historians as there were in\nthe first ages after the deluge, it would be doubted,\nin 300 or 400 years after, whether Asia had ever been\nunited by that part to Africa; and many would firmly\ndeny it.\n\nWhether that great event, the separation of the\ncontinents, took place before or after the population of\nAmerica, is as impossible as it is of little moment for us\nto know; but we are indebted to the above-mentioned\nnavigators for settling the long dispute about the point\nfrom which it was effected. Their observations prove,\nthat in one place the distance between continent and\ncontinent is only 39 miles, not (as the author of the\nRecherches Philosophiques sur les Americains would have\nit) 800 leagues. This narrow strait has also in the\nmiddle two islands, which would greatly facilitate the\nmigration of the Asiatics into the new world, suppo-\nsing\nAmerica, fing that it took place in canoes after the convulsion which rent the two continents asunder. Besides, it may be added, that these straits are, even in the summer, often filled with ice; in winter, often frozen. In either case mankind might find an easy passage; in the last, the way was extremely ready for quadrupeds to cross and stock the continent of America. But where, from the vast expanse of the north-eastern world, to fix on the first tribes who contributed to people the new continent, now inhabited almost from end to end, is a matter that baffles human reason. The learned may make bold and ingenious conjectures, but plain good sense cannot always accede to them.\n\nAs mankind increased in numbers, they naturally protruded one another forward. Wars might be another cause of migrations. There appears no reason why the Asiatic north might not be an officina virorum, as well as the European. The overteeming country, to the east of the Riphean mountains, must find it necessary to discharge its inhabitants: the first great wave of people was forced forward by the next to it, more tumid and more powerful than itself; successive and new impulses continually arriving, short rest was given to that which spread over a more eastern tract; disturbed again and again, it covered fresh regions; at length, reaching the farthest limits of the old world, found a new one, with ample space to occupy unmeasured for ages; till Columbus curled them by a discovery, which brought again new fins and new deaths to both worlds.\n\n\"The inhabitants of the new world (Mr Pennant observes) do not consist of the offspring of a single nation; different peoples, at several periods, arrived there; and it is impossible to say, that any one is now to be found on the original spot of its colonization. It is impossible, with the lights which we have so recently received, to admit that America could receive its inhabitants (at least the bulk of them) from any other place than eastern Asia. A few proofs may be added, taken from customs or dress common to the inhabitants of both worlds; some have been long extinct in the old, others remain in both in full force.\n\n\"The custom of scalping was a barbarism in use with the Scythians, who carried about them at all times this savage mark of triumph: they cut a circle round the neck, and stripped off the skin, as they would that of an ox. A little image found among the Calmucks, of a Tartarian deity, mounted on a horse, and fitting on a human skin, with scalps pendent from the breast, fully illustrates the custom of their Scythian progenitors, as described by the Greek historian. This usage, as the Europeans know by horrid experience, is continued to this day in America. The ferocity of the Scythians to their prisoners extended to the remotest part of Asia. The Kamtchatkans, even at the time of their discovery by the Russians, put their prisoners to death by the most lingering and excruciating inventions; a practice in full force to this very day among the aboriginal Americans. A race of the Scythians were styled Anthropophagi, from their feeding on human flesh. The people of Nootka Sound still make a repast on their fellow-creatures: but what is more wonderful, the savage allies of the British army have been known to throw the mangled limbs of the French prisoners into the horrible caldron, and devour them with the same relish as those of a quadruped.\n\n\"The Scythians were said, for a certain time, annually to transform themselves into wolves, and again to resume the human shape. The newly-discovered Americans about Nootka Sound at this time disguise themselves in dresses made of the skins of wolves and other wild beasts, and wear even the heads fitted to their own. These habits they use in the chase, to circumvent the animals of the field. But would not ignorance or superstition ascribe to a supernatural metamorphosis these temporary expedients to deceive the brute creation?\n\n\"In their marches, the Kamtchatkans never went abreast, but followed one another in the same track, and dresses. The same custom is exactly observed by the Americans.\n\n\"The Tungus, the most numerous nation resident in Siberia, prick their faces with small punctures, with cans, a needle, in various spaces; then rub into them charcoal, so that the marks become indelible. This custom is still observed in several parts of America. The Indians on the back of Hudson's bay, to this day, perform the operation exactly in the same manner, and puncture the skin into various figures; as the natives of New Zealand do at present, and as the ancient Britons did with the herb glattum, or woad; and the Virginians, on the first discovery of that country by the English.\n\n\"The Tungus use canoes made of birch bark, defended over ribs of wood, and nicely sewed together. The Canadians, and many other American nations, use no other sort of boats. The paddles of the Tungus are broad at each end; those of the people near Cook's river, and of Oonalaftha, are of the same form.\n\n\"In burying of the dead, many of the American nations place the corpse at full length, after preparing it according to their customs; others place it in a fitting posture, and lay by it the most valuable clothing, wampum, and other matters. The Tartars did the same; and both people agree in covering the whole with earth, so as to form a tumulus, barrow, or cairnhead.\n\n\"Some of the American nations hang their dead in trees. Certain of the Tungus observe a similar custom.\n\n\"We can draw some analogy from dress: convenience in that article must have been consulted on both continents, and originally the materials must have been the same, the skins of birds and beasts. It is singular, that the conic bonnet of the Chinese should be found among the people of Nootka. I cannot give into the notion, that the Chinese contributed to the population of the new world; but we can readily admit, that a shipwreck might furnish those Americans with a pattern for that part of the dress.\n\n\"In respect to the features and form of the human body, almost every tribe found along the western coast resembles has some similarity to the Tartar nations, and still retain the little eyes, small noses, high cheeks, and broad faces. They vary in size, from the lusy Calmucks to the little Nogaians. The internal Americans, such as the Five Indian nations, who are tall of body,\nAmerica, body, robust of make, and of oblong faces, are derived from a variety among the Tartars themselves. The fine race of Tschutski seem to be the stock from which those Americans are derived. The Tschutski, again, from that fine race of Tartars the Kabardiniski, or inhabitants of Kabarda.\n\n\"But about Prince William's found begins a race chiefly distinguished by their drels, their canoes, and their instruments of the chase, from the tribes to the south of them. Here commences the Eiquémaux people, or the race known by that name in the high latitudes of the eastern side of the continent. They may be divided into two varieties. At this place they are of the largest size. As they advance northward, they decrease in height, till they dwindle into the dwarfish tribes which occupy some of the coasts of the Icy sea, and the maritime parts of Hudson's bay, of Greenland, and Terra de Labrador. The famous Japanese map places some islands seemingly within the straits of Behring, on which is bestowed the title of Na Sue, or the Kingdom of the Dwarfs. Does not this in some manner authenticate the chart, and give us reason to suppose that America was not unknown to the Japanese; and that they had (as is mentioned by Kämpfer and Charlevoix) made voyages of discovery, and according to the last, actually wintered on the continent? That they might have met with the Eiquémaux is very probable: whom, in comparison of themselves, they might justly distinguish by the name of dwarfs. The reason of their low stature is very obvious: they dwell in a most severe climate, amidst penury of food; the former in one much more favourable, abundant in provisions; circumstances that tend to prevent the degeneracy of the human frame. At the island of Oonalacha, a dialect of the Eiquémaux is in use, which was continued along the whole coast from thence northward.\"\n\nThe continent which stocked America with the human race poured in the brute creation through the same passage. Very few quadrupeds continued in the peninsula of Kamtchatka; Mr Pennant enumerates only 25 which are inhabitants of land: all the rest perished in their migration, and fixed their residence in the new world. Seventeen of the Kamtchatkan quadrupeds are found in America: others are common only to Siberia or Tartary, having, for unknown causes, entirely evacuated Kamtchatka, and divided themselves between America and the parts of Asia above cited. Multitudes again have deserted the old world even to an individual, and fixed their seats at distances most remote from the spot from which they took their departure; from Mount Ararat, the resting-place of the ark, in a central part of the old world, and excellently adapted for the dispersion of the animal creation to all its parts. We need not be startled (says Mr Pennant) at the vast journeys many of the quadrupeds took to arrive at their present seats. Might not numbers of species have found a convenient abode in the vast Alps of Asia, instead of wandering to the Cordilleras of Chili? or might not others have been contented with the boundless plains of Tartary, instead of travelling thousands of miles to the extensive flats of Pampas?—To endeavour to elucidate common difficulties is certainly a trouble worthy of the philosopher and of the divine; not to attempt it would be a criminal indolence, a neglect to Vindicate the ways of God to man.\n\nBut there are multitudes of points beyond the human ability to explain, and yet are truths undeniable: the facts are indisputable, notwithstanding the causes are concealed. In such cases, faith must be called in to our relief. It would certainly be the height of folly to deny to that Being who broke open the fountains of the great deep to effect the deluge—and afterwards, to compel the dispersion of mankind to people the globe, directed the confusion of languages—powers inferior in their nature to these. After these wondrous proofs of Omnipotence, it will be absurd to deny the possibility of infusing instinct into the brute creation. Deus est anima brutorum: \"God himself is the soul of brutes.\" His pleasure must have determined their will, and directed several species, and even whole genera, by impulse irresistible, to move by slow progression to their defined regions. But for that, the llama and the paco might still have inhabited the heights of Armenia and some more neighbouring Alps, instead of labouring to gain the distant Peruvian Andes; the whole genus of armadillos, flow of foot, would never have quitted the torrid zone of the old world for that of the new; and the whole tribe of monkeys would have gambolled together in the forests of India, instead of dividing their residence between the shades of Indoflan and the deep forests of the Brazils. Lions and tigers might have infested the hot parts of the new world, as the first do the deserts of Africa, and the last the provinces of Asia; or the pantherine animals of South America might have remained additional scourges with the savage heats of those ancient continents. The old world would have been overstocked with animals; the new remained an unanimated waste; or both have contained an equal portion of every heat of the earth. Let it not be objected, that animals bred in a southern climate, after the descent of their parents from the ark, would be unable to bear the frost and snow of the rigorous north, before they reached South America, the place of their final destination. It must be considered, that the migration must have been the work of ages; that in the course of their progress each generation grew hardened to the climate it had reached; and that after their arrival in America, they would again be gradually accustomed to warmer and warmer climates, in their removal from north to south, as they had been in the reverse, or from south to north. Part of the tigers still inhabit the eternal snows of Ararat; and multitudes of the very same species live, but with exalted rage, beneath the line, in the burning foil of Borneo or Sumatra; but neither lions nor tigers ever migrated into the new world. A few of the first are found in India and Persia, but they are found in numbers only in Africa. The tiger extends as far north as Western Tartary, in lat. 40° 50°, but never has reached Africa.\"\n\nIn fine, the conjectures of the learned respecting the vicinity of the old and new worlds, are now, by the discoveries of our great navigators, left in conviction; and in the place of imaginary hypotheses, the real place of migration is incontrovertibly pointed out.\nAmerica. Some (from a passage in Plato) have extended over the Atlantic, from the straits of Gibraltar to the coast of North and South America, an island equal in size to the continents of Asia and Africa; over which had passed, as over a bridge, from the latter, men and animals, woolly-headed negroes, and lions and tigers, none of which ever existed in the new world. A mighty sea arose, and in one day and night engulfed this stupendous tract, and with it every being which had not completed its migration into America. The whole negro race, and almost every quadruped, now inhabitants of Africa, perished in this critical day. Five only are to be found at present in America; and of these only one, the bear, in South America: Not a single custom, common to the natives of Africa and America, evince a common origin. Of the quadrupeds, the bear, stag, wolf, fox, and weasel, are the only animals which we can pronounce with certainty to be found on each continent. The stag, fox, and weasel, have made also no farther progress in Africa than the north; but on the same continent the wolf is spread over every part, yet is unknown in South America, as are the fox and weasel. In Africa and South America the bear is very local, being met with only in the north of the first, and on the Andes in the last. Some cause unknown arrested its progress in Africa, and impelled the migration of a few into the Chilian Alps, and induced them to leave unoccupied the vast tract from North America to the lofty Cordilleras.\n\nAllusions have often been made to some remains, on the continent of America, of a more polished and cultivated people, when compared with the tribes which possessed it on its first discovery by Europeans. Mr Barton, in his Observations on some parts of Natural History, Part I., has collected the scattered hints of Kalm, Carver, and some others, and has added a plan of a regular work, which has been discovered on the banks of the Muckingum, near its junction with the Ohio. These remains are principally stone walls, large mounds of earth, and a combination of these mounds with the walls, suspected to have been fortifications. In some places the ditches and the forts are said to have been plainly seen; in others, furrows, as if the land had been ploughed.\n\nThe mounds of earth are of two kinds: they are artificial tumuli, designed as repositories for the dead; or they are of a greater size, for the purpose of defending the adjacent country; and with this view they are artificially constructed, or advantage is taken of the natural eminences, to raise them into a fortification.\n\nThe remains near the banks of the Muckingum, are situated about one mile above the junction of that river with the Ohio, and 162 miles below Fort Pitt. They consist of a number of walls and other elevations, of ditches, &c., altogether occupying a space of ground about 300 perches in length, and from about 150 to 25 or 30 in breadth. The town, as it has been called, is a large level, encompassed by walls, nearly in the form of a square, the sides of which are from 96 to 86 perches in length. These walls are, in general, about 10 feet in height above the level on which they stand, and about 20 feet in diameter at the base, but at the top they are much narrower; they are at present overgrown with vegetables of different kinds, and, among others, with trees of several feet diameter. The chasms, or openings in the walls, were probably intended for gateways: they are three in number at each side, besides the smaller openings in the angles. Within the walls there are three elevations, each about six feet in height, with regular ascents to them: these elevations considerably resemble some of the eminences already mentioned, which have been discovered near the river Mississippi. This author's opinion is, That the Toltecas, or some other Mexican nation, were the people to whom the mounts and fortifications, which he has described, owe their existence; and that those people were probably the descendants of the Danes. The former part of this conjecture is thought probable, from the similarity of the Mexican mounts and fortifications described by the Abbé Clavigero, and other authors, to those described by our author; and from the tradition of the Mexicans, that they came from the north-west; for, if we can rely on the testimony of late travellers, fortifications similar to those mentioned by Mr Barton, have been discovered as far to the north as Lake Pepin; and we find them, as we approach to the south, even as low as the coasts of Florida. The second part of our author's conjecture appears not so well supported.\n\nIt is believed by many, that the ancients had some imperfect notions of a new world; and several ancient authors are quoted in confirmation of this. In a book ascribed to the philosopher Aristotle, we are told that formerly the Carthaginians discovered an island far beyond the pillars of Hercules, large, fertile, and finely watered with navigable rivers, but uninhabited. This island was distant a few days sailing from the continent; its beauty induced the discoverers to settle there; but the policy of Carthage disfavored the colony, and laid strict prohibition on all the subjects of the state not to attempt any future establishment. This account is also confirmed by an historian of no mean credit, who relates, that the Tyrians would have settled a colony on the new discovered island, but were opposed by the Carthaginians for state reasons. The following passage has also been quoted from Seneca's Medea, in confirmation of this notion:\n\n---\n\nVenient annis\nSecula feris, quibus oceanus\nVincula rerum laxet, et ingens\nPateat tellus, Typhosque novos\nDelegat orbes; nec fit terris\nUltima Thule.\n\nAct. III. ver. 375.\n\n---\n\nOther authors are also quoted in support of this belief. But however this may be, nobody ever believed the existence of this continent so firmly as to go in quest of it; at least, there are no accounts well supported that America received any part of its first inhabitants from Europe prior to the 15th century. The Welsh Pretensions fondly imagine that our country contributed, in 1170, of the people to the new world, by the adventure of Madoc, the discovery of Owen Gwynedd, who, on the death of his father, failed there, and colonized part of the country, America in All that is advanced in proof is, a quotation from one of our poets, which proves no more than that he had distinguished himself by sea and land. It is pretended that he made two voyages: that failing well, he left Ireland.\nAmerica. Ireland so far to the north, that he came to a land unknown, where he saw many strange things; that he returned home, and, making a report of the fruitfulness of the new-discovered country, prevailed on numbers of the Welsh of each sex to accompany him on a second voyage, from which he never returned. The favourers of this opinion assert, that several Welsh words, such as *gwrando*, \"to hearken or listen;\" the tile of *Crafo*, or \"welcome;\" *Cape Breton*, from the name of our own island; *gwynndwyr*, or \"the white water;\" and *penguin*, or \"the bird with a white head,\" are to be found in the American language. But likeness of found in a few words will not be deemed sufficient to establish the fact; especially if the meaning has been evidently perverted: for example, the whole penguin tribe have unfortunately not only black heads, but are not inhabitants of the northern hemisphere; the name was also bestowed on them by the Dutch, *a pinguedine*, from their excessive fatness; but the inventor of this, thinking to do honour to our country, inconsiderately caught at a word of European origin, and unheard of in the new world. It may be added, that the Welsh were never a naval people; that the age in which Madoc lived was peculiarly ignorant in navigation; and the most which they could have attempted must have been a mere coaling voyage.\n\nThe Norwegians put in for a share of the glory, on grounds rather better than the Welsh. By their settlements in Iceland and in Greenland, they had arrived within so small a distance of the new world, that there is at least a possibility of its having been touched at by a people so versed in maritime affairs, and so adventurous, as the ancient Normans were. The proofs are much more numerous than those produced by the British historians; for the discovery is mentioned in several of the Icelandic manuscripts. The period was about the year 1002, when it was visited by one Bjorn; and the discovery pursued to greater effect by Lief, the son of Eric, the discoverer of Greenland. It does not appear that they reached farther than Labrador; on which coast they met with Equimaux, on whom they bestowed the name of Skraelingues, or dwarfish people, from their small stature. They were armed with bows and arrows, and had leathern canoes, such as they have at present. All this is probable; nor should the tale of the German, called Turkil, one of the crew, invalidate the account. He was one day missing; but soon returned, leaping and fingering with all the extravagant marks of joy a *bon vivant* could show, on discovering the inebriating fruit of his country, the grape: Torquatus even says, that he returned in a state of intoxication. To convince his commander, he brought several bunches, who from that circumstance named the country Vinland. It is not to be denied that North America produces the true vine; but it is found in far lower latitudes than our adventurers could reach in the time employed in their voyage, which was comprehended in a very small space. There appears no reason to doubt of the discovery; but as the land was never colonized, nor any advantages made of it, it may be fairly conjectured, that they reached no farther than the barren country of Labrador. In short, it is from a much later period that we must date the real discovery of America.\n\nTowards the close of the 15th century, Venice and Genoa being rivals in commerce, in which the former had greatly the superiority, Christopher Columbus, a native of Genoa, whose knowledge of the true figure of the earth, however attained, was much superior to the general notions of the age in which he lived, conceived a project of sailing to the East Indies by directing his Columbus course westward. The design was founded upon a mistake of the geographers of those days, who placed the eastern parts of Asia immensely too far to the eastward; so that had they been in the right, the shortest way would have been to sail directly westward. He applied first to his own countrymen; but being rejected by them, he applied to France, where he was laughed at and ridiculed. He next applied to Henry VII. of England; but meeting with a disappointment there he made an application to Portugal, where he met with the same mortifying reception. Spain was his next resource; where, after eight years attendance, he obtained, in 1492, a fleet of three ships. The largest, a ship of no considerable burden, was commanded by Columbus as admiral, who gave it the name of Santa Maria, out of respect for the blest Virgin, whom he honoured with singular devotion. Of the second, called the Pinta, Martin Pinzon was captain, and his brother Francis pilot. The third, named the Nigra, was under the command of Vincent Yanez Pinzon. These two were light vessels, hardly superior in burden or force to large boats. This squadron, if it merits that name, was victualled for 12 months, and had on board 90 men, mostly sailors, together with a few adventurers who followed the fortune of Columbus, and some gentlemen of Isabella's court, whom she appointed to accompany him. Though the expense of the undertaking was one of the circumstances which chiefly alarmed the court of Spain, and retarded so long the negotiation with Columbus, the sum employed in fitting out this squadron did not exceed 4000l. But as Columbus was deeply impressed with sentiments of religion, he would not set out upon an expedition so arduous, and of which one great object was to extend the knowledge of the Christian faith, without imploring publicly the guidance and protection of Heaven. With this view, he, together with all the persons under his command, marched in solemn procession to the monastery of Rabida. After confessing their sins, and obtaining absolution, they received the holy sacrament from the hands of the guardian, who joined his prayers to theirs for the success of an enterprise which he had so zealously patronised.\n\nNext morning, being Friday the third day of August, in the year 1492, Columbus set sail a little before sunrise, in presence of a vast crowd of spectators, who sent up their supplications to Heaven for the prosperous issue of the voyage, which they wished rather than expected. Columbus steered directly for the Canary islands, and arrived there without any occurrence that would have deserved notice on any other occasion: but in a voyage of such expectation and importance, every circumstance was the object of attention. The rudder of the Pinta broke loose the day after she left the harbour, and that accident alarmed the crew, no less superstitious than unskillful, as a certain omen of the unfortunate destiny of the expedition. Even in the short run to the Canaries, the ships were found to be so crazy and ill appointed, as to be very improper for\nfor a navigation which was expected to be both long and dangerous. Columbus refitted them, however, to the best of his power; and having supplied himself with fresh provisions, he took his departure from Gomera, one of the most westerly of the Canary islands, on the fifth day of September.\n\nHere the voyage of discovery may properly be said to begin; for Columbus, holding his course due west, left immediately the usual track of navigation, and stretched into unfrequented and unknown seas. The first day, as it was very calm, he made but little way; but on the second, he lost sight of the Canaries; and many of the sailors, dejected already and dismayed, when they contemplated the boldness of the undertaking, began to beat their breasts, and to shed tears, as if they were never more to behold land. Columbus comforted them with assurances of success, and the prospect of vast wealth, in those opulent regions whither he was conducting them. He regulated everything by his sole authority; he superintended the execution of every order; and allowing himself only a few hours for sleep, he was at all other times upon deck. As his course lay through seas which had not formerly been visited, the sounding line or instruments for observation, were continually in his hands. After the example of the Portuguese discoverers, he attended to the motion of tides and currents, watched the flight of birds, the appearance of fishes, of sea-weeds, and of every thing that floated on the waves, and entered every occurrence with a minute exactness, in the journal which he kept. As the length of the voyage could not fail of alarming sailors habituated only to short excursions, Columbus endeavoured to conceal from them the real progress which they made. With this view, though they run 18 leagues on the second day after they left Gomera, he gave out that they had advanced only 15; and he uniformly employed the same artifice of reckoning short during the whole voyage. By the 14th of September, the fleet was above 200 leagues to the west of the Canary isles, at a greater distance from land than any Spaniard had been before that time. There they were struck with an appearance no less astonishing than new. They observed that the magnetic needle, in their compasses, did not point exactly to the polar star, but varied towards the west; and as they proceeded this variation increased. This appearance, which is now familiar, though it still remains one of the mysteries of nature, into the cause of which the sagacity of man hath not been able to penetrate, filled the companions of Columbus with terror. They were now in a boundless unknown ocean, far from the usual course of navigation; nature itself seemed to be altered, and the only guide which they had left was about to fail them. Columbus, with no less quickness than ingenuity, invented a reason for this appearance, which, though it did not satisfy himself, seemed so plausible to them, that it dispelled their fears, or silenced their murmurs.\n\nHe still continued to steer due west, nearly in the same latitude with the Canary islands. In this course he came within the sphere of the trade wind, which blows invariably from east to west between the tropics, and a few degrees beyond them. He advanced before this steady gale with such uniform rapidity, that it was seldom necessary to shift a sail. When about 400 leagues to the west of the Canaries, he found the sea so covered with weeds, that it resembled a meadow of vast extent; and in some places they were so thick as to retard the motion of the vessels. This strange appearance occasioned new alarm and disquiet. The sailors imagined that they were now arrived at the utmost boundary of the navigable ocean; that these floating weeds would obstruct their farther progress, and concealed dangerous rocks, or some large tract of land, which had sunk, they knew not how, in that place. Columbus endeavoured to persuade them, that what had alarmed, ought rather to have encouraged them, and was to be considered as a sign of approaching land. At the same time, a brisk gale arose, and carried them forward. Several birds were seen hovering about the ship, and directed their flight towards the west. The responding crew resumed some degree of spirit, and began to entertain fresh hopes.\n\nUpon the first of October, they were, according to the admiral's reckoning, 770 leagues to the west of the Canaries; but lest his men should be intimidated by the prodigious length of the navigation, he gave out that they had proceeded only 584 leagues; and, fortunately for Columbus, neither his own pilot, nor those of the other ships, had skill sufficient to correct this error, and discover the deceit. They had now been above three weeks at sea; they had proceeded far beyond what former navigators had attempted or deemed possible: all their prognostics of discovery, drawn from the flight of birds and other circumstances, had proved fallacious; the appearances of land, with which their own credulity or the artifice of their commander had from time to time flattered and amused them, had been altogether illusive, and their prospect of success seemed now to be as distant as ever. These reflections occurred often to men, who had no other object or occupation, than to reason and discourse concerning the intention and circumstances of their expedition. They made impression at first upon the ignorant and timid, and extending by degrees to such as were better informed or more resolute, the contagion spread at length from ship to ship. From secret whispers or murmurings they proceeded to open cabals and public complaints. They taxed their sovereign with inconsiderate credulity, in paying such regard to the vain promises and rash conjectures of an indigent foreigner, as to hazard the lives of so many of her own subjects, in prosecuting a chimerical scheme. They affirmed that they had fully performed their duty, by venturing so far in an unknown and hopeless course, and could incur no blame, for refusing to follow, any longer, a desperate adventurer to certain destruction. They contended, that it was necessary to think of returning to Spain, while their crazy vessels were still in a condition to keep the sea, but expressed their fears that the attempt would prove vain, as the wind which had hitherto been so favourable to their course, must render it impossible to sail in the opposite direction. All agreed that Columbus should be compelled by force to adopt a measure on which their common safety depended. Some of the more audacious proposed, as the most expeditious and certain method for getting rid at once of his remonstrances, to throw him into the sea; being persuaded that,\nthat, upon their return to Spain, the death of an unsuccessful projector would excite little concern, and be inquired into with no curiosity.\n\nColumbus was fully sensible of his perilous situation. He had observed, with great uneasiness, the fatal operation of ignorance and fear in producing disaffection among his crew; and saw that it was now ready to burst out into open mutiny. He retained, however, perfect presence of mind. He affected to seem ignorant of their machinations. Notwithstanding the agitation and solicitude of his own mind, he appeared with a cheerful countenance; like a man satisfied with the progress which he had made, and confident of success. Sometimes he employed all the arts of influence to soothe his men. Sometimes he endeavoured to work upon their ambition or avarice, by magnificent descriptions of the fame and wealth which they were about to acquire. On other occasions, he assumed a tone of authority, and threatened them with vengeance from their sovereign, if, by their dastardly behaviour, they should defeat this noble effort to promote the glory of God, and to exalt the Spanish name above that of every other nation. Even with sedulous sailors, the words of a man whom they had been accustomed to reverence were weighty and persuasive; and not only restrained them from those violent excesses which they meditated, but prevailed with them to accompany their admiral for some time longer.\n\nAs they proceeded, the indications of approaching land seemed to be more certain, and excited hope in proportion. The birds began to appear in flocks, making towards the south-west. Columbus, in imitation of the Portuguese navigators, who had been guided in several of their discoveries by the motion of birds, altered his course from due west towards that quarter whither they pointed their flight. But after holding on for several days in this new direction without any better success than formerly, having seen no object during 30 days but the sea and the sky, the hopes of his companions subsided faster than they had risen; their fears revived with additional force; impatience, rage, and despair, appeared in every countenance. All sense of subordination was lost. The officers, who had hitherto concurred with Columbus in opinion, and supported his authority, now took part with the private men: they assembled tumultuously on the deck, expostulated with their commander, mingled threats with their expostulations, and required him instantly to tack about and return to Europe. Columbus perceived that it would be of no avail to have recourse to any of his former arts, which having been tried so often had lost their effect; and that it was impossible to rekindle any zeal for the success of the expedition among men whose breasts fear had extinguished every generous sentiment. He saw that it was no less vain to think of employing either gentle or severe measures, to quell a mutiny so general and so violent. It was necessary, on all these accounts, to soothe passions which he could no longer command, and to give way to a torrent too impetuous to be checked. He promised solemnly to his men that he would comply with their request, provided they would accompany him, and obey his commands for three days longer; and if, during that time, land were not discovered, he would then abandon the enterprise, and direct his course towards Spain.\n\nEnraged as the sailors were, and impatient to turn their faces again towards their native country, this proposition did not appear to them unreasonable. Nor did Columbus hazard much in confining himself to a term so short. The preludes of discovering land were now so numerous and promising, that he deemed them infallible. For some days the sounding line reached the bottom, and the soil which it brought up indicated land to be at no great distance. The flocks of birds increased; and were composed not only of sea fowl, but of such land birds as could not be supposed to fly far from the shore. The crew of the Pinta observed a cane floating which seemed to be newly cut, and likewise a piece of timber artificially carved. The sailors aboard the Nigra took up the branch of a tree with red berries perfectly fresh. The clouds around the setting sun assumed a new appearance; the air was more mild and warm; and, during night, the wind became unequal and variable. From all these symptoms, Columbus was so confident of being near land, that on the evening of the 11th of October, after public prayers for success, he ordered the sails to be furled, and the ships to lie by, keeping strict watch, lest they should be driven ashore in the night. During this interval of suspense and expectation, no man shut his eyes, all kept upon deck, gazing intently towards that quarter, where they expected to discover the land which had been so long the object of their wishes.\n\nAbout two hours before midnight, Columbus standing on the forecastle, observed a light at a distance, on the coast, and privately pointed it out to Pedro Gutierrez, a page of the queen's wardrobe. Gutierrez perceived it; and calling to Salcedo comptroller of the fleet, all three saw it in motion, as if it were carried from place to place. A little after midnight the joyful sound of Land! land! was heard from the Pinta, which kept always ahead of the other ships. But having been so often deceived by fallacious appearances, every man was now become slow of belief; and waited, in all the anguish of uncertainty and impatience, for the return of day. As soon as morning dawned, all doubts and fears were dispelled. From every ship an island was seen about two leagues to the north, whose flat and verdant fields, well flored with wood, and watered with many rivulets, presented the aspect of a delightful country. The crew of the Pinta instantly began the Te Deum, as a hymn of thanksgiving to God; and were joined by those of the other ships, with tears of joy and transports of congratulation. This office of gratitude to heaven was followed by an act of justice to their commander. They threw themselves at the feet of Columbus, with feelings of self-condemnation mingled with reverence. They implored him to pardon their ignorance, incredulity, and insolence, which had created him so much unnecessary disquiet, and had so often obstructed the prosecution of his well-concerted plan; and praising, in the warmth of their admiration, from one extreme to another, they now pronounced the man whom they had so lately reviled and threatened, to be a person inspired by Heaven with sagacity and fortitude more than human, in order to accomplish a design so far beyond the ideas and conception of all former ages.\n\nAs soon as the sun arose, all their boats were manned and armed. They rowed towards the island with their\ntheir colours displayed, with warlike music, and other martial pomp. As they approached the coast, they saw it covered with a multitude of people, whom the novelty of the spectacle had drawn together, whose attitudes and gestures expressed wonder and astonishment at the strange objects which presented themselves to their view. Columbus was the first European who set foot in the new world which he had discovered. He landed in a rich drefs, and with a naked sword in his hand. His men followed; and, kneeling down, they all kissed the ground which they had so long desired to see. They next erected a crucifix; and, prostrating themselves before it, returned thanks to God for conducting their voyage to such a happy issue.\n\nThe above was one of the Bahama islands; to which he gave the name of San Salvador, and took possession of it in the name of their Catholic majesties. In this first voyage he discovered several other of the Lucayo or Bahama islands, with those of Cuba and Hispaniola. The natives considered the Spaniards as divinities, and the discharge of the artillery as their thunder: they fell prostrate at the sound. The women, however, offered their favours, and courted the embraces of their new guests as men. Their husbands were not jealous of them; and in the arms of these wantons the companions of Columbus are said to have caught that malady which directs its poison to the springs of life. In a second voyage many new islands were discovered. In a third, he attained the great object of his ambition, by discovering the continent of America, near the mouth of the river Orinoco, on the first day of August 1498. His success produced a crowd of adventurers from all nations; but the year before this, the northern continent had been discovered by Sebastian Cabot in the service of Henry VII. of England.\n\nNotwithstanding the many settlements of the Europeans in this continent, great part of America remains still unknown. The northern continent contains the British colonies of Hudson's Bay, Canada, Nova Scotia, New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida. It contains also the Spanish territories of Louisiana, New Mexico, California, and Mexico. Besides these, there are immense regions to the west and north, the boundaries of which have never yet been discovered. In such as are in any degree known, dwell the Equinoxes, the Algonquins, the Hurons, the Iroquois, the Cherokees, the Chickasaws, and many other tribes of Indians. In the southern continent lie the Spanish provinces of Terra Firme, Guiana, Peru, Paraguay, and Chili; together with that of Brazil, belonging to the Portuguese; and the country of Surinam, belonging to the Dutch. Vast tracts, however, in the inland parts, are unknown, being comprehended under the general name of Amazonia. A large district also, said to be the residence of a gigantic race of men, lies on the east side of the continent, between the straits of Magellan and the province of Paraguay. See Patagonia.\n\nThis vast country produces most of the metals, minerals, plants, fruits, trees, and wood, to be met with in the other parts of the world, and many of them in greater quantities and high perfection. The gold and silver of America have supplied Europe with such immense quantities of those valuable metals, that they are become vastly more common; so that the gold and silver of Europe now bear little proportion to the high price set upon them before the discovery of America.\n\nIt also produces diamonds, pearls, emeralds, amethysts, and other valuable stones, which, by being brought into Europe, have contributed likewise to lower their value. To these, which are chiefly the production of Spanish America, may be added a great number of other commodities, which, though of less price, are of much greater use; and many of them make the ornament and wealth of the British empire in this part of the world. Of these are the plentiful supplies of cochineal, indigo, anatto, logwood, brazil, fustic, pimento, lignum vitae, rice, ginger, cocoa, or the chocolate nut, sugar, cotton, tobacco, banillas, red-wood, the balsams of Tolu, Peru, and Chili, that valuable article in medicine the Jesuit's bark, meehoacan, sassafras, farfaparilla, caffia, tamarinds, hides, furs, ambergris, and a great variety of woods, roots, and plants; to which, before the discovery of America, we were either entire strangers, or forced to buy at an extravagant rate from Asia and Africa, through the hands of the Venetians and Genoese, who then engrossed the trade of the eastern world.\n\nOn this continent there grows also a variety of excellent fruits; as pine-apples, pomegranates, citrons, lemons, oranges, malications, cherries, pears, apples, figs, grapes; great numbers of culinary, medicinal, and other herbs, roots, and plants; with many exotic productions, which are nourished in as great perfection as in their native soil.\n\nAlthough the Indians still live in the quiet possession of many large tracts, America, so far as known, is entangled chiefly claimed, and divided into colonies, by three sorts of American nations, the Spaniards, English, and Portugueze. The Spaniards, as they first discovered it, have the largest and richest portion, extending from New Mexico and Louisiana in North America, to the straits of Magellan in the South sea, excepting the large province of Brazil, which belongs to Portugal; for though the French and Dutch have some forts in Surinam and Guiana, they scarcely deserve to be considered as proprietors of any part of the southern continent.\n\nNext to Spain, the most considerable proprietor of America was Great Britain, who derived her claim to North America from the first discovery of that continent by Sebastian Cabot in the name of Henry VII. anno 1497, about six years after the discovery of South America by Columbus in the name of the king of Spain. This country was in general called Newfoundland; a name which is now appropriated solely to an island upon its coast. It was a long time before we made an attempt to settle in this country. Sir Walter Raleigh, an uncommon genius and a brave commander, first showed the way, by planting a colony in the southern part, which he called Virginia, in honour of his mistress Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThe French indeed, from this period until the conclusion of the war before last, laid claim to, and actually possessed, Canada and Louisiana; comprehending all that extensive inland country reaching from Hudson's Bay on the north, to Mexico and the gulf of the same name on the south. But in that war, to which...\nwhich their perfidy and ambition gave rise, they were not only driven from Canada and its dependencies, but obliged to relinquish all that part of Louisiana lying on the east side of the Mississippi, as related under the History of Britain. And thus our colonies were preserved, secured, and extended so far, as to render it difficult to ascertain the precise bounds of our empire in North America. To the northward we might have extended our claims quite to the pole itself, nor did any nation seem inclined to dispute the property of this northernmost country with us. From that extremity we had a territory extending southward to Cape Florida in the gulf of Mexico, N. Lat. 24°, and consequently near 4000 miles long in a direct line. And to the westward our boundaries reached to nations unknown even to the Indians of Canada.\n\nOf the revolution that has since taken place, by which a great part of those territories have been separated from the British empire, the history follows in the next article.\n\nAmerica, United States of. Of the rise and establishment of this republic, which has given a new face to the western world, a succinct and impartial narrative shall in this article be attempted; in which, however, we cannot hope entirely to avoid errors, as they are perhaps unavoidable. The accounts from which the historian must derive his information are not yet cleared from the mistakes of prejudice and the fabrications of party; when they differ, their comparative authenticity is with difficulty ascertained; and they want above all that softening which they can receive from time alone.\n\nThe beginning of every political establishment is contemptible. Some few banditti taking refuge among the marshes on the banks of the Tiber, laid the foundation of the Roman empire. The turbulence of some North Americans, and the blunders of some British statesmen, gave birth to this new republic, which at a future period, it has been fancied, may perhaps surpass even the splendour of Rome.\n\nThe state of the British colonies at the conclusion of the war in 1763, was such as attracted the attention of all the politicians in Europe. Their flourishing condition at that period was remarkable and striking: their trade had prospered in the midst of all the difficulties and distresses of a war in which they were so nearly and so immediately concerned. Their population continued on the increase, notwithstanding the ravages and depredations that had been so fiercely carried on by the French, and the native Indians in their alliance. They abounded with spirited and active individuals of all denominations. They were flushed with the uncommon prosperity that had attended them in their commercial affairs and military transactions. Hence they were ready for all kind of undertakings, and saw no limits to their hopes and expectations.\n\nAs they entertained the highest opinion of their value and importance, and of the immense benefit that Britain derived from its connexion with them, their notions were adequately high in their own favour. They deemed themselves, not without reason, entitled to every kindness and indulgence which the mother country could bestow.\n\nAlthough their pretensions did not amount to a perfect equality of advantages and privileges in matters of commerce, yet in those of government they thought themselves fully competent to the task of conducting their domestic concerns with little or no interference from abroad. Though willing to admit the supremacy of Great Britain, they viewed it with a suspicious eye, and with a marked desire and intent speedily to give it limitations.\n\nTheir improvements in all the necessary and useful arts did honour to their industry and ingenuity. Though they did not live in the luxury of Europe, they had all the solid and substantial enjoyments of life, and were not unacquainted with many of its elegancies and refinements.\n\nA circumstance much to their praise is, that notwithstanding their peculiar addiction to those occupations of which lucre is the sole object, they were duly attentive to cultivate the field of learning; and they have ever since their first foundation been particularly careful to provide for the education of the rising progeny.\n\nTheir vast augmentation of internal trade and external commerce, was not merely owing to their position and facility of communication with other parts; it arose also from their natural turn and temper, full of schemes and projects; ever aiming at new discoveries, and continually employed in the search of means of improving their condition.\n\nTheir condition carried them into every quarter from whence profit could be derived. There was scarcely any port of the American hemisphere to which they had not extended their navigation. They were continually exploring new sources of trade, and were found in every spot where business could be transacted.\n\nTo this extensive and incessant application to commerce, they added an equal vigilance in the administration of their affairs at home. Whatever could conduce to the amelioration of the soil they possessed, to the profits of agriculture, or to the improvement of their domestic circumstances, was attended to with so much labour and care, that it may be strictly said, that Nature had given them nothing of which they did not make the most.\n\nIn the midst of this solicitude and toil in matters of business, the affairs of government were conducted with a steadiness, prudence, and lenity, seldom experienced, and never exceeded, in the best regulated countries of Europe.\n\nSuch was the situation of the British colonies in general throughout North America, and of the New England provinces in particular, when the pacification above mentioned opened one of the most remarkable scenes that ever commanded the attention of the world.\n\nThe French, who have for many ages been the principal enemies of Britain, had long viewed, the French, with equal envy and apprehension, the flourishing state of those colonies she had founded in North America. No doubt at present subsists, that they began immediately after the peace of Paris to carry into execution the scheme they had formed for the separation of the British colonies from the mother country.\n\nConfident that, whilst a good understanding lasted between them, the superiority must henceforth remain\nAmerica, for ever on the side of Britain, it was only by their union that France could hope to regain the station and consequence she had formerly possessed in Europe.\n\nThe first steps the took were to employ her secret emissaries in spreading dissatisfaction among the British colonies; and the effects produced by her machinations were precisely such as they had intended and expected. The disposition of the inhabitants of North America began gradually to alter from that warmth of attachment to the mother country which had so peculiarly characterized them. They began to view her rather in the light of a sovereign than that of a parent; and to examine, with a scrupulous nicety, the nature of those ties that rendered them parts of her empire.\n\nIn March 1764, a bill was passed, by which heavy duties were laid on goods imported by the colonists from such West India islands as did not belong to Great Britain; at the same time that these duties were to be paid into the exchequer in specie; and in the same session, another bill was framed to restrain the currency of paper money in the colonies themselves. These acts coming so close upon each other, threw the whole continent into the utmost ferment. Vehement remonstrances were made to the ministry, and every argument made use of that reason or ingenuity could suggest; but to no purpose. Their reasoning, however, convinced a great number of people at home; and thus the American cause came to be considered as the cause of liberty.\n\nThe Americans, finding all argumentation vain, at last united in an agreement to import no more of the manufactures of Great Britain, but to encourage to the utmost of their power every thing of that kind among themselves. Thus the British manufacturers also became a party against ministry, and did not fail to express their resentment in the strongest terms; but the ministry were not to be so easily daunted, and therefore proceeded to the last step of their intended plan, which was to lay on stamp duties throughout the continent. Previous to this, indeed, several regulations were passed in favour of the commerce of the colonies; but they had now inhibited such unfavourable sentiments of the British ministry, that they paid very little regard to any thing pretended to be done in their favour; or if these acts made any favourable impression, it was quickly obliterated by the news of the stamp act. The reason given for this act to exceedingly obnoxious was, that a sum might be raised sufficient for the defence of the colonies against a foreign enemy; but this pretence was so far from giving any satisfaction to the Americans, that it excited their indignation to the utmost degree. They not only asserted that they were abundantly able to defend themselves against any foreign enemy, but denied that the British parliament had any right to tax them at all.\n\nIt would be superfluous to enter into any arguments used by the contending parties on this important occasion. It was evident that the matter was not to be decided by argument but by force of arms; and the British ministry, too confident of the authority and power of this country, determined to carry on matters with a high hand, to terrify the colonies into an implicit subjection, or, if that would not do, to compel them to it by force. The stamp act, after a violent opposition to parliament, was passed, and its reception in America was such as might have been expected.\n\nThe news, and the act itself, first arrived at Bolton, where the bells were muffled and rung a funeral peal, with universal mourning. Death's head was affixed to it, and styled the \"Folly of dignation England, and the Ruin of America;\" and afterwards publicly burnt by the enraged populace: The stamps themselves were seized and destroyed, unless brought by men of war, or kept in fortified places; those who were to receive the stamp duties were compelled to resign their offices; and such of the Americans as sided with government on this occasion had their houses plundered and burnt.\n\nThough these outrages were committed by the lowest of the multitude, they were first connived at by those of superior rank, and the principles on which they were founded afterwards openly patronized by them; and the doctrine became general, and openly avowed, that Britain had no right whatever to tax the colonies without their own consent.\n\nIt was now found absolutely necessary either to yield to the Americans, by repealing the obnoxious statutes, or to enforce them by arms. The ferment had diffused itself universally throughout the colonies. Virginia first, and after that all the rest of the provinces, declared against the right of Britain to lay on taxes in America; and that every attempt to vest others with this power besides the king, or the governor of the province and his general assembly, was illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust. Non-importation agreements were everywhere entered into; and it was even resolved to prevent the sale of any more British goods after the present year. American manufactures, though dearer, as well as inferior in quality to the British, were universally preferred. An association was entered into against eating of lamb, in order to promote the growth of wool; and the ladies with cheerfulness agreed to renounce the use of every species of ornament manufactured in Britain. Such a general and alarming confederacy determined the ministry to repeal some of the most obnoxious statutes; and to this they were more inclined by a petition from the first American congress, held at New York in the beginning of October 1765.\n\nThe stamp act was therefore repealed, to the universal joy of the Americans, and indeed to the general satisfaction of the English, whose manufactures had begun to suffer very severely in consequence of the American association against them. The disputes on the subject without doors, however, were by no means silenced, but each party continued to argue the case as violently as ever. The celebrated Dr Benjamin Franklin was on this occasion examined before the House of Commons; and his opinion was in substance as follows:\n\n\"That the tax in question was impracticable and ruinous. The very attempt had so far alienated the affection of the colonies, that they behaved in a less friendly manner towards the natives of England than before; considering the whole nation as conspiring against their liberty, and the parliament as willing rather to oppress than to support and assist them. America, in fact, did not stand in any need of British manufactures, having already begun to construct such as might be deemed absolutely necessary, and that with...\"\nsuch success, as left no doubt of their arriving in a short time at perfection. The elegancies of dress had already been renounced for manufactures of the American kind, though much inferior; and the bulk of the people, consisting of farmers, were such as could in no way be affected by the want of British commodities, as having every necessary within themselves. Materials of all kinds were to be had in plenty: the wood was fine; flax grew in great abundance, and iron was everywhere to be met with.\n\nThe Doctor also insisted, \"That the Americans had been greatly misrepresented; that they had been traduced as void of gratitude and affection to the parent state; than which nothing could be more contrary to truth. In the war of 1755 they had at their own expense, raised an army of 25,000 men; and in that of 1739 they assisted the British expeditions against South America with several thousand men, and had made many brave exertions against the French in North America. It was said, that the war of 1755 had been undertaken in defence of the colonies; but the truth was, that it originated from a contest about the limits between Canada and Nova Scotia, and in defence of the English rights to trade on the Ohio. The Americans, however, would still continue to act with their usual fidelity; and, were any war to break out in which they had no concern, would show themselves as ready as ever to assist the parent state to the utmost of their power, and would never fail to manifest their readiness in contributing to the emergencies of government, when called to do so in a regular and constitutional manner.\"\n\nThe ministry were conscious, that in repealing this obnoxious act, they yielded to the Americans; and therefore, to support, as they thought, the dignity of Great Britain, it was judged proper to publish a declaratory bill, setting forth the authority of the mother-country over her colonies, and her power to bind them by laws and statutes in all cases whatsoever. This much diminished the joy with which the repeal of the stamp act was received in America. It was considered as a proper reason to enforce any claims equally prejudicial with the stamp act, which might hereafter be set up; a spirit of jealousy pervaded the whole continent, and a strong party was formed, watchful on every occasion to guard against the supposed encroachments of the British power.\n\nIt was not long before an occasion offered, in which the Americans manifested a spirit of absolute independence; and that, instead of being bound by the British legislature in all cases, they would not be controlled by it in the most trivial affairs. The Rockingham ministry had passed an act, providing the troops stationed in different parts of the colonies with such accommodation as were necessary for them. The assembly of New York, however, took upon them to alter the mode of execution prescribed by the act of parliament, and to substitute one of their own. This gave very great offence to the new ministry, and rendered them, though composed of those who had been active against the stamp bill, less favourable to the colonies than in all probability they would have otherwise been. An unlucky circumstance at the same time occurred, which threw everything once more into confusion. One of the new ministry, Mr Charles Townshend, having declared that he could find a way of taxing the Americans without giving them offence, was called upon to propose his plan. This was by imposing a duty Mr Townshend upon tea, paper, painters colours, and glass imported thence into America. The undutiful behaviour of the New plan to tax York assembly, and that of Boston, which had proceeded in a similar manner, caused this bill to meet with less opposition than otherwise it might have done. As a punishment to the refractory assemblies, the legislative power was taken from that of New York, until it should fully comply with the terms of the act. That of Boston at last submitted with reluctance. The bill for the new taxes was quickly passed, and sent to America in 1768.\n\nA ferment much greater than that occasioned by the received stamp act now took place throughout the continent, there with. The populace renewed their outrages, and those of superior station entered into regular combinations against it. Circular letters were sent from Massachusetts co-even the colony to all the rest, setting forth the injustice and impropriety of the behaviour of the British legislature. Meetings were held in all the principal towns, in which it was proposed to lessen the consumption of foreign manufactures, by giving proper encouragement to their own. Continual disputes ensued betwixt the governors and general assemblies of their provinces, which were much heightened by a letter from Lord Shelburne to Governor Bamand of Massachusetts Bay, containing complaints of the people he governed. The assembly, and their exasperated to the highest degree, charged their governor, nor with having misrepresented them to the court of Britain, required him to produce copies of the letters he had sent; and, on his refusal, wrote letters to the English ministry, accusing him of misrepresentation and partiality, complaining at the same time most grievously of the proceedings of parliament, as utterly subversive of the liberties of America, and the rights of British subjects.\n\nThe governor, at a loss how to defend himself, prorogued the assembly; and, in his speech on the occasion, gave a loofe to his resentment, accusing the members of ambitious designs, incompatible with those of dutiful and loyal subjects. To counteract the circular letter of the province of Massachusetts Bay, Lord Hillsborough, secretary for the American department, sent another to the governors of the different colonies, reprobating the other as full of misrepresentation, and tending to excite a rebellion against the authority of the parent state.\n\nMatters now hastened to a crisis. The governor had been ordered to proceed with vigour, and by no means to show any disposition to yield to the people as formerly. In particular, they were required to rescind the resolution by which they had written the circular letter above mentioned; and, in case of a refusal, it was told them that they would be dissolved. As this circular letter had been framed by the resolutions of a former letter; House, they desired, after a week's consultation, that a recess might be granted to consult with their constituents; but this being refused, they came to a determination, 92 against 17, to adhere to the resolution which they which produced the circular letter. At the same time refuse, a letter was sent to Lord Hillsborough, and a message to the governor, in justification of their proceedings. In both they expressed themselves with such freedom\nAmerica, as was by no means calculated to accord with the sentiments of those in power. They insisted that they had a right to communicate their sentiments to their fellow-subjects upon matters of such importance; complained of the requisition to rescind the circular letter as unconstitutional and unjust; and particularly insisted, that they were represented as harbouring seditious designs, when they were doing nothing but what was lawful and right. At the same time, they condemned the late acts of parliament as highly oppressive, and subversive of liberty. The whole was concluded by a list of accusations against their governor, representing him as unfit to continue in his station, and petitioning the king for his removal from it.\n\nThese proceedings were followed by a violent tumult at Boston. A vessel belonging to a capital trader had been seized in consequence of his having neglected some of the new regulations; and being taken under the protection of a man of war at that time lying in the harbour, the populace attacked the houses of the commissioners of excise, broke their windows, destroyed the collector's boats, and obliged the customhouse officers to take refuge in Castle William, situated at the entrance of the harbour.\n\nThe governor now took the last step in his power to put a stop to the violent proceedings of this assembly, by dissolving it entirely; but this was of little moment. Their behaviour had been highly approved by the other colonies, who had written letters to them expressive of their approbation. After the dissolution of the assembly, frequent meetings of the people were held in Boston, which ended in a remonstrance to the governor, to the same purpose as some of the former; but concluding with an extraordinary request, that he would take upon him to order the king's ships out of the harbour.\n\nWhile the disposition of the Bostonians was thus going on from bad to worse, news arrived that the agent for the colony had not been allowed to deliver their petition to the king; it having been objected, that the assembly without the governor was not sufficient authority. This did not contribute to allay the ferment; and it was further augmented by the news that a number of troops had been ordered to repair to Boston, to keep the inhabitants in awe.\n\nA dreadful alarm now took place. The people called on the governor to convene a general assembly, in order to remove the fears of the military; who they said were to be assembled to overthrow their liberties, and force obedience to laws to which they were entirely adverse. The governor replied that it was no longer in his power to call an assembly; having, in his last instructions from England, been required to wait the king's orders, the matter being then under consideration at home. Being thus refused, the people took upon themselves the formation of an assembly, which they called a Convention. The proceedings and resolutions of this were conformable to their former behaviour; but now they went a step farther, and, under pretence of an approaching rupture with France, ordered the inhabitants to put themselves in a posture of defence against any sudden attack of an enemy; and circular letters were directed to all the towns in the province, acquainting them with the resolutions that had been taken in the capital, and exhorting them to proceed in the same manner. The town of Hatfield alone refused its concurrence; but this served only to expose them to the censure and contempt of the rest. The convention, however, thought proper to allure the governor of their pacific intentions, and renewed their request that an assembly might be called; but being refused any audience, and threatened with being treated as rebels, they at last thought proper to dissolve of themselves, and sent over to Britain a circumstantial account of their proceedings, with the reason of their having assembled in the manner already mentioned.\n\nThe expected troops arrived on the very day on which the convention broke up, and had some houses in the town fitted up for their reception. Their arrival had a considerable influence on the people, and for some time seemed to put a stop to the disturbances; but the seeds of discord had now taken such deep root, that it was impossible to quench the flame. The late outrageous behaviour in Boston had given the greatest offence in England; and, notwithstanding all the efforts of opposition, an address from both houses of parliament was presented to the king; in which the audacious behaviour of the colony of Massachusetts Bay against was set forth in the most ample manner, and the most vigorous measures recommended for reducing them to obedience. The Americans, however, continued steadfast in the ideas they had adopted. Though the troops had for some time quieted the disturbances, yet the calm continued no longer than they appeared respectable on account of their number; but as soon as this was diminished by the departure of a large detachment, the remainder were treated with contempt, and it was even resolved to expel them altogether. The country people took up arms for this purpose, and were to have assisted their friends in Boston; but before the plot could be put in execution, an event happened which put an end to every idea of reconciliation between the contending parties.\n\nOn the 5th of March 1770, a scuffle happened between some people killed. The inhabitants poured in from all quarters to the assistance of their fellow-citizens; a violent tumult ensued, during which the military fired among the mob, killing and wounding several of them. The whole province now rose in arms, and the soldiers were obliged to retire to Castle William to prevent their being cut in pieces. In other respects, the determinations of the Americans continued, if possible, more firm than ever, until at last government, determined to act with vigour, and at the same time to behave with as much condescension as possible, repealed all the duties lately laid on, that of tea alone excepted. This was left on purpose to maintain the dignity of the crown of Britain; and it was thought that it could not be productive of any discontent in America, as being an affront; fair of very little moment, the produce of which was not expected to exceed 16,000l. The opposition, however, were strenuous in their endeavours to get this tax likewise abrogated; inflicting, that the Americans would consider it only as an inlet to others; and that the repeal of all the rest, without this, would answer no great purpose. The event showed that their opinion was well founded. The Americans opposed the violently tea tax with the same violence as they had done all the rest; all the rest.\nAmerica; rest: and at last, on the news that salaries had been settled on the justices of the superior court of Boston, the governor was addressed on the subject; the measure was condemned in the strongest terms; and a committee, selected out of the several districts of the colony, appointed to inquire into it.\n\nThe new assembly proceeded in the most formal manner to disavow the supremacy of the British legislature; accused the parliament of Britain of having violated the natural rights of the Americans in a number of instances. Copies of the transactions of this assembly were transmitted to every town in Massachusetts, exhorting the inhabitants to rouse themselves, and exert every nerve in opposition to the iron hand of oppression, which was daily tearing the choicest fruits from the fair tree of liberty. The disturbances were greatly heightened by an accidental discovery, that Mr Hutchison, governor of Massachusetts Bay, had written several confidential letters to people in power in England, complaining of the behaviour of the province, recommending vigorous measures against them, and, among other things, afflicting, that \"there must be an abridgement of what is called British liberty.\" Letters of this kind had somehow or other fallen into the hands of the agent for the colony at London. They were immediately transmitted to Boston, where the assembly was sitting, by whom they were laid before the governor, who was thus reduced to a very mortifying situation. Losing every idea of respect or friendship for him as their governor, they instantly dispatched a petition to the king, requesting him to remove the governor and deputy-governor from their places; but to this they not only received no favourable answer, but the petition itself was declared groundless and scandalous.\n\nMatters were now ripe for the utmost extremities on the part of the Americans; and they were brought on in the following manner: Though the colonists had entered into a non-importation agreement against tea as well as all other commodities from Britain, it had nevertheless found its way into America, though in smaller quantities than before. This was sensibly felt by the East India Company, who had now agreed to pay a large sum annually to government; in recompense for which compliance, and to make up their losses in other respects, they were empowered to export their tea free from any duty payable in Britain; and in consequence of this permission, several ships freighted with the commodity were sent to North America, and proper agents appointed for disposing of it. The Americans now perceiving that the tax was thus likely to be enforced whether they would or not, determined to take every possible method to prevent the tea from being landed, as well knowing that it would be impossible to hinder the sale should the commodity once be brought on shore. For this purpose the people assembled in great numbers, forcing those to whom the tea was configned to resign their offices, and to promise solemnly never to resume them; and committees were appointed to examine the accounts of merchants, and make public tests, declaring such as would not take them enemies to their country. Nor was this behaviour confined to the colony of Massachusetts Bay; the rest of the provinces entered into the contest with the same warmth, and manifested the same revolution America, to oppose the mother country.\n\nIn the midst of this confusion three ships laden with tea arrived at Boston; but so much were the captains alarmed at the disposition which seemed to prevail among the people, that they offered, providing they could obtain the proper discharges from the tea consignees, customhouse, and governor, to return to Britain without landing their cargoes. The parties concerned, however, though they did not order the tea to be landed, refused to grant the discharges required. The ships, therefore, would have been obliged to remain in the harbour; but the people, apprehensive that if they remained there the tea would be landed in small quantities, and disposed of in spite of every endeavour to prevent it, resolved to destroy it at once. This resolution was executed with equal speed and secrecy. The very evening after the above mentioned discharges had been refused, a number of people, disguised like Mohawk Indians, boarded the ships, and threw into the sea their whole cargoes, consisting of 342 chests of tea; after which they retired without making any further disturbance, or doing any more damage. No tea was destroyed in other places, though the same spirit was everywhere manifested. At Philadelphia and other places, the pilots were enjoined not to conduct the vessels up the river; and at New York, though the governor caused some tea to be landed under the protection of a man of war, he was obliged to deliver it up to the custody of the people, to prevent its being sold.\n\nThe destruction of the tea at Boston, which happened in November 1773, was the immediate prelude to the disasters attending civil discord. Government finding themselves everywhere insulted and despised, resolved to enforce their authority by all possible means; and as Boston had been the principal scene of the riots and outrages, it was determined to punish that city in an exemplary manner. Parliament was acquainted by a message from his majesty with the undutiful behaviour of the city of Boston, as well as of all the colonies, recommending at the same time the most vigorous and spirited exertions to reduce them to obedience. The parliament in its address promised a ready compliance; and indeed the Americans, by their outrageous behaviour, had now lost many of their partisans. It was proposed to lay a fine on the town of Boston equal to the price of the tea which had been destroyed, and to shut up its port by armed vessels until the refractory spirit of the inhabitants should be subdued; which it was thought must quickly yield, as a total stop would thus be put to their trade. The bill was strongly opposed on the same grounds that the petitioners had been; and it was predicted, that instead of having any tendency to reconcile or subdue the Americans, it would infallibly exasperate them beyond any possibility of reconciliation. The petitions against it, presented by the colony's agent, pointed out the same consequence in the strongest terms, and in the most positive manner declared that the Americans never would submit to it; but such was the infatuation attending every rank and degree of men, that it never was imagined the Americans would dare to resist the parent-state openly, but would in the end submit implicitly to her commands. In this confidence a third bill was proposed.\nproposed for the impartial administration of justice on such persons as might be employed in the suppression of riots and tumults in the province of Massachusetts Bay. By this act, it was provided, that should any persons acting in that capacity be indicted for murder, and not able to obtain a fair trial in the province, they might be sent by the governor to England, or to some other colony, if necessary, to be tried for the supposed crime.\n\nThese three bills having passed so easily, the ministry proposed a fourth, relative to the government of Canada; which, it was said, had not yet been settled on any proper plan. By this bill the extent of that province was greatly enlarged; its affairs were put under the direction of a council into which Roman Catholics were to be admitted; the Roman Catholic clergy were secured in their possessions and the usual privileges from those of their own profession. The council above mentioned were to be appointed by the crown, to be removable at its pleasure; and to be invested with every legislative power excepting that of taxation.\n\nNo sooner were these laws made known in America, than they cemented the union of the colonies almost beyond any possibility of dissolving it. The assembly of Massachusetts Bay had passed a vote against the judges accepting salaries from the crown, and put the question, whether they would accept them as usual from the general assembly? Four answered in the affirmative; but Peter Oliver the chief justice refused. A petition against him, and an accusation, were brought before the governor; but the latter refused the accusation, and declined to interfere in the matter; but as they still insisted for what they called justice against Mr Oliver, the governor thought proper to put an end to the matter by dissolving the assembly.\n\nIn this situation of affairs a new alarm was occasioned by the news of the port bill. This had been totally unexpected, and was received with the most extravagant expressions of displeasure among the populace; and while these continued the new governor, General Gage, arrived from England. He had been chosen to this office on account of his being well acquainted in America, and generally agreeable to the people; but human wisdom could not now point out a method by which the flame could be allayed. The first act of his office as governor was to remove the assembly to Salem, a town 17 miles distant; in consequence of the late act. When this was intimated to the assembly, they replied, by requesting him to appoint a day of public humiliation for deprecating the wrath of heaven, but met with a refusal. When met at Salem, they passed a resolution, declaring the necessity of a general congress composed of delegates from all the provinces, in order to take the affairs of the colonies at large into consideration; and five gentlemen, remarkable for their opposition to the British measures, were chosen to represent that of Massachusetts Bay. They then proceeded with all expedition to draw up a declaration, containing a detail of the grievances they laboured under, and the necessity of exerting themselves against lawless power; they set forth the disregard shown to their petitions, and the attempts of Great Britain to destroy their ancient constitution; and concluded with exhorting the inhabitants of the colony to obstruct, by every method in their power, such evil designs, recommending at the same time a total renunciation of everything imported from Great Britain till a redress of grievances could be procured.\n\nIntelligence of this declaration was carried to the Generosity of the people of Salem in favour of those of Bolton, and concluding with these remarkable words: \"By shutting up the port of Bolton, some imagine that the course of trade might be turned hither, and to our benefit; but nature, in the formation of our harbour, forbids our becoming rivals in commerce with that convenient mart; and were it otherwise, we must be dead to every idea of justice, loit to all feelings of humanity, could we indulge one thought to seize on wealth, and raise our fortunes on the ruin of our suffering neighbours.\"\n\nIt had been fondly hoped by the ministerial party at home, that the advantages which other towns of the colony might derive from the annihilation of the trade of Bolton would make them readily acquiesce in the measure of shutting up that port, and rather rejoice in it than otherwise; but the words of the address above mentioned seemed to preclude all hope of this kind; and subsequent transactions soon manifested it to be totally vain. No sooner did intelligence arrive of the remaining bills passed in the session of 1774, espoused than the cause of Bolton became the cause of all the colonies. The port bill had already occasioned violent revolts of the commotions throughout them all. It had been repented in provincial meetings, and resistance even to the last had been recommended against such oppression. In Virginia, the first of June, the day on which the port of Bolton was to be shut up, was held as a day of humiliation, and a public intercession in favour of America was enjoined. The style of the prayer enjoined at this time was, that \"God would give the people one heart and one mind, firmly to oppose every invasion of the American rights.\" The Virginians, however, did not content themselves with acts of religion. They recommended in the strongest manner a general congress of all the colonies, as fully persuaded that an attempt to tax any colony in an arbitrary manner was in reality an attack upon them all, and must ultimately end in the ruin of them all.\n\nThe provinces of New York and Pennsylvania, however, were less sanguine than the rest, being so closely connected in the way of trade with Great Britain, that the giving it up entirely appeared a matter of the most serious magnitude, and not to be thought of but to Britain after every other method had failed. The intelligence of the remaining bills respecting Bolton, however, spread a fresh alarm throughout the continent, and fixed those who had seemed to be the most wavering. The proposal of giving up all commercial intercourse with Britain was again proposed; contributions for the inhabitants of Bolton were raised in every quarter; and they every day received addresses commending them for the heroic courage with which they sustained their calamity.\n\nThe Bostonians on their part were not wanting in their endeavours to promote the general cause. An agreement was framed, which, in imitation of former times,\ntimes, they called a Solemn League and Covenant. By this the subscribers most religiously bound themselves to break off all communication with Britain after the expiration of the month of August ensuing, until the obnoxious acts were repealed; at the same time they engaged neither to purchase nor use any goods imported after that time, and to renounce all connexion with those who did, or who refused to subscribe to this covenant; threatening to publish the names of the refractory, which at this time was a punishment by no means to be despised. Agreements of a similar kind were almost instantaneously entered into throughout all America. General Gage indeed attempted to counteract the covenant by a proclamation, wherein it was declared an illegal and traitorous combination, threatening with the pains of law such as subscribed or countenanced it. But matters were too far gone for his proclamations to have any effect. The Americans retorted the charge of illegality on his own proclamation, and insisted that the law allowed subjects to meet in order to consider of their grievances, and affliciate for relief from oppression.\n\nPreparations were now made for holding the general congress so often proposed. Philadelphia, as being the most central and considerable town, was pitched upon for the place of its meeting. The delegates of whom it was to be composed were chosen by the representatives of each province, and were in number from two to seven for each colony, though no province had more than one vote. The first congress which met at Philadelphia, in the beginning of September 1774, consisted of 51 delegates. The novelty and importance of the meeting excited an universal attention; and their transactions were such as could not but tend to render them respectable.\n\nThe first act of congress was an approbation of the conduct of Massachusetts Bay, and an exhortation to continue in the same spirit with which they had begun. Supplies for the suffering inhabitants (whom indeed the operation of the port bill had reduced to great distress) were strongly recommended; and it was declared, that in case of attempts to enforce the obnoxious acts by arms, all America should join to afflict the town of Boston; and should the inhabitants be obliged, during the course of hostilities, to remove farther up the country, the losses they might sustain should be repaired at the public expense.\n\nThey next addressed General Gage by letter; in which, having stated the grievances of the people of Massachusetts colony, they informed him of the fixed and unalterable determination of all the other provinces to support their brethren, and to oppose the British acts of parliament; that they themselves were appointed to watch over the liberties of America; and entreated him to desist from military operations, lest such hostilities might be brought on as would frustrate all hopes of reconciliation with the parent state.\n\nThe next step was to publish a declaration of their rights. These they summed up in the rights belonging to Englishmen; and particularly insisted, that as their distance rendered it impossible for them to be represented in the British parliament, their provincial assemblies, with the governor appointed by the king, constituted the only legislative power within each province. They would, however, consent to such acts of parliament as were evidently calculated merely for the regulation of commerce, and securing to the parent state the benefits of the American trade; but would never allow that they could impose any tax on the colonies, for the purpose of raising a revenue, without their consent. They proceeded to reprobate the intention of each of the new acts of parliament; and insisted on all the rights they had enumerated as being unalienable, and what none could deprive them of.\n\nThe Canada act they particularly pointed out as being extremely inimical to the colonies, by whose affluence it had been conquered; and they termed it, \"An act for establishing the Roman Catholic religion in Canada, abolishing the equitable system of English laws, and establishing a tyranny there.\" They further declared in favour of a non-importation and non-consumption of British goods until the acts were repealed by which duties were imposed upon tea, coffee, wine, sugar, and molasses, imported into America, as well as the Boston port act, and the three others passed in the preceding session of parliament. The new regulations against the importation and consumption of British commodities were then drawn up with great solemnity; and they concluded with returning the warmest thanks to those members of parliament who had with so much zeal, though without any success, opposed the obnoxious acts of parliament.\n\nTheir next proceedings were to frame a petition to the king, an address to the British nation, and another to the colonies; all of which were so much in the usual strain of American language for some time past, that it is needless to enter into any particular account of them. It is sufficient to say, that they were all drawn up in a masterly manner, and ought to have impressed the people of this country with a more favourable idea of the Americans than they could at that time be induced to entertain.\n\nAll this time the disposition of the people had corresponded with the warmest wishes of congress. The first of June had been kept as a fast, not only throughout Virginia where it was first proposed, but through the whole continent. Contributions for the distresses of Boston had been raised throughout America, and people of all ranks seemed to be particularly touched with them. Even those who seemed to be most likely to derive advantages from them took no opportunity, as has been already intimated in the case of Salem.\n\nThe inhabitants of Marblehead also showed a noble generosity example of magnanimity in the present case. Though of the inhabitants situated in the neighbourhood of Boston, and most likely to derive benefit from their distresses, they did not attempt to take any advantage, but generously offered the use of their harbour to the Bostonians, as well as their wharfs and warehouses, free of all expense. In the mean time the British forces at Boston were continually increasing in number, which greatly augmented the general jealousy and disaffection; the extreme country were ready to rise at a moment's warning; attachment and the experiment was made by giving a false alarm that the communication between the town and country was to be cut off, in order to reduce the former by tonians. Famine to a compliance with the acts of parliament.\n\nOn this intelligence the country people assembled in great numbers, and could not be satisfied till they had sent messengers into the city to inquire into the truth\ntruth of the report. These messengers were enjoined to inform the town's people, that if they should be so pusillanimous as to make a surrender of their liberties, the province would not think itself bound by such examples; and that Britain, by breaking their original charter, had annulled the contract subsisting between them, and left them to act as they thought proper.\n\nThe people in every other respect manifested their inflexible determination to adhere to the plan they had so long followed. The new counsellors and judges were obliged to resign their offices, in order to preserve their lives and properties from the fury of the multitude. In some places they shut up the avenues to the court houses; and when required to make way for the judges, replied, that they knew of none but such as were appointed by the ancient usage and custom of the province. Everywhere they manifested the most ardent desire of learning the art of war; and every individual who could bear arms, was most assiduous in procuring them, and learning their exercise.\n\nMatters at last proceeded to such a height, that General Gage thought proper to fortify the neck of land which joins the town of Boston to the continent. This, though undoubtedly a prudent measure in his situation, was exclaimed against by the Americans in the most vehement manner; but the general, instead of giving ear to their remonstrances, deprived them of all power of acting against himself, by seizing the provincial powder, ammunition, and military stores, at Cambridge and Charlestown. This excited such indignation, that it was with the utmost difficulty the people could be restrained from marching to Boston and attacking the troops. Even in the town itself, the company of cadets that used to attend him disdained themselves, and returned the standard he had as usual presented them with on his accession to the government. This was occasioned by his having deprived the celebrated John Hancock, afterwards president of the congress, of his commission as colonel of the cadets. A similar instance happened of a provincial colonel having accepted a seat in the new council; upon which 24 officers of his regiment resigned their commissions in one day.\n\nIn the mean time a meeting was held of the principal inhabitants of the towns adjacent to Boston. The purpose of this was publicly to renounce all obedience to the late acts of parliament, and to form an engagement to indemnify such as should be prosecuted on that account; the members of the new council were declared violators of the rights of their country; all ranks and degrees were exhorted to learn the use of arms; and the receivers of the public revenue were ordered not to deliver it into the treasury, but retain it in their own hands till the constitution should be restored, or a provincial congress dispose of it otherwise.\n\nA remonstrance against the fortifications on Boston Neck was next prepared; in which, however, they still pretended their unwillingness to proceed to any hostile measures; afflicting only as usual their firm determination not to submit to the acts of parliament they had already so much complained of. The governor, to restore tranquility, if possible, called a general assembly; but so many of the council had resigned their seats, that he was induced to countermand its fitting by proclamation. This measure, however, was deemed illegal; the assembly met at Salem; and after waiting a day for the governor, voted themselves into a provincial congress, of which Mr Hancock was chosen president. A committee was instantly appointed, who waited on the governor with a remonstrance concerning the fortifications on Boston Neck; but nothing of consequence took place, both parties mutually criminating each other. The winter was now coming on, and the governor, to avoid quartering the soldiers upon the inhabitants, proposed to erect barracks for them; but the Gen. Gage selected men of Boston compelled the workmen to desist. Carpenters were sent for to New York, but they were refused; and it was with the utmost difficulty that he accommodated procure winter lodgings for his troops. Nor was dating his the difficulty less in procuring clothes; as the merchants of New York told him, that \"they would never supply any article for the benefit of men sent as enemies to their country.\"\n\nThis disposition, known to be almost universal throughout the continent, was in the highest degree satisfactory to congress. Every one saw that the ensuing spring was to be the season of commencing hostilities, and the most indefatigable diligence was used by the colonies to be well provided against such a formidable enemy. A list of all the fencible men in each colony was made out, and especially of those who had served in the former war; of whom they had the satisfaction to find that two-thirds were still alive and fit to bear arms. Magazines of arms were collected, and money was provided for the payment of troops. The governors in vain attempted to put a stop to these proceedings by proclamations; the fatal period was now arrived; and the more the servants of government attempted to repress the spirit of the Americans, the more violent it appeared.\n\nIn the mean time the inhabitants of Boston were reduced to great distress. The British troops, now distinguished by the name of the enemy, were absolutely in possession of it; the inhabitants were kept as prisoners, and might be made accountable for the conduct of the whole colonies; and various measures were contrived to relieve the latter from such disagreeable situation. Sometimes it was thought expedient to remove the inhabitants altogether; but this was impracticable without the governor's consent. It was then proposed to set fire to the town at once, after valuing the houses and indemnifying the proprietors; but this being found equally impracticable, it was resolved to wait some other opportunity, as the garrison was not very numerous, and, not being supplied with necessaries by the inhabitants, might soon be obliged to leave the place. The friends of British government indeed attempted to do something in opposition to the general voice of the people; but after a few ineffectual meetings and resolutions they were utterly silenced, and obliged to yield to the superior number of their adversaries.\n\nMatters had now proceeded so far that every idea of reconciliation or friendship with Britain was lost. The Military Americans, therefore, without ceremony, began to seize on the military stores and ammunition belonging to the government. This first commenced at Newport in Rhode Island, where the inhabitants carried off 40 pieces of cannon appointed for the protection of the place;\nplace; and on being asked the reason of this proceeding, they replied, that the people had seized them lest they should be made use of against themselves. After this the assembly met, and resolved that ammunition and warlike stores should be purchased with the public money.\n\nNew Hampshire followed the example of Rhode Island, and seized a small fort for the sake of the powder and military stores it contained. In Pennsylvania, however, a convention was held, which expressed an earnest desire of reconciliation with the mother country; though, at the same time, in the strongest manner declaring, that they were resolved to take up arms in defense of their just rights, and defend to the last their opposition to the late acts of parliament; and the people were exhorted to apply themselves with the greatest alacrity to the prosecution of such manufactures as were necessary for their defense and subsistence, such as salt, saltpetre, gunpowder, steel, &c. This was the universal voice of the colonies, New York only excepted. The assembly of that province, as yet ignorant of the fate of their last remonstrance, refused to concur with the other colonies in their determination to throw off the British yoke: their attachment, however, was very faint, and by the event it appeared that a perseverance in the measures which the ministry had adopted was sufficient to unite them to the rest.\n\nAs the disturbances had originated in the province of Massachusetts Bay, and there continued all along with the greatest violence, so this was the province where the first hostilities were formally commenced. In the beginning of February the provincial congress met at Cambridge; and as no friends to Britain could now find admittance to that assembly, the only consideration was how to make proper preparations for war. Expertness in military discipline was recommended in the strongest manner, and several military institutions enacted; among which that of the minute-men was one of the most remarkable. These were chosen from the most active and expert among the militia; and their business was to keep themselves in constant readiness at the call of their officers; from which perpetual vigilance they derived their title.—It was now easily seen that a slight occasion would bring on hostilities, which could not but be attended with the most violent and certain destruction to the vanquished party: for both were so much exasperated by a long course of reproaches and literary warfare, that they seemed to be filled with the utmost inveteracy against each other.\n\nOn the 26th of February, General Gage having been informed that a number of field-pieces had been brought to Salem, despatched a party to seize them. Their road was obstructed by a river, over which was a drawbridge. This the people had pulled up, and refused to let down: upon which the soldiers seized a boat to ferry them over; but the people cut out her bottom. Hostilities would immediately have commenced, had it not been for the interposition of a clergyman, who represented to the military on the one hand, the folly of opposing such numbers; and to the people on the other, that as the day was far spent the military could not execute their design, so that they might without any fear leave them the quiet possession of the drawbridge. This was complied with; and the soldiers, after having remained for some time at the bridge, returned without executing their orders.\n\nThe next attempt, however, was attended with more serious consequences. General Gage, having been informed that a large quantity of ammunition and military stores had been collected at Concord, about 20 miles from Boston, and where the provincial congress was sitting, sent a detachment, under the command of Colonel Smith and Major Pitcairn, to destroy the stores, and, as was reported, to seize Messrs Hancock and Adams, the leading men of the congress. They set out before daybreak, on the 19th of April, marching with the utmost silence, and securing every one they met on the road, that they might not be discovered. But notwithstanding all their care, the continual ringing of bells and firing of guns as they went along, soon gave them notice that the country was alarmed. About five in the morning they had reached Lexington, 15 miles from Boston, where the militia of the place were exercising. An officer called out to them to disperse; but some shots, it is said, being at that moment fired from a house in the neighborhood, the military made a discharge, which killed and wounded several of the militia. The detachment then proceeded to Concord, where, having destroyed the stores, they were encountered by the Americans; and a scuffle ensued, in which several fell on both sides. The purpose of their expedition being thus accomplished, it was necessary for the king's troops to retreat, which they did through a continual fire kept upon them from Concord to Lexington. Here their ammunition was totally expended; and they would have been unavoidably cut off, had not a considerable reinforcement commanded by Lord Percy luckily met them. The Americans, however, continued their attack with great fury; and the British would still have been in the utmost danger, had it not been for two field pieces which Lord Percy had brought with him. By these the impetuosity of the Americans was checked, and the British made good their retreat to Boston with the loss of 250 killed and wounded: that of the Americans was about 60.\n\nBy this engagement the spirits of the Americans were raised, that they meditated nothing less than the total expulsion of the British troops from Boston, fowls before Boston. An army of 20,000 men was assembled, who formed a line of encampment from Roxbury to Mystic, through a space of about 30 miles; and here they were soon after joined by a large body of Connecticut troops, under General Putnam, an old officer of great bravery and experience. By this formidable force was the town of Boston now kept blocked up. General Gage, however, had so strongly fortified it, that the enemy, powerful as they were, durst not make an attack; while, on the other hand, his force was by far too insignificant to meet such an enemy in the field. But towards the end of May, a considerable reinforcement having arrived, with Generals Howe, Burgoyne, and Clinton, he was soon enabled to attempt something of consequence; and this the boasts of the provincials, that they were besieging those who had been sent to subdue them, seemed to render unnecessary. Some skirmishes in the mean time happened in the islands lying off Boston harbour, in which the Americans had the advantage, and burnt an armed schooner, which her people\npeople had been obliged to abandon after she was left aground by the tide. Nothing decisive, however, took place till the 17th of June. In the neighbourhood of Charlestown, a place on the northern shore of the peninsula on which Boston stands, is a high ground called Bunker's Hill, which overlooks and commands the whole town of Boston. In the night of the 16th the provincials took possession of this place; and worked with such indefatigable diligence, that, to the astonishment of their enemies, they had before daylight almost completed a redoubt, with a strong intrenchment reaching half a mile eastward, as far as the river Mystic. After this they were obliged to sustain a heavy and incessant fire from the ships and floating batteries with which Charlestown Neck was surrounded, as well as the cannon that could reach the place from Boston; in spite of which, however, they continued their work and finished it before mid-day. A considerable body of foot was then landed at the foot of Bunker's Hill, under the command of Generals Howe and Pigot; the former being appointed to attack the lines, and the latter the redoubt. The Americans, however, having the advantage of the ground, as well as of their intrenchments, poured down such incessant volleys as threatened the whole body with destruction; and General Howe was for a little time left almost alone, all his officers being killed or wounded. The provincials in the mean time had taken possession of Charlestown, so that General Pigot was obliged to contend with them in that place as well as in the redoubt. The consequence was, that he was overmatched; his troops were thrown into disorder; and he would in all probability have been defeated, had not General Clinton advanced to his relief: upon which the attack was renewed with such fury, that the provincials were driven beyond the neck that leads to Charlestown. In the heat of the engagement the British troops were obliged to let fire to the town of Charlestown, which quickly obliged the provincials to yield after they were deprived of that shelter. The loss on the British side amounted to about 1000, among whom were 19 officers killed and 70 wounded; that of the Americans did not exceed 500.\n\nThe British troops claimed the victory in this engagement with justice, though it must be allowed that it was dearly bought; and the Americans boasted that the real advantages were on their side, as they had so much weakened the enemy, that they durst not afterwards venture out of their intrenchments. From the many advantages, however, which the Americans possessed, it is evident that the greatest display of valour was on the side of their enemies. The former were strongly intrenched, and most of their fortifications cannon proof; their soldiers were all chosen, and excellent marksmen, to whom muskets ready loaded were handed as fast as they were discharged; and when one party was wearied, another came to their assistance, as was perceived by the spectators on the tops of the houses at Boston. Considering, however, that this was the first time the provincials had been in actual service, it must be owned that they behaved with great spirit, and by no means merited the appellation of cowards, with which they were so often branded in Britain.\n\nIn other places the same determined spirit of resistance appeared on the part of the Americans. Lord North's conciliatory scheme was utterly rejected by the assemblies of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and afterwards in every other colony. The Americans began hostilities at Lexington determined the colony of come more New York, which had hitherto continued to waver, to and more unite with the rest; and as the situation of New York determined renders it unable to resist an attack from the sea, its position was resolved, before the arrival of a British fleet, to secure the military stores, send off the women and children, and to set fire to the city if it was still found incapable of defence. The exportation of provisions was everywhere prohibited, particularly to the British fishery on the banks of Newfoundland, or to such colonies of America as should adhere to the British interest. Congress resolved on the establishment of an army, and of a large paper currency in order to support it. In the inland northern colonies, Colonels Eaton and Ethan Allen, without receiving any orders from congress, or communicating their design to anybody, with a crown party of only 250 men, surpised the forts of Crown Point and Point Ticonderoga, and the rest that form a communication between the colonies and Canada. On this occasion 200 pieces of cannon fell into their hands, besides mortars and a large quantity of military stores, together with two armed vessels, and materials for the construction of others.\n\nAfter the battle of Bunker's Hill, the provincials erected fortifications on the heights which commanded Charlestown, and strengthened the rest in such a manner that there was no hope of driving them from thence; at the same time that their activity and boldness astonished the British officers, who had been accustomed to entertain too mean an opinion of their courage.\n\nThe troops, thus shut up in Boston, were soon reduced to distresses. Their necessities obliged them to attempt the carrying off the American cattle on the islands before Boston, which produced frequent skirmishes; but the provincials, better acquainted with the navigation of these shores, landed on the islands, destroyed or carried off whatever was of any use, burned the lighthouse at the entrance of the harbour, and took prisoners the workmen sent to repair it, as well as a party of marines who guarded them. Thus the garrison were reduced to the necessity of sending out armed vessels to make prizes indiscriminately of all that came in their way, and of landing in different places to plunder for subsistence as well as they could.\n\nThe congress in the mean time continued to act with all the vigour which its constituents had expected, Articles of confederation and perpetual union were drawn up and solemnly agreed upon; by which they bound themselves and their posterity for ever. These were in substance as follow:\n\n1. Each colony was to be independent within itself, and to retain an absolute sovereignty in all domestic affairs.\n\n2. Delegates to be annually elected to meet in congress, at such time and place as should be enacted in the preceding congress.\n\n3. This assembly should have the power of determining war or peace, making alliances; and in short all that power which sovereigns of states usually claim as their own.\n\n4. The\n4. The expenses of war to be paid out of the common treasury, and raised by a poll tax on males between 16 and 62: the proportions to be determined by the laws of the colony.\n\n5. An executive council to be appointed to act in place of the congress during its recess.\n\n6. No colony to make war with the Indians without consent of congress.\n\n7. The boundaries of all the Indian lands to be secured and ascertained to them; and no purchases of lands were to be made by individuals, or even by a colony, without consent of congress.\n\n8. Agents appointed by congress should reside among the Indians, to prevent frauds in trading with them, and to relieve, at the public expense, their wants and distresses.\n\n9. This confederation to last until there should be a reconciliation with Britain; or, if that event should not take place, it was to be perpetual.\n\nAfter the action of Bunker's Hill, however, when the power of Great Britain appeared less formidable in the eyes of America than before, congress proceeded formally to justify their proceedings in a declaration drawn up in terms more expressive, and well calculated to excite attention.\n\n\"We are it possible (said they) for men who exercise their reason, to believe that the divine Author of our existence intended a part of the human race to hold an absolute property in and unbounded power over others, marked out by His infinite goodness and wisdom as the objects of a regal domination, never rightfully resolvable, however severe and oppressive; the inhabitants of these colonies might at least require from the parliament of Great Britain some evidence that this despotic authority over them had been granted to that body: but a reverence for our Great Creator, principles of humanity, and the dictates of common sense, must convince all those who reflect upon the subject, that government was instituted to promote the welfare of mankind, and ought to be administered for the attainment of that end.\n\nThe legislature of Great Britain, however, stimulated by an inordinate passion for power, not only unjustifiable, but which they know to be peculiarly reprobated by the very constitution of that kingdom; and despairing of success in any mode of contest where regard should be had to law, truth, or right; have at length, defying those, attempted to effect their cruel and impolitic purpose, of enslaving these colonies by violence, and have thereby rendered it necessary for us to close with their last appeal from reason to arms. Yet, however blinded that assembly may be, by their intemperate rage for unlimited domination, so to slight justice in the opinion of mankind, we esteem ourselves bound by obligations to the rest of the world to make known the justice of our cause.\"\n\nAfter taking notice of the manner in which their ancestors left Britain, the happiness attending the mutual friendly commerce betwixt that country and her colonies, and the remarkable success of the late war, they proceed as follows: \"The new ministry finding the brave foes of Britain, though frequently defeated, yet still contending, took up the unfortunate idea of granting them a hasty peace, and of then subduing her faithful friends.\n\n\"Their devoted colonies were judged to be in such a state as to present victories without bloodshed, and all the easy emoluments of statutable plunder. The uninterrupted tenor of their peaceable and respectful behaviour from the beginning of their colonization; their dutiful, zealous, and useful services during the war, though so recently and amply acknowledged in the most honourable manner by his majesty, by the late king, and by parliament, could not save them from the intended innovations. Parliament was influenced to adopt the pernicious project; and assuming a new power over them, has in the course of eleven years given such decisive specimens of the spirit and consequences attending this power, as to leave no doubt of the effects of acquiescence under it.\n\n\"They have undertaken to give and grant our money without our consent, though we have ever exercised an exclusive right to dispose of our own property. Statutes have been passed for extending the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty, and vice-admiralty, beyond their ancient limits; for depriving us of the accustomed and inestimable rights of trial by jury, in cases affecting both life and property; for suspending the legislature of one of our colonies; for interfering all commerce to the capital of another; and for altering fundamentally the form of government established by charter, and secured by acts of its own legislature; and solemnly confirmed by the crown; for exempting the murderers of colonists from legal trial, and in effect from punishment; for erecting in a neighbouring province, acquired by the joint arms of Great Britain and America, a despotism dangerous to our very existence; and for quartering soldiers upon the colonists in time of a profound peace. It has also been resolved in parliament, that colonists charged with committing certain offences, shall be transported to England to be tried.\n\n\"But why should we enumerate our injuries in detail? By one statute it was declared, that parliament can of right make laws to bind us in all cases whatever. What is to defend us against so enormous, so unlimited a power? Not a single person who affirms it is chosen by us, or is subject to our control or influence; but on the contrary, they are all of them exempt from the operation of such laws; and an American revenue, if not diverted from the ostensible purposes from which it is raised, would actually lighten their own burdens in proportion as it increases ours.\n\n\"We saw the misery to which such despotism would reduce us. We for ten years incessantly and ineffectually besieged the throne as supplicants; we reasoned, we remonstrated with parliament in the most mild and decent language: but administration, sensible that we should regard these measures as freemen ought to do, sent over fleets and armies to enforce them.\n\n\"We have pursued every temperate, every respectful measure; we have even proceeded to break off all commercial intercourse with our fellow-subjects as our last peaceable admonition, that our attachment to no nation on earth would supplant our attachment to liberty: this we flattered ourselves was the ultimate step of the controversy; but subsequent events have shown how vain was this hope of finding moderation in our enemies!\n\n\"The Lords and Commons, in their address in the month\nmonth of February, said, that a rebellion at that time actually existed in the province of Massachusetts Bay, and that those concerned in it had been countenanced and encouraged by unlawful combinations and engagements entered into by his majesty's subjects in several of the colonies; and therefore they behooved his majesty that he would take the most effectual measures to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the supreme legislature. Soon after the commercial intercourse of whole colonies with foreign countries was cut off by an act of parliament; by another, several of them were entirely prohibited from the fisheries in the seas near their coasts, on which they always depended for their subsistence; and large reinforcements of ships and troops were immediately sent over to General Gage.\n\n\"Fruitless were all the entreaties, arguments, and eloquence of an illustrious band of the most distinguished peers and commoners, who nobly and strenuously affected the justice of our cause, to stay, or even to mitigate, the heedless fury with which these accumulated outrages were hurried on. Equally fruitless was the interference of the city of London, of Bristol, and many other respectable towns in our favour.\"\n\nAfter having reproached parliament, General Gage, and the British government in general, they proceed thus: \"We are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission to tyranny or resistance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the cost of this contest, and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery. Honour, justice, and humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity have a right to receive from us. Our cause is just; our union is perfect; our internal resources are great; and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable. We fight not for glory or conquest; we exhibit to mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies. They boast of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than servitude or death. In our own native land, in defence of the freedom that is our birthright, for the protection of our property acquired by the honest industry of our forefathers and our own, against violence actually offered, we have taken up arms; we shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of our aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed,—and not before.\"\n\nThese are some of the most striking passages in the declaration of congress on taking up arms against Great Britain, and dated July 6th 1775. Without inquiring whether the principles on which it is founded are right or wrong, the determined spirit which it shows ought to have convinced us, that the conquest of America was an event scarcely ever to be expected. In every other respect an equal spirit was shown; and the rulers of the British nation had the mortification to see those whom they styled rebels and traitors, succeed in negotiations in which they themselves were utterly foiled. In the passing of the Quebec bill, ministry had flattered themselves that the Canadians would be so much attached to them on account of restoring the French laws, that they would very readily join in any attempt against the colonists, who had reprobed that bill in such strong terms; but in this, as in every thing else indeed, they found themselves mistaken. The Canadians having been subject to Britain for a period of 15 years, and being thus rendered sensible of the superior advantages of British government, received the bill itself with evident marks of disapprobation; nay, reprobed it as tyrannical and oppressive. A scheme had been formed for General Carleton, governor of the province to raise an army of Canadians wherewith to act against the Americans; and so sanguine were the hopes of administration in this respect, that they had sent 20,000 stand of arms, and a great quantity of military stores, to Quebec for the purpose. But the people, though they did not join the Americans, yet were found immovable in their purpose to stand neutral. Application was made to the bishop; but he declined to interpose his influence, as contrary to the rules of the Popish clergy; so that the utmost efforts of government in this province were found to answer little or no purpose.\n\nThe British administration next tried to engage the Minnitry Indians in their cause. But though agents were dispatched among them with large presents to the chiefs, vain to arm them universally replied, that they did not understand the nature of the quarrel, nor could they distinguish whether those who dwelt in America or on the other side of the ocean were in fault; but they were surprized to see Englishmen ask their affiance against one another; and advised them to be reconciled, and not think of shedding the blood of their brethren.—To the representations of congress they paid more respect. There set forth, that the English on the other side of the ocean had taken up arms to enslave not only their countrymen in America, but the Indians also; and if the latter should enable them to overcome the colonists, they themselves would soon be reduced to a state of slavery also. By arguments of this kind these savages were engaged to remain neutral; and thus the colonists were freed from a most dangerous enemy. On this occasion the congress thought proper to hold a solemn conference with the different tribes of Indians. The speech made by them on the occasion is curious, but too long to be fully inserted. The following is a specimen of the European mode of addressing these people.\n\n\"Brothers, Sachems, and Warriors!\n\n\"We, the delegates from the Twelve United Provinces, now fitting in general congress at Philadelphia, send their talk to you our brothers.\n\n\"Brothers, and Friends now attend!\n\n\"When our fathers crossed the great water, and came over to this land, the king of England gave them a talk, assuring them that they and their children should be his children; and that if they would leave their native country, and make settlements, and live here, and buy and sell, and trade with their brethren beyond the water, they should still keep hold of the same covenant-chain, and enjoy peace; and it was convenanted, that the fields, houses, goods, and possessions which our fathers should acquire, should remain to them as their own, and be their children's for ever, and at their sole disposal.\n\n\"Brothers and Friends, open a kind ear!\n\n\"We will now tell you of the quarrel betwixt the counsellors...\"\ncounsellors of King George and the inhabitants and colonies of America.\n\n\"Many of his counsellors have persuaded him to break the covenant-chain, and not to send us any more good talks. They have prevailed upon him to enter into a covenant against us; and have torn asunder, and cast behind their backs, the good old covenant which their ancestors and ours entered into, and took strong hold of. They now tell us, they will put their hands into our pocket without asking, as though it were their own; and at their pleasure they will take from us our charters or written civil constitution, which we love as our lives; also our plantations, our houses, and goods, whenever they please, without asking our leave. They tell us, that our vessels may go to that or this island in the sea, but to this or that particular island we shall not trade any more; and, in case of our non-compliance with these new orders, they shut up our harbours.\n\n\"Brothers, we live on the same ground with you; the same island is our common birthplace. We desire to sit down under the same tree of peace with you; let us water its roots, and cherish the growth, till the large leaves and flourishing branches shall extend to the setting sun, and reach the skies. If any thing disagreeable should ever fall out between us, the Twelve United Colonies, and you, the Six Nations, to wound our peace, let us immediately seek measures for healing the breach. From the present situation of our affairs, we judge it expedient to kindle up a small fire at Albany, where we may hear each other's voice, and dilute our minds fully to one another.\"\n\nThe other remarkable transactions of this congress were the ultimate refusal of the conciliatory proposal made by Lord North, of which such sanguine expectations had been formed by the English ministry; and appointing a generalissimo to command their armies, which were now very numerous. The person chosen for this purpose was George Washington: a man universally beloved, that he was raised to such a high station by the unanimous voice of congress; and his subsequent conduct showed him every way worthy of it. Horace Gates and Charles Lee, two English officers of considerable reputation, were also chosen; the former an adjutant-general, the second a major-general. Artemus Ward, Philip Schuyler, and Israel Putnam, were likewise nominated major-generals. Seth Pomeroy, Richard Montgomery, David Wooster, William Heath, Joseph Spencer, John Thomas, John Sullivan, and Nathaniel Green were chosen brigadier-generals at the same time.\n\nCongress had now also the satisfaction to receive deputies from the colony of Georgia, expressing a desire to join the confederacy. The reasons they gave for renouncing their allegiance to Britain were, that the conduct of parliament towards the other colonies had been oppressive; that though the obnoxious acts had not been extended to them, they could view this only as an omission, because of the seeming little consequence of their colony; and therefore looked upon it rather to be a slight than a favour. At the same time they framed a petition to the king, similar to that sent by the other colonies, and which met with a similar reception.\n\nThe success which had hitherto attended the Americans in all their measures, now emboldened them to think not only of defending themselves, but likewise of acting offensively against Great Britain. The conquest of Canada appeared an object within their reach, and one that would be attended with many advantages; and as an invasion of that province was already facilitated by the taking of Crown Point and Ticonderago, of Canada, it was resolved if possible to penetrate that way into Canada, and reduce Quebec during the winter, before the fleets and armies, which they were well assured would fail thither from Britain, should arrive. By order of congress, therefore, 3000 men were put under the command of Generals Montgomery and Schuyler, with orders to proceed to Lake Champlain, from whence they were to be conveyed in flat-bottomed boats to the mouth of the river Sorel, a branch of the great river St Lawrence, and on which is situated a fort of the same name with the river. On the other hand, they were opposed by General Carleton governor of Canada, a man of great activity and experience in war; who, with a very few troops, had hitherto been able to keep in awe the disaffected people of Canada, notwithstanding all the representations of the colonists. He had now augmented his army by a considerable number of Indians, and promised even in his present situation to make a very formidable resistance.\n\nAs soon as General Montgomery arrived at Crown Point, he received information that several armed vessels were stationed at St John's, a strong fort on the Sorel, with a view to prevent his crossing the lake; on which he took possession of an island which commands the mouth of the Sorel, and by which he could prevent them from entering the lake. In conjunction with General Schuyler, he next proceeded to St John's; but finding that place too strong, he landed on a part of the country considerably distant, and full of woods and swamps. From thence, however, they were driven by a party of Indians whom General Carleton had employed.\n\nThe provincial army was now obliged to retreat to the island of which they had at first taken possession; where General Schuyler being taken ill, Montgomery was left to command alone. His first step was to gain over the Indians whom General Carleton had employed, and this he in a great measure accomplished; after which, on receiving the full number of troops appointed for his expedition, he determined to lay siege to St John's. In this he was facilitated by the reduction of Chamblee, a small fort in the neighbourhood, where taken, he found a large supply of powder. An attempt was made by General Carleton to relieve the place; for which purpose he with great pains collected about 1000 Canadians, while Colonel Maclean proposed to raise a regiment of the Highlanders who had emigrated from their own country to America.\n\nBut while General Carleton was on his march with General the new levies, he was attacked by a superior force of provincials, and utterly defeated; which being made known to another body of Canadians who had joined Colonel Maclean, they abandoned him without striking a blow, and he was obliged to retreat to Quebec.\n\nThe defeat of General Carleton was a sufficient recompense to the Americans for that of Colonel Ethan Allen, which had happened some time before. The\nsuccess which had attended this gentleman against Crown Point and Ticonderaga had emboldened him to make a similar attempt on Montreal; but being attacked by the militia of the place, supported by a detachment of regulars, he was entirely defeated and taken prisoner.\n\nAs the defeat of General Carleton and the defection of Maclean's forces left no room for the garrison of St John's to hope for any relief, they now consented to surrender themselves prisoners of war; but were in other respects treated with great humanity. They were in number 500 regulars and 200 Canadians, among whom were many of the French nobility who had been very active in promoting the cause of Britain among their countrymen.\n\nGeneral Montgomery next took measures to prevent the British shipping from passing down the river from Montreal to Quebec. This he accomplished to effectually, that the whole were taken. The town itself was obliged to surrender at discretion; and it was with the utmost difficulty that General Carleton escaped in an open boat by the favour of a dark night.\n\nNo further obstacle now remained in the way of the Americans to the capital, except what arose from the nature of the country; and these indeed were very considerable. Nothing, however, could damp the ardour of the provincials. Notwithstanding it was now the middle of November, and the depth of winter was at hand, Colonel Arnold formed a design of penetrating through woods, marshes, and the most frightful futilities from New England to Canada by a nearer way than that which Montgomery had chosen; and this he accomplished in spite of every difficulty, to the astonishment of all who saw or heard of the attempt. This desperate march, however, cannot be looked upon as conducive to any good purpose. A third part of his men under another colonel had abandoned him by the way, under pretence of want of provisions; the total want of artillery rendered his presence insignificant before a place strongly fortified; and the smallness of his army rendered it even doubtful whether he could have taken the town by surprise. The Canadians indeed were amazed at the exploit, and their inclination to revolt from Britain was somewhat augmented; but none of them as yet took up arms in behalf of America.\n\nThe conformation into which the town of Quebec was thrown proved detrimental rather than otherwise to the expedition; as it doubled the vigilance and activity of the inhabitants to prevent any surprise; and the appearance of common danger united all parties, who, before the arrival of Arnold, were contending most violently with one another. He was therefore obliged to content himself with blocking up the avenues to the town, in order to distress the garrison for want of provisions; and even this he was unable to do effectually, by reason of the small number of his men.\n\nThe matter was not much mended by the arrival of General Montgomery. The force he had with him, even when united to that of Arnold, was too insignificant to attempt the reduction of a place so strongly fortified, especially with the assistance only of a few mortars and field-pieces. After the siege had continued through the month of December, General Montgomery, conscious that he could accomplish his end no other way than by surprise, resolved to make an attempt on the last day of the year 1775. The method he took at this time was perhaps the best that human wisdom could devise. He advanced by break of day, in the midst of a heavy fall of snow, which covered his men from the sight of the enemy. Two real attacks were made by himself and Colonel Arnold, at the same time that two feigned attacks were made on two other places, thus to distract the garrison, and make them divide their forces. One of the real attacks was made by the people of New York, and the other by those of New England under Arnold. Their hopes of surprising the place, however, were defeated by the signal for the attack being through some mistake given too soon. General Montgomery himself had the most dangerous place, being obliged to pass between the river and some high rocks on which the Upper Town stands; so that he was forced to make what haste he could to close with the enemy. His fate, however, was now General decided. Having forced the first barrier, a violent Montgomery killed him, his principal officers, and the most of the Americans party he commanded; on which those who remained defeated immediately retreated. Colonel Arnold in the meantime made a desperate attack on the Lower Town, and carried one of the barriers after an obstinate resistance for an hour; but in the action he himself received a wound, which obliged him to withdraw. The attack, however, was continued by the officers whom he had left, and another barrier forced; but the garrison, now perceiving that nothing was to be feared except from that quarter, collected their whole force against it; and, after a desperate engagement of three hours, overpowered the provincials, and obliged them to surrender.\n\nIn this action, it must be confessed that the valour of the provincial troops could not be exceeded. They had fought under as great disadvantages as those which attended the British at Bunker's Hill, and had behaved equally well. Such a terrible disaster left no hope remaining of the accomplishment of their purpose, as General Arnold could now scarce number 800 effective men under his command. He did not, however, abandon the province, or even remove to a greater distance than three miles from Quebec; and here he still found means to annoy the garrison very considerably by intercepting their provisions. The Canadians, notwithstanding the bad success of the American arms, still continued friendly; and thus he was enabled to sustain the hardships of a winter encampment in that most severe climate. The congress, far from passing Arnold any censure on him for his misfortune, created him a brigadier-general.\n\nWhile hostilities were thus carried on with vigour in the north, the flame of contention was gradually extending itself in the south. Lord Dunmore, the governor of Virginia, was involved in disputes similar to Lord Duntho which had taken place in other colonies. These more with had proceeded so far that the assembly was dissolved; his province in this province was attended with a consequence unknown to the rest. As Virginia contained a great number of slaves, it was necessary that a militia should be kept constantly on foot to keep them in awe. During the dissolution of the assembly the militia laws expired; and the people, after complaining of the danger they were in from the negroes, formed a convention,\nAmerica, which enacted that each county should raise a quota for the defense of the province. Dunmore, on this, removed the powder from Williamsburg; which created such discontents, that an immediate quarrel would probably have ensued, had not the merchants of the town undertaken to obtain satisfaction for the injury supposed to be done to the community. This tranquility, however, was soon interrupted; the people, alarmed by a report that an armed party were on their way from the man of war where the powder had been deposited, assembled in arms, and determined to oppose by force any farther removals. In some of the conferences which passed at this time, the governor let fall some unguarded expressions, such as threatening them with setting up the royal standard, proclaiming liberty to the negroes, destroying the town of Williamsburg, &c., which were afterwards made public, and exaggerated in such a manner as greatly to increase the public ferment.\n\nThe people now held frequent assemblies. Some of them took up arms with a design to force the governor to restore the powder, and to take the public money into their own possession; but on their way to Williamsburg for this purpose, they were met by the receiver-general, who became security for the payment of the gunpowder, and the inhabitants promised to take care of the magazine and public revenue.\n\nBy this intercession the governor was so much intimidated, that he sent his family on board a man of war. He himself, however, issued a proclamation, in which he declared the behaviour of the person who promoted the tumult treasonable, accused the people of disaffection, &c. On their part they were by no means deficient in recrimination; and some letters of his to Britain being about the same time discovered, consequences ensued extremely similar to those which had been occasioned by those of Mr Hutchinson at Boston.\n\nIn this state of confusion the governor thought it necessary to fortify his palace with artillery, and procure a party of marines to guard it. Lord North's conciliatory proposal arriving also about the same time, he used his utmost endeavours to cause the people comply with it. The arguments he used were such as must do him honour; and had not matters already gone to such a pitch of irritation, it is highly probable that some attention would have been paid to them. \"The view (he said) in which the colonies ought to behold this conciliatory proposal, was no more than an earnest admonition from Great Britain to relieve her wants; that the utmost confidence had been used in the mode of application; no determinate sum having been fixed, as it was thought most worthy of British generosity to take what they thought could be conveniently spared, and likewise to leave the mode of raising it to themselves,\" &c. But the clamour and dissatisfaction were now universal, that nothing else could be attended to. The governor had called an assembly for the purpose of laying this conciliatory proposal before them; but it had been little attended to. The assembly began their session by inquiries into the state of the magazine. It had been broken into by some of the townsmen; for which reason spring-guns had been placed there by the governor, which discharged themselves upon the offenders at their entrance: these circumstances, with others of a similar kind, raised such a violent uproar, that as soon as the preliminary business of the session was over, the governor retired on board a man of war, informing the assembly that he durst no longer trust himself on shore. This produced a long course of disputation, which ended in a positive refusal of the governor to trust himself again in Williamsburg, even to give his assent to the bills, which could not be passed without it, and though the assembly offered to bind themselves for his personal safety. In his turn, he requested them to meet him on board the man of war, where he then was; but this proposal was rejected, and all further correspondence containing the least appearance of friendship was discontinued.\n\nLord Dunmore, thus deprived of his government, attempted to reduce by force those whom he could not reduce longer govern. Some of the most strenuous adherents to the British cause, whom their zeal had rendered obnoxious at home, now repaired to him. He was also joined by numbers of black slaves. With these and the assistance of the British shipping, he was for some time enabled to carry on a kind of predatory war, sufficient to hurt and exasperate, but not to subdue. After some inconceivable attempts on land, proclaiming liberty to the slaves, and setting up the royal standard, he took up his residence at Norfolk, a maritime town of some consequence, where the people were better affected to Britain than in most other places. A considerable force, however, was collected against him; but is and the natural impetuosity of his temper prompting tirelessly him to act against them with more courage than caution, he was entirely defeated, and obliged to retire to his shipping, which was now crowded by the number of those who had incurred the resentment of the provincials.\n\nIn the mean time a scheme of the utmost magnitude Mr Conolly and importance was formed by one Mr Conolly, a Pennsylvanian of an intrepid and aspiring disposition, and for refusing attached to the cause of Britain. The first step of this Virginia plan was to enter into a league with the Ohio Indians. This he communicated to Lord Dunmore, and it received his approbation: Upon which Conolly set out, and actually succeeded in his design. On his return he was despatched to General Gage, from whom he received a colonel's commission, and set out in order to accomplish the remainder of his scheme. The plan in general was, that he should return to the Ohio, where, by the assistance of the British and Indians in these parts, he was to penetrate through the back settlements into Virginia, and join Lord Dunmore at Alexandria. But by an accident very naturally to be expected, he was discovered, taken prisoner, and thrown into a dungeon.\n\nAfter the retreat of Lord Dunmore from Norfolk, that place was taken possession of by the provincials, who treated the loyalists that had remained there with great cruelty; at the same time that they greatly disturbed those on board Lord Dunmore's fleet, by refusing to supply them with any necessaries. Nor was cruelty of this all; the vicinity of the shipping was so great as the Americans to afford the riflemen an opportunity of aiming at the people on board, and exercising the cruel occupation of killing them, in which they did not fail every day to employ themselves. These proceedings at last drew a remonstrance from his lordship; in which he insisted that the fleet should be furnished with necessaries, and that...\nthat the soldiers should desist from the cruel diversion above mentioned; but both these requests being denied, a resolution was taken to let fire to the town. After giving the inhabitants proper warning, a party landed, under cover of a man of war, and let fire to that part which lay nearest the shore; but the flames were observed at the same time to break forth in every other quarter, and the whole town was reduced to ashes. This universal destruction, by which a loss of more than 300,000l. was incurred, is said to have been occasioned by order of the congress itself, that the loyalists might find no refuge there for the future.\n\nIn the southern colonies of Carolina the governors were expelled and obliged to take refuge on board of men of war, as Lord Dunmore had been; Mr. Martin, governor of North Carolina, on a charge of attempting to raise the back settlers, consisting chiefly of Scots Highlanders, against the colony. Having secured themselves against any attempts from these enemies, however, they proceeded to regulate their internal concerns in the same manner as the rest of the colonies; and by the end of the year 1775, Britain beheld the whole of America united against her in the most determined opposition. Her vast possessions of that tract of land (since known by the name of the Thirteen United States) were now reduced to the single town of Boston; in which her forces were besieged by an enemy with whom they were apparently not able to cope, and by whom they must of course expect in a very short time to be expelled. The situation of the inhabitants of Boston, indeed, was peculiarly unhappy. After having failed in their attempts to leave the town, General Gage had consented to allow them to retire with their effects; but afterwards, for what reason does not well appear, he refused to fulfil his promise. When he resigned his place to General Howe in October 1775, the latter, apprehensive that they might give intelligence of the situation of the British troops, strictly prohibited any person from leaving the place under pain of military execution. Thus matters continued till the month of March 1776, when the town was evacuated.\n\nOn the 2d of that month, General Washington opened a battery on the west side of the town, from whence it was bombarded with a heavy fire of cannon at the same time; and three days after, it was attacked by another battery from the eastern shore. This terrible attack continued for 14 days without intermission; when General Howe, finding the place no longer tenable, determined if possible to drive the enemy from their works. Preparations were therefore made for a most vigorous attack on a hill called Dorchester Neck, which the Americans had fortified in such a manner as would in all probability have rendered the enterprise next to desperate. No difficulties, however, were sufficient to daunt the spirit of the general; and everything was in readiness, when a sudden storm prevented this intended exertion of British valour. Next day, upon a more close inspection of the works they were to attack, it was thought advisable to desist from the enterprise altogether. The fortifications were very strong, and extremely well provided with artillery; and besides other implements of destruction, upwards of 100 hogheads of stones were provided to roll down upon the enemy as they came up; which, as the ascent was extremely steep, must have done prodigious execution.\n\nNothing therefore now remained but to think of a retreat; and even this was attended with the utmost difficulty and danger. The Americans, however, knowing that it was in the power of the British general to reduce the town to ashes, which could not have been repaired in many years, did not think proper to give the least molestation; and for the space of a fortnight the troops were employed in the evacuation of the place, from whence they carried along with them 2000 of the inhabitants, who durst not stay on account of their attachment to the British cause. From Boston they sailed to Halifax; but all their vigilance could not prevent a number of valuable ships from falling into the hands of the enemy. A considerable quantity of cannon and ammunition had also been left at Bunker's Hill and Boston Neck; and in the town an immense variety of goods, principally woollen and linen, of which the provincials stood very much in need. The estates of those who fled to Halifax were confiscated; as also those who were attached to government, and had remained in the town. As an attack was expected as soon as the British forces should arrive, every method was employed to render the fortifications, already very strong, impregnable. For this purpose some foreign engineers were employed, who had before arrived at its fortifications; and so eager were people of all ranks to accomplish this business, that every able-bodied man in the place, without distinction of rank, set apart two days in the week, to complete it sooner.\n\nThe Americans, exasperated to the utmost by the Congress proceedings of parliament, now formally renounced all claims to the connexion with Britain, and declared themselves independent. This celebrated declaration was published on the 4th of July 1776. Previous to this a circular letter had been sent through each colony, stating the reasons for it; and such was the animosity now everywhere prevailing against Great Britain, that it met with universal approbation, except in the province of Maryland alone. It was not long, however, before the people of that colony, finding themselves left in a very dangerous minority, thought proper to accede to the measures of the rest. The manifesto itself was much in the usual style, stating a long list of grievances, for which redress had been often applied in vain; and for these reasons they determined on a final separation; to hold the people of Britain as the rest of mankind, \"enemies in war, in peace friends.\"\n\nAfter thus publicly throwing off all allegiance and hope of reconciliation, the colonists soon found that an exertion of all their strength was required in order to support their pretensions. Their arms, indeed, had not, during this season, been attended with success, in Canada. Reinforcements had been promised to Colonel Arnold, who still continued the blockade of Quebec; but they did not arrive in time to second his operations. Being sensible, however, that he must either desist from the enterprise, or finish it successfully, he recommenced in form; attempting to burn the ship-ropes, and even to storm the town itself. They were unsuccessful, however, by reason of the smallness of their number, though they succeeded so far as to burn a number of houses in the suburbs; and the garrison were...\nwere obliged to pull down the remainder, in order to prevent the fire from spreading.\n\nAs the provincials, though unable to reduce the town, kept the garrison in continual alarms, and in a very disagreeable situation, some of the nobility collected themselves into a body under the command of one Mr Beaujeu, in order to relieve their capital; but they were met on their march by the provincials, and so entirely defeated, that they were never afterwards able to attempt any thing. The Americans, however, had but little reason to plume themselves on this success. Their want of artillery at last convinced them, that it was impracticable in their situation to reduce a place so strongly fortified; the smallpox at the same time made its appearance in their camp, and carried off great numbers; intimidating the rest to such a degree, that they deserted in crowds. To add to their misfortunes, the British reinforcements unexpectedly appeared, and the ships made their way through the ice with such celerity, that the one part of their army was separated from the other; and General Carleton falling out as soon as the reinforcement was landed, obliged them to fly with the utmost precipitation, leaving behind them all their cannon and military stores; at the same time that their shipping was entirely captured by vessels sent up the river for that purpose. On this occasion the provincials fled with such precipitation that they could not be overtaken; so that none fell into the hands of the British excepting the sick and wounded. General Carleton now gave a signal instance of his humanity: Being well apprised that many of the provincials had not been able to accompany the rest in their retreat, and that they were concealed in woods, &c. in a very deplorable situation, he generously issued a proclamation, ordering proper persons to seek them out, and give them relief at the public expense; at the same time, lest, through fear of being made prisoners, they should refuse these offers of humanity, he promised, that, as soon as their situation enabled them, they should be at liberty to depart to their respective homes.\n\nThe British general, now freed from any danger of an attack, was soon enabled to act offensively against the provincials, by the arrival of the forces destined for that purpose from Britain. By these he was put at the head of 12,000 regular troops, among whom were those of Brunswick. With this force he instantly set out to the Three Rivers, where he expected that Arnold would have made a stand; but he had fled to Sorel, a place 150 miles distant from Quebec, where he was, at last met by the reinforcements ordered by congress. Here, though the preceding events were by no means calculated to inspire much military ardour, a very daring enterprise was undertaken; and this was, to surprise the British troops posted here under Generals Fraser and Nefbit; of whom the former commanded those on land, the latter such as were on board of transports and were but a little way distant. The enterprise was undoubtedly very hazardous, both on account of the strength of the parties against whom they were to act, and as the main body of the British forces was advanced within 50 miles of the place; besides that a number of armed vessels and transports with troops lay between them and the Three Rivers. Two thousand chosen men, however, under General Thomson, engaged in this enterprise. Their success was America by no means answerable to their spirit and valour. Though they passed the shipping without being observed, General Fraser had notice of their landing; and General thus being prepared to receive them, they were soon defeated into disorder, at the same time that General and taken Nefbit, having landed his forces, prepared to attack prisoner by them in the rear. On this occasion some field pieces did prodigious execution, and a retreat was found to be unavoidable. General Nefbit, however, had got between them and their boats; so that they were obliged to take a circuit through a deep swamp, while they were hotly pursued by both parties at the same time, who marched for some miles on each side of the swamp, till at last the miserable provincials were sheltered from further danger by a wood at the end of the swamp. Their general, however, was taken, with 200 of his men.\n\nBy this disaster the provincials lost all hopes of accomplishing anything in Canada. They demolished their works, and carried off their artillery with the utmost expedition. They were pursued, however, by General Burgoyne; against whom it was expected that they would have collected all their force, and made a resolute stand. But they were now too much dispirited by misfortune, to make any further exertions of valour. On the 18th of June the British general arrived at Fort St John's, which he found abandoned and burnt. Chamblee had shared the same fate, as well as all the vessels that were not capable of being dragged up against the current of the river. It was thought that they would have made some resistance at Nut Island, the entrance to Lake Champlain; but this also they had abandoned, and retreated across the lake to Crown Point, whither they could not be immediately followed.\n\nThus was the province of Canada entirely evacuated by the Americans; whose loss in their retreat from Quebec was not calculated at less than 1000 men; of whom 400 fell at once into the hands of the enemy at a place called the Cedars, about 50 miles above Montreal. General Sullivan, however, who conducted this retreat after the affair of General Thomson, was acknowledged to have had great merit in what he did, and received the thanks of congress accordingly.\n\nThis bad success in the north, however, was somewhat compensated by what happened in the southern colonies.—We have formerly taken notice that Mr Martin, governor of North Carolina, had been obliged to leave his province and take refuge on board a man-of-war. Notwithstanding this, he did not despair of reducing it again to obedience. For this purpose he applied to the Regulators, a daring set of banditti, who lived in a kind of independent state; and though considered by government as rebels, yet had never been molested, on account of their numbers and known skill in the use of fire-arms. To the chiefs of these people commissions were sent, in order to raise some regiments; and Colonel Macdonald, a brave and enterprising officer, was appointed to command them. In the month of February he erected the king's standard, issued proclamations, &c. and collected some forces, expecting to be soon joined by a body of regular troops, who were known to be shipped from Britain to act against the southern colonies. The Americans, sensible of their danger, despatched immediately what forces they\nthey had to act against the royalists, at the same time that they diligently exerted themselves to support these with suitable reinforcements. Their present force was commanded by a General Moore, whose numbers were inferior to Macdonald; for which reason the latter summoned him to join the king's standard under pain of being treated as a rebel. But Moore, being well provided with cannon, and conscious that nothing could be attempted against him, returned the compliment, by acquainting Colonel Macdonald, that if he and his party would lay down their arms, and subscribe an oath of fidelity to congress, they should be treated as friends; but if they persisted in an undertaking for which it was evident they had not sufficient strength, they could not but expect the severest treatment. In a few days General Moore found himself at the head of 8000 men, by reason of the continual supplies which daily arrived from all parts. The royal party amounted only to 2000, and they were destitute of artillery, which prevented them from attacking the enemy while they had the advantage of numbers. They were now therefore obliged to have recourse to a desperate exertion of personal valour; by dint of which they effected a retreat for 80 miles to Moore's Creek, within 16 miles of Wilmington. Could they have gained this place, they expected to have been joined by Governor Martin and General Clinton, who had lately arrived with a considerable detachment. But Moore with his army pursued them so closely, that they were obliged to attempt the passage of the creek itself, though a considerable body of the enemy, under the command of Colonel Cofwell, with fortifications well planted with cannon, was posted on the other side. On attempting the creek, however, it was found not to be fordable. They were obliged therefore to cross over a wooden bridge which the provincials had not time to destroy entirely. They had, however, by pulling up part of the planks, and greasing the remainder in order to render them slippery, made the passage difficult, that the royalists could not attempt it. In this situation they were, on the 27th of February, attacked by Moore, with his superior army, and totally defeated with the loss of their general and most of their leaders, as well as the best and bravest of their men.\n\nThus was the power of the provincials established in North Carolina. Nor were they less successful in the province of Virginia; where Lord Dunmore, having long continued an useless predatory war, was at last driven from every creek and road in the province. The people he had on board were disfranchised to the highest degree by confinement in small vessels. The heat of the season, and the numbers crowded together, produced a pestilential fever, which made great havoc, especially among the blacks. At last, finding themselves in the utmost hazard of perishing by famine as well as by disease, they let fire to the least valuable of their vessels, reserving only about 50 for themselves, in which they bade a final adieu to Virginia, some failing to Florida, some to Bermuda, and the rest to the West Indies.\n\nIn South Carolina the provincials had a more formidable enemy to deal with. A squadron, whose object was the reduction of Charlestown, had been fitted out in December 1775; but by reason of unfavourable weather did not reach Cape Fear in North Carolina till the mouth of May 1776: and here it met with further obstacles till the end of the month. Thus the Americans, always noted for their alertness in raising fortifications, had time to strengthen those of Charlestown in such a manner as rendered it extremely difficult to be attacked. The British squadron consisted of two 50 gun ships, four of 30 guns, two of 20, an armed schooner and bomb-ketch; all under the command of Sir Peter Parker. The land forces were commanded by Lord Cornwallis, with Generals Clinton and Vaughan. As they had yet no intelligence of the evacuation of Boston, General Howe despatched a vessel to Cape Fear with some instructions; but it was too late; and in the beginning of June the squadron anchored off Charlestown bar. Here they met with some difficulty in crossing, being obliged to take out the guns from the two large ships, which were, notwithstanding, several times in danger of sticking fast. The next obstacle was a strong fort on Sullivan's Island, six miles east from Charlestown; which, though not completely finished, was very strong. However, the British generals resolved without hesitation to attack it; but though an attack was easy from the sea, it was very difficult to obtain a cooperation of the land forces. This was attempted by landing them on Long Island, adjacent to Sullivan's Island on the east, from which it is separated by a very narrow creek, said not to be above two feet deep at low water. Opposite to this ford the provincials had posted a strong body of troops, with cannon and intrenchments; while General Lee was posted on the main land, with a bridge of boats between that and Sullivan's Island, so that he could at pleasure send reinforcements to the troops in the fort on Sullivan's Island.\n\nOn the part of the British, so many delays occurred, that it was the 28th of June before matters were in readiness for an attack; and by this time the provincials had abundantly provided for their reception. On the morning of that day the bomb-ketch began to throw shells into Fort Sullivan, and about mid-day the two 50 gun ships, and 30 gun frigates came up and began a severe fire. Three other frigates were ordered to take their station between Charlestown and the fort, in order to enflame the batteries, and cut off the communication with the main land; but through the ignorance of the pilots they all struck fast; and though two of them were disentangled, they were found to be totally unfit for service: the third was burnt that the might not fall into the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe attack was therefore confined to the five armed ships and bomb-ketch, between whom and the fort a dreadful fire ensued. The Bristol suffered excessively. The springs on her cable being shot away, she was for some time entirely exposed to the enemy's fire. As the enemy poured in great quantities of red-hot balls, she was twice in flames. The captain (Mr Morris), after receiving five wounds, was obliged to go below deck in order to have his arm amputated. After undergoing this operation he returned to his place, where he received another wound, but still refused to quit his station: at last he received a red-hot ball in his belly, which instantly put an end to his life. Of all the officers and seamen who stood on the quarter-deck of this vessel, not one escaped without a wound excepting Sir Peter Parker alone; whose intrepidity and presence...\npreference of mind on this occasion was very remarkable.\n\nThe engagement lasted till darkness put an end to it. Little damage was done by the British, as the works of the enemy lay so low that many of the shot flew over; and the fortifications, being composed of palm-trees mixed with earth, were extremely well calculated to resist the impression of cannon. During the height of the attack, the provincial batteries remained for some time silent, so that it was concluded that they had been abandoned; but this was found to proceed only from want of powder; for as soon as a supply of this necessary article was obtained, the firing was resumed as brisk as before. During the whole of this desperate engagement it was found impossible for the land forces to give the least assistance to the fleet. The enemy's works were found to be much stronger than they had been imagined, and the depth of water effectually prevented them from making any attempt. In this unsuccessful attack the killed and wounded on the part of the British amounted to about 200. The British and Experiment were so much damaged, that it was thought they could not have been got over the bar; however, this was at last accomplished by a very great exertion of naval skill, to the surprise of the provincials, who had expected to make them both prizes.\n\nOn the American side the loss was judged to have been very considerable, as most of their guns were dismounted, and reinforcements had poured into the fort during the whole time of the action.\n\nThis year also, the Americans, having so frequently made trial of their valour by land, became desirous of trying it by sea also, and of forming a navy that might in some measure be able to protect their trade, and do essential hurt to the enemy. In the beginning of March Commodore Hopkins was despatched with five frigates to the Bahama islands, where he made himself master of the ordnance and military stores; but the gunpowder, which had been the principal object, was removed. On his return he captured several vessels; but was foiled in his attempt on the Glasgow frigate, which found means to escape notwithstanding the efforts of his whole squadron.\n\nThe time, however, was now come when the fortitude and patience of the Americans were to undergo a severe trial. Hitherto they had been on the whole successful in their operations; but now they were doomed to experience misfortune, misery, and disgrace; the enemy overrunning their country, and their own armies not able to face them in the field. The province of New York, as being the most central colony, and most accessible by sea, was pitched upon for the object of the main attack. The force sent against it consisted of 6 ships of the line, 30 frigates, besides other armed vessels, and a vast number of transports. The fleet was commanded by Lord Howe, and the land forces by his brother General Howe, who was now at Halifax. The latter, however, a considerable time before his brother arrived, had set sail from Halifax, and lay before New York, but without attempting to commence hostilities until he should be joined by his brother. The Americans had, according to custom, fortified New York, and the adjacent islands, in an extraordinary manner. However, General Howe was about the middle of July, Lord Howe arrived with the grand armament; and being one of the commissioners appointed to receive the submission of the colonists, he published a circular letter to this purpose to the several governors who had lately been expelled from their provinces, desiring them to make the extent of his commission, and the powers he was invested with by parliament, as public as possible. Here, however, congress saved him trouble, by ordering his letter and declaration to be published in all the newspapers, that every one, as they said, might see the infidelity of the British ministry, and that they had nothing to trust to besides the exertion of their own valour.\n\nLord Howe next sent a letter to General Washington; but as it was directed \"To George Wallington, Washington-Eq,\" the General refused to accept of it, as not being directed in the style suitable to his station. To a letter from Lord Howe obviating this objection, Adjutant-general Paterson was Howe sent with another letter, directed \"To George Washington, &c., &c., &c.\" But though a very polite reception was given the bearer, General Washington utterly refused the letter; nor could any explanation of the adjutant induce him to accept of it. The only interesting part of the conversation was that relating to the powers of the commissioners, of which Lord Howe was one. The adjutant told him, that these powers were very extensive; that the commissioners were determined to exert themselves to the utmost, in order to bring about a reconciliation; and that he hoped the general would consider this visit as a step towards it. General Washington replied, That it did not appear that these powers conferred in anything else than granting pardons; and as America had committed no offence, she asked no forgiveness, and was only defending her unquestionable rights.\n\nThe decision of every thing being now, by consent of both parties, left to the sword, no time was lost, commence but hostilities commenced as soon as the British troops could be collected. This, however, was not done before the month of August; when they landed without any opposition on Long Island, opposite to the shore of Staten Island. General Putnam, with a large body situation of troops, lay encamped and strongly fortified on a of the Peninsula on the opposite shore, with a range of hills between the armies, the principal part of which was near a place called Flat-bush. Here the centre of the British army, consisting of Hessians, took post; the left wing, under General Grant, lying near the shore; and the right, consisting of the greater part of the British forces, lay under Lord Percy, Cornwallis, and General Clinton. Putnam had ordered the passes to be secured by large detachments, which was executed as to those at hand; but one of the utmost importance, that lay at a distance, was entirely neglected. This gave an opportunity to a large body of troops under Lord Percy and Clinton to pass the mountains and attack the Americans in the rear, while they were engaged with the Hessians in front. Through this piece of negligence their defeat became inevitable. Those who were engaged with the Hessians first perceived their mistake, and began a retreat towards their camp; but the passage was intercepted by the British troops, who drove them back into the woods. Here they were met by the Hessians; and thus were they for many hours slaughtered between the two parties, no way\nway of escape remaining but by breaking through the British troops, and thus regaining their camp. In this attempt many perished; and the right wing, engaged with General Grant, shared the same fate. The victory was complete; and the Americans lost on this fatal day (August 27th) between 3000 and 4000 men, of whom 2000 were killed in the battle or pursuit. Among these a regiment, consisting of young gentlemen of fortune and family in Maryland, was almost entirely cut in pieces, and of the survivors not one escaped without a wound.\n\nThe ardour of the British troops was now so great, that they could scarcely be restrained from attacking the lines of the provincials; but for this there was now no occasion, as it was certain they could not be defended. Of the British only 61 were killed in this engagement, and 257 wounded. Eleven hundred of the enemy, among whom were three generals, were taken prisoners.\n\nAs none of the American commanders thought it proper to risk another attack, it was resolved to abandon their camp as soon as possible. Accordingly on the night of the 29th of August, the whole of the continental troops were ferried over with the utmost secrecy and silence; so that in the morning the British had nothing to do but take possession of the camp and artillery which had been abandoned.\n\nThis victory, though complete, was very far from being so decisive as the conquerors imagined. Lord Howe, supposing that it would be sufficient to intimidate the congress into some terms, sent General Sullivan, who had been taken prisoner in the late action, to congress, with a message, importing, that though he could not confidently treat with them as a legal assembly, yet he would be very glad to confer with any of the members in their private capacity; setting forth at the same time the nature and extent of his powers as commissioner. But the congress were not as yet sufficiently humbled to derogate in the least from the dignity of character they had assumed. They replied, That the congress of the free and independent states of America could not confidently fend any of its members in another capacity than that which they had publicly assumed; but as they were extremely desirous of restoring peace to their country upon equitable conditions, they would appoint a committee of their body to wait upon him, and learn what proposals he had to make.\n\nThis produced a new conference. The committee appointed by congress was composed of Dr Franklin, Mr Adams, and Mr Rutledge. They were very politely received by his lordship; but the conference proved as fruitless as before independency had been declared, and the final answer of the deputies was, That they were extremely willing to enter into any treaty with Great Britain that might conduce to the good of both nations, but that they would not treat in any other character than that of independent states. This enervating declaration instantly put an end to all hopes of reconciliation; and it was resolved to prosecute the war with the utmost vigour. Lord Howe, after publishing a manifesto, in which he declared the refusal of congress, and that he himself was willing to confer with all well-disposed persons about the means of restoring public tranquillity, set about the most proper methods for reducing the city of New York. Here the provincial troops were posted, and from a great number of batteries kept continually annoying the British shipping. The East River lay between them, of about 1200 yards in breadth, which the British troops were extremely desirous of passing. At last the ships having, after an incessant cannonade of several days, silenced the most troublesome batteries, a body of troops was sent up the river to a bay, about three miles distant, where the fortifications were less strong than in other places. Here having driven off the provincials by the cannon of the fleet, they marched directly towards the city; but the enemy, finding that they should now be attacked on all sides, abandoned the city, and retired to the New York north of the island, where their principal force was collected. In their passage thither they skirmished with the British, but carefully avoided a general engagement; and it was observed that they did not behave with that ardour and impetuous valour which had hitherto marked their character.\n\nThe British and provincial armies were now situated above two miles distant from each other. The former of the British encamped from thence to thence for an extent of two American miles, being the breadth of the island, which, though armies, is miles long, exceeds not two in any part in breadth. The provincials, who lay directly opposite, had strengthened their camp with many fortifications; at the same time, being masters of all the passes and defiles betwixt the two camps, they were enabled to defend themselves against an army much more numerous than their own; and they had also strongly fortified a pass called King's Bridge, whence they could secure a passage to the continent in case of any misfortune. Here General Washington, in order to incure the provincials to actual service, and at the same time to annoy the enemy as much as possible, employed his troops in continual skirmishes; by which it was observed that they soon recovered their spirits, and behaved with their usual boldness.\n\nAs the situation of the two armies was now highly inconvenient for the British generals, it was resolved to make such movements as might oblige General Washington to relinquish his strong situation. The possession of New York had been less beneficial than was expected. It had been concerted among the provincials, that the city should be burnt at the time of evacuation; but as they were forced to depart with precipitation, they were prevented from putting the scheme into execution. In a few days, however, it was New York attempted by some who had been left behind for that purpose. Taking advantage of a high wind and dry weather, the town was set on fire in several places at once, by means of combustibles properly placed for that purpose; and notwithstanding the most active exertions of the soldiery and sailors, a fourth part of the city was consumed.\n\nOn this occasion the British were irritated to the highest degree; and many persons, said to be incendiaries, were without mercy thrown into the flames. It was determined to force the provincial army to a greater distance, that they might have it less in their power, by any emissaries, to engage others in a similar attempt. For this purpose, General Howe having left Lord Percy with sufficient force to garrison New York, he embarked his army in flat-bottomed boats, by which they\nthey were conveyed through the dangerous passage called Hell Gate, and landed near the town of West Chester, lying on the continent towards Connecticut. Here, having received a supply of men and provisions, they moved to New Rochelle, situated on the sound which separates Long Island from the continent. After this, receiving still fresh reinforcements, they made such movements as threatened to distress the provincials very much, by cutting off their convoys of provisions from Connecticut, and thus force them to an engagement. This, however, General Washington determined at all events to avoid. He therefore extended his forces into a long line opposite to the way in which the enemy marched, keeping the Bruna, a river of considerable magnitude, between the two armies, with the North River on his rear. Here again the provincials continued for some time to annoy and skirmish with the royal army, until at last, by some other manoeuvres, the British general found means to attack them advantageously at a place called the White Plains, and drove them from some of their posts. The victory on this occasion was much less complete than the former; however it obliged the provincials once more to shift their ground, and to retreat farther up the country. General Howe pursued for some time; but at last finding all his endeavours vain to bring the Americans to a pitched battle, he determined to give over such an useless chase, and employ himself in reducing the forts which the provincials still retained in the neighbourhood of New York. In this he met with the most complete success. The Americans, on the approach of the king's forces, retreated from King's Bridge into Fort Washington; and this, as well as Fort Lee, which lay in the neighbourhood, was quickly reduced, though the garrison made their escape. Thus the Jersey's were laid entirely open to the incursions of the British troops; and so fully were these provinces taken possession of by the royal army, that its winter quarters extended from New Brunswick to the river Delaware. Had any number of boats been at hand, it is probable that Philadelphia would now have fallen into their hands. All these, however, had been carefully removed by the Americans. In lieu of this enterprise, Sir Henry Clinton undertook an expedition to Rhode Island, and became master of it without losing a man. His expedition was also attended with this further advantage, that the American fleet under Commodore Hopkins was obliged to sail as far as possible up the river Providence, and thus remained entirely useless.\n\nThe same ill success continued to attend the Americans in other parts. After their expulsion from Canada, they had crossed the lake Champlain, and taken up their quarters at Crown Point, as we have already mentioned. Here they remained for some time in safety, as the British had no vessels on the lake, and consequently General Burgoyne could not pursue them. To remedy this deficiency, there was no possible method, but either to construct vessels on the spot, or take pieces some vessels already constructed, and drag them up the river into the lake. This, however, was effected in no longer a space than three months; and the British general, after incredible toil and difficulty, saw himself in possession of a great number of vessels, by which means he was enabled to pursue his enemies, and invade them in his turn. The labour undergone at this time by the sea and land forces must indeed have been prodigious; since there were conveyed over land, and dragged up the rapids of St Lawrence, no fewer than 30 large long boats, 400 batteaux, besides a vast number of flat-bottomed boats, and a gondola of 30 tons. The intent of the expedition was to push forward before winter to Albany, where the army would take up its winter quarters, and next spring effect a junction with that under General Howe, when it was not doubted that the united force and skill of these two commanders would speedily put a termination to the war.\n\nBy reason of the difficulties with which the equipment of this fleet had been attended, it was the beginning of October before the expedition could be undertaken. It was now, however, by every judge allowed to be completely able to answer the purpose for which it was intended. It consisted of one large vessel with three masts, carrying 18 twelve pounders; two schooners, the one carrying 14, the other 12 six pounders; a large flat-bottomed raudeau with 6 twenty-four and 6 twelve pounders; and a gondola with 8 nine pounders. Besides these were 20 vessels of a smaller size, called gun-boats, carrying each a piece of brass ordnance from 9 to 24 pounds, or howitzers. Several long-boats were fitted out in the same manner; and besides all these, there was a vast number of boats and tenders, of various sizes, to be used as transports for the troops and baggage. It was manned by a number of select seamen, and the guns were to be served by a detachment from the corps of artillery; the officers and soldiers appointed for this expedition were also chosen out of the whole army.\n\nTo oppose this formidable armament the Americans had only a very incon siderable force, commanded by naval force General Arnold; who, after engaging part of the British fleet for a whole day, took advantage of the darkness of the night to set sail without being perceived, and next morning was out of sight; but he was so hotly pursued by the British, that on the second day after he was overtaken, and forced to a second engagement. In this he behaved with great gallantry; but his force being very inferior to that of the enemy, he was obliged to run his ships ashore and set them on fire. A few only escaped to Lake George; and the garrison of Crown Point having destroyed or carried off everything of value, retired to Ticonderago. Thither General Carleton intended to have pursued them; but the difficulties he had to encounter appeared so many and so great, that it was thought proper to march back into Canada, and desist from any further operations till next spring.\n\nThus the affairs of the Americans seemed everywhere going to wreck; even those who had been most fanatics among them in their cause began to waver. The time, also, most eagerly desired for which the soldiers had enlisted themselves was now expired; and the bad success of the preceding campaign had been so very discouraging, that no person was willing to engage himself during the continuance of a war, of which the event seemed to be so doubtful. In consequence of this, therefore, General Washington found his army daily decreasing in strength; so that from 30,000, of whom it consisted when General Howe landed on Staten Island, scarce a tenth part could now be mustered. To assist the chief commander as much as\nGeneral Lee had collected a body of forces in the north; but on his way southward, having imprudently taking up his lodging at some distance from his troops, information was given to Colonel Harcourt, who happened at that time to be in the neighbourhood, and Lee was made prisoner. The loss of this general was much regretted, the more especially as he was of superior quality to any prisoner in the possession of the colonists, and could not therefore be exchanged. Six field officers were offered in exchange for him, and refused; and the congress was highly irritated as its being reported that he was to be treated as a defector, having been a half-pay officer in the British service at the commencement of the war. In consequence of this they issued a proclamation, threatening to retaliate on the prisoners in their possession whatever punishment should be inflicted on any of those taken by the British, and especially that their conduct should be regulated by the treatment of General Lee.\n\nIn the meantime they proceeded with the most indefatigable diligence to recruit their army, and bound their soldiers to serve for a term of three years, or during the continuance of the war. The army designed for the ensuing campaign was to consist of 88 battalions; of which each province was to contribute its quota; and 20 dollars were offered as a bounty to each soldier, besides an allotment of lands at the end of the war. In this allotment it was stipulated, that each soldier should have 100 acres; an ensign 150; a lieutenant 200; a captain 300; a major 400; a lieutenant-colonel 450; and a colonel 500. No lands were promised to those who enlisted only for three years. All officers or soldiers disabled through wounds received in the service were to enjoy half-pay during life. To defray the expense, congress borrowed five millions of dollars at five per cent.; for payment of which the United States became surety. At the same time, in order to animate the people to vigorous exertions, a declaration was published, in which they set forth the necessity there was for taking proper methods to ensure success in their cause; they endeavoured to palliate as much as possible the misfortunes which had already happened; and represented the true cause of the present distresses to be the short term of enlistment.\n\nThis declaration, together with the imminent danger of Philadelphia, determined the Americans to exert themselves to the utmost in order to reinforce General Washington's army. They soon received farther encouragement, however, by an exploit of that general against the Hessians. As the royal army extended in different cantonments for a great way, General Washington, perceiving the imminent danger to which Philadelphia was exposed, resolved to make some attempt on those divisions of the enemy which lay nearest that city. There happened to be the Hessians, who lay in three divisions, the last only 20 miles distant from Philadelphia. On the 25th of December, having collected as considerable a force as he could, he set out with an intent to surprise that body of the enemy who lay at Trenton. His army was divided into three bodies; one of which he ordered to cross the Delaware at Trenton Ferry, a little below the town; the second at a good distance below, at a place called Bordentown, where the second division of Hessians was placed; while he himself with the third, directing his course to a ferry some miles above Trenton, intended to have passed it at midnight, and attack the Hessians at break of day. But by reason of various impediments, it was eight in the morning before he could reach the place of his destination. The enemy, however, did not perceive his approach till they were suddenly attacked. Colonel Ralle, who commanded them, did all that could be expected from a brave and experienced officer; but every thing was in such confusion, that no efforts of valour or skill could now retrieve matters. The colonel himself was mortally wounded, his troops were entirely broken, their artillery seized, and about 1000 taken prisoners.\n\nThis action, though seemingly of no very decisive nature, was sufficient at that time to turn the fortune of war in favour of America. It tended greatly to lessen the fear which the provincials had of the Hessians, at the same time that it equally abated the confidence which the British had till now put in them. Reinforcements came into General Washington's army from all quarters; so that he was soon in a condition to leave Philadelphia, and take up his quarters at Trenton. Emboldened by his success, he determined to make another attempt on a division of the British forces stationed at Maidenhead, a town situated halfway between Trenton and Princeton. This consisted of three regiments under the command of Colonel Mawhood, an officer of great merit. The troops were surprised on their march; but though they were separately surrounded and attacked by a force so vastly superior, they charged the enemy so resolutely with their bayonets, that they effected a retreat. These attempts of the Americans, however, with the hostile disposition of the people, showed the impossibility of maintaining posts so far advanced in the enemy's country; so that it was resolved to retreat towards Brunswick, in order to prevent it, with the troops and magazines it contained, from falling into the hands of the provincials. General Washington lost no opportunity of recovering what had been lost; and by dividing his army into small parties, which could be reunited on a few hours warning, he in a manner entirely covered the country with it, and repopulated himself of all the important places.\n\nThus ended the campaign of 1776, with scarce any real advantage, other than the acquisition of the city of New York, and of a few fortresses in its neighbourhood; where the troops were constrained to act with as much circumspection as if they had been besieged by a victorious army, instead of being themselves the conquerors.\n\nThe army at New York began in 1777 to exercise a kind of predatory war, by sending out parties to destroy magazines, make incursions, and take or destroy such forts as lay on the banks of rivers, to which their great command of shipping gave them access. In this they were generally successful: the provincial magazines at Peek's Hill, a place about 50 miles distant from New York, were destroyed, the town of Dumbury in Connecticut burnt, and that of Ridgefield in the same province was taken possession of. In returning from the last expedition, however, the British were greatly harassed by the enemy under Generals Arnold, Wooster, and Sullivan; but they made good their retreat in spite of all opposition, with the loss of only 170 killed.\nAmerica. killed and wounded. On the American side the loss was much greater; General Wooster was killed, and Arnold in the most imminent danger. On the other hand, the Americans destroyed the stores at Sag Harbor, in Long Island, and made prisoners of all who defended the place.\n\nAs this method of making war, however, could answer but little purpose, and favoured more of the barbarous incursions of savages than of a war carried on by a civilized people, it was resolved to make an attempt on Philadelphia. At first it was thought that this could be done through the Jerseys; but General Washington had received such large reinforcements, and posted himself so strongly, that it was found to be impracticable. Many stratagems were used to draw him from this strong situation, but without success; so that it was found necessary to make the attempt on Philadelphia by sea. While the preparations necessary for this expedition were going forward, the Americans found means to make amends for the capture of General Lee by that of General Preble, who was seized in his quarters with his aid-de-camp, in much the same manner as General Lee had been. This was exceedingly mortifying to the general himself, as he had not long ago set a price upon General Arnold himself, by offering a sum of money to any one that apprehended him; which the latter answered by setting a lower price upon General Preble.\n\nThe month of July was far advanced before the preparations for the expedition against Philadelphia were completed; and it was the 23rd before the fleet was able to sail from Sandy Hook. The force employed in this expedition consisted of 36 battalions of British and Hessians, a regiment of light horse, and a body of loyalists raised at New York. The remainder of these, with 17 battalions, and another body of light horse, was stationed at New York under Sir Henry Clinton. Seven battalions were stationed at Rhode Island. After a week's sailing they arrived at the mouth of the Delaware; but there received certain intelligence, that the navigation of the river was so effectually obstructed, that no possibility of forcing a passage remained. Upon this it was resolved to proceed farther southward to Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, from whence the distance to Philadelphia was not very great, and where the provincial army would find less advantage from the nature of the country than in the Jerseys.\n\nThe navigation from Delaware to Chesapeake took up the best part of the month of August, and that up the bay itself was extremely difficult and tedious. At last, having sailed up the river Elk as far as was practicable, the troops were landed without opposition, and set forward on their intended expedition. On the news of their arrival in Chesapeake, General Washington left the Jerseys, and hastened to the relief of Philadelphia; and in the beginning of September met the royal army at Brandywine Creek about mid-day, between the head of the Elk and Philadelphia. Here he adhered to his former method of skirmishing and harassing the royal army on its march; but as this proved insufficient to stop its progress, he retired to that side of the creek next to Philadelphia with an intent to dispute the passage. This brought on a general engagement on the 11th of September, in which the Americans were worsted through the superior discipline of the British troops; and it was only through the approach of night that they were saved from being entirely destroyed. On this occasion the provincials lost about 1000 killed and wounded, besides 400 taken prisoners.\n\nThe loss of this battle proved also the loss of Philadelphia. General Washington retired towards Lancaster, an inland town at a considerable distance from Philadelphia. Here, however, the British general took such measures as must have forced the provincials to a second engagement; but a violent rain, which lasted a day and a night, prevented his design. General Washington, though he could not prevent the loss of Philadelphia, still adhered to his original plan of defeating the royal party, by laying ambuscades and cutting off detached parties: but in this he was less successful than formerly; and one of his own detachments, consisting of 500 men, were themselves surrounded and entirely defeated, with the loss of 300 killed and wounded, besides a great number taken, and all their arms and baggage.\n\nGeneral Howe now perceiving that the Americans would not venture another battle even for the sake of their capital, took peaceable possession of it on the 26th of September. His first care was then to cut Philadelphi off, by means of strong batteries, the communication between the upper and lower parts of the river: which was executed notwithstanding the opposition of some American armed vessels; one of which, carrying 36 guns, was taken. His next task was to open a communication with it by sea; and this was a work of no small difficulty. A vast number of batteries and forts had been erected, and immense machines formed like chevaux de frise, from whence they took their name, sunk in the river to prevent its navigation. As the fleet was sent round to the mouth of the river in order to co-operate with the army, this work, however difficult, was accomplished; nor did the provincials give much opposition, as well knowing that all places of this kind were now untenable. General Washington, however, took the advantage of the royal army being divided to attack the camp of the principal division of it that lay at Germantown in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia. In this he met with very little success; for though he reached the place of destination by three o'clock in the morning, the patrols had time to call the troops to arms. The Americans, notwithstanding, made a very resolute attack; but they were received with such bravery, that they were compelled to abandon the attempt, and retreat in great disorder; with the advantage, however, of carrying off their cannon, though pursued for a considerable way, feated after having 300 killed, 600 wounded, and upwards of 400 taken prisoners, among whom were 54 officers. On the British side, the loss amounted to 430 wounded and prisoners, and 70 killed; but among the last were General Agnew and Colonel Bird, with some other excellent officers.\n\nThere still remained two strong forts on the Delaware to be reduced. These were Mud Island and Red Bank. The various obstructions which the Americans had thrown in the way rendered it necessary to bring up the Augusta, a ship of the line, and the Merlin frigate, to the attack of Mud Island; but during the heat of action both were grounded. Upon this\nAmerica. this the Americans sent down four fire-ships, and directed the whole fire from their galleys against them. The former were rendered ineffectual by the courage and skill of the British seamen; but during the engagement both the Augusta and Merlin took fire and were burnt to ashes, and the other ships obliged to withdraw. The enemy, encouraged by this unsuccessful attempt, proceeded to throw new obstructions in the way; but the British general having found means to convey a number of cannon and to erect batteries within gunshot of the fort by land, and bringing up three ships of the line which mounted heavy cannon, the garrison, after making a vigorous defence for one day, perceiving that preparations were making for a general assault on the next, abandoned the place in the night. Those who defended Red Bank followed their example, and abandoned it on the approach of Lord Cornwallis. A great number of the American flotilla now finding themselves entirely destitute of any protection, sailed up the river in the night time. Seventeen however remained, whose retreat was intercepted by a frigate and some armed vessels; on which the Americans ran them ashore and burnt them, to prevent their falling into the enemy's hands.\n\nThus the campaign of 1777 in Pennsylvania concluded successfully on the part of the British. In the north, however, matters wore a different aspect. The expedition in that quarter had been projected by the British ministry as the most effectual method that could be taken to crush the colonies at once. The four provinces of New England had originally begun the confederacy against Britain, and were still considered as the most active in the continuation of it; and it was thought, that any impression made upon them, would contribute in an effectual manner to the reduction of all the rest. For this purpose, an army of 4000 chosen British troops and 3000 Germans was put under the command of General Burgoyne; General Carleton was directed to use his influence with the Indians to persuade them to join in this expedition; and the province of Quebec was to furnish large parties to join in the same. The officers who commanded under General Burgoyne were General Philips of the artillery, Generals Fraser, Powell, and Hamilton, with the German officers Generals Reidefeld and Specht. The soldiers, as has already been observed, were all excellently disciplined, and had been kept in their winter-quarters with all imaginable care, in order to prepare them for the expedition on which they were going. To aid the principal expedition, another was projected on the Mohawk river under Colonel St Leger, who was to be assisted by Sir John Johnson, son to the famous Sir William Johnson, who had so greatly distinguished himself in the war of 1755.\n\nOn the 21st of June 1777, the army encamped on the western side of the lake Champlain; where being joined by a considerable body of Indians, General Burgoyne made a speech, in which he exhorted those new allies to lay aside their ferocious and barbarous manner of making war; to kill only such as opposed them in arms; and to spare prisoners, with such women and children as should fall into their hands. After issuing a proclamation, in which the force of Britain and that which he commanded was set forth in very ostentatious terms, the campaign opened with the siege of Ticonderoga. The place was very strong, and garrisoned by 6000 men under General Sinclair; nevertheless, the works were so extensive, that even this number was insufficient to defend them properly. They had therefore omitted to fortify a rugged eminence called Sugar Hill, the top of which overlooked and effectually commanded the whole works; vainly imagining that the difficulty of the ascent would be sufficient to prevent the enemy from taking possession of it. On the approach of the first division of the army, the provincials abandoned and set fire to their outworks; and expeditions were the British troops, that by the 5th of July every post was secured which was judged necessary for investing it completely. A road was soon after made to the very summit of that eminence which the Americans had with such confidence supposed could not be ascended; and so much were they now disheartened, that they instantly abandoned the fort entirely, taking the road to Skeneborough, a place to the south of Lake George; while their baggage, with what artillery and military stores they could carry off, were sent to the same place by water. But the British generals were determined not to let them pass so easily. Both were pursued, and both overtaken. Their armed vessels consisted only of five galleys; two of which were taken, and three blown up; on which they set fire to their boats and fortifications at Skeneborough. On this occasion the provincials lost 200 boats, 130 pieces of cannon, with all their provisions and baggage. Their land forces under Colonel Francis made a brave defence against General Frazer; and being greatly superior in number, had almost overpowered him, when General Reidefeld with a large body of Germans came to his assistance. The enemy were now overpowered in their turn; and their commander being killed, they fled on all sides with great precipitation. In this action 200 Americans were killed, as many taken prisoners, and above 600 wounded, many of whom perished in the woods for want of assistance.\n\nDuring the engagement General Sinclair was at Cattletown, about six miles from the place; but instead of going forward to Fort Anne, the next place of strength, he repaired to the woods which lie between that fortress and New England. General Burgoyne, however, detached Colonel Hill with the ninth regiment, in order to intercept such as should attempt to retreat towards Fort Anne. On his way he met with a body of the enemy, said to be six times as numerous again as his own; but after an engagement of three hours defeated, and they were obliged to retire with great loss. After abandoning Fort Anne, they set fire to it, and retired to Fort Edward. In all these engagements the loss of killed and wounded in the royal army did not exceed 200 men.\n\nGeneral Burgoyne was now obliged to suspend his General operations for some time, and wait at Skeneborough for the arrival of his tents, provisions, &c., but employed himself in making roads through the country near St Anne, and in clearing a passage for his troops with great difficulty. This was attended with incredible toil; but all obstacles were surmounted with equal patience and resolution by the army. In short, after undergoing the utmost difficulty that could be undergone, and making every exertion that man could.\nAmerica could make, he arrived with his army before Fort Edward about the end of July. Here General Schuyler had been for some time endeavouring to recruit the shattered American forces, and had been joined by General Sinclair with the remains of his army; the garrison of Fort George also, situated on the lake of that name, had evacuated the place and retired to Fort Edward.\n\nBut on the approach of the royal army, they retired from thence also, and formed their headquarters at Saratoga. Notwithstanding the great successes of the British general, they showed not the least disposition to submit, but seemed only to consider how they might make the most effectual resistance. For this purpose, the militia was everywhere raised and drafted to join the army at Saratoga; and such numbers of volunteers were daily added, that they soon began to recover from the terror into which they had been thrown. That they might have a commander whose abilities could be relied on, General Arnold was appointed, who repaired to Saratoga with a considerable train of artillery; but receiving intelligence that Colonel St Leger was proceeding with great rapidity in his expedition on the Mohawk river, he removed to Still-water, a place about half way between Saratoga and the junction of the Mohawk and Hudson's river. The colonel, in the mean time, had advanced as far as Fort Stanwix; the siege of which he pressed with great vigour. On the 6th of August, understanding that a supply of provisions, escorted by 800 or 900 men, was on the way to the fort, he despatched Sir John Johnson with a strong detachment to intercept it. This he did so effectually, that, besides intercepting the provisions, 400 of its guard were slain, 200 taken, and the rest escaped with great difficulty. The garrison, however, were not to be intimidated by this disaster, nor by the threats or representations of the colonel; on the contrary, they made several successful forays under Colonel Willet, the second in command; and this gentleman, in company with another, even ventured out of the fort, and, eluding the vigilance of the enemy, passed through them in order to hasten the march of General Arnold to their assistance.\n\nThus the affairs of Colonel St Leger seemed to be in no very favourable situation, notwithstanding his late successes, and they were soon totally ruined by the defection of the Indians. They had been alarmed by the report of General Arnold's advancing with 2000 men to the relief of the fort; and while the colonel was attempting to give them encouragement, another report was spread, that General Burgoyne had been defeated with great slaughter, and was now flying before the provincials. On this he was obliged to do as they thought proper; and the retreat could not be effected without the loss of the tents and some of the artillery and military stores.\n\nGeneral Burgoyne, in the mean time, notwithstanding all the difficulties he had already sustained, found that he must still encounter more. The roads he had made with so much labour and pains were destroyed either by the wetness of the season or by the enemy; so that the provisions he brought from Fort George could not arrive at his camp without the most prodigious toil. On hearing of the siege of Fort Stanwix by Colonel St Leger, he determined to move forward, in hopes of enclosing the enemy betwixt his own army and that of St Leger, or of obtaining the command of all the country between Fort Stanwix and Albany; or at any rate, a junction with Colonel St Leger would be effected, which could not but be attended with the most happy consequences. The only difficulty was the want of provisions; and this it was proposed to remedy by reducing the provincial magazines at Bennington. For this purpose, Colonel Baum, a German officer of great bravery, was chosen, with a body of 500 attempt on men. The place was about twenty miles from Hudson's river; and to support Colonel Baum's party, the garrison marched up the river's bank, and encamped at Bennington, opposite to Saratoga, with the river betwixt it and that place. An advanced party was posted at Batten Kill, between the camp and Bennington, in order to support Colonel Baum. In their way the British seized a large supply of cattle and provisions, which were immediately sent to the camp; but the badness of the roads retarded their march so much, that intelligence of their design was sent to Bennington. Understanding now that the American force was greatly superior to his own, the colonel acquainted the general, who immediately despatched Colonel Breymann with a party to his affiance; but through the same causes that had retarded the march of Colonel Baum this affiance could not arrive in time. General Starke, in the mean time, who commanded at Bennington, determined to attack the two parties separately; and for this purpose advanced against Colonel Baum, whom Colonel Baum surrounded on all sides and attacked with the utmost violence. The troops defended themselves with extraordinary valour, but were to a man either killed or taken, and Colonel Breymann, after a desperate engagement, had taken the good luck to effect a retreat through the darkness of the night, which otherwise he could not have done, Colonel as his men had expended all their ammunition, being defeated.\n\nGeneral Burgoyne, thus disappointed in his attempt on Bennington, applied himself with indefatigable diligence to procure provisions from Fort George; and having at length amassed a sufficient quantity to last for a month, he threw a bridge of boats over the river Hudson, which he crossed about the middle of September, encamping on the hills and plains near Saratoga. As soon as he approached the provincial army, at this time encamped at Stillwater under General Gates, he determined to make an attack; for which purpose he put himself at the head of the central division of his army, having General Frazer and Colonel Breymann at the right, with Generals Reidefeld and Philips on the royal left. In this position he advanced towards the enemy my; on the 19th of September. But the Americans did not now wait to be attacked; on the contrary, they attacked the central division with the utmost violence; and it was not until General Philips with the artillery came up that they could be repulsed. On this occasion, though the British troops lost only 330 killed with great and wounded, and the enemy no fewer than 1500, the difficulty former were very much alarmed at the obstinate resolution shown by the Americans. This did not, however, prevent them from advancing towards the enemy, and posting themselves the next day within cannon-shot of their lines. But their allies the Indians began to desert in great numbers; and at the same time the ans defert.\ngeneral was in the highest degree mortified by having no intelligence of any assistance from Sir Henry Clinton, as had been stipulated. He now received a letter from him, by which he was informed that Sir Henry intended to make a diversion on the North River in his favour. This afforded but little comfort; however, he returned an answer by several truthful persons whom he despatched different ways, stating his present difficult situation, and mentioning that the provisions and other necessaries he had would only enable him to hold out till the 12th of October.\n\nIn the mean time the Americans, in order to cut off the retreat of the British army in the most effectual manner, undertook an expedition against Ticonderago; but were obliged to abandon the enterprise after having surprized all the outposts, and taking a great number of boats with some armed vessels, and a number of prisoners. The army under General Burgoyne, however, continued to labour under the greatest difficulties; so that in the beginning of October he had been obliged to diminish the soldiers allowance. On the 7th of that month he determined to move towards the enemy. For this purpose he sent a body of 1500 men to reconnoitre their left wing; intending, if possible, to break through it in order to effect a retreat. The detachment, however, had not proceeded far when a dreadful attack was made upon the left wing of the British army, which was with great difficulty prevented from being entirely broken by a reinforcement brought up by General Frater, who was killed in the attack. After the troops had with the most desperate efforts regained their camp, it was most furiously assaulted by General Arnold; who, notwithstanding all opposition, would have forced the intrenchments, had he not received a dangerous wound, which obliged him to retire. Thus the attack failed on the left, but on the right the camp of the German reserve was forced, Colonel Breymann killed, and his countrymen defeated with great slaughter, and the loss of all their artillery and baggage.\n\nThis was by far the heaviest loss the British army had sustained since the action at Bunker's Hill. The list of killed and wounded amounted to near 1200, exclusive of the Germans; but the greatest misfortune was, that the enemy had now an opening on the right rear of the British forces, so that the army was threatened with entire destruction. This obliged General Burgoyne once more to shift his position, that the enemy might also be obliged to alter theirs. This was accomplished on the night of the 7th, without any loss, and all the next day he continued to offer the enemy battle; but they were now too well assured of obtaining a complete victory, by cutting off all supplies from the British, to risk a pitched battle. Wherefore they advanced on the right side, in order to enclose him entirely; which obliged the general to direct a retreat towards Saratoga. But the enemy had now stationed a great force on the ford at Hudson's river, so that the only possibility of retreat was by securing a passage to Lake George; and to effect this, a body of workmen was detached, with a strong guard, to repair the roads and bridges that led to Fort Edward. As soon as they were gone, however, the enemy seemed to prepare for an attack; which rendered it necessary to recall the guard, and the workmen being of course left exposed could not proceed.\n\nIn the mean time, the boats which conveyed provisions down Hudson's river were exposed to the continual fire of the American marksmen, who took many of them; so that it became necessary to convey the provisions over land. In this extreme danger it was resolved to march by night to Fort Edward, forcing the passages at the fords either above or below the place; and in order to effect this the more easily, it was resolved that the soldiers should carry their provisions on their backs, leaving behind their baggage and every other incumbrance. But before this could be executed, intelligence was received that the enemy had raised strong intrenchments opposite to these fords, well provided with cannon, and that they had likewise taken possession of the rising ground between Fort George and Fort Edward, which in like manner was provided with cannon.\n\nAll this time the American army was increasing by the continual arrival of militia and volunteers from all stations of parts. Their parties extended all along the opposite bank of Hudson's river, and some had even passed it in order to observe the least movement of the British army. The whole force under General Gates was computed at 16,000 men, while the army under General Burgoyne scarcely amounted to 6000; and every part of the camp was reached by the grape and rifle shot of the enemy, besides a discharge from their artillery, which was almost incessant. In this state of extreme distress and danger, the army continued with the greatest constancy and perseverance till the evening of the 13th of October, when an inventory of provisions being taken, it was found that no more remained than what was sufficient to serve for three days; and a council of war being called, it was unanimously determined to capitulate; there was no method now remaining but to treat late with the enemy. In consequence of this, a negotiation was opened next day, which speedily terminated in the capitulation of the whole British army; the principal article of which was, that the troops were to have a free passage to Britain, on condition of not serving against America during the war. On this occasion, General Gates ordered his army to keep within their camp while the British soldiers went to a place appointed for them to lay down their arms, that the latter might not have the additional mortification of being made spectators of so melancholy an event. The number of those who surrendered at Saratoga amounted to 5750, according to the American accounts; the list of sick and wounded left in the camp when the army retreated to Saratoga, to 528; and the number of those lost by other accidents since the taking of Ticonderago, to near 3000. Thirty-five brass field-pieces, 7000 stand of arms, clothing for an equal number of soldiers, with the tents, military chest, &c., constituted the booty on this occasion.\n\nSir Henry Clinton, in the mean time, had failed up successful the North river, and destroyed the two forts called expedition Montgomery and Clinton, with Fort Constitution, and of Sir Henry another place called Continental Village, where were Clinton barracks for 2000 men. Seventy large cannon were carried away, besides a number of smaller artillery, and a great quantity of stores and ammunition; a large boom...\nAmerica. boom and chain reaching across the river from Fort Montgomery to a point of land called St Anthony's Nose, and which cost not less than £75,000 sterling, were partly destroyed and partly carried away, as was also another boom of little less value at Fort Constitution. The loss of the British army was but small in number, though some officers of great merit were killed in the different attacks.\n\nAnother attack was made by Sir James Wallace with some frigates, and a body of land forces under General Vaughan. The place which now suffered was named Elopus; the fortifications were destroyed, and the town itself was reduced to ashes, as that called Continental Village had been before.\n\nBut these successes, of whatever importance they might be, were now disfavored by both parties. They served only to irritate the Americans, flustered with their success; and they were utterly insufficient to raise the spirits of the British, who were now thrown into the utmost dismay.\n\nOn the 16th of March 1778, Lord North intimated to the house of commons, that a paper had been laid before the king by the French ambassador, intimating the conclusion of an alliance between the court of France and the United States of America. The preliminaries of this treaty had been concluded in the end of the year 1777, and a copy of them sent to congress, in order to counteract any proposals that might be made in the mean time by the British ministry. On the 6th of February 1778, the articles were formally signed, to the great satisfaction of the French nation.\n\nThey were in substance as follows:\n\n1. If Great Britain should, in consequence of this treaty, proceed to hostilities against France, the two nations should mutually assist one another.\n\n2. The main end of the treaty was in an effectual manner to maintain the independency of America.\n\n3. Should those places of North America still subject to Britain be reduced by the colonies, they should be confederated with them, or subjected to their jurisdiction.\n\n4. Should any of the West India islands be reduced by France, they should be deemed its property.\n\n5. No formal treaty with Great Britain should be concluded either by France or America without the consent of each other; and it was mutually engaged that they should not lay down their arms till the independence of the States had been formally acknowledged.\n\n6. The contracting parties mutually agreed to invite those powers that had received injuries from Great Britain to join the common cause.\n\n7. The United States guaranteed to France all the possessions in the West Indies which she should conquer; and France in her turn guaranteed the absolute independency of the States, and their supreme authority over every country they possessed, or might acquire during the war.\n\nThe mortification of such a treaty as this could not but be looked upon as a declaration of war. On its being announced to the house, every one agreed in an address to his majesty, promising to stand by him to the utmost in the present emergency; but it was warmly contended by the members in opposition, that the present ministry ought to be removed on account of their numberless blunders and miscarriages in every instance. Many were of opinion, that the only way to extricate the nation from its trouble was to acknowledge the independency of America at once; and thus we might still do with a good grace what must inevitably be done at last, after expending much more blood and treasure than had yet been lavished in this unhappy contest. The ministerial party, however, entertained different ideas. Influenced by zeal for the national honour, it was determined at once to resent the arrogance of France, and prosecute hostilities against America with more vigour than ever, should the terms now offered them be rejected.\n\nThe Americans, in the mean time, affidively employed their agents at the courts of Spain, Vienna, Prussia, and Turkey, in order, if possible, to conclude alliances with them, or at least to procure an acknowledgment of their independency. As it had been reported that Britain intended to apply for assistance to Russia, the American commissioners were enjoined to use their utmost influence with the German princes to prevent such auxiliaries from marching through their territories, and to endeavour to procure the recall of the German troops already sent to America. To France they offered a cession of such West India islands as should be taken by the united strength of France and America; and should Britain by their joint endeavours be dispossessed of Newfoundland, Cape Breton, and Nova Scotia, these territories should be divided between the two nations, and Great Britain be totally excluded from the fishery. The proposals to the Spanish court were, that in case they should think proper to espouse their quarrel, the American states should assist in reducing Pensacola under the dominion of Spain, provided their subjects were allowed the free navigation of the river Mississippi, and the use of the harbour of Pensacola; and they further offered, that if agreeable to Spain, they would declare war against Portugal, should that power expel the American ships from its ports.\n\nIn the mean time, the troops under General Burgoyne were preparing to embark for Britain according to the convention at Saratoga; but to their utter surprise, congress positively refused to allow them to embark, under pretence that some sinister designs were harboured on the part of Britain, and that they only wanted an opportunity to join the other troops at Philadelphia or New York.\n\nThe season for action was now approaching; and congress was indefatigable in its preparations for a new campaign, which it was confidently said would be the last. Among other methods taken for this purpose, it was recommended to all the young gentlemen of the colonies to form themselves into bodies of cavalry to serve at their own expense during the war. General Washington at the same time, in order to remove all encumbrances from his army, lightened the baggage as much as possible, by substituting packs and portmanteaus in place of chests and boxes, and using packhorses instead of waggons. On the other hand, the British army, expecting to be speedily reinforced by 20,000 men, thought nothing of concluding the war according to their wishes before the end of the campaign. It was with the utmost concern as well as indignation, therefore, my lord that they received the news of Lord North's conciliatory bill. It was universally looked upon as a national disgrace;\ndissgrace; and some even tore the cockades from their hats, and trampled them under their feet as a token of their indignation. By the colonists it was received with indifference. The British commissioners endeavoured to make it as public as possible; and the congress, as formerly, ordered it to be printed in all the newspapers. On this occasion Governor Tryon enclosed several copies of the bill to General Washington in a letter, entreating that he would allow them to be circulated; to which that general returned for answer a copy of a newspaper in which the bill was printed, with the resolutions of congress upon it. These were, That whoever presumed to make a separate agreement with Britain should be deemed a public enemy; that the United States could not with any propriety keep correspondence with the commissioners until their independence was acknowledged, and the British fleets and armies removed from America. At the same time, the colonies were warned not to suffer themselves to be deceived into security by any offers that might be made; but to use their utmost endeavours to send their quotas with all diligence into the field. The individuals with whom the commissioners conversed on the subject of the conciliatory bill, generally returned for answer, that the day of reconciliation was past; and that the haughtiness of Britain had extinguished all filial regard in the breasts of the Americans.\n\nAbout this time also Mr Silas Deane arrived from France with two copies of the treaty of commerce and alliance to be signed by congress. Advices of the most agreeable nature were also received from various parts, representing in the most favourable light the dispositions of the European powers; all of whom, it was said, wished to see the independence of America settled upon the most firm and permanent basis. Considering the situation of matters with the colonists at this time, therefore, it is no wonder that the commissioners found themselves unable to accomplish the business on which they came. Their proposals were utterly rejected, themselves treated as spies, and all intercourse with them interdicted.\n\nBut before any final answer could be obtained from congress, Sir Henry Clinton had taken the resolution of evacuating Philadelphia. Accordingly, on the 16th of June, after having made all necessary preparations, the army marched out of the city, and crossed the Delaware before noon with all its baggage and other encumbrances. General Washington, apprised of this design, had despatched express into the Jerseys with orders to collect all the force that could be assembled in order to obstruct the march of the enemy. After various movements on both sides, Sir Henry Clinton, with the royal army, arrived on the 27th of June at a place called Freehold; where, judging that the enemy would attack him, he encamped in a very strong situation. Here General Washington determined to make an attack as soon as the army had again begun its march. The night was spent in making the necessary preparations, and General Lee with his division was ordered to be ready by daybreak. But Sir Henry Clinton, justly apprehending that the chief object of the enemy was the baggage, committed it to the care of General Knyphausen, whom he ordered to set out early in the morning, while he followed with the rest of the army. The attack was accordingly made; but the British general had taken such care to arrange his troops properly, and so effectually supported his forces when engaged with the Americans, that the latter not only made no impression, but were with difficulty prevented from a total defeat by the advance of General Washington with the whole army. The British troops effected their retreat with the loss of 300 men, of whom many died through mere fatigue, without any wound. In this action General Lee was charged by General Washington with disobedience and misconduct in retreating before the British army. He was tried by a court martial, and sentenced to a temporary suspension from his command. After they had arrived at Sandy Hook, a bridge of boats was by Lord Howe's directions thrown from thence over the channel which separated the island from the main land, and the troops were conveyed aboard the fleet; after which they sailed to New York. After sending some light detachments to watch the enemy's motions, General Washington marched towards the North River, where a great force had been collected to join him, and where it was now expected that some very capital operations would take place.\n\nIn the mean time, France had set about her preparations for the assistance of the Americans. On the 14th of April Count d'Estaing had sailed from Toulon with a strong squadron of ships of the line and frigates, and arrived on the coast of Virginia in the beginning of July, while the British fleet was employed in conveying the forces from Sandy Hook to New York. It consisted of one ship of 90 guns, one of 82, five of 74, and four of 64, besides several large frigates; and, exclusive of its complement of sailors, had 6000 marines and soldiers on board. To oppose this the British had only six ships of 64 guns, three of 50, and two of 40, with some frigates and sloops. Notwithstanding this inferiority, however, the British admiral posted himself to advantageously, and showed such superior skill, that D'Estaing did not think proper to attack him. He therefore remained at anchor four miles off Sandy Hook till the 22nd of July, without effecting anything more than the capture of some vessels, which, through ignorance of his arrival, fell into his hands.\n\nThe next attempt of the French admiral was, in conjunction with the Americans, on Rhode Island. It was proposed that D'Estaing, with the 6000 troops he had with him, should make a descent on the southern part of the island, while a body of the Americans should take possession of the north; at the same time the French squadron was to enter the harbour of Newport, and take and destroy all the British shipping. On the 8th of August the French admiral entered the harbour as was proposed, but found himself unable to do any material damage. Lord Howe, however, instantly fell foul for Rhode Island; and D'Estaing, confiding in his superiority, immediately came out of the harbour to attack him. A violent storm parted the two fleets, and did so much damage that they were rendered totally unfit for action. The French, however, suffered most; and several of the ships being afterwards attacked singly by the British, very narrowly escaped being taken. On the 20th of August\nhe returned to Newport in a very flattered condition; and, not thinking himself safe there, failed two days after for Bofton. General Sullivan had landed in the mean time on the northern part of Rhode Island with 10,000 men. On the 17th of August they began their operations by erecting batteries, and making their approaches to the British lines. But General Pigot, who commanded in Newport, had taken such effectual care to secure himself on the land side, that without the affluence of a marine force it was altogether impossible to attack him with any probability of success. The conduct of DeEstaing, therefore, who had abandoned them when matter of the harbour, gave the greatest disgust to the people of New England, and Sullivan began to think of a retreat. On perceiving his intentions, the garrison fell out upon him with so much vigour, that it was not without difficulty that he effected his retreat. He had not been long gone when Sir Henry Clinton arrived with a body of 4000 men; which, had it arrived sooner, would have enabled the British commander to have gained a decisive advantage over him, as well as to have destroyed the town of Providence, which, by its vicinity to Rhode Island, and the enterprises which were continually projected and carried on in that place, kept the inhabitants of Rhode Island in continual alarms.\n\nThe first British expedition was to Buzzard's Bay, on the coast of New England and neighbourhood of Rhode Island. Here they destroyed a great number of privateers and merchantmen, magazines, with storehouses, &c.; whence proceeding to a fertile and populous island called Martha's Vineyard, they carried off 10,000 sheep and 300 black cattle. Another expedition took place up the North River, under Lord Cornwallis and General Knyphausen; the principal event of which was the destruction of a regiment of American cavalry, known by the name of Washington's Light Horse. A third expedition was directed to Little Egg Harbour in New Jersey, a place noted for privateers, the destruction of which was its principal intention. It was conducted by Captains Ferguson and Collins, and ended in the destruction of the enemy's vessels, as well as of the place itself. At the same time part of another body of American troops, called Pulaski's Legion, was surprised, and a great number of them put to the sword.\n\nThe Americans had in the beginning of the year projected the conquest of West Florida; and one Captain Willing, with a party of resolute men, had made a successful incursion into the country. This awakened the attention of the British to the southern colonies, and an expedition against them was resolved on. Georgia was the place of destination; and the more effectually to ensure success, Colonel Campbell, with a sufficient force, under convoy of some ships of war, commanded by Commodore Hyde Parker, embarked at New York, while General Prevost, who commanded in East Florida, was directed to set out with all the force he could spare. The armament from New York arrived off the coast of Georgia in the month of December; and though the enemy were very strongly posted in an advantageous situation on the shore, the British troops made good their landing, and advanced towards Savannah the capital of the province. That very day they defeated the forces of the provincials, which opposed them; and took possession of the town America, with such celerity, that the Americans had not time to execute a resolution they had taken of setting it on fire. In ten days the whole province of Georgia was in a state of reduced, Sunbury alone excepted; and this was also Georgia brought under subjection by General Prevost in his march northward. Every proper method was taken to secure the tranquillity of the country; and rewards were offered for apprehending committee and assembly men, or such as they judged most inimical to the British interests. On the arrival of General Prevost, the command of the troops naturally devolved on him as the senior officer; and the conquest of Carolina was next projected.\n\nIn this attempt there was no small probability of Carolina invaded. The country contained a great number of friends to government, who now eagerly embraced the opportunity of declaring themselves; many of the inhabitants of Georgia had joined the royal standard; and there was not in the province any considerable body of provincial forces capable of opposing the efforts of regular and well-disciplined troops. On the first news of General Prevost's approach, the loyalists assembled in a body, imagining themselves able to stand their ground until their allies should arrive; but in this they were disappointed. The Americans attacked and defeated them with the loss of half their number. The remainder retreated into Georgia; and after undergoing many difficulties, at last effected a junction with the British forces.\n\nIn the mean time, General Lincoln, with a considerable body of American troops, had encamped within 20 miles of the town of Savannah; and another strong party had posted themselves at a place called Briar's Creek, farther up the river of the same name. Thus the extent of the British government was likely to be circumscribed within very narrow bounds. General Prevost therefore determined to dilodge the party at Briar's Creek; and the latter, trusting to their strong situation, and being remiss in their guard, suffered themselves to be surprised on the 30th of March 1779; when they were utterly routed with the loss of defeated 400 killed and taken, besides a great number drowned in the river or the swamps. The whole artillery, stores, baggage, and almost all the arms, of this unfortunate party were taken, so that they could no more make any stand; and thus the province of Georgia was once more freed from the enemy, and a communication opened with those places in Carolina where the loyalists chiefly resided.\n\nThe victory at Briar's Creek proved of considerable service to the British cause. Great numbers of the loyalists joined his army, and considerably increased its force. Hence he was enabled to stretch his posts further up the river, and to guard all the principal passes; so that General Lincoln was reduced to a state of inaction; and at last moved off towards Augusta, in order to protect the provincial assembly, which was obliged to fit in that place, the capital being now in the hands of the British.\n\nLincoln had no sooner quitted his post, than it was judged a proper time by the British general to put in execution the grand scheme which had been meditated against Carolina. Many difficulties indeed lay in his way. The river Savannah was so swollen by the excel-\nAmerica, five rains of the seasons, that it seemed impassable; the opposite shore, for a great way, was so full of swamps and marshes, that no army could march over it without the greatest difficulty; and, to render the passage still more difficult, General Moultrie was left with a considerable body of troops in order to oppose the enemy's attempts. But in spite of every opposition, the constancy and perseverance of the British forces at last prevailed. General Moultrie was defeated, and obliged to retire towards Charlestown; and the victorious army, after having waded through the marshes for some time, at last arrived in an open country, through which they pursued their march with great rapidity towards the capital; while General Lincoln remained in a state of security at Augusta, vainly imagining that the obstacles he had left in the way could not be surmounted.\n\nCertain intelligence of the danger to which Charlestown was exposed at last aroused the American general from his lethargy. A chosen body of infantry, mounted on horseback for the greater expedition, was despatched before him; while Lincoln himself followed with all the forces he could collect. General Moultrie too, with the troops he had brought from Savannah, and some others he had collected since his retreat from thence, had taken possession of all the avenues leading to Charlestown, and prepared for a vigorous defense. But all opposition proved ineffectual. The Americans were defeated in every encounter; and, retreating continually, allowed the British army to come within cannon-shot of Charlestown on the 12th of May.\n\nThe town was now summoned to surrender, and the inhabitants would gladly have agreed to observe a neutrality during the rest of the war, and would have engaged also for the rest of the province. But these terms not being accepted, they made preparations for a vigorous defense. It was not, however, in the power of the British commander at this time to make an attack with any prospect of success. His artillery was not of sufficient weight; there were no ships to support his attack by land; and General Lincoln advancing rapidly with a superior army, threatened to enclose him between his own force and the town; so that should he fail in his first attempt, certain destruction would be the consequence. For these reasons he withdrew his forces from before the town, and took possession of two islands called St James's and St John's, lying to the southward; where having waited some time, his force was augmented by the arrival of two frigates. With these he determined to make himself master of Port Royal, another island possessed of an excellent harbour and many other natural advantages, from its situation also commanding all the sea coast from Charlestown to Savannah river. The American general, however, did not allow this to be accomplished without opposition. Perceiving that his opponent had occupied an advantageous post on St John's island preparatory to his enterprise against Port Royal, he attempted, on the 20th of June, to dislodge him from it; but after an obstinate attack, the provincials were, as usual, obliged to retire with considerable loss. On this occasion the success of the British arms was in a great measure owing to an armed boat, which galled the right flank of the enemy so effectually, that they could direct their efforts only against the strongest part of the lines, which proved impregnable to their attacks. This disappointment was instantly followed by the loss of Port Royal, which General Prevost took possession of, and put his troops into proper stations, waiting for the arrival of such reinforcements as were necessary for the intended attack on Charlestown.\n\nIn the meantime Count d'E斯塔ing, who, as we have already observed, had put into Volton harbour to recruit, had used his utmost efforts to ingratiate himself with the inhabitants of that city. Zealous also in the cause of his master, he had published a proclamation to be dispersed through Canada, inviting the people to return to their original friendship with France, and declaring that all who renounced their allegiance to Great Britain should certainly find a protector in the king of France. All his endeavours, however, proved insufficient at this time to produce any revolution, or even to form a party of any consequence among the Canadians.\n\nAs soon as the French admiral had refitted his fleet, he took the opportunity, while that of Admiral Byron had been shattered by a storm, of sailing to the West Indies. During his operations there, the Americans having represented his conduct as totally unserviceable to them, he received orders from Europe to affrust the colonies with all possible speed.\n\nIn compliance with these orders, he directed his course towards Georgia, with a design to recover that province out of the hands of the enemy, and to put it against as well as South Carolina, in such a posture of defense as would effectively secure them from any future attack. This seemed to be an easy matter, from the little force with which he knew he should be opposed; and the next object in contemplation was no less than the destruction of the British fleet and army at New York, and their total expulsion from the continent of America. Full of these hopes, the French commander arrived off the coast of Georgia with a fleet of 22 sail of the line and 10 large frigates. His arrival was so little expected, that several vessels laden with provisions and military stores fell into his hands; the Experiment also, a vessel of 50 guns, commanded by Sir James Wallace, was taken after a stout resistance. On the continent, the British troops were divided. General Prevost, with an inconsiderable part, remained at Savannah; but the main force was under Colonel Maitland at Port Royal. On the first appearance of the French fleet, an express was despatched to Colonel Maitland; but it was intercepted by the enemy; so that before he could set out in order to join the commander in chief, the Americans had secured most of the passes by land, while the French fleet effectually blocked up the passage by sea. But, by taking advantage of creeks and rivulets, and marching over land, he arrived just in time to relieve Savannah.\n\nD'E斯塔ing, after making a galconade of what had happened at St Vincents and Grenada, had allowed the conduct of General Prevost 24 hours to deliberate whether he command should capitulate or not. This time the general employed in making the best preparations he could for a defense; and during this time it was that Colonel Maitland arrived. D'E斯塔ing's summons was now rejected; and as on this occasion the superiority of the enemy was by no means so much out of proportion as it had been at Grenada, there was every probability of\nAmerica, success on the part of the British. The garrison now consisted of 3000 men, all of approved valour and experience, while the united force of the French and Americans did not amount to 10,000. The event was answerable to the expectations of the British general. Having the advantage of a strong fortification and excellent engineers, the fire of the allies made so little impression, that D'Eftaing resolved to bombard the town, and a battery of nine mortars was erected for the purpose. This produced a request from General Preval, that the women and children might be allowed to retire to a place of safety. But the allied commanders had the humanity to refuse compliance; and they resolved to give a general assault. This was accordingly attempted on the 9th of October: but the assailants were everywhere repulsed with such slaughter, that 1200 were killed and wounded; among the former was Count Pulaski, and among the latter was D'Eftaing himself.\n\nThis disaster entirely overthrew the sanguine hopes of the Americans and French; mutual reproaches and animosities took place in the most violent degree; and after waiting eight days longer, both parties prepared for a retreat; the French to their shipping, and the Americans into Carolina.\n\nWhile the allies were thus unsuccessfully employed in the southern colonies, their antagonists were no less industrious in distressing them in the northern parts. Sir George Collier was sent with a fleet, carrying on board General Matthews, with a body of land forces, into the province of Virginia. Their first attempt was on the town of Portsmouth; where, though the enemy had destroyed some ships of great value, the British troops arrived in time to save a great number of others. On this occasion about 120 vessels of different sizes were burnt, and 20 carried off; and an immense quantity of provisions designed for the use of General Washington's army was either destroyed or carried off, together with a great variety of naval and military stores. The fleet and army returned with little or no loss to New York.\n\nThe success with which this expedition was attended, soon gave encouragement to attempt another. The Americans had for some time been employed in the erection of two strong forts on the river; the one at Verplank's Neck on the east, and the other at Stoney Point on the west side. These when completed would have been of the utmost service to the Americans, as commanding the principal pass, called the King's Ferry, between the northern and southern colonies. At present, however, they were not in a condition to make any effectual defence; and it was therefore determined to attack them before the works should be completed. The force employed on this occasion was divided into two bodies; one of which directed its course against Verplanks, and the other against Stoney Point. The former was commanded by General Vaughan, the latter by General Pattison, while the shipping was under the direction of Sir George Collier. General Vaughan met with no resistance, the enemy abandoning their works, and setting fire to every thing combustible that they could not carry off. At Stoney Point, however, a vigorous defence was made, though the garrison was at last obliged to capitulate upon honourable conditions. To secure the possession of this last, which was the more important of the two, General Clinton removed from his former situation, and encamped in such a manner that Washington could not give any assistance. The Americans, however, revenged themselves by distressing, with their numerous privateers, the trade to New York.\n\nThis occasioned a third expedition to Connecticut, where these privateers were chiefly built and harboured. The command was given to Governor Tryon, and to General Garth, an officer of known valour and experience. Under convoy of a considerable number of armed vessels they landed at Newhaven, where they demolished the batteries that had been erected to oppose them, and destroyed the shipping and naval stores; but they spared the town itself, as the inhabitants had abstained from firing out of their houses upon the troops. From Newhaven they marched to Fairfield, where they proceeded as before, reducing the town also to ashes. Norwalk was next attacked, which in like manner was reduced to ashes; as was also Greenfield, a small port in the neighbourhood.\n\nThese successes proved very alarming as well as detrimental to the Americans; so that General Washington determined at all events to drive the enemy from Stoney Point. For this purpose he sent General Wayne with a detachment of chosen men, directing them to attempt the recovery of it by surprise. On this occasion the Americans showed a spirit and resolution exceeding anything they had performed during the course of the war. Though after the capture of it by the British the fortifications of this place had been completed, and were very strong, they attacked the enemy with bayonets, after passing through a heavy fire of musketry and grape shot; and in spite of all opposition, obliged the surviving part of the garrison, amounting to 500 men, to surrender themselves prisoners of war.\n\nThough the Americans did not at present attempt to retain possession of Stoney Point, the success they had met with in the enterprise emboldened them to make a similar attempt on Paulus Hook a fortified post on the Jersey side opposite to New York; but in this they were not attended with equal success, being obliged to retire with precipitation after they had made themselves masters of one or two posts.\n\nAnother expedition of greater importance was now projected on the part of the Americans. This was an expedition against a post on the river Penobscot, on the borders of Nova Scotia, of which the British had lately taken possession, and where they had begun to erect a fort which nobody threatened to be a very great inconvenience to the colonists. The armament destined against it was soon got in readiness, that Colonel Maclean, the commanding officer at Penobscot, found himself obliged to drop the execution of part of his scheme; and instead of a regular fort, to content himself with putting the works already constructed in as good a posture of defence as possible. The Americans could not effect a landing without a great deal of difficulty, and bringing the guns of their largest vessels to bear upon the shore. As soon as this was done, however, they erected several batteries, and kept up a brisk fire for the space of a fortnight; after which they proposed to give a general assault; but before this could be effected, they perceived Sir George Collier with a British fleet sailing up the river to attack.\nAmerica tack them. On this they instantly embarked their artillery and military stores, sailing up the river as far as possible in order to avoid him. They were so closely pursued, however, that not a single vessel could escape; so that the whole fleet, consisting of 19 armed vessels and 24 transports was destroyed; most of them indeed being blown up by themselves. The soldiers and sailors were obliged to wander through immense deserts, where they suffered much for want of provisions; and to add to their calamities, a quarrel broke out between the soldiers and seamen concerning the cause of their difference, which ended in a violent fray, wherein a great number were killed.\n\nThus the arms of America and France being almost everywhere unsuccessful, the independency of the former seemed yet to be in danger notwithstanding the assistance of so powerful an ally, when further encouragement was given by the accession of Spain to the confederacy against Britain in the month of June 1779. The first effect of this appeared in an invasion of West Florida by the Spaniards in September 1779. As the country was in no state of defense, the enemy easily made themselves masters of the whole almost without opposition. Their next enterprise was against the Bay of Honduras, where the British logwood cutters were settled. These finding themselves too weak to resist, applied to the governor of Jamaica for relief; who sent them a supply of men, ammunition, and military stores, under Captain Dalrymple. Before the arrival of this detachment, the principal settlement in those parts, called St George's Key, had been taken by the Spaniards and retaken by the British. In his way Captain Dalrymple fell in with a squadron from Admiral Parker in search of some register ships richly laden; but which retreating into the harbour of Omoa, were too strongly protected by the fort to be attacked with safety. A project was then formed, in conjunction with the people of Honduras, to reduce this fort. Victory quickly declared for the British; but the fortifications were so strong, that the artillery they had brought along with them were found too light to make any impression. It was then determined to try the success of an escalade; and this was executed with so much spirit, that the Spaniards stood astonished without making any resistance, and, in spite of all the efforts of their officers, threw down their arms and surrendered. The spoil was immense, being valued at three millions of dollars. The Spaniards chiefly lamented the loss of 250 quintals of quicksilver; a commodity indispensably necessary in the working of their gold and silver mines, so that they offered to ransom it at any price; but this was refused, as well as the ransom of the fort, though the governor offered 300,000 dollars for it. A small garrison was left for the defense of the place; but it was quickly attacked by a superior force, and obliged to evacuate it, though not without destroying every thing that could be of use to the enemy; spiking the guns, and even locking the gates of the fort and carrying off the keys. All this was done in sight of the besiegers; after which the garrison embarked without the loss of a man.\n\nAs no operations of any consequence took place this year in the province of New York, the congress made use of the opportunity to dispatch General Sullivan America, with a considerable force, in order to take vengeance on the Indians for their ravages and depredations; and the object of the expedition was, not merely the taking reduction of them, but if possible their utter extirpation. Of this the Indians were apprised; and collecting all the Indians' strength, resolved to come to a decisive engagement. Accordingly they took a strong post in the most woody and mountainous part of the country; erecting a breastwork in the front of large logs of wood extending half a mile in length, while their right flank was covered by a river, and the left by a hill of difficult access. This advantageous position they had taken by the advice of the refugees who were among them, and of whom 200 or 300 were present in the battle.\n\nThus posted, the Indians waited the approach of the American army; but the latter having brought some artillery along with them, played it against the breastwork of the enemy with such success, that in two hours it was almost destroyed; and at the same time a party having reached the top of the hill, they became apprehensive of being surrounded, on which they instantly fled with precipitation, leaving a great number of killed and wounded behind them. The Americans after this battle met with no further resistance of any consequence. They were suffered to proceed without interruption, and to execute in the most ample manner the vengeance they had projected. On entering the country of the Indians, it appeared that they had been acquainted with agriculture and the arts of peace far beyond what had been supposed. From General Sullivan's account it was learned, that the Indian housetops were large, convenient, and even elegant; their grounds were excellently cultivated, and their gardens abounded in fruit trees and vegetables of all kinds fit for food. The whole of this fine country was now by the American general converted into a desert. Forty towns and settlements, besides scattered habitations, were demolished; the fields of corn, the orchards, the plantations, were utterly laid waste; all the fruit trees were cut down; and so great had been the industry of the Indians, that in one orchard 1500 of them were destroyed. The quantity of corn wasted on this occasion was supposed to amount to 160,000 bushels. In short such was the defoliation, that on the American army's leaving the country, not a house, not a field of corn, nor a fruit tree, was left upon the ground, nor was an Indian to be seen throughout the whole tract.\n\nWe must now take a view of the transactions in the southern colonies; to which the war was, in the year 1780, so effectually transferred, that the operations there became at last decisive. The success of General Prevost in advancing to the very capital of South Carolina has been already related, together with the obstructions which prevented him from becoming master of it at that time. Towards the end of the year 1779, however, Sir Henry Clinton set sail from New York with a considerable body of troops, intended for the attack against Charlestown, South Carolina, in a fleet of ships of chartered war and transports under the command of Vice Adm. Arbuthnot. They had a very tedious voyage; the weather was uncommonly bad; several of the transports were lost, as were also the greater part of the horses:\nhorses which they carried with them, intended for cavalry or other public uses; and an ordnance ship likewise foundered at sea. Having arrived at Savannah, where they endeavoured to repair the damages sustained on their voyage, they proceeded from thence on the 10th of February 1780 to North Edisto, the place of embarkation which had been previously appointed. They had a favourable and speedy passage thither; and though it required time to have the bar explored and the channel marked, the transports all entered the harbour the next day; and the army took possession of John's island without opposition. Preparations were then made for passing the squadron over Charlestown bar, where the high water spring tides were only 19 feet deep; but no opportunity offered of going into the harbour till the 20th of March, when it was effected without any accident, though the American galleys continually attempted to prevent the English boats from founding the channel. The British troops had previously removed from John's to James's island; and on the 20th of the same month they effected their landing at Charlestown Neck. On the 1st of April they broke ground within 800 yards of the American works; and by the 5th the besiegers guns were mounted in battery.\n\nAs soon as the army began to erect their batteries against the town, Admiral Arbuthnot embraced the first favourable opportunity of passing Sullivan's island, upon which there was a strong fort of batteries, the chief defence of the harbour. He weighed on the 9th, with the Roebuck, Richmond, and Romulus, Blonde, Virginia, Raleigh, and Sandwich armed ship, the Renown bringing up the rear; and, passing through a severe fire, anchored in about two hours under James's island, with the loss of 27 seamen killed and wounded. The Richmond's fore-top mast was shot away, and the ships in general sustained damage in their masts and rigging, though not materially in their hulls. But the Acetus transport, having on board some naval stores, grounded within gunshot of Sullivan's island, and received so much damage that she was obliged to be abandoned and burnt.\n\nOn the 10th, Sir Henry Clinton and Admiral Arbuthnot summoned the town to surrender to his majesty's arms; but Major-general Lincoln, who commanded in Charlestown, returned them an answer, declaring it to be his intention to defend the place. The batteries were now opened against the town; and from their effect the fire of the American advanced works considerably abated. It appears that the number of troops under the command of Lincoln was by far too few for defending works of such extent as those of Charlestown; and that many of these were men little accustomed to military service, and very ill provided with clothes and other necessaries. Lincoln had been for some time expecting reinforcements and supplies from Virginia and other places; but they came in very slowly. Earl Cornwallis, and Lieutenant-colonel Tarleton under him, were also extremely active in intercepting such reinforcements and supplies as were sent to the American general. They totally defeated a considerable body of cavalry and militia which was proceeding to the relief of the town; and also made themselves masters of some posts which gave them in a great degree the command of the country, by which means great supplies of provisions fell into their hands.\n\nSuch was the state of things, and Fort Sullivan had also been taken by the king's troops, when on the 18th of May General Clinton again summoned the town to surrender; an offer being made, as had been done before, that if they surrendered, the lives and property of the inhabitants should be preserved to them. Articles of capitulation were then proposed by General Lincoln; but the terms were not agreed to by General Clinton. At length, however, the town being closely invested on all sides, and the preparations to storm it in every part being in great forwardness, and the ships ready to move to the assault, General Lincoln, who had been applied to for that purpose by the inhabitants, surrendered it on such articles of capitulation as General Clinton had before agreed to. This surrender was on the 4th of May, which was one month and two days after the town had been first summoned to surrender.\n\nA large quantity of ordnance, arms, and ammunition, was found in Charlestown; and, according to Sir Henry Clinton's account, the number of prisoners taken in Charlestown amounted to 5618 men, exclusive of near a thousand sailors in arms; but according to General Lincoln's account, transmitted to the Congress, the whole number of continental troops taken prisoners amounted to no more than 2487. The remainder, therefore, included in General Clinton's account, must have consisted of militia and inhabitants of the town. Several American frigates were also taken or destroyed in the harbour of Charlestown.\n\nThe loss of Charlestown evidently excited a considerable alarm in America; and their popular writers, particularly the author of the celebrated performance entitled Common Sense, in some other pieces made use of it as a powerful argument to lead them to more vigorous exertions against Great Britain, that they might the more effectually and certainly secure their independence.\n\nWhile Sir Henry Clinton was employed in his voyage to Charlestown, and in the siege of that place, fogs at the garrison at New York seem not to have been wholly free from apprehensions for their own safety. An intense frost, accompanied with great falls of snow, began about the middle of December 1779, and shut up the navigation of the port of New York from the sea, within a few days after the departure of Admiral Arbuthnot and General Clinton. The severity of the weather increased to so great a degree, that towards the middle of January all communications with New York by water were entirely cut off, and as many new ones opened by the ice. The inhabitants could scarcely be said to be in an inferior state. Horses with heavy carriages could go over the ice into the Jerseys from one island to another. The passage in the North River, even in the widest part from New York to Paulus Hook, which was 2000 yards, was about the 10th of January practicable for the heaviest cannon: an event which had been unknown in the memory of man. Provisions were soon after transported upon sledges, and a detachment of cavalry marched upon the ice from New York to Staten Island, which was a distance of 11 miles.\n\nThe city of New York being thus circumstanced was\nAmerica was considered as much exposed to the attacks from the continental troops; and it was strongly reported that General Washington was meditating a great stroke upon New York with his whole force, by different attacks. Some time before this, Major-general Patton, commandant at New York, having received an address from many of the inhabitants, offering to put themselves in military array, he thought the present a favourable opportunity of proving the sincerity of their professions. Accordingly he issued a proclamation, calling upon all the male inhabitants from 16 to 60 to take up arms. The requisition was so readily complied with, that in a few days 40 companies from the six wards of the city were enrolled, officered, and under arms, to the number of 2600, many substantial citizens serving in the ranks of each company. Other volunteer companies were formed; and the city was put into a very strong posture of defense.\n\nNo attack, however, was made upon New York, whatever design might originally have been meditated; but an attempt was made upon Staten Island, where there were about 1800 men, under the command of Brigadier-general Sterling, who were well intrenched. General Washington, whose army was huddled at Morristown, sent a detachment of 2700 men, with six pieces of cannon, two mortars, and some horses, commanded by Lord Sterling, who arrived at Staten Island early in the morning of the 15th January. The advanced posts of the British troops retired upon the approach of the Americans, who formed the line, and made some movements in the course of the day; but they withdrew in the night, after having burnt one house, pillaged some others, and carried off with them about 200 head of cattle. Immediately on the arrival of the Americans on Staten Island, Lieutenant-general Knyphausen had embarked 600 men to attempt a passage, and to support General Sterling; but the floating ice compelled them to return. It is, however, imagined, that the appearance of these transports, with the British troops on board, which the Americans could see towards the close of the day, induced the latter to make so precipitate a retreat.\n\nAfter Charlestown had surrendered to the king's troops, General Clinton issued two proclamations, and also circulated a hand bill amongst the inhabitants of South Carolina, in order to induce them to return to their allegiance, and to be ready to join the king's troops. It was said, that the helping hand of every man was wanted to re-establish peace and good government; and that as the commander in chief wished not to draw the king's friends into danger, while any doubt could remain of their success; so now that this was certain, he trusted that one and all would heartily join, and by a general concurrence give effect to such necessary measures for that purpose as from time to time might be pointed out. Those who had families were to form a militia to remain at home, and occasionally to assemble in their own districts, when required, under officers of their own choosing, for the maintenance of peace and good order. Those who had no families, and who could conveniently be spared for a time, it was presumed, would cheerfully affix his majesty's troops in driving their oppressors, acting under the authority of congress, and all the miseries of war, far from that colony. For this purpose it was said to be necessary that the young men should be ready to assemble when required, and to serve with the king's troops for any six months of the ensuing twelve that might be found requisite, under proper regulations. They might choose officers to each company to command them; and were to be allowed, when on service, pay, ammunition, and provisions, in the same manner as the king's troops. When they joined the army, each man was to be furnished with a certificate, declaring that he was only engaged to serve as a militiaman for the time specified; that he was not to be marched beyond North Carolina and Georgia; and that, when the time was out, he was freed from all claims whatever of military service, excepting the common and usual militia duty where he lived. He would then, it was said, have paid his debt to his country, and be entitled to enjoy undisturbed that peace, liberty, and property, at home, which he had contributed to secure. The proclamations and publications of General Clinton appear to have produced some effect in South Carolina; though they probably operated chiefly upon those who were before not much inclined to the cause of American independence. Two hundred and ten of the inhabitants of Charlestown signed an address to General Clinton and Admiral Arbuthnot, soliciting to be readmitted to the character and condition of British subjects, the inhabitants of that city having been hitherto considered as prisoners on parole; declaring their disapprobation of the doctrine of American independence; and expressing their regret, that after the repeal of those statutes which gave rise to the troubles in America, the overtures made by his majesty's commissioners had not been regarded by the congress. Sir Henry Clinton, in one of the proclamations issued at this time, declared, that if any persons should thenceforward appear in arms in order to prevent the establishment of his majesty's government in that country, or should, under any pretence or authority whatsoever, attempt to compel any other person or persons to do so, or who should hinder or intimidate the king's faithful and loyal subjects from joining his forces or otherwise performing those duties their allegiance required, such persons should be treated with the utmost severity, and their estates be immediately seized in order to be confiscated.\n\nMean time the ravages of war did not prevent the Americans from paying some attention to the arts of peace. On the 4th of May an act passed by the council and house of representatives of Massachusetts Bay for incorporating and establishing a society for the cultivation and promotion of the arts and sciences.\n\nSome doubts having arisen in the congress, towards the close of the preceding year, about the propriety of their assembling in the city of Philadelphia, it was congress now resolved that they should continue to meet there; and a committee of three members was appointed, to report a proper place where buildings might be provided for the reception of the congress, together with an estimate of the expense of providing such buildings and the necessary offices for the several boards. It was also resolved by the congress, that a monument should be erected to the memory of their late general Richard Montgomery, who fell at Quebec, in testimony of his signal and important services to the United States.\nStates of America, with an inscription expressive of his amiable character and heroic achievements; and that the continental treasurers should be directed to advance a sum not exceeding 30cl. to Dr Franklin to defray the expense; that gentleman being desired to cause the monument to be executed at Paris, or in some other part of France. It was likewise resolved by the congress, that a court should be established for the trial of all appeals from the court of admiralty of the United States of America, in cases of capture; to consist of three judges, appointed and commissioned by congress, and who were to take an oath of office; and that the trials in this court should be determined by the usage of nations.\n\nThe difficulties of the congress and of the people of America had been greatly increased by the depreciation of their paper currency. At the time when the colonies engaged in a war with Great Britain, they had no regular civil governments established among them of sufficient energy to enforce the collection of taxes, or to provide funds for the redemption of such bills of credit as their necessities obliged them to issue. In consequence of this state of things, their bills increased in quantity far beyond the sum necessary for the purpose of a circulating medium: and as they wanted at the same time specific funds to rely on for their redemption, they saw their paper currency daily sink in value. The depreciation continued, by a kind of gradual progression, from the year 1777 to 1780: so that, at the latter period, the continental dollars were passed, by common consent, in most parts of America, at the rate of at least 1/3 below their nominal value. The impossibility of keeping up the credit of the currency to any fixed standard, occasioned great and almost insurmountable embarrassments in ascertaining the value of property, or carrying on trade with any sufficient certainty. Those who sold, and those who bought, were left without a rule whereon to form a judgment of their profit or their loss; and every species of commerce or exchange, whether foreign or domestic, was exposed to numberless and increasing difficulties. The consequences of the depreciation of the paper currency were also felt with peculiar severity by such of the Americans as were engaged in their military services, and greatly augmented their other hardships. The requisitions made by the congress to the several colonies for supplies, were also far from being always regularly complied with; and their troops were not unfrequently in want of the most common necessaries; which naturally occasioned complaints and discontent among them. Some of these difficulties, resulting from their circumstances and situation, perhaps no wisdom could have prevented; but they seem to have arisen in part from the congress not being sufficiently acquainted with the principles of finance, and from a defect of system in the departments of their government. The cause of the Americans appears also to have suffered somewhat by their depending too much on temporary infusions. But the congress endeavoured, towards the close of the year 1780, to put their army upon a more permanent footing, and to give all the satisfaction to their officers and soldiers which their circumstances would permit. They appointed a committee for arranging their finances, and made some new regulations reflecting their war-office and treasury-board, and other public departments.\n\nNotwithstanding the disadvantages under which they laboured, the Americans seemed to entertain no doubt that they should be able to maintain their independence. The 4th of July was celebrated this year at Philadelphia with some pomp, as the anniversary of American independence. A commencement for conferring degrees in the arts was held the same day, in the hall of the university there; at which the president and members of the congress attended, and other persons in public offices. The Chevalier de la Lucerne, minister plenipotentiary from the French king to the United States, was also present on the occasion. A charge was publicly addressed by the provost of the university to the students; in which he said, that he could not but congratulate them \"on that auspicious day, which, amidst the confusions and delusions of war, beheld learning beginning to revive; and animated them with the pleasing prospect of seeing the sacred lamp of science burning with a still brighter flame, and scattering its invigorating rays over the unexplored deserts of that extensive continent; until the whole world should be involved in the united blaze of knowledge, liberty, and religion.\" When he stretched his views forward (he said), and surveyed the rising glories of America, the enriching consequences of their determined struggle for liberty, the extensive fields of intellectual improvement and useful invention, in science and arts, in agriculture and commerce, in religion and government, through which the unfettered mind would range, with increasing delight, in quest of the undiscovered treasure which yet lay concealed in the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms of that new world; or in the other fertile sources of knowledge with which it abounded. His heart swelled with the pleasing prospect, that the sons of that institution would distinguish themselves, in the different walks of life, by their literary contributions to the embellishment and increase of human happiness.\"\n\nOn the 10th of July, M. Ternay, with a fleet consisting of seven ships of the line, besides frigates, and body of a large body of French troops, commanded by the count de Rochambeau, arrived at Rhode Island; and the following day 6000 men were landed there. A committee from the general assembly of Rhode Island was appointed to congratulate the French general upon his arrival; whereupon he returned an answer, in which he informed them, that the king his master had sent him to the assistance of his good and faithful allies the United States of America. At present, he said, he only brought over the vanguard of a much greater force destined for their aid; and the king had ordered him to assure them, that his whole power should be exerted for their support. He added, that the French troops were under the strictest discipline; and, acting under the orders of General Washington, would live with the Americans as their brethren.\n\nA scheme was soon after formed, of making a combined attack with English ships and troops, under the command of Sir Henry Clinton and Admiral Arbuthnot, against the French fleet and troops at Rhode Island. Accordingly a considerable part of the troops at New York was embarked for that purpose. General\nGeneral Washington having received information of this, palled the North River, by a very rapid movement, and with an army increased to 12,000 men, proceeded with celerity towards King's Bridge, in order to attack New York; but learning that the British general had changed his intentions, and disembarked his troops on the 31st of the month, General Washington recrossed the river, and returned to his former station. Sir Henry Clinton and the admiral had agreed to relinquish their design of attacking the French and Americans at Rhode Island as impracticable for the present.\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was also made about this time in the Jerseys by General Knyphausen, with 7000 British troops under his command, to surprise the advanced posts of General Washington's army. They proceeded very rapidly towards Springfield, meeting little opposition till they came to the bridge there, which was very gallantly defended by 170 of the continental troops, for 15 minutes, against the British army; but they were at length obliged to give up to unequal a contest, with the loss of 37 men. After securing this pass, the British troops marched into the place, and set fire to most of the houses. They also committed some other depredations in the Jerseys; but gained no laurels there, being obliged to return about the beginning of July without effecting any thing material.\n\nBut in South Carolina the royal arms were attended with more success. Earl Cornwallis, who commanded the British troops there, obtained a very signal victory over General Gates on the 16th of August. The action began at break of day, in a situation very advantageous for the British troops, but very unfavourable to the Americans. The latter were much more numerous; but the ground on which both armies stood was narrowed by swamps on the right and left, so that the Americans could not properly avail themselves of their superior numbers. There seems to have been some want of generalship in Gates, in suffering himself to be surprised in so disadvantageous a position; but this circumstance was partly the effect of accident; for both armies fell out with a design of attacking each other precisely at the same time, at ten the preceding evening, and met together before daylight at the place where the action happened. The attack was made by the British troops with great vigour, and in a few minutes the action was general along the whole line. It was at this time a dead calm, with a little haze in the air, which prevented the smoke from rising, occasioned so thick a darkness, that it was difficult to see the effect of a very heavy and well-supported fire on both sides. The British troops either kept up a constant fire, or made use of bayonets, as opportunities offered; and, after an obstinate resistance during three quarters of an hour, threw the Americans into total confusion, and forced them to give way in all quarters. The continental troops appear to have behaved well; but the militia were soon broken, and left the former to oppose the whole force of the British troops. General Gates did all in his power to rally the militia, but without effect: the continentals retreated in some order; but the rout of the militia was so great, that the British cavalry are said to have continued the pursuit of them to the distance of 22 miles from the place where the action happened. The loss of the Americans was very considerable: about 1000 prisoners were taken, and more are said to have been killed and wounded, but the number is not very accurately ascertained. Seven pieces of brass cannon, a number of colours, and all the ammunition wagons of the Americans, were also taken. Of the British troops, the killed and wounded amounted to 213. Among the prisoners taken was Major-general Baron de Kalb, a Prussian officer in the American service, who was mortally wounded, having exhibited great gallantry in the course of the action, and received 11 wounds. The British troops by whom this great victory was achieved did not much exceed 2000, while the American army is said to have amounted to 6000; of which, however, the greatest part was militia.\n\nLieutenant-colonel Tarleton, who had greatly distinguished himself in this action, was detached the following day, with some cavalry and light infantry, Tarleton, amounting to about 350 men, to attack a corps of Americans under General Sumpter. He executed this service with great activity and military address. He procured good information of Sumpter's movements; and by forced and concealed marches came up with and surprised him on the middle of the day on the 18th, near the Catawba fords. He totally destroyed or dispersed his detachment, which consisted of 700 men, killing 150 on the spot, and taking two pieces of brass cannon, 300 prisoners, and 44 waggons.\n\nNot long after these events, means were found to General detach Major-general Arnold, who had engaged to ardently in the cause of America, and who had exhibited feats of too much bravery in the support of it, from the interests of the congress. Major André, adjutant-general to the British army, was a principal agent in this transaction; or, if the overt of joining the king's troops came first from Arnold, this gentleman was the person employed to concert the affair with him. More must have been originally comprehended in the scheme than the mere defection of the American cause by Arnold; but whatever designs had been formed for promoting the views of the British government, they were frustrated by the apprehending of Major André. He was taken in disguise, after having assumed a false name, on the 23rd of September, by three American soldiers, to whom he offered considerable rewards if they would have suffered him to escape, but without effect. Several papers written by Arnold were found upon him; and when Arnold had learned that Major André was seized, he found means to get on board a barge, and to escape to one of the king's ships. Upon General Washington referred the case of Major André fate of Major André to the examination and decision of a board of general officers, consisting of Major-general Greene, Major-general Lord Sterling, Major-general the Marquis de la Fayette, Major-general the Baron de Steuben, two other major-generals, and eight brigadier-generals. Major André was examined before them, and the particulars of his case inquired into; and they reported to the American commander in chief, that Mr André came on shore from the Vulture sloop of war in the night, on an interview with General Arnold, in a private and secret manner; that he changed his dress within the American lines; and, under a feigned name and in a disguised habit, passed the American works at Stoney.\nStoney and Verplank's Points, on the evening of the 22d of September; that he was taken on the morning of the 23d at Tarry-town, being then on his way for New York; and that, when taken, he had in his possession several papers which contained intelligence for the enemy. They therefore determined, that he ought to be considered as a spy from the enemy; and that, agreeable to the law and usage of nations, he ought to suffer death. Sir Henry Clinton, Lieutenant-general Robertson, and the late American general Arnold, all wrote pressing letters to General Washington on the occasion, in order to prevent the decision of the board of general officers from being put in force: But their applications were ineffectual. Major André was hanged at Tappan, in the province of New York, on the 2d of October. He met his fate with great firmness; but appeared somewhat hurt that he was not allowed a more military death, for which he had followed a more military death, for which he had fol-\n\nArnold kept up the most friendly and intimate acquaintance with him, and there was a continued interchange of dinners, balls, routes, and concerts: so that M. Gerard must have believed, that in General Arnold he had found and left one of the warmest friends the court of France had in America. He was also one of the first in congratulating the Chevalier de Luzerne, the second French minister. About this time complaints and accusations were exhibited against him by the government of Philadelphia for divers mal-practices; among which charges were, the appropriation of goods and merchandise to his own use, which he had seized as British property in Philadelphia in July 1778. It was determined by a court-martial, that his conduct was highly reprehensible; but he was indulgently treated, and was therefore only reprimanded by the commander-in-chief General Washington. It was in these circumstances, the Americans said, bankrupted in reputation and fortune, loaded with debts, and having a growing and expensive family, that General Arnold first turned his thoughts towards joining the royal arms.\n\nAfter the defeat of General Gates by Earl Cornwallis, that nobleman exerted himself to the utmost in South Carolina, extending the progress of the British arms, and with considerable effect. But one enterprise, which was conducted by Major Ferguson, proved unsuccessful. That officer had taken abundant pains to discipline some of the Tory militia, as they were termed; and with a party of these and some British troops, amounting in the whole to about 1400 men, made incursions into the country. But on the 7th of October he was attacked by a superior body of Americans at a place called King's Mountain, and totally defeated. One hundred and fifty were killed in the action, and 810 made prisoners, of whom 150 were wounded. Fifteen hundred stands of arms also fell into the hands of the Americans, whose loss was inconsiderable. But the following month Lieutenant-colonel Tarleton, who continued to exert his usual activity and bravery, with a party of 170, chiefly cavalry, attacked and defeated General Sumpter, who is said to have had 1000 men, at a place called Black Stocks. Sumpter was wounded, and about 120 of the Americans killed, wounded, or taken. Of the British troops about 50 were killed and wounded.\n\nOn the 3d of September, the Mercury, a congress packet, was taken by the Veuf, Captain Keppel, near Mr. Laverne's, late president of the congress, who was bound on an embassy to Holland. He had thrown his papers overboard, but great part of them were recovered without having received much damage. He was brought to London, and examined before the privy council; in consequence of which he was committed close prisoner to the Tower on the 6th of October, on a charge of high treason. His papers were delivered to the ministry, and contributed to facilitate a rupture with Holland, as among them was found a sketch of a treaty of amity and commerce between the republic of Holland and the United States of America.\n\nAt the beginning of the year 1781, an affair happened in America, from which expectations were formed by Sir Henry Clinton, that some considerable advantage might be derived to the royal cause. The long\nAmerica. long continuance of the war, and the difficulties under which the congress laboured, had prevented their troops from being properly supplied with necessaries and conveniences. In consequence of this, on the 1st of January, the American troops that were huddled at Morris Town, and who formed what was called the Pennsylvania line, turned out, being in number about 1300, and declared, that they would serve no longer, unless their grievances were redressed, as they had not received their pay, or been furnished with the necessary clothing or provisions. It is said that they were somewhat inflamed with liquor, in consequence of rum having been distributed to them more liberally than usual, New Year's day, being considered as a kind of festival. A riot ensued, in which an officer was killed, and four wounded; five or six of the insurgents were also wounded. They then collected the artillery, stores, provisions, and waggons, and marched out of the camp. They passed by the quarters of General Wayne, who sent a message to them, requesting them to desist, or the consequences would prove fatal. They refused, and proceeded on their march till the evening, when they took post on an advantageous piece of ground, and elected officers from among themselves. On the second, they marched to Middlebrook, and on the third to Princeton, where they fixed their quarters. On that day a flag of truce was sent to them from the officers of the American camp, with a message, desiring to know what were their intentions. Some of them answered, that they had already served longer than the time for which they were enlisted, and would serve no longer; and others, that they would not return, unless their grievances were redressed. But at the same time they repeatedly, and in the strongest terms, denied being influenced by the least disaffection to the American cause, or having any intentions of deserting to the enemy.\n\nIntelligence of this transaction was soon conveyed to New York. A large body of British troops were immediately ordered to hold themselves in readiness to move on the shortest notice, it being hoped that the American revolters might be induced to join the royal army. Messengers were also sent to them from General Clinton, acquainting them that they should directly be taken under the protection of the British government; that they should have a free pardon for all former offences; and that the pay due to them from the congress should be faithfully paid them, without any expectation of military service, unless it should be voluntary, upon condition of their laying down their arms and returning to their allegiance. It was also recommended to them to move beyond the South river; and they were assured, that a body of British troops should be ready to protect them whenever they desired it. These propositions were rejected with disdain; and they even delivered up two of Sir Henry Clinton's messengers to the congress. Joseph Reed, Esq., president of the state of Pennsylvania, afterwards repaired to them at Princeton, and an accommodation took place: such of them as had served out their full terms were permitted to return to their own homes, and others again joined the American army, upon receiving satisfactory assurances that their grievances should be redressed.\n\nLord Cornwallis now began to make very vigorous exertions, in order to penetrate into North Carolina. On the 11th of January his lordship's army was in motion, and advancing towards that province; but was somewhat delayed by an attempt made by the Americans, under General Morgan, to make themselves masters of the valuable district of Ninety-six. In order to prevent this, Lord Cornwallis detached Lieutenant-colonel Tarleton, with 300 cavalry, 300 light infantry, the 7th regiment, the first battalion of the 71st regiment, and two three-pounders, to oppose the progress of Morgan, not doubting but that he would be able to perform this service effectually. The British troops came up with the Americans under General Morgan on the 17th of January. The Americans were drawn up in an open wood, and having been lately joined by some militia, were more numerous than the British troops under Lieutenant-colonel Tarleton; but the latter were so much better disciplined, that they had the utmost confidence of obtaining a speedy victory. The attack was begun by the first line of infantry, consisting of the 7th regiment and a corps of light infantry, with a troop of cavalry placed on each flank. The first battalion of the 71st and the remainder of the cavalry formed the reserve. The American line soon gave way, and their militia quitted the field; upon which the royal troops, supposing the victory already gained, engaged with ardour in the pursuit, and were thereby thrown into some disorder. General Morgan's corps, who were supposed to have been routed, then immediately faced about, and threw in a heavy fire upon the king's troops, which occasioned the utmost confusion amongst them; and they were at length totally defeated by the Americans. Four hundred of the British infantry were either killed, Colonel wounded, or taken prisoners: the loss of the cavalry Tarleton was much less considerable; but the two three-pounders fell into the hands of the Americans, together with the colours of the 7th regiment; and all the detachment of royal artillery were either killed or wounded in defence of their colours. Lieutenant-colonel Tarleton, however, made another effort: having assembled about 50 of his cavalry, with which he charged and repulsed Colonel Washington's horse, retook his baggage, and killed the Americans who were appointed in consequence to guard it. He then retreated to Hamilton's ford, near the mouth of Bullock's creek, carrying with him part of his baggage, and destroying the remainder.\n\nThis defeat of the troops under Tarleton was a severe stroke to Lord Cornwallis, as the loss of his light infantry was a great disadvantage to him. The day after that event, he employed in collecting the remains of Tarleton's corps, and in endeavouring to form a junction with General Leslie, who had been ordered to march towards him with a body of British troops from Wynnsborough. Considerable exertions were then made by part of the army, without baggage, to retake the prisoners in the hands of the Americans, and to intercept General Morgan's corps on its retreat to the Catawba. But that American officer, after his defeat of Tarleton, had made forced marches up into the country, and crossed the Catawba the evening before a great rain, which swelled the river to such a degree, as to prevent the royal army from crossing for several days; during which time the British prisoners were got over the Yadkin; whence they proceeded to Dan River,\nLord Cornwallis employed a halt of two days in collecting some flour, and in destroying superfluous baggage and all his waggons, excepting those laden with hospital stores, salt, and ammunition, and four reserved empty in readiness for sick or wounded. Being thus freed from all unnecessary encumbrances, he marched through North Carolina with great rapidity, and penetrated to the remotest extremities of that province on the banks of the Dan. His progress was sometimes impeded by parties of the militia, and force skirmishes ensued, but he met with no very considerable opposition. On the first of February, the king's troops crossed the Catawba at Mr. Cowan's Ford, where General Davidton, with a party of American militia, was posted in order to oppose their passage; but he falling by the first discharge, the royal troops made good their landing, and the militia retreated. When Lord Cornwallis arrived at Hillborough, he erected the king's standard, and invited, by proclamation, all loyal subjects to repair to it, and to stand forth and take an active part in afflicting his lordship to restore order and government. He had been taught to believe that the king's friends were numerous in that part of the country; but the event did not confirm the truth of the representations that had been given. The royalists were but few in number, and some of them too timid to join the king's standard. There were, indeed, about 200 who proceeded to Hillborough, under Colonel Pyle, in order to avow their attachment to the royal cause; but they were met accidentally, and surrounded by a detachment from the American army, by whom a number of them are said to have been killed when they were begging for quarter, without making the least resistance. Meanwhile General Greene was marching with great expedition with the troops under his command, in order to form a junction with other corps of American troops, that he might thereby be enabled to put some effectual stop to the progress of Lord Cornwallis.\n\nIn other places some considerable advantages were obtained by the royal arms. On the 4th of January, some ships of war, with a number of transports, on board which was a large body of troops under the command of Brigadier-general Arnold, arrived at Westover, about 140 miles from the capes of Virginia, where the troops immediately landed and marched to Richmond; which they reached without opposition, the militia that was collected having retreated on their approach. Lieutenant-colonel Simcoe marched from hence with a detachment of the British troops to Weatham, where they destroyed one of the finest foundries for cannon in America, and a large quantity of stores and cannon. General Arnold, on his arrival at Richmond, found there large quantities of salt, rum, sail-cloth, tobacco, and other merchandise; and that part of these commodities which was public property he destroyed. The British troops afterwards attacked and dispersed some small parties of the Americans, took some stores and a few pieces of cannon, and on the 20th of the same month marched into Portsmouth. On the 25th Captain Barclay, with several ships of war, and a body of troops under the command of Major Craig, arrived in Cape Fear river. The troops landed about nine miles from Wilmington, and on the 28th entered that town. It was understood that their having possession of that town, and being masters of Cape Fear river, would be productive of very beneficial effects to Lord Cornwallis's army.\n\nGeneral Greene having effected a junction about the 10th of March with a continental regiment of what were called eighteen months men, and two large bodies of militia belonging to Virginia and North Carolina, formed a resolution to attack the British troops under the command of Lord Cornwallis. The American army marched from the High Rock Ford on the 12th of the month, and on the 14th arrived at Guildford. Lord Cornwallis, from the information he had received of the motions of the American general, concluded what were his designs. As they approached more nearly to each other, a few skirmishes ensued between some advanced parties, in which the king's troops had the advantage. On the morning of the 15th, Lord Cornwallis marched with his troops at daybreak in order to meet the Americans, or to attack them in their encampment. About four miles from Guildford, the advanced guard of the British army, commanded by Lieutenant-colonel Tarleton, fell in with a corps of the Americans, consisting of Lieutenant-colonel Lee's legion, some Black Mountain men and Virginia militia, with whom he had a severe skirmish, but whom he at length obliged to retreat.\n\nThe greater part of the country in which the action happened is a wilderness, with a few cleared fields interspersed. The American army, which was superior to the royal in point of numbers, was posted on a rising ground about a mile and a half from Guildford court-house. It was drawn up in three lines: the front line was composed of the North Carolinian militia, under the command of the generals Butler and Eaton; the second line of Virginian militia, commanded by the generals Stephens and Lawson, forming two brigades; the third line, consisting of two brigades, one of Virginia and one of Maryland continental troops, commanded by General Huger and Colonel Williams. Lieutenant-colonel Washington, with the dragoons of the first and third regiments, a detachment of light infantry composed of continental troops, and a regiment of riflemen under Colonel Lynch, formed a corps of observation for the security of their right flank. Lieutenant-colonel Lee, with his legion, a detachment of light infantry, and a corps of riflemen under Colonel Campbell, formed a corps of observation for the security of their left flank. The attack of the American army was directed to be made by Lord Cornwallis in the following order: On the right, the regiment of Bute and the 71st regiment, led by Major-general Leslie, and supported by the first battalion of guards; on the left, the 23rd and 33rd regiments, led by Lieutenant-colonel Webster, and supported by the grenadiers and second battalion of guards commanded by Brigadier-general O'Hara; the Yagers and light infantry of the guards remained in a wood on the left of the guns, and the cavalry in the road, ready to act as circumstances might require.\n\nAbout half an hour after one in the afternoon, the action commenced by a cannonade, which lasted about twenty minutes; when the British troops advanced in three\nAmerica, three columns and attacked the North Carolinian brigades with great vigour, and soon obliged part of these troops, who behaved very ill, to quit the field; but the Virginian militia gave them a warm reception, and kept up a heavy fire for a long time, till being beaten back, the action became general almost everywhere. The American corps under the lieutenant-colonels Washington and Lee were also warmly engaged, and did considerable execution. Lieutenant-colonel Tarleton had directions to keep his cavalry compact, and not to charge without positive orders, excepting to protect any of the corps from the most evident danger of being defeated. The excessive thickness of the woods rendered the British bayonets of little use, and enabled the broken corps of Americans to make frequent stands with an irregular fire. The second battalion of the guards first gained the clear ground near Guildford court-house, and found a corps of continental infantry, superior in number, formed in an open field on the left of the road. Delirious of figuring themselves, they immediately attacked and soon defeated them, taking two six-pounders; but as they pursued the Americans into the wood with too much ardour, they were thrown into confusion by a heavy fire, and instantly charged and driven back into the field by Lieutenant-colonel Washington's dragoons, with the loss of the six-pounders they had taken. But the American cavalry were afterwards repulsed, and the two six-pounders again fell into the hands of the British troops. The spirited exertions of Brigadier-general O'Hara and of Lieutenant-colonel Tarleton, greatly contributed to bring the action to a termination. The British troops having at length broken the second Maryland regiment, and turned the left flank of the Americans, got into the rear of the Virginian brigade, and appeared to be gaining their right, which would have encircled the whole of the continental troops, when General Greene thought it prudent to order a retreat. Many of the American militia differed in the woods; but the continental troops retreated in good order to the Reedy Fork river, and crossed at the ford about three miles from the field of action, and there halted. When they had collected their stragglers, they retreated to the iron works, 10 miles distant from Guildford, where they encamped. They lost their artillery and two wagons laden with ammunition. It was a hard-fought action, and lasted an hour and a half. Of the British troops, the loss, as stated by Lord Cornwallis, was 332 killed, wounded, and missing. General Greene, in his account of the action transmitted to the congress, stated the loss of the continental troops to amount to 329 killed, wounded, and missing; but he made no estimate of the loss of the militia. Lieutenant-colonel Stuart was killed in the action; and Lieutenant-colonel Webster, and the captains Schutz, Maynard, and Goodriche, died of the wounds that they received in it. Brigadier-general O'Hara, Brigadier-general Howard, and Lieutenant-colonel Tarleton, were also wounded. Of the Americans, the principal officer killed was Major Anderson of the Maryland line, and the generals Stephens and Huger were wounded.\n\nThe British troops underwent great hardships in the course of this campaign; and in a letter of Lord Cornwallis's to Lord George Germain, dated March 17th, he observed, that \"the soldiers had been two days America, without bread.\" His lordship quitted Guildford three days after the battle which was fought in that place; and on the 7th of April arrived in the neighbourhood of Wilmington. Soon after, General Greene, notwithstanding his late defeat, endeavoured to make some vigorous attempts against the king's forces in South Carolina. Lord Rawdon had been appointed to defend the post of Camden, with about 800 British and provincials; and on the 19th of April General Greene appeared before that place with a large body of continentals and militia. He found it, however, impossible to attempt to storm the town with any prospect of success; and therefore endeavoured to take such a position as should induce the British troops to fall from their works. He posted the Americans about a mile from the town, on an eminence which was covered with woods, and flanked on the left by an impaffable General Rawdon marched out of Camden, and with great gallanty attacked General Greene in his camp. The Americans made a vigorous resistance, but were at last compelled to give way; and the pursuit is said to have been continued three miles. For some time after the action commenced, General Gates entertained great hopes of defeating the British troops; in which, as the Americans were superior in point of numbers, he would probably have succeeded, had not some capital military errors been committed by one or two of the officers who served under him. On the American side Colonel Washington had behaved extremely well in this action, having made upwards of 200 of the English prisoners, with ten or twelve officers, before he perceived that the Americans were abandoning the field of battle. The loss of the English was about one hundred killed and wounded. Upwards of 100 of the Americans were taken prisoners; and, according to the account published by General Greene, they had 126 killed and wounded. After this action, Greene retreated to Rugeley's mills, 12 miles from Camden, in order to collect his troops and wait for reinforcements.\n\nNotwithstanding the advantage which Lord Rawdon had obtained over General Greene at Camden, that nobleman soon after found it necessary to quit that post; and the Americans made themselves masters of several other posts that were occupied by the king's troops, and the garrisons of which were obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of war. These troops were afterwards exchanged under a cartel which took place between Lord Cornwallis and General Greene for the release of all prisoners of war, in the southern district. Afterwards these events, General Greene laid close siege to Ninety-six, which was considered as the most commanding and important of all the posts in the back but irreputable country; and on the 19th of June he attempted to storm the garrison, but was repulsed by the gallantry of the British troops, with the loss, as it is said, of 75 killed and 150 wounded. General Greene then raised the siege, and retired with his army behind the Saluda, to a strong situation within 16 miles of Ninety-six.\n\nOn the 18th of April a large body of British troops, under the command of Major-general Philips and Brigadier-general Arnold, embarked at Portsmouth in Virginia, in order to proceed on an expedition for the purpose of destroying some of the American stores. A party\nAmerica, party of light infantry were sent ten or twelve miles up the Chickahominy; where they destroyed several armed ships, foundry warehouses, and the American slate ship yards. At Peterburgh, the English destroyed 4000 hogheads of tobacco, one ship, and a number of small vessels on the stocks and in the river. At Chesterfield court-house, they burnt a range of barracks for 2000 men and 300 barrels of flour. At a place called Oxborn's, they made themselves masters of several vessels loaded with cordage and flour, and destroyed about 2000 hogheads of tobacco, and foundry vessels were sunk and burnt. At Warwick, they burnt a magazine of 500 barrels of flour, some fine mills belonging to Colonel Carey, a large range of public rope-walks and storehouses, tan and bark houses full of hides and bark, and great quantities of tobacco. A like destruction of stores and goods was made in other parts of Virginia.\n\nFrom the account already given of some of the principal military operations of the present year in America, it appears, that though considerable advantages had been gained by the royal troops, yet no event had taken place from which it could rationally be expected that the final termination of the war would be favourable to Great Britain. It was also a disadvantageous circumstance, that there was a misunderstanding between Admiral Arbuthnot and Sir Henry Clinton, and a mutual disapprobation of each other's conduct. This was manifest from their despatches to government, and especially from those of General Clinton, whose expressions respecting the conduct of the admiral were by no means equivocal.\n\nOn the 16th of March 1781, a partial action happened off the capes of Virginia, between the fleet under Admiral Arbuthnot, consisting of seven ships of the line and one fifty-gun ship, and a French squadron, consisting of the same number of ships of the line and one forty-gun ship. Some of the ships in both fleets received considerable damage in the action, and the loss of the English was 30 killed and 73 wounded; but no ship was taken on either side. The British fleet had, however, considerably the advantage; as the French were obliged to retire, and were supposed to be prevented by this action from carrying troops up the Chesapeake, in order to attack General Arnold and impede the progress of Lord Cornwallis. But it was an unfortunate circumstance, that some time before this engagement, the Romulus, a ship of 44 guns, was captured by the French off the capes of Virginia.\n\nLord Cornwallis, after his victory over General Greene at Guilford, proceeded, as we have seen, to Wilmington, where he arrived on the 7th of April. But before he reached that place, he published a proclamation, calling upon all loyal subjects to stand forth and take an active part in restoring good order and government; and declaring to all persons who had engaged in the present rebellion against his majesty's authority, but who were now convinced of their error, and desirous of returning to their duty and allegiance, that if they would surrender themselves with their arms and ammunition at head-quarters, or to the officer commanding in the district contiguous to their respective places of residence, on or before the 20th of that month, they would be permitted to return to their homes upon giving a military parole; they would be protected in their persons and properties from all sorts of violence from the British troops; and would be restored as soon as possible to all the privileges of legal and constitutional government. But it does not appear that any considerable number of the Americans were allured by these promises to give any evidences of their attachment to the royal cause.\n\nOn the 26th of May, his lordship arrived at Peterburgh in Virginia, where he joined a body of British troops that had been under the command of Major-general Philips; but the command of which, in consequence of the death of that officer, had devolved upon Brigadier-general Arnold. Before this juncture he had encountered considerable inconveniences from the difficulty of procuring provisions and forage; so that in a letter to Sir Henry Clinton, he informed him, that his cavalry wanted every thing, and his infantry everything but shoes. He added, that he had experienced the difficulties of marching hundreds of miles in a country chiefly hostile, without one active or useful friend, without intelligence, and without communication with any part of the country.\n\nOn the 26th of June, about six miles from Williamsburg, Lieutenant-colonel Simcoe, and 350 of the actions, queen's rangers, with 80 mounted yagers, were attacked by a much superior body of the Americans; but whom they repulsed with great gallantry and with equal success, making four officers and twenty private men prisoners. The loss of the Americans in this action is said to have been upwards of 120, and that of the British troops not more than 40.\n\nOn the 6th of July an action happened near the Green Springs in Virginia, between a reconnoitring party of the Americans under General Wayne, amounting to about 800, and a large part of the British army under Lord Cornwallis; in which the Americans had 127 killed and wounded, and the loss of the royal troops is supposed to have been considerably greater. It was an action in which no small degree of military skill and courage was exhibited by the Americans. In a variety of skirmishes, the marquis La Fayette very much distinguished himself, and displayed the utmost ardour in the American cause.\n\nIn South Carolina, an action happened on the 9th of September near the Eata Springs, between a large body of British troops under the command of Lieutenant-colonel Stuart and a much superior body of Americans, said to amount to more than 4000, under the command of General Greene. It was an obstinate engagement, and lasted near two hours; but the Americans were defeated, and two of their fix-pounders fell into the hands of the English. The loss, however, of the royal troops was very considerable; amounting to more than 400 killed and wounded, and upwards of 200 missing.\n\nIn the course of the same month, General Arnold Expedition was sent on an expedition against New London, in Connecticut, where he destroyed a great part of the town shipping, and an immense quantity of naval stores, European manufactures, and East and West India commodities. The town itself was also burnt, which is said to have been unavoidable, on account of the explosion of great quantities of gunpowder which happened to be in the storehouses that were let on fire. A fort, of which it was thought necessary to gain possession in this\nAmerica; this expedition was not taken without considerable loss. This was Fort Griffield; which was defended by the Americans with great gallantry, and the assault was made by the English with equal bravery. The British troops entered the works with fixed bayonets, and were opposed with great vigour by the garrison with long spears. After a most obstinate defence of near forty minutes, the assailants gained possession of the fort, in which 85 Americans were found dead, and 60 wounded, most of them mortally. Of the British troops Major Montgomery was killed by a spear in entering the American works; and 192 men were also killed and wounded in this expedition.\n\nNotwithstanding the signal advantages that Lord Cornwallis had obtained over the Americans, his situation in Virginia began by degrees to be very critical; and the rather because he did not receive those reinforcements and supplies from Sir Henry Clinton, of which he had formed expectations, and which he conceived to be necessary to the success of his operations. Indeed, the commander in chief was prevented from sending those reinforcements to Lord Cornwallis which he otherwise might have done, by his fears respecting New York, against which he entertained great apprehensions that General Washington intended to make a very formidable attack. In fact, that able American general appears to have taken much pains, and to have employed great ingenuity, in order to lead Sir Henry Clinton to entertain this imagination. Letters, expressive of this intention, fell into the hands of Sir Henry, which were manifestly written with a design that they should be intercepted, and only with a view to amuse and deceive the British general. The project was successful; and by a variety of judicious military manoeuvres, in which he completely out-generalled the British commander, he increased his apprehensions about New York, and prevented him from sending proper assistance to Lord Cornwallis. Having for a considerable time kept Sir Henry Clinton in perpetual alarm in New York; though with an army much inferior to the garrison of that city, General Washington suddenly quitted his camp at White Plains, crossed the Delaware, and marched towards Virginia, apparently with a design to attack Lord Cornwallis. Sir Henry Clinton then received information, that the count de Grasse, with a large French fleet, was expected every moment in the Chesapeake, in order to co-operate with General Washington. He immediately endeavoured, both by land and water, to communicate this information to Lord Cornwallis; and also sent him assurances that he would either reinforce him by every possible means in his power, or make the best diversion he could in his favour. In the mean time, Lord Cornwallis had taken possession of the ports of York Town and Gloucester in Virginia, where he fortified himself in the best manner he was able.\n\nOn the 28th of August, Sir Samuel Hood, with a squadron from the West Indies, joined the squadron under the command of Admiral Graves before New York. It was then necessary, on account of the situation of Lord Cornwallis, that they should immediately proceed to the Chesapeake; but some time appears to have been needlessly lost, though Admiral Hood was extremely anxious that no delay might be made. They arrived, however, in the Chesapeake, on the 5th of September, with 19 ships of the line; where they found America, the count de Grasse, who had anchored in that bay on the 30th of August, with 24 ships of the line. The French admiral had previously landed a large body of troops, which had been brought from Rhode Island, and who immediately marched to join the American army under General Washington. The British and American fleets came to an action on the same day in between which the former arrived in the Chesapeake. On board British and French the British fleet 90 were killed and 246 wounded; fleets off the fomie of the ships were greatly damaged in the engagement; Chesapeake, and the Terrible, a 74 gun ship, was so much shattered, that it was afterwards found necessary to let fire to it. That this action had not been favourable to the English, was manifest from the event; the fleets continued in fight of each other for five days successively, and sometimes were very near; but at length the French fleet all anchored within the Cape, so as to block up the passage. Admiral Graves, who was the commander-in-chief, then called a council of war, in which it was resolved that the fleet should proceed to New York, that the ships might be there put into the best state for the service; and thus were the French left masters of the navigation of the Chesapeake.\n\nBefore the news of this action had reached New York, a council of war was held there, in which it was resolved, that 5000 men should be embarked on board the king's ships, in order to proceed to the affiance of Lord Cornwallis. But when it was known that the French were absolute masters of the navigation of the Chesapeake, it was thought inexpedient to send off that reinforcement immediately. In another council of war, it was resolved, that as Lord Cornwallis had provisions to last him till the end of October, it was advisable to wait for more favourable accounts from Admiral Graves, or for the arrival of Admiral Digby, who was expected with three ships of the line. It was not then known at New York, that Admiral Graves had determined to return with the whole fleet to that port.\n\nIn the mean time, the most effectual measures were adopted by General Washington for surrounding the Lord Cornwallis army under Lord Cornwallis. A large body of French troops, under the command of Lieutenant-general the count de Rochambeau, with a very considerable train of artillery, assisted in the enterprise. The Americans amounted to near 8000 continentals and 5000 militia. General Washington was invested with the authority of commander-in-chief of these combined forces of America and France. On the 29th of September, the investment of York Town was complete, and the British army quite blocked up. The day following, Sir Henry Clinton wrote a letter to Lord Cornwallis, containing assurances that he would do everything in his power to relieve him, and some information concerning the steps that would be taken for that purpose. A duplicate of this letter was sent to his lordship by Major Cochran on the 3rd of October. That gentleman, who was a very gallant officer, went in a vessel to the capes, and made his way to Lord Cornwallis, through the whole French fleet, in an open boat. He got to York Town on the 10th of the month; and soon after his arrival had his head carried off by a cannon ball.\n\nAfter the return of Admiral Graves to New York, a council of war was held, consisting of flag and gene-\nAmerica, in which it was resolved, that a large body of troops should be embarked on board the king's ships as soon as they were refitted, and that the exertions of both fleet and army should be made in order to form a junction with Lord Cornwallis. Sir Henry Clinton himself embarked on board the fleet, with upwards of 7000 troops, on the 18th; they arrived off Cape Charles, at the entrance of the Chesapeake, on the 24th, where they received intelligence that Lord Cornwallis had been obliged to capitulate five days before.\n\nIt was on the 19th of October that Lord Cornwallis surrendered himself and his whole army, by capitulation, prisoners to the combined armies of America and France, under the command of General Washington. He made a defence suitable to the character he had before acquired for courage and military skill; but was compelled to submit to untoward circumstances and superior numbers. It was agreed by the articles of capitulation, that the British troops were to be prisoners to the United States of America, and the seamen to the French king, to whose officers also the British vessels found at York Town and Gloucester were to be delivered up. The British prisoners amounted to more than 6000; but many of them, at the time of surrender, were incapable of duty. A considerable number of cannon, and a large quantity of military stores, fell into the hands of the Americans on this occasion.\n\nAs no rational expectation now remained of a subjugation of the colonies, the military operations that succeeded in America were of little consequence. Some incon siderable actions and skirmishes did indeed take place after that event; in which the refugees chiefly distinguished themselves, and discovered an inveterate animosity against the Americans. On the 5th of May 1782, Sir Guy Carleton arrived at New York, being appointed to the command of the British troops in America in the room of Sir Henry Clinton. Two days after his arrival, he wrote a letter to General Washington, acquainting him, that Admiral Digby was joined with himself in a commission to treat of peace with the people of America; transmitting to him, at the same time, some papers tending to manifest the pacific disposition of the government and people of Britain towards those of America. He also desired a passport for Mr Morgan, who was appointed to transmit a similar letter of compliment to the congress. General Washington declined signing any passport till he had taken the opinion of congress upon that measure; and by them he was directed to refuse any passport for such a purpose. However, another letter was sent to General Washington, dated the 2d of August, and signed by Sir Guy Carleton and Rear-admiral Digby, in which they informed him, that they were acquainted by authority that negotiations for a general peace had already commenced at Paris; that Mr Grenville was invested with full powers to treat with all the parties at war; and was then at Paris in the execution of his commission. They farther informed him, that his majesty, in order to remove all obstacles to that peace which he so ardently wished to restore, had commanded his ministers to direct Mr Grenville, that the independency of the thirteen provinces should be proposed by him, in the first instance, instead of making it the condition of a general treaty. But some jealousies were entertained by the Americans, that it was the design of the British court either to disunite them, or to bring them to treat of a peace separately from their ally the king of France; they therefore resolved, that any man, or in company of men, who should presume to make any proposition or partial convention or agreement with the king of Great Britain, or with any commissioner or commissioners under the crown of Great Britain, ought to be considered and treated as open and avowed enemies of the United States of America; and also that those states could not with propriety hold any conference or treaty with any commissioners on the part of Great Britain, unless they should, as a preliminary thereto, either withdraw their fleets and armies, or else, in positive or express terms, acknowledge the independence of the said states. They likewise resolved, that any propositions which might be made by the court of Great Britain, in any manner tending to violate the treaty subsisting between them and the king of France, ought to be treated with every mark of indignity and contempt.\n\nIn the month of June, the town of Savannah, and different parts of the whole province of Georgia, were evacuated by the places evacuated by the king's troops; as was also Charlestown, South Carolina, about the close of the year. In the mean time, the negotiations for peace being continued, provisional articles of peace were signed at Paris on the 30th of November by the commissioner of His Britannic Majesty and the American commissioners, in which his majesty acknowledged the united colonies of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, to be \"free, sovereign, and independent states.\" They had constituted themselves such on the 4th of July 1776; they had been acknowledged such by the French king on the 30th of January 1778, when he concluded with them a treaty of amity and commerce; Holland had acknowledged them as such April 16th 1782; Sweden acknowledged them as such February 5th 1783; Denmark the 25th February, Spain in March, and Russia in July, the same year.\n\nAccording to the report of the committee appointed for that purpose, the Foreign Debt of the United States incurred by the war, amounted to 7,885,085 sterling; and the Domestic Debt to 34,115,290, total at 48s. 6d. each, equal to 9,450,084 sterling, the interest of which at 6 per cent., is 567,000l. But the cost to Great Britain is moderately computed at 115,654,914l., and the additional annual burden by it 4,557,575l. since January 1775. As to the loss of men during the unhappy war, the States of America, according to authentic estimates, lost by the sword and in prison near 80,000 men; and by the British returns at New York, the number of soldiers killed in the service amounted to 43,633.\n\nSuch was the end of the contest between Great Britain and America: A contest in which the latter, consequently, obtained an independent rank among the nations, that may be productive of more important consequences than can yet be foreseen; and in which the former, happily for herself, was forced to relinquish a sovereignty that served only to repress her own internal industry.\nAmerica, industry, and retard her prosperity. She has, in the event, only suffered a diminution of unwieldy empire, which has been more than compensated by an increase of population, commerce, revenues, and wealth.\n\nAs to the general constitution of the American States:—By the acts of confederation and perpetual union, each of the colonies contracted a reciprocal treaty of alliance and friendship for their common defense, for the maintenance of their liberties, and for their general and mutual advantage; obliging themselves to assist each other against all violence that might threaten all, or any one of them, and to repel in common all the attacks that might be levelled against all, or any one of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, commerce, or under any other pretext whatsoever.\n\nEach of the colonies referred to themselves alone the exclusive right of regulating their internal government, and of framing laws in all matters not included in the articles of confederation.—But for the more convenient management of the general interest of the United States, it was determined, that delegates should be annually appointed in such manner as the legislature of each state should direct, to meet in congress on the first Monday of November of every year, with a power referred to each state to recall its delegates, or any of them, at any time within the year, and to lend others in their stead for the remainder of the year. No state is to be represented in congress by less than two, nor more than seven members; and no person is capable of being a delegate for more than three years, in any term of six years; nor is any person, being a delegate, capable of holding any office under the United States, for which he, or any other for his benefit, shall receive any salary, fees, or emolument of any kind. In determining questions in the United States, in congress assembled, each state is to have one vote. Every state is to abide by the determinations of the United States in congress assembled, on all questions which are submitted to them by the confederation. The articles of confederation are to be inviolably observed by every state, and the union is to be perpetual; nor is any alteration, at any time hereafter, to be made in any of them, unless such alteration be agreed to in a congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislature of every state.\n\nIn the mean time, the return of peace was very far from immediately producing in the United States, all that tranquillity and prosperity, which the eager supporters of the revolution had promised to themselves and their country. The public finances were in such a state of entire derangement, as rendered it utterly impossible to make payment of the arrears due to the army. Accordingly the whole officers and soldiers that composed this body, which at the end of a long war, is always so formidable and dangerous to a free state, were extremely discontented. Attempts were made, by anonymous publications, to inflame their minds, which were already sufficiently agitated, and to induce them to unite in redressing their own grievances, while they had still arms in their hands. During the time that matters were in this state, had the commander in chief of the army been a less virtuous man, it is not impossible, that the freedom of America might have been overturned, and these colonies might have exchanged the mild government of Britain, for a military usurpa-\n\nVol. II. Part I.\nAmerica, payments with which they were afflicted, the revenue of the union was ill paid, and all its exertions were enfeebled. The congress had no power of making general commercial regulations to bind the whole states, nor could it even interfere to prevent their waging war against each other if they thought fit. Hence, from the mutual jealousies of thirteen separate legislatures, the most discordant regulations arose.\n\nAs soon as the war was at an end, Great Britain naturally treated the American states as a foreign nation, and prohibited, under pain of confiscation, any of their commodities to be conveyed to the British West India islands, unless in British built vessels, navigated by British mariners. Thus the Americans were excluded from that branch of commerce in which they had formerly obtained most of the ready money or specie that came into their country. With a view to induce Great Britain to relax the severity of this and other regulations, injurious to their commerce, some of the American states imposed heavy taxes upon goods of British manufacture. Other states took advantage of this circumstance, to invite the British merchants to frequent their ports exclusively, and not only received all British commodities free from any duty, but they suffered their people to engage in smuggling traffic, for the transportation of these commodities into the states in which they had been heavily taxed. Thus the same commodities which were severely taxed in Philadelphia, were imported without difficulty or expense into the Jerseys, on the opposite side of the Delaware, and were daily conveyed by illicit traders across the river. Hence arose a spirit of commercial jealousy, and a warfare between the different legislatures, which filled the whole country with a degree of diffusion, little short of hostility.\n\nThe Americans were at the same time in a great measure excluded from the trade to the Mediterranean. They could no longer navigate that sea with safety, a privilege which as British subjects they had always enjoyed. As the congress possessed no funds, wherewith to enter into a compromise with the piratical states of Barbary, to whom all Europe pays tribute, the American vessels were constantly exposed to danger. Being unable to defend themselves from the corsairs, they were obliged either to relinquish the beneficial trade which they had formerly possessed in that quarter, or to endure it at a ruinous premium.\n\nIndependent of these partial evils, the general balance of trade speedily became extremely unfavourable to the United States. The debts due from the merchants to Great Britain, the payment of which had been prohibited by congress during the war, were now impatiently demanded. The American merchants were almost universally sued, and the remnant of their effects seized by the agents of British houses. To relieve their own distresses, they proceeded against the retailers, who had been unable to pay them during the war, and to whom peace had not yet restored prosperity. In this way the old traders were almost universally ruined, and compelled to abandon all commercial concerns. At the same time, however, as the ravages of armies and the want of a free communication between Europe and America during the war, had multiplied the wants of the latter, an inundation of European manufactures, was one of the first effects that followed the establishment of peace. These were purchased by the Americans far beyond their means of payment, and thus almost every person connected with commerce was brought to ruin, and a great part of the people were involved in their distresses.\n\nAll these evils were aggravated by the want of an efficient government. Congress had incurred debts, and issued paper money for payment of the interest of these debts, or of the current public expenses; but as it possessed no efficient revenue, its paper was soon depreciated, and became an object of speculation. Dishonest men paid their debts with it, and thus defrauded their creditors, and the morality of the people was severely wounded. The several states had themselves also contracted debts for the war. Some states willing to fund their debts, imposed taxes for the purpose, which were so far beyond the means of the inhabitants, that they could not be levied without extreme rigour. The extremities to which government proceeded in these cases, occasioned general discontent, and even produced an insurrection in the state of Massachusetts.—From all these causes, an embarrassed commerce, a depreciated paper money, which inundated all America, the inability of the laws to enforce payment of the taxes, a spirit of jealousy between the different states, and the inadequacy of congress to apply a remedy to these complicated evils, something little short of anarchy was produced in the United States.\n\nIn the midst of these calamities, a proposition was made in 1785, in the house of delegates in Virginia, to a new convention to appoint commissioners to meet such commissioners as might be appointed by other states, to form a system of commercial regulations for the United States. Accordingly, several states appointed commissioners, who, in 1786, assembled at Annapolis. But, as the states were not all represented, and the commissioners thought their own powers too limited to authorize them to propose a proper remedy for the evils that prevailed upon their country, they agreed to recommend a general convention, to be held at Philadelphia the following year, with power to frame a general plan of government for the United States. In consequence of this recommendation, in May 1787 delegates from all the states, except Rhode Island, assembled at Philadelphia, and chose General Washington for their president. They sat four months, and deliberated in private. Their debates have never been published; but they are known to have been extremely animated. The public opinion was, at that period, by no means fixed with regard to the kind of government that ought to be adopted. At the commencement of the war, a considerable party disliked the violent measures of their countrymen. At different periods about 30,000 men had been in the service of Great Britain. This implied that a large body of royalists existed in America. Even of those who disliked the supremacy of Britain, and wished to establish American independence, many were by no means prepared to relish the whole principles of a republican government. When the question, therefore, came to be agitated concerning the best political constitution for the United States, a variety of opinions were broached. These, however, in a great measure resolved themselves into two systems: one party, at that time called federalists, wished to establish a constitution as purely republican as possible; and the other party,\nparty, then called antifederalists, wished to give the new government a monarchical character and tendency. It is even said that some were not wanting who eagerly desired to copy closely the model of the British constitution. This was not wonderful. Under the principles of that constitution Britain had become a great nation, and America had prospered. It was the most free form of government at that time known. The vices which had crept into it were evidently independent of its radical structure, and might easily be avoided in a new country. By adopting this tried and well-known form of government, it was said that the hazard of new experiments would be avoided, and the states might at once place themselves in a secure train of prosperity. But the feelings of the people at the time were, upon the whole, hostile to these reasonings. Their sufferings, in consequence of British hostility, were too recent to permit them to regard with complacency, in speculation, a system which in practice they had taught themselves to dislike. Their pride would not suffer them to become the servile imitators of another nation; and the public sentiments were so generally republican, as to lead them to dislike all kinds of permanent or hereditary ranks and privileges. Hence, when in the early sittings of the convention of Philadelphia a plan was presented, which proposed the establishment of a president for life, and senators for life, and expressed a desire to render these offices hereditary, and to subject the laws of the respective states to the review of the general government, it met with no adequate support; and a committee was appointed to prepare a plan of a new constitution for the United States.\n\nIn addition to the divisions that existed among the members of this convention, from their tendency to republican or to monarchical principles, they were also divided in consequence of the different interests of their constituents. The votes were given by states, and when the delegates of a state differed in opinion, the majority was reckoned the vote of the state. The greater states, after a considerable contest, carried the point, that in the new house of representatives, the representation should stand upon the basis of the population of each state, though they were under the necessity of conceding to the lesser states, that each state should be equally represented in the new senate. Virginia and the southern states, with the aid of the antifederalists, in opposition to the federalist or republican party, obtained the strange privilege, in a nation of freemen, of numbering three fifths of their slaves as a part of their population in all questions about the number of their representatives. In other questions, however, the delegates of the great states frequently voted with the federalist party, though, upon the whole, the more zealous republicans were greatly disturbed by many articles of the new constitution. Of these the celebrated Dr Franklin was one. He had the integrity and the moderation, however, on this occasion, to prefer the peace of his country to his private political opinions; and when the plan was completed, he proposed that it should be signed by all the members of the convention, that from their apparent unanimity, it might have the better chance of being accepted by the different states. \"In the long career I have already run\" (said that eminent statesman and philosopher), \"I have more than once been compelled to abandon opinions I had openly maintained, and which I thought well founded from the deep consideration I had given them. As I grow older I am more and more disposed to question my own judgment, and to pay respect to that of others. There are some men, as well as some religious sects, who imagine that reason is entirely on their side; and that their opponents plunge deeper into error in proportion as they depart from their opinions. Struck with these examples, which are but too common, I accept of this constitution with all its faults, even supposing I am not mistaken in my opinion of its faults; for I am persuaded that a general government is necessary to our safety, and that no form of government that is well administered is incapable of producing the happiness of the people; and I think there is reason to believe that this constitution will be well administered for a number of years, and that it will not end, as too many other governments have done, in despair, unless the American people shall reach that degree of corruption in which, at once incapable of being directed by a free constitution, and unworthy of its blessings, despair becomes necessary to their existence. I therefore give my vote for this constitution, both because, in the present circumstances of this nation, I cannot hope to see one more perfect, and because I am not sure this is not as perfect as any it can have. I make a sacrifice of the opinion I have expressed of its defects to the public happiness. I have never uttered my objections out of this house; here they had their birth, and here I wish them to be forever buried. If every one of us who have opposed the constitution, when we return to our constituents, were to unfold the motives of our opposition, and endeavour to gain partisans to our side, perhaps we might prevent the unanimous adoption of the constitution; but, by this, we should only lose the advantage which the appearance of unanimity will give us with foreign nations, and indeed with our own people. The general good opinion of a nation respecting its government is as necessary as the wisdom and integrity of its administration, to the happiness of its people. I trust, therefore, both for our own safety as members of the community, and for the sake of our posterity, that we shall be of one mind, in recommending this constitution wherever our influence reaches; and that afterwards our whole thoughts will be bent to its happy administration. I cannot forbear to form the wish that such of us as still entertain objections to this constitution will follow my example, and doubt a little of their infallibility, and sign this constitutional act, that no question may be left of our unanimity.\" The authority and example of Franklin prevailed, and the following constitution was unanimously transmitted by the convention to the different states for their acceptance.\n\n\"We, the people of the United States, in order to constitute a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves, and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America.\n\nArticle I.\n\nSection 1.

They shall in all cases, except treason, felony, and breach of peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in either house, they shall not be questioned in any other place.\n\nNo senator or representative shall, during the time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no person holding any office under the United States shall be a member of either house during his continuance in office.\n\nAll bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives; but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.\n\nEvery bill which shall have passed the house of representatives and the senate, shall, before it becomes\nA law, if presented to the president of the United States; if he approve, he shall sign it; but if not, he shall return it with his objections to that house in which it first have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to re-consider it. If after such re-consideration two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be re-considered; and if approved by two-thirds of that house, it shall become a law. But in all cases the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays; and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each house respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the president within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the congress, by their adjournment, prevent its return; in which case it shall not be a law.\n\nEvery order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary, (except on a question of adjournment), shall be presented to the president of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or, being disapproved by him, shall be re-passed by two-thirds of the senate and house of representatives; according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.\n\nSect. 8.

He shall hold his office during the term of four years, and together with the vice-president, chosen for the same term, be elected as follows:\n\nEach state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the states may be entitled in the congress; but no senator, or representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States shall be appointed an elector.\n\nThe electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot, for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list they shall sign, and certify, and transmit sealed, to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the president of the senate. The president of the senate shall, in the presence of the senate and house of representatives, open all the certificates, and all the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes, shall be the president, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the house of representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for president; and if no person have a majority, then, from the five highest on the list, the said house shall, in like manner, choose the president. But in choosing the president, the votes shall be taken by states, the representations from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. In every case after the choice of the president, the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the vice-president. But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes, the senate shall choose from them by ballot the vice-president.\n\nThe congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the United States.\n\nNo person except a natural-born citizen, or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall be eligible to the office of president; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United States.\n\nIn case of the removal of the president from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the vice-president, and the congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation, or inability both of the president and vice-president, declaring what officer shall then act as president; and such officer shall act accordingly until the disability be removed or a president shall be elected.\n\nThe president shall, at stated times, receive for his services a compensation which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.\n\nBefore he enter on the execution of his office he shall take the following oath or affirmation.\n\nI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States.\n\nSect. 2. The president shall be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the United States; he may require the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices; and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\n\nHe shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, judges of the supreme court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law. But the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper, in the president alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.\n\nThe president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate, by granting commissions, which shall expire at the end of their next session.\n\nSect. 3. He shall from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both houses, or either of them; and in case of disagreement between them with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper: he shall receive ambassadors, and other public ministers; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and shall commission all the officers of the United States.\n\nSect. 4. The president, vice-president, and all civil\nArticle III.\n\n\"Sec. 1. The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges both of the supreme and inferior courts shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall at stated times receive for their services, a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\n\n\"Sec. 2. The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be party; to controversies between two or more states, between a state and citizens of another state; between citizens of different states, between citizens of the same state, claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.\n\n\"In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, with such exceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make.\n\n\"The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crime shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the congress may by law have directed.\n\n\"Sec. 3. Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.\n\n\"The congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted.\n\nArticle IV.\n\n\"Sec. 1. Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state, and the congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof.\n\n\"Sec. 2. The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.\n\n\"A person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another state, shall, on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.\n\n\"No person held to service or labour in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labour, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labour may be due.\n\n\"Sec. 3. New states may be admitted by the congress into this union: but no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the congress.\n\n\"The congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this constitution shall be construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of any particular state.\n\n\"Sec. 4. The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion, and on application of the legislature or of the executive, (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence.\n\nArticle V.\n\n\"The congress, whenever two-thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of this constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the congress; provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year 1808, shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article; and that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate.\n\nArticle VI.\n\n\"All debts contracted and engagements entered into, before the adoption of this constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this constitution as under the confederation.\n\n\"This constitution and the laws of the United States shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\n\"The senators and representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\nARTICLE VII.\n\n\"The ratification of the convention of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the states so ratifying the same.\n\nDone in convention, by the unanimous consent of the states present, the 17th day of September, in the year of our Lord 1787, and of the independence of the United States of America the 12th.

That after such publication the electors should be appointed and the senators and representatives elected. That the electors should meet on the day fixed for the election of the president, and should transmit their votes certified, signed, sealed, and directed, as the constitution requires, to the secretary of the United States in congress assembled; that the senators and representatives should convene at the time and place assigned; that the senators should appoint a president of the senate for the sole purpose of receiving, opening, and counting the votes for president; and that after he shall be chosen, the congress, together with the president should proceed without delay to execute this constitution.\n\nThe ten following articles were afterwards in 1789; Additions proposed by congress to be added to the constitution; and having received the ratification required by article fifth of the above constitution, they are to be regarded as forming a part of it.\n\nARTICLE I.\n\n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for redress of grievances.\"\n\nARTICLE II.\n\n\"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\"\n\nARTICLE III.\n\n\"No soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.\"\n\nARTICLE IV.\n\n\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmations; and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or things to be seized.\"\n\nARTICLE V.\n\n\"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, excepting in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall be tried twice for the same offence; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\"\n\nARTICLE VI.\n\n\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused party shall\nAmerica shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law; and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favour; and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.\n\nArticle VII.\n\n\"In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved; and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\"\n\nArticle VIII.\n\n\"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\"\n\nArticle IX.\n\n\"The enumeration in the constitution of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\"\n\nArticle X.\n\n\"The powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively or to the people.\"\n\nThe reference of the constitution to the several states to be adopted or rejected by them, in conventions assembled for that special purpose, occasioned the most violent debates. Pamphlets poured from the press, and the newspapers were daily filled with discussions of the merits and defects of the proposed plan of government. Three states, Delaware, New Jersey, and Georgia, accepted the constitution unanimously; but in the other states the parties were more nearly balanced. The conventions convoked by the state legislatures, went into an analysis of the constitution in detail. This took place more especially in Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, and Virginia; and every part of it was made the subject of separate votes. The objections stated against the constitution were chiefly the following: That the convention was only entitled to revise the articles of the original confederation, and had exceeded its powers in framing a new constitution, more especially, as it had declared the acceptance of this constitution by nine states sufficient to make it law; That the constitution ought to have been preceded by a declaration of rights to secure to the several states their particular constitution. It was alleged, that the proposed senate would possess excessive powers and privileges, by being authorized to make amendments in money bills, by its concurring America with the president in the nomination to places, while its members were eligible to every appointment, and by its having the sole trial of impeachments entrusted to it. The prerogative given to the president to pardon criminals convicted of high treason, was represented as dangerous to public liberty, and his power of conferring appointments upon the members of both houses of legislature was accounted a source of corruption. It was said, that the jurisdiction given to the federal courts would prove vexatious, by drawing individuals from distant states to attend to suits instituted before them. The powers given to congress to impose all kinds of taxes, to regulate the election of its members, to maintain a standing army in time of peace, were alleged to be exorbitant. It was said, that the most important of all privileges, the trial by jury, and the liberty of the press, were not secured: And lastly, It was asserted, that the function of president being made capable of indefinite continuance in the same hands, might give an ambitious and artful man an influence dangerous to the congress, to individuals, and to the constitution itself.\n\nSome of these objections do not appear very forcible, and others of them have been obviated by the articles afterwards added to the constitution, which have been already noticed; but it is said, that at the period in question they possessed considerable influence, and that a very great majority of the people of the United States was adverse to the constitution. So sensible, however, were all parties of the extreme defectiveness of the existing government, and of the absolute necessity of putting an end to the anarchy in which the country was plunged, that a majority in the different states was prevailed upon to give their votes for its acceptance. In Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, a minority voted against it, but it passed without any amendment. In Pennsylvania, where the opposition was strong, the minority withdrew and protested against the constitution. South Carolina, Virginia, New York, and Massachusetts, accepted the constitution by a very small majority, but proposed several amendments. New York was on the eve of rejecting the constitution, when intelligence arrived, that it was already accepted by nine of the states; and this circumstance produced an acceptance there also. The convention of New Hampshire separated without coming to a resolution; and having afterwards assembled, gave its assent, with some proposals for amendment. North Carolina not only proposed amendments, but made them the condition of its acceptance. Some time afterwards, however, it accepted the constitution without reserve. Rhode Island, instead of calling a convention, referred the constitution to the assemblies of the towns, by a majority of which it was rejected; but a convention for the purpose being afterwards called, it accepted the constitution. The following table indicates the periods and the manner in which the constitution was accepted.\n| States          | Period of accepting the Constitution | Manner of passing it |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Delaware        | Dec. 31, 1787                        | Unanimously         |\n| Pennsylvania    | Jan. 13                              | For 46 Against 23 Maj. 23 |\n| New Jersey      | Jan. 19                              | Unanimously         |\n| Georgia         | Jan. 2, 1788                         | Ditto               |\n| Connecticut     | Feb. 9                               | For 128 Against 40 Maj. 88 |\n| Massachusetts   | Feb. 6                               | 187 168             |\n| Maryland        | April 28                             | 63 12 51            |\n| South Carolina  | May 23                               | 149 73 76            |\n| New Hampshire   | June 21                              | 57 46 11            |\n| Virginia        | July 15                              | 89 79 10            |\n| New York        | July 26                              | 30 25 5             |\n| North Carolina  | Nov. 27, 1789                        | 193 75 118          |\n| Rhode Island    | May 29, 1790                         | 2                  |\n\nOf the public officers appointed under the constitution of the United States, those of president and vice-president are the most conspicuous and important. In March 1792, the following law was enacted by congress for regulating the mode of their election.\n\n\"Section 1. The case of the election of president or vice-president of the United States before the usual period of election, which case is herein after provided for, being accepted, the electors for choosing the president and vice-president shall be named within 34 days immediately preceding the first Wednesday of December 1792; and thenceforth within 34 days immediately preceding the first Wednesday of December, in the fourth year after the last election. The said electors shall be equal in number to that of the senators and representatives in congress, of which the several states shall have a right to compose their delegation at the time when the president and vice-president to be chosen shall enter into office: provided that, if the new apportioning of representatives in virtue of the new enumeration of the inhabitants, shall not take place before the period for choosing the electors, then the number of electors shall be proportioned to the number of senators and representatives of the present congress.\n\n\"Section 2. The electors shall assemble and vote on the first Wednesday of December in each state, at such place as shall be named by the legislature of the state; and shall draw up and sign three certificates of their respective votes, and shall fold up and seal the same separately, and shall indorse upon the cover of each packet a declaration, that it contains a list of the votes of the state for the president and vice-president; and every elector, or majority of electors, shall appoint by ballot the person to whom they will entrust one of the said certificates, to be by him conveyed to the president of the senate, at the place of residence of the government, before the first Wednesday of the January following; and shall address another of the said certificates, by the post, to the president of the senate at the place of residence of the government; and shall transmit the third of the said certificates to the judge of the district in which their assembly shall be held.\n\n\"Section 3. The executive power, in each state, shall cause to be drawn up, and properly certified, three lists of the names of the electors of the state, and shall transmit the same to the electors before the first Wednesday of December; and the electors shall add one of the said lists to each of the before-mentioned lists of their votes.\n\n\"Section 4. In the case of a list of the votes of a state not arriving at the place of residence of the government in January, the secretary of state shall dispatch an express to the judge of the district of such state in whose hands the third certificate shall have been deposited, who shall transmit it by the same messenger to the place of residence of the government.\n\n\"Section 5. The congress shall commence its sittings on the second Wednesday of February 1793; and thenceforth on the second Wednesday of the February following each assembly of electors; and the certificates, or as many of them as shall have arrived, shall be opened, the votes counted, and names of the persons elected to fill the offices of president and vice-president declared and proclaimed, according to the forms of the constitution.\n\n\"Section 6. In the case of the president of the senate not being present at the place of residence of the government on the arrival of persons charged with the lists of the votes of the electors, such person shall deliver the lists to the secretary of state, who shall carefully preserve them, and remit them as soon as possible to the president of the senate.\n\n\"Section 7. The persons appointed by the electors to convey the lists to the president of the senate, shall receive, at the time of delivering the said lists, 15d. per mile, for the distance, by the high road, from the place of election to the residence of the government.\n\n\"Section 8. If any person being appointed to convey the votes of the electors to the president of the senate, and having accepted that trust, shall neglect to discharge the same, he shall incur a penalty of 1000 dollars.\n\n\"Section 9. In the case of the removal, death, resignation, or incapacity to fill his office of the president or vice-president, the provisional president of the senate, or, where no such officer has been appointed, the speaker of the house of representatives, shall fulfil the duties...\"\nAmerica, duties of president of the United States, or vice-president, until the president or vice-president shall resume his functions, or a new election shall take place.\n\n\"Sec. 10. When the offices of president and vice-president shall become vacant at the same time, the secretary of state shall give notice of the same to the executive power of each state; and shall publish the said notice, in one gazette at least of each state, in which it shall be declared, that the electors for the president of the United States shall be appointed or chosen in the several states within the 34 days immediately preceding the first Wednesday of the month of December following, provided a space of two months shall intervene between the date of such notice, and the first Wednesday of the December following; but when the said space of time shall not so intervene, or if the term for which the late president and vice-president were elected does not expire on the third day of March following, then the secretary of state shall declare in such notice that the electors are to be appointed, or chosen, within the 34 days immediately preceding the first Wednesday of December in the following year; and the electors shall be appointed accordingly, and shall proceed as is provided in this act.\n\n\"Sec. 11. The only evidence that shall be required of the refusal to accept the office of president or vice-president, or resignation of either of said offices, shall be a declaration in writing, to that effect, signed by the person refusing to accept or resigning such office, which shall be transmitted to, and deposited in the office of the secretary of state.\n\n\"Sec. 12. The term for which the president and vice-president shall be chosen shall be four years: commencing, in all cases, on the 4th of March following the day of the election.\n\nBy this law, as well as by the constitution, the power of declaring the manner of nominating the electors who are to choose the president and vice-president, was left to the legislatures of the several states; the result of which was that a uniform mode was not adopted. In some of the states the people were left to nominate the electors in the same manner as they voted for other representatives. In other states, that power was confined to the legislatures themselves. The following is a statement of the different modes which have been established in all the states including the three new states of Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee.\n\n| States in which the electors for the president and vice-president of the United States are named by the people. | States in which the electors for the president and vice-president of the United States are named by the legislature. |\n|---|---|\n| Massachusetts | Vermont |\n| Pennsylvania | New Hampshire |\n| Virginia | Connecticut |\n| Tennessee | Rhode Island |\n| Kentucky | New York |\n| South Carolina | Delaware |\n| Georgia | New Jersey |\n| | Maryland |\n| | North Carolina |\n\nIn the executive government of the United States there are three departments, the department of state, the department of finances, and that of war: a secretary is at the head of each of these, who acts under the authority of the president. The secretary of state is keeper of the seals of the union. It belongs to his office to countersign the laws, and to promulgate them. He has the custody of all public papers, but his principal employment is to transact affairs with foreign powers.\n\nAt the head of the finances is a secretary of the Treasury. This part of the public business was attended with many difficulties at the period when the constitution was formed, and for some years thereafter. The new congress, at the close of its first session, in September 1789, ordered the secretary of the treasury of the union, Mr Hamilton, to prepare a plan for the refutation of public credit. This duty was performed in January 1790, and after long debates, the congress, on the 4th of August of that year, passed the plan into a law. By this law, the debt due to foreign nations, as well as to the creditors at home, was funded, together with a long arrear of interest, and even interest upon interest. The debt due to foreign nations amounted to $11,908,188 dollars, and the domestic debt to $40,905,185 dollars, making together $52,813,673 dollars. The president of the United States was authorized to borrow $12,000,000 of dollars to pay the foreign debt. Another loan was made to extinguish the domestic debt, and in payment of this loan certificates of interest due, (one of the kinds of public paper then current) were received and funded at three per cent. The capital of the debt, including the rest of the paper money then in circulation, was funded at six per cent. interest, with a provision that for a third of the debt thus funded no interest should be paid till the year 1800. This part of the debt therefore received the name of deferred stock. The deferred stock was appointed to be redeemed in the proportion of eight per cent. per annum. For the rest of the debt two other funds were created, one of three per cent. and one of five per cent.—By this law the whole debts due by the several states to the union, and for which the credit of congress stood pledged to the public creditors, were adopted as the debt of the union. But as the debts due by the several states were very unequal, this part of the plan met with much opposition. It is understood, however, to have been at last carried, in consequence of a kind of compromise between the northern and southern states. The northern states, including New York, were the principal debtors. Massachusetts alone owed $6,000,000 of dollars. The northern states, therefore were deeply interested, that the public debt should be adopted by the whole union. The southern states, on the contrary, were all, with the exception of South Carolina, creditors of the union. But it was their favourite project to draw the seat of the federal government nearer to them. Virginia was more eager in the prosecution of this object than the rest, and Virginia was the principal public creditor. Accordingly, the deputies of the northern states made a compromise with the southern states, agreeing to vote that the seat of the federal government should be placed on the river Potomac, on condition of the others voting for the consolidation of the debts. The state of Pennsylvania, though among the debtors, opposed this plan; but its opposition was got over by an agreement, that the seat of the federal government...\nAmerica's government should continue at Philadelphia for ten years. Thus the plan for consolidating the debts passed, and at the same time a law was enacted, authorizing the general government to accept, from the state or states to which it might belong, of a territory for the permanent seat of its residence, not exceeding ten miles square at the confluence of the Potomac and the Eastern Branch; authorizing, at the same time, the president of the United States to appoint commissioners to survey the territory, and to prepare, against the first Monday of December 1802, the buildings necessary for transferring the congress and whole offices of the federal government thither. In honour of the president of the union, who had so long been the commander in chief of the armies of the states, the new city was ordained to be called Washington.\n\nThe congress afterwards erected an office for the reduction of national debt; but a regular system of taxation being now established in the United States, it is probable that the government, finding itself rather strengthened than weakened by the existence of a public debt, or what is called the funding system, has not been very anxious to accomplish the payment of that debt, and accordingly it has rather increased than diminished. The debt of the United States, which in 1790 amounted to $72,613,254 dollars, amounted in 1796 to $78,697,410 dollars.\n\nA part of the general system of finance, proposed by Mr Hamilton, consisted of the establishment of a national bank, in imitation of the bank of England, which was accordingly incorporated in 1791, with a capital of $10,000,000 of dollars. Of these $2,000,000 were subscribed by the United States, but are not to be made good at the period imposed on other subscribers. The remaining $8,000,000 were furnished by individuals; one-fourth in specie, and the rest in certificates of public debt; so that, in this way, paper currency to the amount of $6,000,000 of dollars at once disappeared. This bank is authorized, by its charter, to establish assistant or branch banks, in such parts of the United States as it may deem expedient; and accordingly, besides the principal bank at Philadelphia, it soon established four branches, at New York, Bolton, Baltimore, and Charlestown. Its dividends are eight per cent, and its shares have risen from a fourth to a fifth above the original value.\n\nBesides the ordinary militia, the United States have a small permanent military establishment regulated by law. It is composed of a body of artillery and engineers, two companies of light dragoons, and four regiments of infantry. The corps of artillery and engineers, consists of 764 men divided into four battalions, and each battalion into four companies: a captain, two lieutenants, and two cadets, are allowed to each company. Each battalion has a major; and the whole corps is commanded by an adjutant-general, who has a lieutenant-colonel under him. Each company of dragoons consists of a captain, two lieutenants, and a cornet; 52 privates, and 11 sergeants, corporals, fiddlers, farriers, and trumpeters. The staff of each regiment of infantry consists of a lieutenant-colonel, two majors, an adjutant, a paymaster, quartermaster, surgeon, and two assistant surgeons. Each company consists of a captain, lieutenant, and an ensign; with 62 sergeants, corporals, soldiers, and musicians. This little army, therefore, consists of 2774 soldiers, sergeants, musicians, dragoons, and artillery men. The staff of the whole consists of a brigadier-general, a major of brigade, and an inspector, a judge advocate, a quartermaster, and a paymaster general. Their pay would in Europe be accounted exorbitant. The privates receive four dollars a day. In addition to this, each individual of every rank receives what is called a ration, consisting of a pound of beef, and a pound of bread, with a small quantity of distilled spirits, and salt, vinegar, soap, and candles. A captain of infantry receives 40 dollars a-day, and three rations, and the other officers in proportion.\n\nThe navy is also a branch of the war department; but as yet it consists only of a few vessels, though there is no doubt that, in a case of necessity, the United States would soon render themselves formidable as a maritime power. They possess in profusion all the materials necessary for ship-building. They have abundance of naval architects, and great numbers of experienced seamen, in proportion to their population.\n\nFor the administration of justice, an attorney general of the United States is by law attached to the executive government. His functions are, to prosecute, in the supreme court of the states, all suits in which the government of the union is interested, and to assist the president with his opinion on questions of law. He is permitted, as in Great Britain, to pursue his profession in the affairs of individuals. In the United States, justice is administered by district courts, circuit courts, and a supreme court. These possess exclusive jurisdiction, in all suits that affect the interests of the union. The courts of district are held four times a year in each state, by a judge appointed by the federal government, and residing in the state. They have jurisdiction in crimes within the district and the adjoining sea, where the penalty does not exceed 100 dollars, or a slight corporal punishment. They judge also in civil questions, in which the union or foreigners are interested to the amount of 100 dollars, and unless in admiralty cases, the question is tried by a jury.\n\nThe circuit courts are held by a judge of the supreme court, twice a year in each state, along with the judges of the district. They have an exclusive cognizance of all crimes against the union, and they are courts of appeal from the district courts. They have cognizance, along with the courts of the different states, of all civil causes, not exceeding 500 dollars in value, or where a foreigner is party, or the dispute is between citizens of different states.\n\nThe supreme court of the union consists of a chief justice, and five judges. It sits twice a year at the seat of government. It is a court of appeal from the circuit courts, and the tribunals of the several states. It has exclusive jurisdiction in all civil causes, where one of the states is a party, unless the adverse party be a citizen of the same state, and over all suits against foreign ambassadors or envoys, and their domestics, according to the law of nations. It may also try, but not exclusively, causes in which an ambassador, consul, or other foreign minister, is interested as prosecutor.\n\nOn account of the distance of the states of Kentucky and Tennessee, and the province of Maine, their courts of district exercise the jurisdiction of courts of circuit, except in cases of appeal, which are carried before the supreme federal court. Juries serving in the federal\nAmerica's federal courts are chosen according to the forms observed in the states where these courts happen to be held.\n\nCrimes or offenses of which the federal tribunals take cognizance, are treasons, rebellions, refusals to pay imposts enjoined by the union, smuggling, frauds by officers of the revenue in matters of revenue, and in short every offense committed against laws passed by the congress. In addition to these, the federal courts take cognizance of all offenses committed within what is accounted not the territory of any particular state, but of the union at large, such as, the open seas, or forts or arsenals belonging to the union, and also the precincts of the federal city of Washington, which is considered as the common property of the American nation.\n\nIn civil matters, both in the courts of the union, and of the particular states, the common law of England is considered as the law of America, where no special enactments exist to the contrary. The administration of justice, however, is understood to be no less embarrassed by intricacies and delays in North America, than it is under some of the oldest governments of Europe. A reform in this respect will not readily be expected, when it is considered, that more than one half of the legislature of the union, as well as of the legislatures of the different states, is always composed of lawyers.\n\nIn April 1792, the congress ordered the establishment of the United States, of a public mint, by a law, which regulates the division, the value, and the standard of their money. The division and value of these monies, are as follows.\n\n**Gold Coin.**\n\n- The Eagle, value ten dollars.\n- The Half-Eagle, value five dollars.\n- The Quarter-Eagle, value two dollars and a half.\n\n**Silver Coin.**\n\n- The Dollar, value a hundred cents.\n- The Half-Dollar, value fifty cents.\n- The Quarter-Dollar, value twenty-five cents.\n- The Tenth of a Dollar, value twelve cents and a half.\n- The Half-Tenth, value six cents and a quarter.\n\n**Copper Coin.**\n\n- The Cent, value the hundredth part of a dollar.\n- The Half-Cent, value the two hundredth part of a dollar.\n\nThe weight of these is as follows. The eagle ought to contain 247\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) grains of pure gold, or 270 grains of standard gold, which is thus regulated; 11 parts of pure gold in 12\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) parts of alloy, of which one half ought to be of silver.\n\nThe half-eagle ought to contain 123\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) grains of pure gold, or 135 grains of alloy gold.\n\nThe quarter-eagle ought to contain 61 grains of pure gold, or 67\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) grains of alloy gold.\n\nThe dollar ought to contain 37\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) grains of pure silver, or 416 grains of alloy silver.\n\nThe standard of silver is 1485 parts of pure silver, and 170 parts of alloy which is of pure copper.\n\nThe half-dollar ought to contain 182\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) grains of pure silver, or 280 grains of standard silver.\n\nA quarter-dollar ought to contain 92\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) grains of pure silver, or 104 grains of standard silver.\n\nThe tenth of a dollar ought to contain 37\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) grains of pure silver, or 52 grains of standard silver.\n\nThe half-tenth ought to contain 18\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) grains of pure silver, or 26 grains of standard silver.\n\nThe cent ought to contain 11 pennyweights of copper.\n\nThe half-cent ought to contain five and a half.\n\nThe gold and silver coins ought, according to law, to bear on one side an emblematical figure of liberty, and upon the other, the eagle of the United States, with the words \"United States.\"\n\nThe copper coins, instead of the American eagle, bear an inscription denoting their value.\n\nThe proportional value between gold and silver, when coined, to the coin of the United States, is determined by comparing one pound of the one to fifteen of the other; that is to say, one pound of coined gold is equal to fifteen pounds of coined silver.\n\nAll the counties of the United States are required to make use of these coins.\n\nThe Spanish dollar is the only piece of foreign coin which is current in the United States as money: all others, which had received a valuation by the law, are only received by weight since 1795. It does not appear, however, that the United States have hitherto made much use of their mint, at least for the coinage of the more valuable metals.\n\nThe convulsions of nations and the calamities and history of the crimes of mankind, always form the most interesting subject of history; and happy is that people concerning whom the historian gives little to relate. From the period of the acceptance of their constitution, the American states have, in a great degree, enjoyed that fortunate situation. On the 13th of September 1788, the old congress having received the ratification of the constitution from eleven states, declared it to be in force, and appointed the first Wednesday of the following January for choosing the electors, who were to assemble on the first Wednesday in February following to elect the president and vice-president. The new congress was also appointed to meet on the first Wednesday of March following at New York. Accordingly Washington, on the first Wednesday of February 1789, George Washington, who had been the commander-in-chief of the armies of the United States and president of the convention of Philadelphia that framed the constitution, was elected president, and John Adams, who had seconded Mr Jefferson in proposing the original declaration of American independence, was at the same time elected vice-president. The popularity of the president was deservedly very great; and, as all parties concurred in supporting the new constitution, much unanimity prevailed in the public councils. By degrees, however, it appeared, that two parties continued to exist, professing the same radical principles as formerly. The party most attached to the principles that leaned towards monarchy, or rather towards aristocracy, concurred steadily in giving support to the new authorities in all their exertions as soon as they were constituted, adopting for themselves the appellation of federalists, which had by that time become popular. On the other hand, the more strict and zeal...\nous republicans, who had originally been called federalists, and who had only opposed the constitution, because, in their opinion, it did not sufficiently incorporate the whole states into one nation, now began to receive the appellation of antifederalists; because, from their temper and character, they frequently opposed the measures of the new federal government.\n\nIn this way the names of the parties were changed, while their principles remained the same. It is not believed, however, that in the United States there exists any party that wishes to dissolve the confederation; the word antifederalist being only used to express the democratic or most zealous republican party, whereas the appellation of federalist is applied to those of a more aristocratical character and tendency, who array themselves most steadily on the side of established authority, in opposition to every kind of innovation.\n\nIn the earliest period of the constitution, the only extraordinary effort that we find to have been made by either of these parties, consisted of a proposal made in the senate of congress, in which the aristocratical party, now called federalists, were very numerous, to give the titles of illustrious bishops to the president of the United States, of right honourable to the members of the senate, and honourable to the members of the house of representatives; but this project was abandoned by the senate itself, as the public opinion was found to be adverse to it, and as the house of representatives was disposed to impose a negative upon it. When the system of finance, of which we have already taken notice, and which still exists, was proposed, it was vehemently combated by the opposition or the antifederalist party, on account of the tendency, which, in their opinion, it must have to introduce a funding system, and by means of it an extravagant and expensive government, in consequence of the facility with which that system enables ministers to negotiate loans, and thereby rather to increase than diminish their own power by the dependance upon government which these loans produce. The same reasons which induced the antifederalist party to oppose the new system of finance, or the introduction of a funding system, recommended it to the support of the federalists, who, by means of it, expected to increase the strength and influence of government. This last motive probably derived greater weight from the personal interests and prejudices of the individuals who usually joined the federalist or aristocratical party.\n\nIt is to be observed, that, in North America as in Europe, the political opinions of men are, in a great measure, formed by their situations. At the same time, local situation produces in America an effect precisely the reverse of what it does among the Europeans. In Europe the proprietors of land constitute the aristocracy of the country in which they live, and are the pillars of the government; whereas the inhabitants of towns, from being crowded into a narrow space, and from their want of personal distinction, have a tendency to assume a more levelling and turbulent character. But, in America, unless when land is bought in large quantities to be speedily disposed of as an object of commercial speculation, it is usually held in property by the cultivators of it, who labour upon their own farms, and constitute a body of yeomanry in early circumstances, but not possessed of great wealth. Hence, in all political questions they are led to adopt equalizing notions, and a jealousy of the conduct of those entrusted with power. In the towns, on the contrary, a great diversity of rank exists. By means of extensive commerce large fortunes are made, the owners of which live in a style of great splendour, and along with the members of the learned professions constitute the aristocracy of America. The commercial men being also intimately connected with Great Britain, are naturally led to approve of the institutions that exist in it, and to favour her cause in every quarrel with European nations.\n\nIt was not till the second period of the French revolution, or the fall of monarchy in that country, that the American parties became in any great degree exacerbated against each other. That extraordinary event, by which Europe was convulsed from its centre to its extremities, and by which all its nations were roused to arms, carried agitation and discord even beyond the shores of the Atlantic. The people of the American states belonging to the race of Europe, and having so recently been an object of lively interest and of hostility between different states, could not fail to have their minds occupied by the new events and speculations which at that time engaged the attention of all ranks of men. The French had been the allies of America. Their troops had fought for the independence of that country, and Lafayette and other names that were distinguished in the early periods of the French revolution, were well known, and enjoyed much personal popularity among the Americans. It is not wonderful, therefore, that the antifederalist party in America regarded with favour the early progress of the French revolution, especially as they considered, in the French soldiers as now engaged on the side of principles which they had learned in the school of America. They contemplated with exultation the progress of republicanism in France, and fancied they beheld in it a confirmation of their own sentiments, and the means of preventing their own government from acquiring an aristocratical or a monarchical tendency. When the governing party in France dishonoured themselves and human nature by the excess of their barbarity and of their crimes under Robespierre, the antifederalists in America being men of a better character, could not fail to regard the conduct of the European revolutionists with much horror. Still, however, they flattered themselves that the disorders of France were only temporary; and they vainly hoped that the spirit of freedom would in that country soon be rendered consistent with the existence of public order.\n\nOn the other hand, the federalist party in America, whose objects were to strengthen the government of the union, to increase the influence of the executive power, and to carry the constitution as far as possible towards aristocracy and monarchy, naturally considered the example and influence of the English government as a barrier against the system of French republicanism. As many of the members of this party were strongly bound to Great Britain by the ties of commercial interest, they soon became extremely eager to detach the United States from France, and to connect them with Britain. This party derived a great accession of strength from the crimes, which nobody pretended to justify, of the rulers of the French republic.\nAmerica. They derived still greater strength from the disorganizing system with regard to foreign nations which the French adopted, and which they extended even to the republican states of America. Their ambassador, M. Genet, and their consuls at different ports, instituted political clubs in the towns and villages, and attempted to introduce everywhere the Jacobin practice of affiliation or fraternization. The ambassador also attempting to force the United States into a war with Great Britain, quarrelled openly with the president, and attempted, by the publication of official notes addressed to him, to excite discontent, and to introduce a distinction between the government and the people of the country. He was recalled by the French government, but not till his conduct had excited the disapprobation of all parties in America. It would appear, however, that for a time the American government was disposed to regard the French republic with favour. Payment was readily made to the republic of the debt incurred by the United States to the late French monarch; and as France suffered great distress from a scarcity of provisions, the money was laid out in the purchase of grain and flour, which was conveyed from America to France in a fleet of 160 ships. It was in defence of this fleet that the French fought the naval engagement with Lord Howe on the 1st of June 1794, in which their ships of war were defeated; but they were successful in conveying the transports loaded with grain into Brett harbour. But the American government soon found itself much embarrassed with regard to the part which it ought to act towards the contending powers of Europe. George Washington was still at the head of affairs, having been re-elected president in December 1792, though not altogether unanimously, as in the former instance. This prudent statesman saw that the interest of his rising country required that he should remain disengaged from the destructive quarrels of the European nations. The restless spirit of the French, however, on the one hand, and the eagerness of Great Britain to force an universal combination against them on the other, rendered the preservation of neutrality no easy task. He saw a confederacy of all Europe formed against France; and he could scarcely avoid supposing that it must be successful against anarchy stained with crimes and blood, assisted by choice troops, and having nothing to oppose this force but new soldiers and inexperienced generals, supported by a treasury furnished only with a paper currency, which must speedily be depreciated.\n\nAt the same time, the American commerce was greatly harassed by Great Britain, whose ships, with a view to distress France, seized all vessels going thither with provisions, which formed the chief article of American export. The debates which occurred in the house of representatives in congress in consequence of this state of affairs were extremely violent; and the people without doors were greatly agitated throughout the whole extent of the United States. The general will was to preserve peace and neutrality; but the complaints against Britain were very loud, especially as the extensive traders who were most attached to the British interests were the chief sufferers by the interruption of commerce. The antifederalists on this occasion became still more attached to France, the contagion of whose anarchy among a virtuous people they declared they did not fear. If satisfaction could not be obtained from Britain, they proposed a sequestration of British property in America, an interruption of all commerce with Britain; and they imagined, that by arming American privateers, prohibiting the conveyance of provisions to the British islands, and seizing on Canada, they possessed more certain means of injuring Britain, if she was resolved upon war, than any she had with which to make reprisals upon the states. The federalists, on the other hand, were eager to avoid all connexion with France, and proposed the mildest measures of remonstrance and negotiation with regard to England, deprecating the idea of entering into a contest with her; and the president appears at length to have adopted the resolution of going fully into the measures of this last party. He dismissed Thomas Jefferson from the office of secretary of state, being of that party that had always avowed an attachment to pure republicanism, and that was at present most hostile to Great Britain. He at the same time resolved to send Mr Jay to England for the purpose of negotiating with the British government. This last gentleman being known to be decidedly attached to the federalist party, indicated to the public in very clear terms the measures which the government had resolved to adopt.\n\nAbout this time some internal disorders broke out in one part of America, and, as political factions render at Pittsburg, every event subservient to their mutual hatred, the federalists accused their adversaries, though evidently without reason, of being the contrivers and authors of the disturbance, the history of which was this:—Among the different objects of taxation which presented themselves to congress during the session of 1792, none had appeared more proper than the distilleries throughout the United States. As a revenue from this source could only be collected by an excise, this form was adopted: The duty was light, and the object unexceptionable. But at all times this form of collecting a revenue has been unacceptable to the people in general. By fixing the duty not on the raw material, but on the manufactured commodity, the capital of the trader is less deeply involved, and the price is commonly rendered less burdensome to the consumer; but from the right which, under this form of taxation, it is necessary to confer upon the revenue officers, of entering into private buildings, and of interfering with the operations there going on, it has always been submitted to with reluctance at its first introduction. This tax, however, was peaceably submitted to throughout the whole American continent, excepting in one quarter, that is to say, in the four western counties of Pennsylvania beyond the Alleghany mountains, near the junction of the three great rivers Alleghany, Yohogamy, and Monongahela, whose confluence at Fort Pitt forms the river Ohio. This district had been settled for a considerable time, and is tolerably populous. The inhabitants at first refused to pay the tax, but they were not altogether unanimous in this respect; and government for some time avoided to press the matter by prosecutions, in the hopes that by degrees the authority of law would be established without trouble or alarm. Petitions in the mean time were transmitted to congress against the tax, and some modifications of it had taken place; so that the government at last endeavoured...\nAmerica ed generally to put it in force. The marshal was ordered to proceed by legal process against all rioters and delinquent distillers who should be found to resist or evade the tax; but no sooner was he undertook to be engaged in this duty than the vengeance of armed men was aimed at his person, and the person and property of the inspector of the revenue. They fired on the marshal, arrested him, and detained him some time as a prisoner. The house and papers of the inspector of the revenue were burnt; and both these officers were obliged to fly to Philadelphia. In a few days thereafter, in the month of August 1794, a general meeting was held at Pittsburgh, consisting of five thousand men in arms. A strong remonstrance was drawn up, to be presented to congress. Committees were appointed to correspond with the counties of Washington, Fayette, and Alleghany; and a resolution was entered into, against having any intercourse or dealings with any man who should accept of any office for the collection of the duty.\n\nThe American government on this emergency acted with much prudence. Commissioners were despatched to confer with the leaders of the opposition in the disaffected counties, but the conference was unfortunately without effect. A committee of sixty persons was elected to confer with the commissioners, but of these only a small number voted in favour of the conciliatory proposition. The others threatened, that if the tax was not repealed, the people of the western counties would separate from the American union, and place themselves under the protection of Great Britain. The conduct of the populace was still more outrageous. They surrounded the house where the commissioners resided, broke the windows, and grossly insulted them; so that they were under the necessity of departing without effecting an accommodation.\n\nNothing now remained but to repeal the tax, or to reduce the refractory counties by force. The former was neither judged prudent nor safe; and as a trifling force might have been ineffectual, and therefore extremely pernicious, by encouraging and extending the insurrection, the militia of all the adjacent states were embodied, and different detachments, amounting in all to fifteen thousand men, were ordered to rendezvous at Carlisle, the principal town of Cumberland county. Governor Mifflin, formerly general, marched thither in the middle of September, at the head of six thousand volunteers, who, for the honour of their country, engaged on this occasion to support the laws of the federal government. In the beginning of October, the president joined the army at Carlisle, of which Governor Lee of Virginia was commander-in-chief; and Governor Mifflin was second in command. From Carlisle the army proceeded immediately, amounting in all to fifteen thousand men in two divisions; and the result was, that the insurgents, after a variety of consultations by representative committees, came to a resolution to disband, and submit to the law; and their leaders disappeared. On the 25th of October, a considerable meeting was held at Pittsburgh, of the inhabitants of the western counties, in which they entered into a solemn engagement to support order and obedience to the laws of the republic by every means in their power. A small force was, however, stationed in the counties in which the disturbance had taken place. A considerable number of the insurgents who had been made prisoners were tried, and convicted of high treason; but they were afterwards pardoned. Thus did this rebellion, which at one time exhibited a formidable aspect, terminate without bloodshed, and almost without violence or damage to the public.\n\nDuring the same summer, a part of the western territory of the United States was ravaged by a desperate incursion of the Indians. To repel this attack, Major General Wayne was despatched with a moderate force early in the summer, and about the middle of August he penetrated to the Miami river, where the British had lately re-occupied a fort within the territory which, according to the treaty of 1783, undoubtedly belonged to the American states. Along with the Indian general, Wayne found a number of Canadian settlers encamped without the fort; and he affected in his correspondence, that Colonel M'Hee, the British Indian agent, was the principal instigator of the war between the savages and the United States. The savages, with a few white auxiliaries, amounted to two thousand men, while General Wayne had only nine hundred; but he resolved not to retreat, and, after a last overture for peace, which was rejected, he advanced to the attack on the 20th of August. His advanced guard was at first thrown into disorder by a severe fire from the Indians, but the second line was immediately brought forward, while the first line was directed to route the Indians from their covert by the bayonet; while the cavalry were directed to turn their flank. The effect of the charge of the infantry, however, was, that the savages were routed and immediately dispersed, the battle terminating under the guns of the British garrison, commanded by Major Campbell. This last gentleman and General Wayne now reciprocally accused each other as guilty of hostility in time of peace. The one complained that a fort was occupied within the American territory; and the other, that so near an approach was made to a garrison policed by the troops of his Britannic majesty. It was agreed, however, that the point should be left to be discussed by the ambassadors of their different nations; and General Wayne retired. These occurrences excited strong apprehensions in the American government that the British ministry ferociously meditated hostilities against the United States.\n\nThese apprehensions, however, were soon done away by Jay's treaty, which Mr Jay concluded with Great Britain in the end of the year 1794. By this treaty the British government agreed to indemnify the American merchants for the illegal seizure of their ships and property that had taken place during the war; the forts within the American territory which had been occupied by the British, and which had never been evacuated, were agreed to be given up; and the boundary line to be clearly ascertained. On the other hand, the American government consented, that French property on board American vessels might be lawfully seized, and that no privateers belonging to a nation at war with either party should be allowed to bring their prizes into the ports of the other, unless forced by stress of weather; and at all events, that they should not be allowed to sell their prizes there. Various articles favourable to the American commerce were at the same time stipulated in the treaty.\n\nWhen this treaty was laid before the legislature of\nAmerica, the United States, it occasioned the most violent debates. The senate, however, approved of it, which was all that was necessary, according to the constitution, to render it binding. The house of representatives at first refused to concur in the arrangements necessary for carrying it into effect, though they at last agreed to depart from their opposition, from the dread of involving their country in a war with England, and from the great respect which the country at large entertained for the judgment of the president.\n\nIn the mean time, this treaty, along with other events, had nearly involved the United States in what was undoubtedly at that time less formidable; a war with France. The French had repeatedly made remonstrances to the American government against the conduct of the British, in seizing American vessels, even in their own rivers and bays, when they found either French persons or French property, without any resistance being made on the part of the American states. When the above treaty, authorizing such seizures, in a manner hostile to the interests of France, and even to the spirit of neutrality which it was the interest of the American government to observe, came to be publicly known, the French at first entertained hopes that it would not be sanctioned by the American legislature. Their indignation was greatly roused when they understood that a legalized preference was thrown to the English interest, by allowing them to seize French property in American vessels; while France stood engaged by treaty, not to seize American property in English vessels, or in the vessels of any other nation with which France might happen to be at war. Still, however, the French government regarded less the treaty itself, than the spirit for which it stood, of a greater attachment to Great Britain than to France. Their indignation in this respect was increased, by an intercepted letter from the president of the United States addressed to Mr. Morris, who had lately been the American ambassador in France, and who was then the private agent of the American government in London. This letter, dated at Philadelphia, December 2, 1795, was a detailed answer to various letters of Mr. Morris. The president complained highly of the haughty conduct of the English administration, and of the arbitrary measures which they were continuing to pursue with respect to American navigation. He requested Mr. Morris to represent to the minister not only the injustice, but the impolicy of this conduct; particularly at a moment when it was so much the interest of England to conciliate the minds of the inhabitants of the United States to the acceptance of the treaty. He detailed the efforts he had made, and the difficulties he had encountered to overcome the wayward disposition of his countrymen towards French politics, the abettors of which were the chief opponents of the treaty in question; which, however, he said, had the approbation and sanction of the greater and more respectable part of the community. His only object, he observed, was peace, which he was most anxious to preserve; and if America was happy enough to keep herself out of European quarrels, she might, from the increase of her trade, vie in 20 years with the most formidable powers of Europe.\n\nThis letter, saved from the wreck of the Boston America packet, which had foundered on the coast of France, was considered as decisive evidence of the dispositions of the American government towards the French republic. Their ambassador, M. Adet, was therefore directed to make strong representations against the privileges granted to Great Britain, of seizing French property in American vessels. The answer given by the American government, stated in justification of their conduct, that a special treaty made with France in 1778, formally expressed, that neutral vessels should neutralize the cargo; whereas the treaty lately concluded between the United States and England, contained no similar regulation. The American government therefore asserted, that it acted in perfect conformity to both treaties, and though it was lawful for the English to seize French property on board American vessels, the French, without a breach of their treaty with America, could not be permitted to make reprisals in similar circumstances on the English. This mode of reasoning, which was undoubtedly consistent with the letter of the treaties, if not with political honesty, did not satisfy the French directory; and, accordingly, they entered into a formal resolution to suspend the execution of their treaty with America, and declared, that they would treat all neutral vessels in the same manner, as they should suffer the English to treat them. The only effect of this threatening, was to augment the maritime power of Great Britain; merchants belonging to neutral states being thereby induced on all occasions to entrust their goods to the British flag, as the only power capable of affording them full protection. Still, however, by the management of the American ambassador Mr. Monroe, who was known to belong to the antifederalist party, the French directory was prevented in tolerable temper with the Americans; but upon his being recalled, and Mr. Pinckney, a man of the opposite faction, appointed his successor, they manifested their indignation, by refusing to receive him, or even to suffer him to reside as a private citizen at Paris. They proceeded to no further hostility, however, in expectation that a change favourable to their interests might occur in the American government. For now in the month of October 1796, George Washington, the president, publicly announced his resolution of retiring from political affairs on account of the infirmities of age, and requested his friends not to nominate him in the next election of president.\n\nThe election of a new president to succeed a man of such distinction as George Washington, afforded abundant aliment for the animosity of the political parties in America. The federalists wished to advance to the office of president Mr. Pinckney of South Carolina, a man whose personal character was much respected, and who had lately been ambassador in England. He had also been engaged in some negotiations with Spain, in which his conduct gave general satisfaction. His name was associated by the federalists, in their votes, along with that of John Adams, the vice-president. They considered it as probable, that he would have the second greatest number of votes in the north, where it was expected that John Adams would have the majority; and it was hoped, that he would at least have the second number of votes in the southern states.\nAmerica. If Mr Jefferson should have the majority. Upon the whole, however, the federalists generally professed a wish that Mr Adams should be president, although it is said, that the views of their leaders were privately directed to procure the elevation of Mr Pinckney.\n\nThe antifederalists, on the contrary, openly and unanimously supported Mr Jefferson. He is well known to the public as a man of letters. He had been secretary of state and ambassador in France, and was active in procuring the original declaration of independence. The two parties strained every nerve to support their respective candidates. They mutually accused each other of tricks to invalidate votes, of frauds in the returns, and of all the other unfair proceedings so well understood in the parent state of which they are colonists. The leaders of the federalists were deceived in their expectation of gaining a majority for Mr Pinckney. John Adams had only one vote beyond an absolute majority of the whole which is required by the constitution, and was declared president; and Mr Jefferson having the second greatest number of votes, or three votes fewer than Mr Adams, was declared vice-president.\n\nWhen the news arrived in America of the French directory's refusal to receive Mr Pinckney as minister from the United States, their conduct was represented by Mr Adams the president, in a speech to congress, as a high and aggravated insult to the dignity of the American people. The federalist party, by whom he was supported, had a majority in congress, and some preparations for war were voted; but as the parties were nearly balanced, the opinions of the opposition very frequently prevailed, and the mission of three ambassadors to demand an explanation from the French government was scarcely followed by any preparations for hostility. But by this time the persons who retained the possession of the supreme power in France, under the appellation of an executive directory, had displayed a character which deeply wounded the interests of their country with all foreign nations, and ultimately overturned the republican constitution which had been attempted to be established. Their conduct was insolent and corrupted, while at the same time they were unable to compensate these defects by the ability of their management. Their negotiation with the American ambassadors terminated in an obscure and unprincipled intrigue, in which it appeared that the directory wished to levy a sum of money upon America, as the price of their forbearance; a part of which sum was to go into the public treasury, and a part was to be received privately by the individual members of the directory. They also, from a short-fought policy, authorized their privateers and cruisers to seize all neutral vessels in which any article of British produce or manufacture should be found, to whomsoever it belonged. As the British manufactures were in great demand in every country, this was equivalent to a declaration of hostility against all nations, while, at the same time, the absolute dominion which the British navy had at this period acquired over the ocean, converted it into an impotent menace.\n\nIn consequence of these events, the American congress, towards the end of their session in 1798, by a small majority, enacted a law, to break off all commercial relations with France or its dependencies, and to forbid the entrance of French vessels into the American ports till the end of the fittings of next congress. A premium was also offered for the capture of French armed ships by American vessels. Still, however, though the president, Mr Adams, supported by the leaders of the federalist party, continued to urge the necessity of a war with France, yet, as the majority of the people appeared decidedly adverse to this measure, he had the good sense to depart from his own sentiments, and to attempt a new negotiation. As the French directory, by their misconduct, speedily brought their country to the greatest embarrassments, by once more arming all Europe against France, that nation found it necessary, for the sake of its safety, to relinquish those hopes of freedom for which it had made so many sacrifices, and to submit the whole power of the state to Bonaparte, who had been the most successful commander of its armies. He repaired the errors in the directory by more moderate and better management, and settled all differences with the American states.\n\nDuring these political transactions, the two greatest yellow fever cities of these states, Philadelphia and New York, had very suffered very severely by a pestilential disorder called the yellow fever. It is understood to have been brought originally by vessels employed in the slave trade on the western coast of Africa to the West India islands. After producing the most dreadful mortality in that quarter, it was conveyed to the two great cities in America already mentioned, in consequence of their frequent intercourse with the islands. From them it at times extended itself to the other maritime towns. Having once begun, it returned during different seasons towards the end of summer, and many thousand persons perished by it, besides whose health was permanently injured. More than half the inhabitants fled from the cities; but those infected fortunately either did not infect the inhabitants of the country to whose houses they went, or the infection produced a less dangerous form of disease. The rents of houses sunk about one half in Philadelphia and New York, and their rapid increase was considerably retarded. In consequence, however, of the adoption of those measures of precaution which have been so long practised in Europe, but which have been neglected in America, the danger of a return of the same calamity seems to be somewhat diminished, though from the latest accounts it is by no means done away.\n\nIt has been already mentioned, that a resolution was very early adopted in America of endeavouring to form, or the establishment of a federal city, as it is called, as the capital of the United States, which should be the seat of government independent of every particular state, and having its sovereignty vested in the whole union; and we have stated the circumstances which led to its establishment on the banks of the Potomac. Congress accordingly commenced its fittings at Washington at the end of the year 1800. For several years preceding that period the commissioners of congress had been employed in making out a plan of the city, and in erecting public buildings for the accommodation of the government. As the desire of wealth is a prevailing passion in America, and as the people there readily engage in extensive speculations upon every subject, the federal city of Washington was for some time made the object of an endless variety of purchases and sales of lots of building.\nAmerica, building ground. The public papers both in Europe and America were filled with exaggerated praise of the new city, and with fictitious accounts of the rapidity of its progress towards completion. After various persons had suffered considerably by unsuccessful speculations, it was discovered that it was an easier matter to exhibit upon paper a magnificent and beautiful city, fitted from its extent to be the capital of the world, than to rear its buildings and to fill them with inhabitants. The persons who had obtained property in the intended capital of the United States, became at last convinced, therefore, that the immense extent of ground marked out in the plan would not be so speedily covered with houses as the sanguine spirit of the Americans had originally led them to expect. The proprietors of different lots therefore became rivals. Instead of boasting of the excellencies of the federal city in general, every speculator began to boast of the advantages of that side of the city where his own property lay, and to depreciate every other quarter. Hence the buildings have been begun in situations very remote from each other, so as rather to form a set of scattered hamlets than a single town.\n\nThe federal city is situated in a kind of triangular peninsula, formed by the junction of the rivers called Potowmack and East Branch. The plan includes 412 acres; of these 712 are allotted to 16 streets, feverishly bearing the names of the 16 states, and to other streets of less magnitude, with squares and public gardens. The 347 acres which remain, being the property of the union, and of the original proprietors of the soil, contain 23,000 lots of houses, exclusive of 3000 feet of lots set aside for quays. The capitol, where congress assembles, is at the distance of a mile and a half from the president's house, and three quarters of a mile at least from those parts of the rivers that are most convenient for commerce. It is also to be observed that, in the neighbourhood of the spot chosen for the federal city, there previously existed a village called Georgetown upon the Potowmack. From these circumstances, various quarters of the new city were regarded as more or less likely to become speedily populous; and, according to the different notions entertained by individuals, have become more or less favourite points for building upon. The inhabitants of Georgetown, who had purchased many lots of the intended city in the quarter nearest themselves, represented their own port, and the commerce already belonging to it, as a favourable opening to the commerce of the city of Washington, which would therefore naturally fix itself in that quarter. The proprietors of lots near the point of the peninsula contended, that their situation on the banks of both rivers, being at an equal distance between the capitol and the president's house, and being most airy, healthy, and beautiful, would soon be preferred to all others. The proprietors on the East Branch decried the port of Georgetown, and the whole banks of the Potowmack, as not secure in winter from shoals of ice. They represented the point placed between two rivers as incapable of enjoying completely the advantages of either: at the same time they boasted of the great depth and safety of their own port, and of their vicinity to the capitol, where all the members of congress must assemble once every day, and from which their distance is not more than three quarters of a mile. Amidst these contending speculations, however, though the federal city of America, Washington is understood to be advancing with considerable rapidity, it is nevertheless still in its infancy, and for many years the greatest part of it must remain subject to the plough or the hoe. Its prosperity must depend in a great degree upon the stability of the federal government, and the perseverance which shall be manifested by congress in continuing its fittings there amidst the inconveniences arising from defective accommodation. These last will no doubt speedily diminish, and the government has great inducements to persevere in settling itself upon a spot without the limits of every particular state; and the police of which is entirely in the hands of congress, a circumstance which greatly tends to secure the tranquillity of the deliberations of that body. Neither does there seem to exist any reason for doubting the permanency of the federal government. The several states are so closely connected with each other by situation, and commercial and social intercourse, that it is impossible for them to enjoy any tolerable degree of tranquillity or order without submitting to a common head. If they shall become incapable of governing themselves as a republic, the evils of anarchy will no doubt speedily compel them to submit to a master, but their natural connexion will preserve them as a single nation; and when a capital is once established, with public buildings for the accommodation of all the branches of national government, it is never easily altered.\n\nIn the mean time it appears that the most strictly republican or democratic interest in America is gradually shifting towards acquiring an ascendancy. At the election of president of the United States in 1800, the antifederalists, or, as they are sometimes called by their antagonists, the jacobin party, were successful, though after an eager struggle, in raising their favorite candidate, Mr Jefferson, to that supreme office. The two factions are understood to be greatly irritated against each other; but this circumstance does not appear at all to disturb the tranquillity of the state, or the power of the laws. Indeed it is probable that the success of the most violent party may be the first step towards its acquiring a moderate character, as the experience of mankind in other countries sufficiently demonstrates, that one of the surest means of inspiring popular leaders with a respect for constituted authorities often consists in admitting them to a participation of power.\n\nAs the United States of America, though they have received emigrants from all countries, were originally a British colony, and upon the whole peopled from the British islands, every circumstance in their situation and history must always be highly interesting to the inhabitants of this country. We are connected with them by the ties of consanguinity, as well as by the possession of a common language, laws, and religion. It is only in Great Britain, of all the countries on earth, that a native of the United States can find himself as it were at home, or among a kindred people, possessing the same manners, instructed by the same books, and consequently possessing the same general features of character and thought. On the other hand, it must always be to the British nation a subject of fair and justifiable pride, to reflect, that whatever may hereafter be the destiny of Europe, amidst its wars, debts, taxes, and usurpations, Britain has established in a secure and unaffordable\nAmerica, affinable position, a body of people of its own race and character, who may hereafter be the guardians and preservers of civilization and of letters to mankind.—Temporary hostilities did indeed exist between the two countries; and our neighbours the French were abundantly industrious in endeavouring to ripen the seeds of discord, and to convert them into a source of permanent animosity: but their attempts have been ultimately unsuccessful, being founded upon casual and passing circumstances, which could not long prevail against so many bonds of union that are founded upon the most lasting sentiments and qualities of the human mind. It had been better, no doubt, both for Britain and for the colonies, that the war had been avoided. In the natural course of things, American independence must have taken place. Had the colonies waited another century, till they should possess five times the population of the parent state, one of two things must have occurred; either the British monarch would have deserted his little islands, to reside amidst the great mass of his people beyond the Atlantic, as his ancestor James VI. deserted Edinburgh to go to live at London; or the separation would have cost America only a trifling effort, and would have saved her all the calamities of the war of the revolution, and the difficulties which followed it. But young nations, like young men, are frequently in too great a haste to act a part upon the great theatre of the world, and for a while, as happened to the United States, they sometimes suffer by their rashness. This rashness, or, as it may perhaps be called, this generous ardour, on the part of America, at the reluctance on the part of Britain to relinquish so flourishing a branch of her empire, will be regarded by future generations of Britons, and of Americans, as sentiments which naturally resulted from the situation of the parties, and as no cause of continued dislike. Though two nations, they must for ever be one people; and, as the inhabitants of America must for ages be the employers of the manufacturers of Britain, it is probable that the intercourse and amity of the countries, founded upon ties both of interest and inclination, will long continue to exist and to increase. We think it here necessary, therefore, as far as our information extends, to give a general account of the present situation of the United States.\n\nIn the treaty of peace concluded in 1783, the limits of the United States are thus defined: \"And that all disputes which might arise in future on the subject of the boundaries of the said United States may be prevented, it is hereby agreed and declared, that the following are and shall be their boundaries, viz., from the north-west angle of Nova Scotia, viz., that angle which is formed by a line drawn due north from the source of St Croix river to the Highlands, along the said Highlands, which divide those rivers that empty themselves into the river St Lawrence, from those which fall into the Atlantic ocean, to the north-westernmost head of the Connecticut river; thence down along the middle of that river to the 45th degree of north latitude; from thence by a line due-west on said latitude until it strikes the river Troquois or Cataraquy; thence along the middle of said river into Lake Ontario, through the middle of said lake, until it strikes the communication by water between that lake and Lake Erie; thence along the middle of said communication into Lake Erie, through the middle of said lake, until it arrives at the water communication between that lake and Lake Huron; thence through the middle of said lake to the water communication between that lake and Lake Superior; thence through Lake Superior, northward of the isles Royal and Phillippeaux to the Long Lake; thence through the middle of the said Long Lake, and the water communication between it and the Lake of the Woods, to the said Lake of the Woods; thence through the said lake to the most north-western point thereof, and from thence on a due west course to the river Mississippi; thence by a line to be drawn along the middle of said river Mississippi, until it shall intersect the northernmost part of the 31st degree of north latitude. South, by a line to be drawn due east from the determination of the line last mentioned, in the latitude of 31 degrees north of the equator, to the middle of the river Apalachicola or Catahouche; thence along the middle thereof to its junction with the Flint river; thence straight to the head of St Mary's river, and thence down along the middle of St Mary's river to the Atlantic ocean. East, by a line to be drawn along the middle of the river St Croix, from its mouth in the bay of Fundy to its source; and from its source directly north to the aforesaid Highlands, which divide the rivers that fall into the Atlantic ocean from those which fall into the river St Lawrence, comprehending all islands within twenty leagues of any part of the shores of the United States, and lying between lines to be drawn due east from the points where the aforesaid boundaries between Nova Scotia on the one part and East Florida on the other, shall respectively touch the bay of Fundy, and the Atlantic ocean, excepting such islands as now are, or heretofore have been, within the limits of the said province of Nova Scotia.\"\n\nIn this description there are some trifling inaccuracies; in particular it now appears, that a line drawn due west would not touch the river Mississippi, but would pass to the northward of its source. Neither was it well understood, by the negotiators, what river was meant under the name of St Croix. These points, however, were adjusted in the treaty between Great Britain and the United States, which was entered into in 1795, and commissioners were appointed to point out the river which should be considered as the boundary, and to fix upon a line of junction between the Lake of the Woods and the river Mississippi. The result of the whole is, that the territory of the United States of America may be considered as a vast triangle, of which the Atlantic ocean on the east forms the base. The southern side is formed by the river Mississippi, and the northern by a very irregular line wholly formed by a long chain of lakes and rivers, excepting at its eastern part, which consists of a piece of territory called New Brunswick, referred by Great Britain near the sea coast. In this way, excepting on the corners touching New Brunswick belonging to Britain on the north-east, and Florida belonging to Spain on the south-east, the United States are almost entirely surrounded by water. Parallel to the Atlantic ocean, from Georgia on the south to the most northern states, runs a tract of mountainous country, which receives the general appellation of the Alleghany mountains. The principal chain of these mountains is crossed by no river. On the eastern side of it a vast variety of streams of the greatest magnitude are formed, which descend into the Atlantic ocean. Beyond this chain of mountains, and parallel\nAmerica, to it, at a considerable distance, is the great river Ohio. All the rivers that take their origin among the Alleghany mountains, beyond the principal ridge, flow westward into the Ohio. This last river, after passing along the western side of the Alleghany mountains, falls into the Mississippi, which passes round the southern extremity of these mountains into the Atlantic ocean at the gulf of Mexico. The territory of the United States west of the Ohio may also be considered as forming a triangle, of which the river Ohio, on the east, forms the base; while the two sides are formed by the chain of lakes already mentioned, and by the river Mississippi. This western country, which is of immense extent, is still in a great measure possessed by the Indians. The whole territory of the United States contains, by computation, a million of square miles, in which are 640,000,000 acres.\n\nDeduct for water, 51,000,000\n\nAcres of land in the United States, 589,000,000\n\nThe territory to the westward of the river Ohio amounts to about 220,000,000 of acres, after deducting upwards of 40,000,000 for water. The whole of this immense extent of unappropriated territory belongs to congress, as the head of the union, and is set apart for the payment of the public debts of the confederation. It is meant, when peopled, to be divided into new states to form a part of the union.\n\nNo part of the world has so many navigable waters adjoining to its territory, or passing through it, as the United States of America. The Atlantic ocean, which forms their eastern boundary, is indented with numerous bays, some of which are of very considerable extent, and advance to a considerable distance into the country. On the northern or north-easterly part of the states is the bay of Fundy, between Nova Scotia and New England, chiefly remarkable for its tides, which rise to the height of 50 or 60 feet, and flow so rapidly as to overtake animals that feed upon the shore. Next to it, on the southward, are the bays called Penobscot and Casco, extending along the coast of the province of Maine, which is the most northern territory of the United States. Massachusetts bay follows these, which washes the town of Boston, and is comprehended between Cape Ann on the north, and Cape Cod on the south. Various small bays succeed to these, to the southward, after which is Long Island sound. This is a kind of inland sea, from three to 25 miles broad, and about 140 miles long, extending the whole length of the island, and dividing it from Connecticut. It communicates with the ocean at both ends of Long Island, and affords a very safe inland navigation. Near the west end of this sound, about eight miles eastward of the city of New York, is the strait called Hell Gate. It is remarkable for its whirlpools, which make a tremendous roaring at certain times of the tide. They are occasioned by the narrowness and crookedness of the pass, and by a bed of rocks that extends quite across it; but, a skilful pilot can with safety conduct a ship of any burden through this strait, with the tide, or at still water, with a fair wind. Still proceeding to the south, is Delaware bay, 60 miles in length, which is so wide in some of its parts that a ship in the middle cannot be seen from the land. But of all the American bays, the Chesapeake is the largest. Its entrance is between Cape Charles, and Cape Henry in Virginia, 12 miles wide, and it extends 270 miles to the northward, dividing Virginia from Maryland. It is from seven to 18 miles broad, and generally as much as nine fathoms deep, affording many commodious harbours and a safe and easy navigation. It receives the waters of the Susquehanna, Potomac, Rappahannock, York, and James' Rivers, which are all large and navigable.\n\nTo the south of the Chesapeake, on the coast of North Carolina, are the three bays or sounds called Albemarle, Pamlico, and Core. Of these Pamlico sound, which lies between the other two, is the greatest. It is a kind of lake, or inland sea, from 10 to 20 miles broad, and nearly 100 miles in length. It is separated from the sea in its whole length by a beach of sand, hardly a mile wide, and generally covered with small trees and bushes. Through this bank are several small inlets by which boats may pass. But Ocrecook inlet is the only one that will admit vessels of burden into the most important districts of Edenton and Newbern. This inlet is in lat. 35° 10', and opens into Pamlico sound, between Ocrecook island, and Core bank; the land on the north is called Ocrecook, and on the south Portmouth. A bar of sand having 14 feet water at low tide crosses this inlet; and six miles within this bar the channel is crossed by a shoal called the Swash, having only eight or nine feet water at full tide. Few mariners, though acquainted with the inlets, choose to bring in their own vessels, as the bar often shifts during their absence on a voyage. To the north of Pamlico sound, and communicating with it, Albemarle sound extends 60 miles in length, and is from eight to 12 in breadth. Core sound, which lies to the south of Pamlico, likewise communicates with it. These sounds are so large, when compared with their inlets from the sea, that no tide can be perceived in any of the rivers which empty into them, nor is the water felt even in the mouths of these rivers. A tract of low marshy territory between Pamlico and Albemarle sounds is called Dismal Swamp. The same name, however, is also given to another tract at some distance to the northward of Albemarle sound. A part of this last tract is in North Carolina, and the rest within the boundaries of Virginia.\n\nAs already stated, the northern or north-western boundary of the United States, consists almost entirely of a chain of lakes dividing the country from Canada. These lakes consist of by far the largest collections of fresh water that are to be found in the world. The uppermost or most westerly is called the Lake of the Woods, from the great forests upon its banks. Its length from east to west is about 70 miles, and in some places it is 40 miles wide. To the eastward of it is Rainy or Long Lake, which is nearly 100 miles long, but never more than 20 miles wide. To the eastward of this is Lake Superior, justly termed the Caspian of America. It is undoubtedly the largest basin of fresh water in the world, being 1500 miles in circumference. The water is pure and transparent, and appears generally to rest upon a bed of huge rocks. A great part of its coast is likewise rocky and irregular. It contains many islands, two of which are very considerable. The one, called Isle Royale, is about 100 miles long, and in many places 40 miles broad. The lake abounds with fish, particularly trout and sturgeon. It\nAmerica is affected by storms in the same manner as the ocean. Its waves run as high, and the navigation is equally dangerous. It discharges its waters from the southeast corner, by a strait called St Marie, of about 40 miles long, into Lake Huron; but this strait is not navigable, on account of its having at one part what the Americans call a rapid, that is, a quick descent of the waters among rugged rocks. It does not appear, however, that above one-tenth of the waters which are conveyed by about 40 rivers into Lake Superior, pass out of it by the strait of St Marie, which nevertheless is its only visible outlet. Considerable quantities of copper ore are found in beds upon many small islands in Lake Superior, but it has not hitherto become an object of commerce.\n\nLake Huron is next in magnitude to Lake Superior, being about 1000 miles in circumference. On the north side of it is an island 100 miles in length, and no more than eight miles broad. This island is considered as sacred by the Indians. On its south-west side Lake Huron sends out a bay, called Sagamoon Bay, into the country, of about 80 miles in length and about 18 in breadth. At its north-west corner, this lake communicates with Lake Michigan by the straits of Michillimackinac.\n\nLake St Claire receives the waters of the three great lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron, and discharges them, through a river or strait called Detroit, into Lake Erie. It is about 90 miles in circumference. Its navigation is obstructed by a bar of sand near the middle, which prevents loaded vessels from passing.\n\nLake Erie is nearly 300 miles long from east to west, and about 40 in its broadest part. Its islands and banks are much infested with rattlesnakes. Near the islands the water is covered for many acres together with the large pond lilly, on the leaves of which, in the summer season, lie myriads of water snakes basking in the sun. The American geographers tell us of a remarkable snake found in this lake, called the hissing snake. It is about 18 inches long, and small and speckled. When approached it flattens itself, and the spots upon its skin become visibly brighter. At the same time it blows from its mouth with great force a subtle wind, said to be of a nauseous smell, which, if drawn in by the breath of the traveller, infallibly brings on a decline, that in a few months proves fatal. This lake is of more dangerous navigation than any of the others, on account of the many perpendicular sharp rocks which it contains. It communicates with Lake Ontario by the river Niagara, which is about 35 miles in length; and which being crossed by a branch of the Alleghany mountains, consisting of limestone rock, forms the celebrated falls of Niagara, one of the most wonderful natural objects in the world, on account of the immense weight of water that is at once precipitated from a height which different travelers have estimated variously, from 137 to 160 feet. It has been often described; but as every traveller seems to view it with greater astonishment than his predecessors, we shall state the terms in which it is mentioned by the duke de la Rochefoucault Liancourt, who visited Niagara in 1795. \"At Chippaway the grand spectacle begins. The river which has been constantly expanding from Fort Erie to this place, is here upwards of three miles wide; but on a sudden it is narrowed, and the rapidity of the stream redoubled by the declivity of the ground on which it flows, as well as the sudden contraction of its bed. The channel is rocky; and the interposed fragments of rocks increase the violence of the stream. The country is flat and even to this point; but here a range of white rocks arises on each side of the river, which is contracted to half a mile's breadth. This range is a branch of the Alleghany mountains, which proceeding from Florida, previously to their reaching this point, intersect the whole continent of America. The river, more closely hemmed in by the rocks on the right encroaching upon its channel, branches into two arms, one of which flows along the bank formed by the rocks on the right; and the other, far more considerable, being separated by a small island, makes straight on to the left, and sweeps through a basin of stone which it fills with much foam and noise. At length, being again obstructed by other rocks which it meets on its right, it alters its course with redoubled violence; and, along with the right arm, rushes down a perpendicular ledge of rocks 160 feet high, nearly half concave, and probably worn out by the incessant impetuosity of the waters. Its width is nearly equal to that of its bed, the uniformity of which is only interrupted by an island which separates the two arms, reefs unhaken on its rocky basis, and seems, as it were, to swim between the two streams which rush down at once into this stupendous chasm. The waters of the lakes Erie, Michigan, St Claire, Huron, and Lake Superior, and of the numerous rivers emptying themselves into these lakes, incessantly replace the water that thus dashes down. The water of the falls tumbles perpendicularly on the rocks. Its colour is at times a dark green; at others a foaming white, brilliant throughout, and displaying a thousand variegations as it is struck by the rays of the sun, or, according to the time of the day, the state of the atmosphere, the force of the wind, &c. The water which rushes down the rocks rises in part in a thick column of mist, often towering above the height of the falls and mixing with the clouds. The remainder, broken in its perpendicular descent by fragments of rocks, is in continued agitation, spouts and foams, and casts on shore logs of wood, whole trees, boats, and wrecks, which the stream has swept along in its course. The bed of the river formed by the two ridges of rocks, which extend a great way farther, is still more narrowed, as if part of this mighty stream had vanished during the fall, or were swallowed up by the earth. The noise, agitation, irregularity, and rapid descent of the stream, continue seven or eight miles farther on; and the river does not become sufficiently placid for a safe passage, till it reaches Queenstown nine miles from the falls. It is superfluous to mention, that notwithstanding the severity of the winter in this country, the cataract as well as the river above it are never frozen. But this is not the case with the lakes and smaller rivers that supply it with water. Enormous flakes of ice rush constantly down this cataract when the thaw sets in, without being entirely dashed to pieces on the rocks; and thus are frequently piled in huge masses up to half its height. With the noise occasioned by the falls, we were less struck than we expected; and Mr Guillemand, as well as myself, who had both seen the Rhine fall near Schaffhausen, could not but acknowledge...\nAmerica. ledge that the noise it produces is far more striking. Yet I must repeat it again and again, that nothing can stand the test of comparison with the falls of Niagara. Let no one expect to find here something pleasing, wildly beautiful, or romantic; all is wonderfully grand, awful, sublime: every power of the soul is arrested; the impression strikes deeper the longer you contemplate, and you feel more strongly the impossibility of doing justice to your perceptions and feelings.\"\n\nLake Ontario, which is the lowest of the great lakes that form the northern frontier of the United States, is of an oval form, and abounds with fish of an excellent flavour. It discharges itself on the north-east into the river Iroquois, which, at the town of Montreal, takes the name of the river St Lawrence; and passing by Quebec, falls into the Atlantic ocean at the gulf of St Lawrence.\n\nThe river Mississippi, which forms the third or south-western boundary of the United States, divides their territory from the country of Louisiana, which belonged to Spain, but has recently been ceded to France. This river is supposed, when its windings are included, to be upwards of 3000 miles in length, and to extend nearly 2000 in a direct line. It is navigable to the falls of St Anthony in about lat. 41° 30'. About lat. 39°, a large river called the Illinois, belonging to the United States, falls into it; and it is formed afterwards joined by a larger river than itself from the south, called the Missouri, which has a greater length of navigation. At the distance of 230 miles below its junction with the Missouri, the river Ohio, which is a mile in breadth, falls into the Mississippi. From the mouth of the Ohio it continues to descend 1005 miles to the town of New Orleans, after passing which it falls into the gulf of Mexico. In spring floods the Mississippi rises to a great height and overflows its banks, depositing upon them immense quantities of fertilizing mud or slime. After its junction with the Missouri, its waters become so loaded with the earthy particles, that in a half-pint tumbler they have been found to deposit a sediment of two inches of slime. Its banks, to a great distance from its mouth, appear to have been gradually formed by the deposition of trees and mud, which its floods bring down from the higher country. The soil is accordingly extremely soft, rich, and moist. It is apt to be broken up by the periodical floods of the river, which sometimes appears to alter its channel.\n\nWhen in flood, the current of the Mississippi is so strong that with difficulty it can be ascended. The current descends at the rate of five miles an hour; but it is observed, that at this period there is a counter current which runs at the rate of about two miles an hour, close to the banks of the river, which greatly assists the ascending boats. In autumn, when the waters are low, it does not descend faster than two miles an hour, unless where the stream is narrowed by cliffs of islands, shoals, and land banks. The circumference of many of these shoals being several miles, the voyage is rendered more tedious and dangerous in autumn than in spring, when the water covers them to a great depth. The upper parts of the Mississippi are usually navigated in vessels carrying about 40 tons, and rowed by 18 or 20 men; and what is remarkable, the depth of the river increases as it is ascended. The voyage from New Orleans, near the mouth of the Mississippi, upwards to the river Illinois is usually performed in eight or ten weeks. The river Missouri is said to be navigable about 1200 or 1300 miles beyond its junction with the Mississippi, but no part of it is within the territory of the United States. By a treaty concluded with Spain in 1795, it was agreed that the navigation of the Mississippi should be enjoyed in common by the subjects of Spain and the citizens of America.\n\nThe waters in the interior of the United States are no less convenient for navigation than those upon the extremities of the country.\n\nThe lakes in the interior, however, are by no means Lakes in equal extent to those upon the frontier. They are the interior chiefly situated in the state of New York or in its vicinity. Lake Champlain is the largest. It lies nearly to the east of Lake Ontario, and is about 80 miles in length from north to south, and 14 miles over at its broadest part. It is well stored with fish, and the land around it is good. Crown Point and Ticonderoga are situated on the southern bank of this lake. Lake George lies in a mountainous country south-west of Lake Champlain, and is about 55 miles long from north-east to south-west, but narrow. The lakes Seneca and Cayuga are each about 30 or 40 miles in length. Lake Oneida extends to 25 miles. Besides these there are several others of less magnitude, though useful for inland navigation, called Otsego, Chatogue, Canadrago, and Ulysses. There is also in Orange County an amphibious tract called the Drowned lands, consisting of about 40,000 or 50,000 acres. The waters which descend from the surrounding hills, being but slowly discharged by the river Wallkill, cover these vast meadows every winter, so that the surface of them can be navigated. They were thus rendered extremely fertile, but the inhabitants in the neighbourhood are exposed to intermittent fevers.\n\nIt has been already mentioned that, to the eastward of the Alleghany mountains, all the rivers flow into the Atlantic ocean. Of these, beginning with the north, and going southward, the following are the most remarkable. In the states to the eastward of New York, which were formerly called the New England colonies, and which are now divided into the five states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Vermont, there is only one river of any importance, called Connecticut river. It rises in lat. 45° 10', long. 71° west from London. Its length in a straight line is nearly 300 miles. At its mouth is a bar of land which obstructs the navigation. Ten feet water at full tide is found upon this bar. The river is navigable to Hartford, which is upwards of 50 miles from its mouth, and the produce of the country for 200 miles above is brought thither in boats. The boats which are used in this business are flat-bottomed, long, and narrow, for the convenience of going up the stream, and of so light a make as to be portable in carts. They are taken out of the river for several miles at different carrying-places.\n\nTo the south of Connecticut river is Hudson's river, one of the largest and finest in the United States. It rises in the mountains between the lakes Ontario and Champlain, and is 250 miles in length, falling into the ocean near New York, which stands upon it. About 60 miles above New York the water becomes fresh;\nbut the tide flows a few miles beyond the flourishing town called Albany, 160 miles above New York, and to this distance the river is navigable by sloops of 80 tons burden. From Albany to the neighbourhood of Lake George is 65 miles, and to this distance the river is navigable by light boats; but there are two portages, or carrying-places in the way, of half a mile each. By this river the produce of the remotest farms is easily and speedily conveyed to a certain and profitable market at the great trading city of New York. Its banks are populous to a considerable distance, and a flourishing inland trade is carried on upon it between Albany and New York in nearly 100 vessels of about 70 tons burden, the greater part of which belong to the inhabitants of Albany. They make ten voyages in a year, are navigated by a master, a mate, and two men, who receive wages, the master 20, the mate 15, and the seamen 9 dollars a-month each.\n\nThe next great river to the southward is the Delaware. It rises in the state of New York in Lake Utayantho, and takes its course south-west, till it crosses into Pennsylvania, in latitude 42°. Thence it still proceeds southward, dividing the states of New York and New Jersey, falling into the ocean through Delaware bay, having New Jersey on the north-eastern side, and Pennsylvania and Delaware on the west. From the mouth of Delaware bay, between Cape Henlopen and Cape May, to the city of Philadelphia, is about 118 miles. So far there is a sufficient depth of water for a 74 gun ship. At Philadelphia the river is extremely beautiful, passing through a rich and populous country. It is three miles broad, and the water is perfectly fresh. From Philadelphia upwards to Trenton Falls, where the flood-navigation ends, is 35 miles. The river is navigable 40 miles farther for boats that carry eight or nine tons; and, with some carrying-places, it is navigable for Indian canoes, or such boats as we have already mentioned to be in use upon Connecticut river, for 50 miles. The tide reaches Trenton Falls, and rises six feet at Philadelphia. Three miles below this city, the Delaware receives the river Schuylkill, which is navigable about 8½ or 90 miles.\n\nThe Susquehannah river also rises in the state of New York, crosses the state of Pennsylvania, and flows into the great bay of Chesapeake, after receiving many large streams, several of which are navigable for 50 miles; this river itself being navigable to an immense extent, though sometimes interrupted by rocks, which form troublesome rapids.\n\nNext to these follow the Virginian rivers, the greater part of which flow into the bay of Chesapeake. The value of these streams can only be understood by an inspection of the map of the country. Almost every farm house, to the eastward of the Alleghany mountains, has a navigable river at its door; the result of which has been, that few towns of any consequence exist there, the inhabitants having been induced to extend themselves everywhere along the banks of the rivers, by means of which they enjoy at once all the advantages of agriculture and of commerce; every planter being in some measure a merchant as well as a cultivator of the soil. The most northerly of the Virginian rivers is the Potomac, upon which the federal city of Washington is placed. It is seven miles and a half broad at the mouth. The distance from the capes of Virginia to the termination of the tide-water in this river is above 300 miles, and it is navigable for ships of the greatest burden nearly to that extent. Thereafter, it is obstructed by four considerable falls, or rather rapid descents of the stream among rocks, which for a few miles interrupt the navigation. At these falls, however, navigation is continued, by means of canals supplied with locks; so that this river affords a water communication for many hundred miles above the termination of the tide. It also receives a great variety of navigable streams; one of which is the Shenandoah, which is said to be navigable for small vessels for upwards of 100 miles. The Rappahannock, York river, and James's river, with their various tributary streams, follow in succession. In a multitude of directions, they afford a communication across the first ridges of mountains, called the Blue Mountains, to the foot of the great middle ridge, or the proper Alleghany mountains. In their course they not only facilitate the intercourse of the inhabitants, but, in several situations, exhibit instances of splendid and beautiful scenery. The junction of two of these rivers is thus described by an American writer: \"The passage of the Potomack through the Blue Ridge is perhaps one of the most stupendous scenes in nature. You stand on a very high point of land. On your right comes up the Shenandoah, having ranged along the foot of the mountain 100 miles to seek a vent. On your left approaches the Potomack, in quest of a passage also. In the moment of their junction, they rush together against the mountain, rend it asunder, and pass off to the sea. The first glance of this scene hurries our senses into the opinion, that this earth has been created in time: that the mountains were formed first; that the rivers began to flow afterwards; that in this place particularly they have been damned up by the Blue Ridge of mountains, and have formed an ocean which filled the whole valley: that, continuing to rise, they have at length broken over at this spot, and have torn the mountain down from its summit to its base. The piles of rock on each hand, but particularly on the Shenandoah, the evident marks of their disruption and avulsion from their beds by the most powerful agents of nature, corroborate the impression. But the dilatant finishing which nature has given to the picture is of a very different character. It is a true contrast to the foreground. It is as placid and delightful as that is wild and tremendous. For the mountain being cloven asunder, the presents to your eye, through the cleft, a small catch of smooth blue horizon, at an infinite distance in the plain country, inviting you, as it were, from the riot and tumult roaring around, to pass through the breach, and participate of the calm below. Here the eye ultimately composes itself; and that way too the road happens actually to lead. You cross the Potomack above the junction, pass along its side through the base of the mountain for three miles, its terrible precipices hanging in fragments over you, and within about twenty miles reach Fredericktown, and the fine country round it.\"\n\nTo the southward of Virginia, that is, in the states of North Carolina and Georgia, a great variety of rivers flow into the ocean. As the face of the country, however, is very level, the sand which they bring down in spring floods, or which is cast up by the ocean upon\nAmerica, the coast, is apt to obstruct the entrance into them; so that they are deeper within the country than at the shore. One general rule obtains with regard to them: They are navigable by any vessel that can pass the bar at their mouths; and while a river continues broad enough for a vessel to turn round, there is generally a sufficient depth of water for it to proceed. In North Carolina, the principal rivers are, the Roanoke, which is navigable for small vessels about sixty or seventy miles; the Pamlico, which is navigable for ninety miles; Neuse river, which carries small boats to the distance of two hundred miles; and Trent river, which is navigable for forty miles. In South Carolina are the Santee, the Savannah, and the Pedee, which rise from various sources in that ridge of mountains which divides the waters which flow into the Atlantic ocean from those which fall into the Mississippi. They are navigable to a great distance, as well as a variety of others of less note. In Georgia there are also several rivers, which are navigable to the distance of eighty or ninety miles; but the entrance into them from the ocean is very difficult, as the extreme flatness of the country prevents the stream from having sufficient force to keep their current clear of obstructions at their confluence with the sea-tides.\n\nThe western waters of the United States, or those beyond the Alleghany range, are not less abundant, or less convenient for navigation, than those on the eastern side of the mountains. We have already remarked, that at Fort Pitt the great river Ohio commences; being there formed by the confluence of two, or rather three rivers, the Alleghany, the Monongahela, and the Yohogany; which last runs into the Monongahela, about fifty miles above Fort Pitt. These three rivers, previous to their junction, afford an inland navigation of many hundred miles. The Monongahela is no less than four hundred yards wide at its mouth. At the distance of one hundred miles above this, it is still three hundred yards in breadth, and affords good navigation for boats. For fifty miles higher it is still navigable; though the navigation is apt to be interrupted during dry seasons. The Alleghany also affords a very distant navigation, extending at times in very small vessels to within fifteen miles of Lake Erie, on the northern boundary of the United States. The Ohio, being formed by the junction of these rivers, proceeds along the back, or western side, of the Alleghany, to the distance of eleven hundred and eighty-eight miles before it falls into the Mississippi, receiving in its course a great variety of tributary streams, both from its eastern and western sides. It is said to be one of the most beautiful rivers on earth; its current is gentle; its waters are clear; and its bottom smooth and unbroken by rocks and rapids: a single instance excepted. It is one quarter of a mile wide at Fort Pitt, and increases gradually to one mile in width at its mouth; though at various places it is occasionally broader and narrower. At the rapids or rocky part of its channel, which for about a mile disturb the navigation, it is only a quarter of a mile in breadth. These rapids are in latitude thirty-eight degrees and eight minutes. It affords at all times a sufficiency of water for light boats to Fort Pitt. The inundations of the river begin about the last of March, and subside in July. During these, were it not for the rapidity of the current, and the sudden turns of the river, a first rate man of war might ascend from the ocean to the rapids. But at this place the rise of the water does not exceed ten or twelve feet. The water there defends about thirty feet in a mile and a half. The bed of the river is a solid rock, and is divided by an island into two branches. But it is said that the southern branch is at most seasons navigable in small boats, when conducted by skilful pilots.\n\nThe following are the chief rivers which flow into the Ohio from the east: The Great Kanawha, and the Little Kanawha; the navigation of which last is much interrupted by rocks. The former, however, affords a tolerable navigation of about ninety miles, and is two hundred yards wide at its mouth. The Little Kanawha is one hundred yards broad; but it is navigable only for fifteen miles. After these are the rivers called Sandy, Licking, and Kentucky. The former constitutes the eastern boundary of Kentucky, and reaches the Alleghany mountains. It is of no great size. Licking river is one hundred miles in length, and one hundred yards broad at its mouth. The Kentucky is a very crooked stream, of two hundred miles in length. It falls into the Ohio by a mouth of one hundred yards broad.\n\nBelow the rapids of the Ohio, in the rich country of Kentucky, is Salt river, ninety miles in length, and eighty yards wide. Green river falls into the Ohio one hundred and twenty miles below the rapids. Its course is upwards of one hundred and fifty miles. Cumberland river falls into the Ohio four hundred and thirteen miles below the rapids. Its length is upwards of five hundred miles. These rivers are navigable for boats almost to their sources, without rapids or interruptions for the greatest part of the year. Their banks are generally high, and composed of limestone. Below these is the Tenessee, which runs into the Ohio a short way below the mouth of the Cumberland. The Tenessee is six hundred yards wide at its mouth, and upon ascending it, to the distance of two hundred miles, it widens to between two and three miles; which width it continues for nearly thirty miles. Thus far it is navigable by vessels of great burden. Here, however, it is interrupted by certain shoals, called the Mule Shoals, from the great quantity of shellfish with which they are covered. These shoals can only be passed in small boats; above which, however, the river again becomes navigable for boats of forty or fifty tons burden for some hundred miles; and it is easily navigated at least six hundred miles above the Mule Shoals.\n\nOf the rivers that flow into the Ohio from the west the following are the chief: The Muskingum, which is a gentle stream, confined by high banks. With a portage or carrying-place of about one mile, it affords a communication with a small navigable stream called the Cayaboga, which flows into Lake Erie. Thereafter is the river Hockhocking, inferior to the Muskingum, but navigable for large boats about seventy miles, and for small ones much farther, through a country abounding with coal, iron stone, and other minerals. Next is the Sioto, which can be navigated with large barges for two hundred miles. Then follows the Great Miami, which is navigable to an immense distance, even to the neighbourhood of Lake Erie. The Wabash falls into the Ohio by a mouth two hundred and seventy-five yards wide, one thousand two hundred miles below Fort Pitt. The Wabash is a beautiful river, with high and fertile banks. It can be navigated with boats drawing three feet water, four hundred and twelve miles, and by large canoes one hundred and ninety-seven miles farther. Besides these streams which fall into the Ohio, a variety of\nrivers of great size and importance are to be found still farther to the westward within the territory of the United States. They either fall into the Mississippi on the south-west, or into the great northern lakes; but they are not yet sufficiently known to admit of accurate description. One of the chief of them is the Illinois, which falls into the Mississippi, 176 miles above or to the westward of the Ohio, by a mouth about 400 yards wide. It is navigable to a great distance, and interlocks with the rivers that fall into the northern lakes, in such a way as to furnish a communication with Lake Michigan, with the aid of two portages, the longest of which does not exceed four miles. It receives a number of rivers, which are navigable for boats from 15 to 180 miles.\n\nOne general remark must be made with regard to all the American rivers; that, in consequence of the immense torrents of rain which fall at certain seasons of the year, they are liable to swell, and to overflow their banks in a most violent manner; arising, in a short time, to even 20, or 25 feet in height. This renders their navigation not a little difficult, on account of the great force that is necessary to convey a vessel upwards against the rapidity of the stream. These great floods also render it difficult to establish canals at those parts of any river where falls, or, as the Americans style them, rapids, occur; because the locks, which, in such situations, are necessary upon the canals to raise and let down the vessels, are in great danger of being swept away by the sudden swelling and overflowing of the river. Notwithstanding this inconvenience, however, it is abundantly evident, that no country on earth possesses the same advantages, in point of internal communication, with the United States of America. Even the great Alleghany ridge, which seems to form a barrier between the east and the west, is so closely approached on both sides by navigable streams, that the land carriage necessary in crossing it extends, in some situations, to little more than 40 miles; and, when the increasing population of the country shall have rendered such a measure useful or necessary, it will probably be found not difficult to complete the communication by water by the aid of artificial canals.\n\nWith regard to the general face of the country within the territory of the United States, it is very various. We have already stated, that a great chain of mountains runs from the state of Georgia northward, parallel to the Atlantic ocean, all the way to the great northern lakes. These mountains are not solitary, or scattered in a confused manner; but are formed into different ridges, receiving various appellations in different states. In Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina, the principal ridges, beginning on the east, are called, first, the Kittatinny or Blue mountain, at the distance from 120 to 130 miles from the sea. It is about 4000 feet high, and the country rises from the sea to slowly and gradually towards it, as to appear altogether level. Back from this first ridge, and nearly parallel to it, are the ridges called Peter's, Tyloroma, and Nacoochee; but these names are not in all places adhered to. Then follows the ridges called in Pennsylvania Sharenan's hills, Sidelong hills, Ragged, Great warriors, Eriti and Wells mountains; then the great Alleghany ridge which gives its name to the whole. Beyond it are the Laurel and Chestnut ridges, and various others. These ridges being parallel to each other are themselves incapable of cultivation; but they are divided by rich plains of various breadth and of immense length, containing rivers of different degrees of magnitude. On the east of the mountains, from the lowell ridge to the ocean, the country, as already mentioned, descends very gradually; and in the southern states, for 150 miles from the ocean, is almost entirely level, consisting of a low flat country, apparently formed by sand thrown up by the tides, and by particles of mud deposited by the rivers in their spring floods. In the southern states, that is, those to the south of New York, the soil near the rivers is coarse or fine, according to its distance from the mountains. Near them it contains a large mixture of coarse land; but on the banks of the rivers towards the sea, it consolidates into a fine clay; which, when exposed to the weather, falls down into a rich mould. In the states of South Carolina and Georgia, for many miles from the ocean, when a pit is dug to the depth of 20 feet, every appearance of a fault mark is usually found, such as marl gravel, marl mud, and brackish water.\n\nBeyond the Alleghany mountains the country to the westward is irregular, broken, and variegated, but without great mountains. Various small ridges, however, descend to the westward, between which flow the rivers that run into the Ohio. In some situations, particularly in the neighbourhood of Pittsburgh, the variety of its surface is said to render the country extremely beautiful.\n\nTowards the north part of the state of New York and in the New England states, the country, different from the rest of America, is rough and hilly, or even mountainous; though, upon the whole, their mountains are trifling when compared to those in other parts of the world. Nor does it appear, that in almost any part of the United States, any such thing is to be met with as mountains entirely rugged and barren, rearing their naked summits to the clouds. Even to the top of the Alleghany ridge the whole country is one waving forest, though the trees are of different size and species, according to the variety of soil upon which they stand. Notwithstanding this general regularity of the surface of the country, to the eastward of the mountains, it is not destitute of objects which mark it to have undergone convulsions or changes. Of these we may mention one instance, being a curiosity worthy of attention, in the state of Virginia, called Natural Bridge or Rockbridge. It is on the ascent of a hill, bridge, which seems to have been cloven through its length by some great convulsion. The fissure just at the bridge is, by some measurements, 270 feet deep, by others only 205. It is about 45 feet wide at the bottom, and 90 feet at the top. The breadth of the bridge in the middle is about 60 feet, but more at the ends, and the thickness of the rafters at the summit of the arch is about 40 feet. A part of this thickness consists of a coat of earth which gives growth to many large trees. The residue, with the hill on both sides, is one solid rock of limestone. Though the sides of this bridge are provided in some places with a parapet of fixed rocks, yet few men have resolution to advance, without creeping upon their hands and feet, to look over into the abyss. To a spectator from the low ground, the arch appears beautiful and light as if springing\nIn the same state of Virginia, there are some caverns mentioned by the American geographer, Dr Morfe, which are not unworthy of notice as natural curiosities. The most noted is that called Maddison's Cave, on the north side of the mountains denominated the Blue Ridge, near the river Shenandoah. It is in a hill of about 200 feet perpendicular height, the ascent of which on one side is so steep, that you may pitch a biscuit from its summit into the water which wets its base. The entrance of the cave is in this side, about two-thirds of the way up. It extends into the earth about 300 feet, branching into subordinate caverns, sometimes ascending a little, but more generally descending, and at length terminates in two different places, at basins of water of unknown extent, nearly on a level with the water of the river, of which, however, they do not seem to be affluent water, as they are never turbid, and do not rise and fall in correspondence with it, in seasons of rain or drought. The vault of the cave is of solid limestone, from 20 to 40 and 50 feet high, through which water is continually percolating. This water has deposited a crust, forming the appearance of an elegant drapery, on the sides of the cave, and in dropping from the roof of the vault, generates on that and on the base, stalactites of a conical form, some of which have met and formed massy columns.\n\nThere is another cave, in the North Ridge or North Mountain, which enters from the summit of the ridge. The descent is at first 30 or 40 feet perpendicular, as into a well, from whence the cave extends nearly horizontally 400 feet, preserving a breadth of from 20 to 50 feet, and a height of from five to 12 feet. The heat of the cave is permanently at about 57° of Fahrenheit's thermometer.\n\nIn another ridge is a blowing cave in the side of a hill. It is about 100 feet diameter, and constantly emits a current of air, of such force, as to keep the weeds prostrate to the distance of 20 yards before it. The current is strongest in frost, and weakest after long rains. It probably communicates with a waterfall in the bowels of the earth, the dashing of which generates the current of air, as we know that at the mines, called Lead Hills, in Scotland, for more than a century past, a small waterfall at the bottom of a mine, has been used for the purpose of ventilation, the air generated from the water being conveyed in large tubes to any place where it is wanted. The blowing engine, called the trompe, which is used at some foundries, is also constructed on the same principle.\n\nOn the first of June 1796, a pretty remarkable phenomenon occurred in the vicinity of the town of Katkille, vol. ii. kill., in the state of New York. The country in the neighbourhood is a succession of little hills, or rather small elevations, detached from each other, and only connected a little at the basins. One of these hills, the nearest to Katkille Creek, and elevated about 100 feet above the level of the creek, suddenly suffered a sinking of more than half its declivity. It might have measured about 150 feet, from its summit to the extremity of its base, following the line of inclination. A breadth of about 80 fathoms fell in, beginning at about 3 or 4 fathoms from the top. The sunk part gave way all of a sudden, and fell so perpendicularly that a flock of sheep feeding on the spot, went down with it without being overturned. The trunks of trees that remained on it in a half rotten state, were neither unrooted, nor even inclined from their former direction, and now stand at the bottom of this chasm, of above four acres in extent, in the same perpendicular position, and on the same soil. However, as there was not sufficient space for all this body of earth, which before had lain in a flope, to place itself horizontally between the two parts of the hill that have separated their station, some parts are cracked, and as it were furrowed. But a more striking circumstance is, that the lower part of the hill, which has preserved its former shape, has been pushed and thrown forward by the sinking part making itself room; so that its base has advanced five or six fathoms beyond a small rivulet, which before flowed at the distance of above 10 fathoms from it; and that it has even entirely stopped the course of its stream. The greatest elevation of the chasm, is about 50 or 60 feet; in its sides it has discovered a blue earth, exhibiting all the characteristics of marl. In some of the flats of the marl is found sulphate of lime in minute crystals. The sinking of the hill made little noise, as not to be heard at the proprietor's house, at the distance of 300 fathoms, nor at the town, which is separated from the hill only by the narrow stream of the creek.\n\nThe soil of the United States is not less various than soil in other countries. In the New England states, in consequence of the irregularity of the surface, rich and poor territory are intermingled; but in the southern states, the limits of the fertile and of the more unproductive parts of the country are more distinctly marked. In general the soil is less deep and rich as the land approaches towards the mountains. The neighbourhood of the sea consists of great swamps, which being overflowed by the adjoining rivers, render the land unhealthy, though fit for the cultivation of rice and other valuable productions. Hence, as the first or lowest ridges of mountains possess a considerable degree of fertility, they are better inhabited, because more healthful than the low country. The long valleys between the ridges of the Alleghany mountains are everywhere fertile; but they are sometimes very narrow. Beyond the mountains from Fort Pitt to the northern lakes in the back parts of the state of New York, the country is fertile but moist, and lies low. Around Fort Pitt itself, as already mentioned, to a considerable distance, the country has a beautiful variegated aspect. On the eastern side of the Ohio, however, below Fort Pitt, the country speedily becomes rugged; and, for some hundred miles is little inhabited, to the borders of the fertile country of Kentucky, which in a few years has been settled, rendered populous, and affirmed into the number of the United States. To the westward of the Ohio little is known, excepting that the country is covered with forests and abounds in game, which last circumstance is always a sufficient proof of the existence of abundance of vegetable food, and consequently of a fertile soil. In general, however, concerning the\nThe mineral productions of the territory of the United States are various, as in other parts of the world. The form of mountains, rocks, and beds, of different minerals, is the same here as elsewhere. There are found different species of granite, combined and varied as in the mountains of Europe; innumerable kinds of schists, of limestones, more or less perfect, and minerals of almost every species. In general, however, it may be remarked, that American mineralogy offers few varieties for observation, as the same substances usually pervade a considerable tract of country. The great mountains, that is to say, the most elevated, particularly the central ridge of the Alleghany, and the highest mountains of New England, are generally formed of granite. Those of inferior altitude succeedively exhibit schists more or less perfect, slate, feldspar, calcareous stone, and some sand stones of extreme hardness, and in a state of great perfection. The whole territory to the eastward of the Alleghany mountains, appears to embrace vast quantities of iron ore. The iron ore is of two kinds: one is capable of being manufactured into malleable iron, and is found in the mountains, and also in low barren soils. The other kind of iron is called bog-ore. It is produced in rich valleys. It is said to consist of iron united with the phosphoric acid. In the furnace it yields iron of a hard brittle quality. In consequence of the abundance of timber still to be found in the country, a considerable number of iron mines are wrought to the eastward of the mountains; the fuel used in which consists of charcoal. Their produce, however, is very trifling; none of them make more than to the amount of 1600 tons of pig iron annually, and about 150 tons of bar iron. The toughness of the cast iron manufactured in some of the Virginian furnaces, is said to be very remarkable. Pots and other utensils, cast thinner than usual of this iron, may be safely thrown into or out of the wagons in which they are transported. Salt pans made of it, and no longer wanted for that purpose, cannot be broken up to be melted again, unless previously drilled in many parts.\n\nCoal mines are wrought in the eastern part of Virginia; but, upon the whole, little coal is found in the United States to the eastward of the mountains, where iron ores are extremely abundant. On the contrary, to the westward of these mountains, iron has scarcely been perceived; whereas coal is in the greatest plenty. In the fine country round Pittsburgh, at the head of the Ohio, 320 miles west from Philadelphia, coal is not only extremely plentiful, but of a very superior quality. A bed of it in that neighbourhood was on fire for about twenty years, but little damage appears to have been produced. Coal has been discovered in many places to the eastward of the Ohio, as to produce an opinion, that the whole tract of country beyond the mountains, from Pittsburgh to the Mississippi, abounds with it. Immense beds of limestone rock are to be found in the most eastern tract of mountains. Below these mountains it seldom appears; but in Virginia, from the Blue Ridge westward, the whole country seems to be founded on a rock of limestone, besides America. Great quantities on the surface both loose and fixed. It is formed into beds which range as the mountains and sea coast do, from south-west to north-east; the laminae of each bed declining from the horizon towards a parallelism with the axis of the earth. In some instances, however, but rarely, they are found perpendicular and even reclining the other way. But such cases are always attended with signs of convulsion, or other circumstances of singularity. Limestone is also found on the Mississippi and Ohio. Indeed that mineral appears to pervade the whole length of the ridges of the Alleghany mountains, and towards the lakes Erie and Ontario, the whole country rests upon limestone. It is not found on the high ridges themselves of the Alleghany mountains; but it occupies the fertile valleys between them, and is seen on the banks of the rivers which pass along these valleys. It sometimes appears to the eastward, in the form of very fine marble, chiefly coloured, quarries of which are wrought to adorn the houses of the wealthier citizens in the great towns.\n\nCopper has been found in a variety of situations to the eastward of the mountains. At the distance of eight or ten miles from New York is a pretty rich copper mine. The ore is irregularly scattered through a kind of sand-stone, often resembling grit, and sometimes the pudding-stone. It yields from 60 to 70 pounds of fine copper per cwt. Previous to the revolution it used to be carried to England, where it bore a higher price than any other ore of the same metal. The mine has been several times wrought, abandoned, and resumed. Some workmen, mostly Germans, were brought over from Europe for the purpose within these few years, and paid from 15 to 20 dollars per month. But the high price of labour and the difficulty of obtaining well executed machinery, impede in the United States great difficulties upon all mineralogical enterprises. At New Brunswick, in New Jersey, a copper mine was at one time wrought, in which large quantities of virgin copper were discovered. In particular, in the year 1754, two lumps of virgin copper are said to have been found, which together weighed 1900 pounds. In the course of a few years preceding, within a quarter of a mile of New Brunswick, several pieces of virgin copper, from five to thirty pound weight, in whole upwards of 200 pounds, were even turned up in a field by the plough; but the mine has ceased to be wrought, and the search for the metal discontinued.\n\nConsiderable quantities of black lead are found, and occasionally taken for use from a place, called Winterham, in the county of Amelia in Virginia. No work is established there; but those who want the mineral go and procure it for themselves.\n\nTo the westward of the mountains some lead mines have been found, which will probably hereafter become valuable. In the western part of the state of Virginia, one mine has been for some time wrought by the public. The metal is mixed sometimes with earth and sometimes with rock, which required the force of gunpowder to open it. The proportions yielded are from 50 to 80 pounds of pure metal, from 100 pounds of worked ore. The most common proportion is that of 60 to 100 pound. The lead contains a portion of silver, too small to be worth separation under any process known.\nAmerica to the American workmen. The veins are at times very flattering, and afterwards disappear suddenly and totally. They enter the side of the hill and proceed horizontally. Only about 30 labourers have been employed, and they cultivate their own corn. They have produced 60 tons of lead in a year, but the general quantity is from 20 to 25 tons. Lead mines are also said to have been discovered on the upper parts of the Mississippi, extending over a great length of country; but they are not wrought. Silver mines are also said to have been found in the territory of New York, and in the western country, particularly on the Wabash river; but they are too poor to be worth working. In the territory of New York zinc has been found, and likewise manganese, with various kinds of pyrites; also petrified wood, platter of Paris, talc, crystals of various kinds and colours, asbestos, and several other fossils; also a small black stone, which vitrifies with little heat and makes good glass.—A kind of mica, called by the Americans \"ingloft,\" has also been found, which is transparent, and capable of being divided into thin laminae or sheets, which may be used as a convenient substitute for window glass. Amethysts have been frequently found in Virginia; and even the emerald is not unknown. In the north mountains are immense bodies of schist, containing impositions of shells of various kinds. Petrified shells are also found in very elevated situations at the first sources of the Kentucky river. On the banks of Savannah river in South Carolina, about 90 miles from the sea in a direct line, and 150 or 200 as the river runs, there is a remarkable collection of oyster shells of an uncommon size. They run in a north-east and south-west direction, nearly parallel with the sea coast, in three distinct ridges, which together occupy a space of seven miles in breadth. Such a phenomenon cannot easily be accounted for in any other way than by supposing the whole of this flat country to have been at one period an appendage of the ocean.\n\nSulphur is said to be found in several places of the western territory; and nitre is obtained, as in Spain, by lixiviating the fat earth that is found upon the banks of the rivers. But the most valuable mineral that has hitherto been found in Kentucky and other parts of the western territory, consists of the salt that is obtained by the evaporation of the water of certain springs. Such springs appear to be unknown to the callow of the mountains; but they abound upon the Ohio, where they are more necessary on account of the great distance from the sea. They were discovered in the following curious manner:—The first inhabitants found, that the wild beasts of the forest, especially the buffaloes and deer, were accustomed to come in great crowds to certain spots, and there to employ themselves, apparently with much pleasure, in licking the ground. On examining the soil at these places, it was found to possess a considerable impregnation of sea salt, of which almost all animals that feed upon vegetables are known to be fond. The want of this commodity was a source of much distress to the first emigrants to Kentucky, and was one of the chief obstacles to the settlement of the country; but the example of the inferior animals indicated a mode of relieving their wants. The spots frequented by the buffaloes were called \"licks,\" and at every lick it was found that an area of from five to ten acres is impregnated with common salt; so that by digging wells salt water might be obtained, from which salt can be extracted by evaporation. At least 12 of these licks, or salt springs, have been found in the new state of Kentucky; the principal of which are, Bullet's Lick, or Salt River, 20 miles from the rapids of the Ohio; Drinnon's Lick, about a mile and a half from the mouth of the Kentucky. On the fault what is called Licking Creek there are two springs, called the Upper and Lower Blue Licks; and there is one called Great Bone Lick, from the bones of animals of a monstrous size, of a species that no longer exists, that have been found scattered in its neighbourhood. The water obtained from these springs is by no means so strong as sea water. It requires nearly 400 gallons to make one bushel of salt, which is more by one half than would be wanted of sea water in the same latitude to produce that quantity. In consequence, however, of the abundance of fuel that exists in a country where the finest timber is still considered as a nuisance, salt is here manufactured in plenty, and is sold tolerably cheap.\n\nVarious springs of water impregnated with other mineral ingredients have been found in the territory of the United States, some of which are much frequented by valetudinarians. In 1794, a sulphureous spring was discovered at a few yards distance from the banks of the river Chippeway, which falls into the Niagara, a little above the falls. On the approach of a firebrand, the vapour or steam kindles, assumes the form of burning spirit of wine, and burns down to the bottom. In the state of New York, the springs of Saratoga are much noted. They are eight or nine in number, situated on the margin of a morass, about twelve miles west from the confluence of a stream called Fish Creek, with Hudson's river. They are surrounded by a limestone rock, apparently formed of petrifications deposited by the water. One of the springs particularly attracts attention: it sometimes rises above the earth in the form of a pyramid. The aperture in the top which discovers the water is perfectly cylindrical, about nine inches diameter. In this the water is about twelve inches below the top, except at its annual discharge, which is commonly at the beginning of summer. At all times it appears to be in as great agitation as if boiling in a pot, although it is extremely cold. The same appearances obtain in the other springs, except that the surrounding rocks are of different figures, and the water flows regularly from them. The air which rises in the springs, and causes the ebullition, appears to consist in part at least of carbonic acid gas, with which the water is strongly impregnated, as well as with lime, dissolved by the acid. It also contains a chalybeate impregnation. In the chain of the Alleghany mountains called the Laurel Ridge, about latitude 36°, there is a spring of water 30 feet deep, very cold, and as blue as indigo; but the nature of the impregnation has not been ascertained.\n\nThere is in Pennsylvania, beyond the mountains, a stream called Oil Creek, which flows into the Alleghany river. It issues from a spring, on the top of which floats an oil similar to that called Barbados tar, and from which one man may gather several gallons in a day. The troops sent to guard the western post halted at this spring, collected some of the oil, and bathed.\nAmerica; their joints with it. This gave them great relief from the rheumatic complaints with which they were affected. The waters, of which the troops drank freely, operated as a gentle purge.\n\nIn the county of Anguilla in Virginia, near the sources of James's river, are two springs, distinguished by the appellation of Warm and Hot. They are eight miles distant from each other, and are strongly impregnated with sulphur. They are said to be useful for rheumatic, and some other complaints. The warm spring issues with a very bold stream, sufficient to work a grist mill, and to keep the waters of its basin, which is 32 feet in diameter, at blood heat, or 96° of Fahrenheit. The hot spring is much smaller, and has been so hot as to boil an egg. Some believe its degree of heat to be lessened. It raises the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer to 112°. It sometimes relieves where the warm spring fails. A fountain of common water issuing near its margin gives it a singular appearance.\n\nWhat are called the sweet springs are in the county of Botetourt in the same state, at the eastern foot of the Alleghany, 42 miles from the warm springs. They are quite cold, like common water, and their nature is little known; but all three sorts of springs are much frequented. On the Potowmack, and on York river, are also some springs, supposed to be medicinal; but in favour of whose virtues little is known.\n\nIn the low grounds of the river called Great Kanawha, 67 miles above its mouth, is a hole in the earth, of the capacity of thirty or forty gallons, from which issues constantly a bituminous vapour, in so strong a current as to give to the land about its orifice the motion which it has in a boiling spring. On prefacing a lighted candle or torch within 18 inches of the hole, it flames up in a column of 18 inches diameter, and four or five feet in height, which sometimes burns out within 20 minutes, and at other times has been known to continue three days, and then has been left still burning. The flame is unfeely, of the density of that of burning spirits, and smells like burning pit coal. Water sometimes collects in the basin, which is remarkably cold, and is kept in ebullition by the vapour issuing through it. If the vapour be fired in that state, the water soon becomes so warm that the hand cannot bear it, and evaporates wholly in a short time. On Sandy River there is a similar hole that sends forth a bituminous vapour, the flame of which is a column of about twelve inches diameter and three feet high.\n\nIn the state of Georgia, in the county of Wilkes, about a mile and a half from the town of Washington, a spring rises from a hollow tree, four or five feet in length. The inside of the tree is incrusted with a coat of nitre an inch thick, and the leaves around the spring are incrusted with a substance as white as snow, which has not been analyzed. It is recommended for scurvy and scrophulous disorders.\n\nThe vegetable kingdom in the United States of America is so extremely rich, that even an enumeration of its remarkable objects would greatly exceed the bounds which we have here prescribed to ourselves. Indeed, it does not appear that, excepting the sugar cane, any valuable vegetable production is known which cannot be reared within some part of the territory of the states. With regard to the natural growth of these countries, it consists of an endless variety of trees and shrubs, and lesser plants. Each tract of different soil is usually distinguished by its peculiar vegetation, and is pronounced good, middling, or bad, from the species of trees which it produces; and one species generally predominating in each soil, has produced the descriptive names of Oak Land, Birch, Beech, and Chestnut Lands, Pine Barren Land, Maple, &c., and Cedar Swamps. Intermingled with these, which in the New England states are the predominating species, we find in that northern territory others, as walnut, firs, elm, hemlock, moose wood, laffarass, and many others. Walnut and chestnut trees indicate the best lands; beech and oak grow upon the second; the fir and pitch pine upon the third; barberry and other bushes upon lands of the next quality; and marshy shrubs upon the worst. Along with these are found a variety of flowering trees and shrubs, including all those known in Europe. Among the fruits which grow wild in all the states are several kinds of grapes, which are small, sour, and thick skinned. The vines on which they grow are very luxuriant, and often overhang the highest trees of the forest. They are extremely tough, and possess almost the strength of cordage. On the more fertile soils, the largest trees seldom push their roots into the earth beyond the depth of one foot, being no doubt fed by the rich mould which is formed on the surface by the perpetual shedding of the leaves and the rotting of the grass. In the northern states, the fragrance of the woods from flowering shrubs and trees is not so remarkable as in the south; nor is the timber so valuable. In South Carolina, indeed, the luxuriance of the woods stands unrivalled. There are 18 different species of oak, particularly the live oak, palmetto, or cabbage tree, cucumber tree, deciduous cypress, liquid amber, hickory, &c.; in short, all the species of trees which are so excessively dear in Europe, ten of which are planted to save one, for which both situation and soil are carefully selected, and which yet never attain any considerable height, are here the natural produce of the country, and vegetate with the utmost rapidity. Equally striking to Europeans is the pleasing luxuriance of shrubs, plants, and various kinds of grasses; most of which diffuse an exquisite fragrance.\n\nOf the smaller vegetables, maize, or Indian corn, is a native of America. It agrees with all climates, from the equator to latitude 45°, but flourishes best between latitudes 30° and 40°. The wild rice is a grain which grows in great plenty in some of the interior parts of the states, and seems the most valuable of the spontaneous productions of the country. It grows in the water, where it is about two feet deep, with a rich muddy bottom. In its stalk, ears, and manner of growing, it very much resembles oats. It is gathered by the Indians in the following manner: About the time that it begins to turn from its milky state, and to ripen, they run their canoes into the midst of it, and, tying bunches of it together, just below the ears, they leave it in this situation for three or four weeks, till it is perfectly ripe. At the end of this time, commonly about the last of September, they return to the river, and, placing their canoes close to the bunches of rice, in such a position as to receive the grain when it falls,\nWe have already enumerated the American quadrupeds, and have seen, that of these a considerable number is peculiar to America. Upwards of 130 American birds have been enumerated, and many of them described by Catesby, Jefferson, and Carver. The following catalogue will show the astonishing variety that exists in the American states, of this beautiful part of the creation:\n\nBlackbird.\nRazor-billed do.\nBaltimore bird.\nBaflard Baltimore.\nBlue bird.\nBuzzard.\nBlue jay.\nBlue grobeak.\nBrown bittern.\nCrested do.\nSmall do.\nBooby.\nGreat booby.\nBlue Peter.\nBullfinch.\nBald coot.\nCutwater.\nWhite curlew.\nCat bird.\nCuckow.\nCrow.\nCowpen bird.\nChattering plover or kildee.\nCrane or blue heron.\nYellow-breasted chat.\nCormorant.\nHooping crane.\nPine creeper.\nYellow-throated creeper.\nDove.\nGround dove.\nDuck.\nPlathera duck.\nRound-crested do.\nSheldrake or canvas do.\nBuffels-head do.\nSpoonbill do.\nSummer do.\nBlackhead do.\nBlue-winged shoveller.\nLittle brown duck.\nSprigtail.\nWhite-faced teal.\nBlue-winged teal.\nPied-bill dobchick.\nEagle.\nBald eagle.\nFlamingo.\nFieldfare of Carolina, or robin.\nPurple inch.\nBahama finch.\n\nAmerican goldfinch.\nPainted finch.\nCrested fly-catcher.\nBlack-cap do.\nLittle brown do.\nRed-eyed do.\nFinch creeper.\nStorm finch.\nGoatfucker of Carolina.\nGull.\nLaughing gull.\nGoofe.\nCanada goofe.\nHawk.\nFishing hawk.\nPigeon do.\nNight do.\nSwallow-tailed do.\nHangbird.\nHeron.\nLittle white heron.\nHeath cock.\nHumming bird.\nPurple jackdaw or crow blackbird.\nKing bird.\nKingfisher.\nLoon.\nLark.\nLarge lark.\nBlue linnet.\nMock bird.\nMow bird.\nPurple martin.\nNightingale.\nNoddy.\nNuthatch.\nOyster-catcher.\nOwl.\nScreech owl.\nAmerican partridge or quail.\nPheasant or mountain partridge.\nWater pheasant.\nPelican.\nWater pelican.\nPigeon of passage.\nWhite-crowned pigeon.\nParrot of paradise.\nParoquet of Carolina.\nRaven.\nRice bird.\nRed bird.\nSummer red bird.\nSwan.\nSoree.\nSnipe.\nRedlart.\nRed-winged starling.\nSwallow.\nChimney do.\nSnow bird.\nLittle sparrow.\nBahama do.\nStork.\nTurkey.\nWild turkey.\nTyrant.\nCrested titmouse.\nYellow do.\nBahama do.\nHooded do.\nYellow rump.\n\nOf all these, it has been remarked, that the birds of America generally exceed those of Europe in the beauty of their plumage; but are much inferior to them in the melody of their notes. The buzzard, commonly called the turkey buzzard, from its resemblance to the turkey in plumage and shape, is very common all over South Carolina. It appears, that the police of Charlestown is extremely deficient in those measures which should not be neglected in a populous town, in so hot a climate. Hence the bodies of dead animals are frequently left exposed in the neighbourhood, together with the refuse of slaughterhouses. But the voracity of the turkey buzzard alleviates the effects of this negligence. It speedily devours every thing, and leaves only the bones of any carcass that it finds. Hence it is accounted a kind of sacred bird: no law has been enacted prohibiting it to be killed; but among the whole inhabitants of the town, the public opinion sufficiently protects its safety.\n\nIn all parts of the United States, considerable numbers of snakes are found. But they are neither so numerous nor so venomous in the northern as in the southern states. The following is given as a list of them:\n\nRattle snake.\nSmall rattle snake.\nYellow rattle snake.\nWater viper.\nBlack do.\nBrown do.\nCopper-bellied snake.\nBluish-green do.\nBlack do.\nRibbon do.\nSpotted ribbon do.\nChain do.\nJoint do.\nGreen-spotted do.\nCoachwhip do.\n\nCorn snake\nHognose do.\nHouse do.\nGreen do.\nWampum do.\nGlads do.\nBead do.\nWall or house adder\nStriped or garter snake.\nWater do.\nHissing do.\nThorn-tailed do.\nSpeckled do.\nRing do.\nTwo-headed do.\n\nThe joint snake is a curiosity. Its skin is as hard as parchment, and as smooth as glass. It is beautifully marked.\nAmerica. Striped with black and white. Its joints are so few and stiff, that it can hardly bend itself into the form of a hoop. When struck, it breaks like a pipe's stem, and with a whip it may be broken from the tail to the bowels into pieces not an inch long, without producing the least tincture of blood. It is not venomous. It is not known whether the two-headed snake be a distinct species, or only a monstrous production, very few of them having ever been seen. But of all the American snakes, the rattle snake is the chief, as being the most frequent and the most dangerous. It is a peaceful animal however, and never bites but on being irritated. In the northern states it is little regarded, and its bite seems not be fatal. \"We found,\" says the duke de la Rochefoucault Liancourt, \"a young man, who about six weeks before had been bitten on the knee by a rattle snake, while he was fishing on the banks of Lake Caunadagua. At first he did not feel much pain in the part affected; but an hour afterwards a swelling appeared, which gradually extended all along the leg to the foot, and both became so stiff that he was unable to move them. A cure was effected within the space of only six days by the juice of snake-root laid on the wound and swelling, as a poultice, mixed with milk, together with a few drops of that juice, pure and unmixed, taken internally. Instances of such bites occur but very seldom, and only, it seems, when the animal has been touched; otherwise it constantly retires, and may be killed by a blow with the slenderest stick.\" But in the southern states, particularly in South Carolina, the inhabitants are more afraid of these animals than in New York or Pennsylvania; as instances are known in that southern climate of people having died a quarter of an hour after they were bitten by the rattle snake. The juice of plantago Virginiana, Linn., or the root and branches of mahua bruised, are the remedies most commonly applied. Either of these plants is sufficient; but they are deemed more efficacious when they are applied jointly. A tobacco leaf steeped in rum, or a single leaf of one of the above plants, takes off the pain and swelling. Caesar, a negro, discovered this cure in South Carolina; he proved its efficacy to the assembly of the states, in 1750, by causing a rattle snake to bite him; and obtained for this arcanum his liberty, and a pension of 100 guineas a-year.\n\nAn astonishing variety of insects is found in the United States. Of these, during the summer, the matketo is the most troublesome. In the back parts of the state of New York, the lands are frequently visited by a species of locusts which fix chiefly on the trees, and consume the leaves. They are so extremely numerous, that every attempt to destroy or remove them is apparently fruitless. Flies, likewise, in moist situations, are very troublesome, being found in such prodigious swarms, especially about noon, that the farmers are obliged to keep large fires burning near their houses, where the cattle find shelter from these tormenting insects till the cool of the evening, when the latter disappear, and retire into the woods.\n\nBees are found in the woods in swarms, which produce large quantities of honey, of different qualities, according to the kinds of flowering shrubs and plants that prevail in the neighbourhood. It is said, however, that this valuable insect is most usually found in the vicinity of cultivated places, where a part at least America of the timber has been cut down, and that hence, when the savages perceive a swarm of bees, they say, that it is time for them to remove, as the approaches of cultivation not only bring white men, who are always in some measure their enemies, but also tend to narrow their hunting grounds. The planters not only rear enough of bees to supply themselves with honey of an excellent quality, but considerable quantities are brought to the coast for exportation.\n\nAn account has been given by an American physician, Dr Benjamin Smith Barton, of a poisonous honey, injurious kind of honey collected by bees in the territory of the United States, which is, perhaps, worthy of attention both for philosophical and for commercial reasons. \"The honey which I call deleterious,\" says he, \"or poisonous honey, produces, as far as I have learned, the following symptoms, viz. In the beginning a diminution of sight, or vertigo succeeded by a delirium, which is sometimes mild and pleasant, and sometimes ferocious, ebriety, pain in the stomach and intestines, profuse perspiration, foaming at the mouth, vomiting and purging, and, in a few instances, death. In some persons a vomiting is the first effect of the poison. When this is the case, it is probable that the persons suffer much less from the honey than when no vomiting is induced. Sometimes the honey has been observed to produce a temporary palsy of the limbs: an effect which I have remarked in animals that have eaten one of those very vegetables, the kalmia latifolia, from whose flowers the bees obtain a pernicious honey. Death is very seldom the consequence of eating this kind of honey. The violent impression which it makes upon the stomach and intestines often induces an early vomiting or purging, which are both favourable to the speedy recovery of the patient. The fever which it excites is frequently relieved, in a short time, by the profuse perspiration, and perhaps by the foaming at the mouth. I may add, that, as the human constitution resists to an astonishing degree the effects of the narcotic or other poisonous vegetables that are best known to us, so we need not wonder, that it also resists the effects of the deleterious honey that is produced from such vegetables.\n\n\"It deserves to be mentioned, that the honey which is formed by two different hives of bees in the same tree, or at a little distance from each other, often possesses the most opposite properties. Nay, the honey from the same individual combs is sometimes not less different in taste, in colour, and in its effects. Thus one stratum or portion of it may be eaten without the least inconvenience, whilst that which is immediately adjacent to it shall occasion the several effects which I have just enumerated. I have taken some pains to learn what are the signs by which the deleterious honey may at first view be distinguished from innocent honey. I am informed, that there is no difficulty in the matter.\n\n\"The poisonous honey is said by some to be of a crimson colour; by others, it is said to be of a reddish brown colour, and of a thicker consistence than common innocent honey. These are the signs by which I am told the most experienced hunters in the southern parts of North America are enabled to distinguish pernicious from innocent honey.\"\n\nDr\nDr Barton, however, justly doubts the infallibility of these signs, so far as they depend upon the colour of the honey, as Mr Bruce found honey red like blood at Dixan in Abyssinia, which he does not say was poisonous; and the honey collected in Scotland from the flowers of the erica, or blooming heather, is usually of a dirty brown colour, though it was never known to possess any noxious property. He proceeds to state, that a friend of his, Mr William Bartram, who has written upon the natural productions of North America, informed him, that \"in the Carolinas and Floridas the poisonous honey is often similar in colour, taste, and odour, to the common or innocent honey, that the former cannot be distinguished from the latter. It is owing, he says, to this circumstance that so many accidents daily happen from the use of the wild honey. He was informed, that it is experience alone which enables the hunters and others to determine whether the honey which they find in the woods be poisonous or innocent. They have observed that the injurious effects manifest themselves, in a short time, after the honey is taken into the stomach. They are accustomed, therefore, to eat a small quantity before they venture to satisfy their appetite. Should this produce any disagreeable effects, they do not think it prudent to continue the use of it; but, if in a short time it should occasion no inconvenience, they think they may, with perfect safety, indulge their appetite to the full.\n\n\"I have been informed, that the poisonous honey, by boiling and straining, may be rendered as innocent as any honey whatever. It is likewise said, that, by long keeping, it becomes harmless. It is poisonous to dogs as well as to men. Hitherto I have not been able to obtain any certain information concerning the means to be pursued in the treatment of persons labouring under the effects of the poisonous honey. It is said, that the Indians and some of the whites use cold bathing with advantage. As the effects produced by this honey are similar to those produced by several narcotic vegetables that are well known to us; such as opium, hyoscyamus niger or henbane, datura stramonium or thorn-apple, &c., it is probable that the same means of treatment will apply to both cases. In South Carolina, Georgia, and the two Floridas, but more especially in East Florida, the instances of injury from the eating of wild honey are more numerous than in any other parts of North America that are known to us. There is a tract of country, included between the rivers St Illa and St Mary's in East Florida, that is remarkable for immense numbers of bees. These insects, which were originally introduced into Florida by the Spaniards, have increased into innumerable swarms from the facility with which they procure their food, in, perhaps, the richest flowered country of North America. In this tract of country the alarming effects of the wild honey are often experienced by the settlers, by wandering hunters, and by savages.\n\n\"It is highly probable that this poisonous honey is procured from a considerable number of the flowers of the countries which I have mentioned. A complete list of these flowers would be acceptable; but such a list it will be difficult to procure at present. Meanwhile I am happy to have it in my power to mention some of the vegetables from whose flowers the bees extract a deleterious honey, not only in the country between the American St Illa and St Mary's, but also in some other parts of North America. These vegetables are the kalmia angustifolia and latifolia of Linnaeus, the kalmia biflora of Walter, the audromeda mariana, and some other species of this genus.\n\n\"Every American has heard of the poisonous properties of the kalmia angustifolia and latifolia. The former of these plants is known in the United States by the names of dwarf laurel, rey, landkill, &c. It has long been known that its leaves, when eaten by sheep, prove fatal to them. The following fact likewise will show, that the flowers also are endowed with a poisonous property. About 20 years since, a party of young men, solicited by the prospect of gain, moved with a few hives of bees from Pennsylvania into the Jerseys. They were induced to believe, that the savannahs of this latter country were very favourable to the increase of their bees, and consequently to the making of honey. They accordingly placed their hives in the midst of these savannahs, which were finely painted with the flowers of the kalmia angustifolia. The bees increased prodigiously; and it was evident, that the principal part of the honey which they made was obtained from the flowers of the plant which I have just mentioned. I cannot learn that there was anything uncommon in the appearance of the honey; but all the adventurers, who ate of it, became intoxicated to a great degree. From this experiment they were sensible that it would not be prudent to sell their honey; but, unwilling to lose all their labour, they made the honey into the drink well known by the name of metheglin, supposing that the intoxicating quality, which had resided in the honey, would be lost in the metheglin. In this respect, however, they were mistaken: the drink also intoxicated them, after which they removed their hives. In North Carolina, this species of kalmia, and the andromeda mariana are supposed to be the principal vegetables from which the bees prepare the poisonous honey that is common in that part of the United States.\n\n\"The kalmia latifolia, known in the United States by the names of laurel, great laurel, winter green, spoon bough, spoon wood, &c., is also a poison. Its leaves indeed are eaten with impunity by the deer, and by the round-horned elk; but they are poisonous to sheep, to horned cattle, and to horses. In the former of these animals they produce convulsions, foaming at the mouth, and death. Many of General Braddock's horses were destroyed by eating the leaves and the twigs of this shrub in the month of June 1755, a few days before this unfortunate general's defeat and death. In the severe winter of the years 1790 and 1791, there appeared to be such unequivocal reasons for believing that several persons in Philadelphia had died in consequence of their having eaten our pheasant, in whose crops the leaves and buds of the kalmia latifolia were found, that the mayor of the city thought it prudent, and his duty, to warn the people against the use of this bird by a public proclamation. I know, that by many persons, especially by some lovers of pheasant flesh, the circumstance just mentioned was supposed to be delusive of foundation: but the foundation was a solid one. This might be shown by several well authenticated facts. It is sufficient for my present purpose to observe,\"\nAmerica observe, that the collection of a deleterious honey from the flowers of this species of kalmia gives some countenance to the opinion, that the flesh of pheasants that had eaten the leaves and the buds of this plant may have been impregnated with a pernicious quality.\n\n\"In Georgia and Florida the kalmia hirta is supposed to be the principal vegetable from which the deleterious honey in these parts of our continent is procured. The andromeda mariana or broad-leaved moorwort is a very common plant in many parts of North America. The leaves are poisonous to sheep. The petioli or footstalks of the leaves, and the seeds within the seed vessel, are covered with a brown powder similar to that of the kalmia. This powder, applied to the nostrils, occasions violent sneezing. From the flowers of this plant the bees extract considerable quantities of honey; and it deserves to be mentioned, that this honey, as well as that obtained from some other American species of andromeda, has frequently the very smell of the flowers from which it is obtained.\"\n\nIn addition to the above plants, from whose flowers the bees are known to obtain poisonous honey, the same writer mentions some others which are suspected to be dangerous, as the rododendron maximum or Pennsylvania mountain laurel. The seeds of this plant and the footstalks of the leaves are covered, like some of the andromedae and kalmiae, with a brown powder which excites sneezing; and, it is singular, that Dioscorides mentions sneezing as one of the symptoms produced by honey made about Heraclia Pontica. The azalea nudiflora, called in the United States the wild honeysuckle, is also suspected of producing poisonous honey. A species of this genus, the azalea pontica of Linnaeus, is supposed to be the ogelothron of Pliny, who mentions it as the plant from which the poisonous honey about Heraclia Pontica is prepared. The datura stramonium, called in America James-town weed, gyn- jin, flint weed, or French chesnut, produces in the tube of its flower a considerable quantity of honey, which is suspected to be of a bad quality; because the plant itself is known to possess poisonous properties. Upon the whole, from what is known upon the subject in America, Dr Barton is led to suspect, that every flower that is poisonous to man may produce a honey injurious to man, since the properties of the fluid are to dependant upon the properties of the plant from which it is produced. Hence he thinks, that there is more of poetry than philosophy in the following lines of Pope:\n\n\"In the nice bee, what sense so subtly true,\nFrom poisonous herbs extracts the healing dew?\"\n\nThe kaiman, a species of the alligator, or crocodile, is also found in the southern rivers of the United States. Some of the kaimans are of monstrous size as to exceed five yards in length. They devour all living animals that they can catch. They are fond of the flesh of hogs and dogs. When basking on the shore, they keep their huge mouths wide open, till they are filled with musquitoes, flies, and other insects; when they suddenly shut their jaws, and swallow their prey. They are great destroyers of fish in the rivers and creeks, which they catch with the same address. Eight or ten of them lie at the mouth of the river or creek, whilst others go to a distance up the river, and chase the fish downward; by which means, none of any bigness escape them. They are said, however, to remain torpid during the winter in dens which they find in the banks of the rivers, having previously swallowed a large number of pine knots, which forms their only sustenance till the period of their revival or wakening. The kaiman seldom touches a man, however near it may lie to him. It constantly flees when at land; but in the water it is fiercer, and has been known to bite off the leg of a person bathing. It more frequently attacks dogs. Sometimes when hounds, in pursuit of a flag, swim through the water, the kaimans seize both hounds and deer, and pull them down to the bottom, without their ever appearing again. The scales with which they are coated render them invulnerable, unless the wound be inflicted in the interstices of the scales, or at the extremities.\n\nThe climate of the great territory belonging to the United States, must necessarily be various, in consequence of the difference of latitude and soil that takes place in it. The snow covers Vermont and the province of Maine, during five or six months of the year; and the winter there lasts seven months, while there is hardly any winter in South Carolina, and still less in Georgia. Should any snow fall in the latter of these states, it does not remain two days upon the ground. The sudden variation of temperature which frequently occurs, is the most remarkable characteristic of the climate of the whole states. It is usual to see the thermometer rise or fall 25° of Fahrenheit's scale in 24 hours. In April 1796, it fell in 12 hours from the 77th degree of Fahrenheit to 44°, and this observation was made at Wilmington in Delaware, and in Baltimore. The river Delaware at Philadelphia, 3 miles in breadth, is sometimes frozen over in one night; and the same thing occurs in all the rivers of Virginia and to the northward. The seasons, in the United States, are only three: summer, winter, and autumn, or what the Americans more expressively call the fall, from the falling of the leaves in the forests. The transition, from the locking up of all vegetation in winter to the sudden burst of it again to life at the beginning of summer, is so rapid as utterly to exclude that preëxisting and delightful season, which, in the more moderate climate of Europe receives the appellation of spring. Within a week or ten days after the melting of the snow, the woods and orchards are in full bloom. Both the heat and the cold are more intense in America than in Europe. The frost is stronger and more durable. The sunshine is more ardent and permanent, and the heat is far more opprobrious and intolerable. It may be remarked, that in the different latitudes of the United States, the heat differs more in its duration than in its power. In 1795 at Newark, on the frontiers of Upper Canada, the duke de la Rochefoucault Liancourt saw the thermometer of Fahrenheit rise in July to the 92°. In the month of August the same year, he saw it at 96° at Albany in the state of New York. At Savannah in Georgia, it seldom rises above that height; though from Newark or Albany, to Savannah, there is a difference of 14° of latitude. But the thermometer remains during a month or two at Savannah at this height, and very seldom two days together in the northern states. The following\nAmerica; following remarks and facts, relative to the climate and seasons in America and Europe, are given by Dr Holyoke of Salem in the state of Massachusetts; and completely demonstrate the intenseness both of the heat and the cold that are experienced in the most northerly states of the American union.\n\nThe following table exhibits the mean or medium degree of greatest heat and cold by Fahrenheit's thermometer:\n\n| Lat. | Mean of gr. heat | Mean of gr. cold |\n|------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Stockholm | 59° 20' | 84.93 | 10.96 |\n| Copenhagen | 55° 40' | 81.77 | 2.93a |\n| Berlin | 52° 32' | 80.37 | 0.62b |\n| Mons | 50° 25' | 80.15 | 1.18a |\n| Prague | 50° 4' | 92.7 | 12.77b |\n| Wurtzburg | 49° 46' | 93.87 | 4.6 |\n| Manheim | 49° 27' | 89.6 | 1.2a |\n| Ratibon | 48° 56' | 79.7 | 2.42b |\n| Buda | 47° 40' | 90.7 | 4.26a |\n| Geneva | 46° 12' | 88.9 | 10.2a |\n| Rochelle | 46° 0' | 90.5 | 16.03a |\n| Padua | 45° 22' | 91.4 | 16.93a |\n| Marseilles | 43° 17' | 89.6 | 27.5a |\n| Rome | 41° 53' | 85.43 | 33.46a |\n| Salem in Massachusetts | 42° 31' | 97.2 | 2.42b |\n\nThese European cities, except Rome, are all north of the latitude of Salem. But in the whole middle region of Europe, which is from 7 to 10 degrees north of Salem, the heat in summer and cold in winter is, on an average, less than at Salem by a difference of 5, 8, and 10 degrees. Comparing the temperature of the European atmosphere under nearly the same parallel of latitude with Salem, viz. at Rome, Padua, and Marseilles, it is found that the mean of greatest heat in Europe falls short of ours by 8 degrees, and the mean of greatest cold by more than 30 degrees. It is also found, by observations made at different times and places, that in America there falls a greater quantity of rain annually than in Europe; we have notwithstanding more fair weather, and fewer cloudy, foggy, and rainy days. The medium quantity of rain that falls yearly in Europe does not exceed 30 inches of water, whereas in America the medium quantity is at least 50 inches.\n\nThe mean number of fair days, according to observations made in 20 cities of Europe, amounts only to 64. Several observations in America make the mean number of fair days to be about 130. The mean number of cloudy days in the same cities of Europe (all which are upon the continent) was, in 1785, 113; in America there are about 80 or 90. The number of rainy days in the same cities was, on a mean, 122; the number in America is 85 or 90. These facts seem to prove that the atmosphere of Europe is more humid than that in America; and this may be one cause why the European climate is more temperate under the same parallels of latitude, and less subject to extremes of heat and cold.\n\nThe following facts concerning the temperature of our own climate are extremely curious. From observations made at four different hours in the day for seven years, it is found that the mercury in Fahrenheit America rose to 85° and upwards.\n\nIn 1786. In 1787. In 1788. In 1789. In 1790.

As that part of the country, however, is yet less inhabited, or has only been so for a short period, very few authentic documents have reached us concerning it.\n\nThe extremes of heat and cold which so rapidly succeed each other in America at different seasons, and which persevere so steadily when they are once begun, do not fail to affect very sensibly the health of the inhabitants of the United States. In general, people become old in America sooner than in Europe. In the more northern parts of the country, that is, in the New England states, and also near the mountains, this is less sensibly the case, but excepting in these situations, it is more rare to see men of a great age there than in Europe. The influence of the climate upon females is still more sensible. When young, they are generally beautiful, and more particularly so at Philadelphia, and in the other middle states. But after 20 years of age they soon begin to lose their fresh colour. At 25, many of them might be taken for Europeans of 40; as their bloom is faded, and their form has already suffered a change. If they have previously been mothers, which in this rising country is usually the case, their alteration is still more premature. Yet, it is admitted, that neither nightly revels, the abuse of spirituous liquors, the want of exercise, nor an excess of it, can be brought to account for this early change. In the northern states, the period of their beauty is indeed lengthened, but only for a few years. Whereas, in the southern states it is shortened. In South Carolina, at the age of 30, a woman appears old; and both men and women soon lose the bloom of youth, and feel the infirmities of age. At the age of 50, in that exhausting climate, the hair becomes entirely white. The number of children that die in their infancy is said to be proportionally much greater than in Europe; though this does not prevent the population from advancing with nearly twenty times the rapidity that it does with us. Colds, hooping-coughs, and disorders of the throat, carry off great numbers of children. The most common mortal diseases in all the states are dropsies of the chest, consumptions, and bilious and putrid fevers. Of diseases that are not mortal, the most frequent of all is the ague or intermittent fever, which, however, sometimes degenerates into a bilious fever. These intermittent fevers are undoubtedly the result of a climate abounding in moisture, arising from immense rivers, swamps, and forests, acted upon by the intense heat of a burning sun. In such a situation the human strength is exhausted, so as to be at all times liable to fall into this simple and least dangerous form of fever. Though it is experienced by almost every stranger, and at times by most of the natives, it is seldom hazardous; but at the same time it undoubtedly enfeebles the constitution, and prepares it for sinking under other diseases. It is always towards the end of summer, when the heat is most intense, and the health of the people most weakened by the hot and moist climate of America, that the dreadful disease, the yellow fever, makes its appearance. It thus comes at a period when intermittent fevers at all times abound; and the extreme mortality which it produces is probably to be accounted for, not less from the state of debility and relaxation with regard to general health, than from any peculiar malignity of the temper, which never fails to yield to the restorative and strengthening power of a few frothy days, or even rainy. It is a singular circumstance, that of the great number of French who were in Philadelphia during the different periods at which it was desolated by this fatal scourge, sometimes none, and never more than four or five in a season, suffered by the yellow fever, though none of them deserted the city on that occasion. The only plausible, though probably inadequate, account which has ever been given of the cause of their escaping that calamity, is their habitual abstinence from spirituous liquors; in the use of which the Americans of all ranks, that is the men, not the women, indulge very freely, and thereby no doubt increase the degree of debility which the climate has a tendency to produce, and consequently expose themselves in a greater degree to the influence of any contagious distemper. Under all its advantages, however, the climate of America allows the full exertion and enjoyment of all the human faculties. Men of sound constitutions in every part of it attain to old age. Even in South Carolina in 1787, of the 9600 white inhabitants of Charlestown 200 were above 60 years; and in the New England states instances of great longevity abound.\n\nThe manufactures that are carried on in the United States are extremely few. A year seldom passes away, without attempts being made by individuals to establish factories, cotton-works, glass-houses, and other extensive manufactories, but without success. Sometimes, particular states affit in the most liberal manner, with the public money, the undertakers of these plans; but the money is soon spent, and the work obliged to be dropped. The reason is obvious. In the European nations, men and women abound, and the lower classes are, therefore, under the necessity of giving their industry, and the result of their skill, for little more than what is barely sufficient to afford them subsistence. In America the case is different. Men are few, the soil is fertile and unoccupied, and subsistence is easily procured. Every man aspires, therefore, to the possession of something beyond the gratification of his present wants, or the mere necessaries of life. He endeavours to become independent, by obtaining and cultivating a portion of the soil for his\nAmerica, his own use. To withdraw him from an enterprise of this kind, which is so flattering to the passions of all men, a large reward is necessary, or, in other words, if an ordinary tradesman in America do not receive high wages, he will go to the woods, and settle as a farmer, or small proprietor, which in that country he can do upon easy terms. Hence it happens, that the manufacturers of Europe find it easy to underfell all those who attempt to rival them in America. Even, when a skilful European manufacturer conveys his capital and his tools across the Atlantic, the case is not altered. His servants and labourers must be carried along with him. Supposing this difficulty to be surmounted, he must immediately give them three times the wages that they received in Europe, or they will not remain in his service, as they can easily obtain such a price for their industry there. In consequence of high wages, they are enabled, in a year or two, to accumulate enough of money to enable them to purchase or obtain credit for a small farm, in a fertile though remote part of the country. They never fail, therefore, speedily to desert the business to which they were originally educated, and to betake themselves to agriculture, which, from the independence it affords, is of all occupations the most grateful to the human mind. Thus, any great manufacture carried on in America, could only be supported by a succession of emigrant workmen, receiving exorbitant wages, and having the prospect of immediately deserting it; a situation, in which it evidently could not prosper. Hence, to a very remote period, that is, till land shall become scarce and precious, in consequence of an overflowing population, the United States of America must depend upon Europe for their most valuable manufactures. Neither is this a misfortune to America. Men there, as elsewhere, in following out their own private intents, contribute most effectually to advance the prosperity of their country. Agriculture is there pursued because it is the most profitable of all employments to those who engage in it, and leads them most rapidly to the possession of property and independence; at the same time, by providing in abundance the means of subsistence, it facilitates to the community the acquisition of what chiefly it wants, a numerous population, which, by the natural progress of things will ultimately bring in its train the cultivation of all the arts.\n\nThe Americans, however, are not destitute of a considerable variety of such manufactures, as their peculiar situation has naturally led them to establish. We have already mentioned, the manufacture of iron from the ore, which they practice in several situations to the eastward of the mountains, though not to such extent as to supply the wants of their country. They also tan leather, which they are induced to do from the abundance of oak-bark that they possess; and they manufacture hats in considerable quantities. They have distilleries for the preparation of spirituous liquors, both from molasses imported from the West India islands, and from grain. Tradesmen in the towns, and private families in remote situations, prepare soap, candles, and malt liquors. In the remoter districts, the women also prepare a considerable part of the clothing of their families. Upon the rivers, great numbers of saw mills are erected, for the purpose of converting to profit the timber, which they are under the necessity of cutting down, before the lands can be brought into cultivation. Connected with this operation, of clearing the land of timber, is the preparation of pot and pearl ashes. As this forms a considerable branch of the trade of many American towns, the back country of which has been recently settled, we shall here state the mode of preparing this salt, which has been generally adopted.\n\nLarge tubs with a double bottom are filled with the potash ashes of wood: the uppermost bottom, which contains several holes, is covered with ashes, about 10 or 11 inches deep, while the under part of the tub is filled with straw or hay. Water being poured over the ashes extracts the particles of salt, and discharges all the heterogeneous matter which it may yet contain on the layer of hay or straw. The ley is drawn off by means of a cock, and if it should not yet have attained a sufficient degree of strength, poured again over the same or over fresh ashes. The ley is deemed sufficiently strong when an egg swims on it. This ley is afterwards boiled in large iron caldrons, which are constantly filled out of other caldrons, in which ley is likewise boiling. If the ley begins to thicken in the caldron, no fresh ley is added, but the fire is well fed with fuel until all the aqueous particles are separated, and the whole is completely inspissated and indurated. This salt is of a black colour, and called black potash. Some manufacturers leave the potash in this state in the caldron, and increase the fire, by means of which the oil is discharged from the salt in a thick smoke, and the black potash assumes a grey colour, in which state it is packed up in the barrels for sale.\n\nThe process of preparing the potash requires more or less time according to the quality of the ashes and the ley, and to the degree of strength of the latter; the medium time is 24 hours. The ashes of green wood, and especially of oak, are preferred. No potash can be prepared from the ashes of resinous trees, and ashes which are five or six months old are better than those that are new.\n\nSome manufacturers use only one caldron for boiling, which they fill with cold ley as it comes from the tubs, and others put the salt, as soon as it begins to coagulate, into smaller caldrons to complete the process.\n\nIn many parts of the state of New York, especially in the north, and the vicinity of Albany, the inhabitants who fell the wood prepare the potash. But there are also large manufactories, where from 30 to 40 tubs are used for preparing the ley, and from 10 to 12 caldrons for its evaporation. The manufacturers buy the ashes from private families. The tubs and caldrons are of different sizes, in proportion to the greater or less extent of the manufactory. By a general estimate, from five to six hundred bushels of ashes yield a ton of potash.\n\nThe barrels in which the potash is packed up, must be made of white oak, or if this cannot be had, of wood which is but little porous. The staves ought to be far more durable than for casks in which other dry goods are packed, the hoops also must be more numerous; for the least fissure would expose the potash to humidity, to the air, and consequently to deliquescence and dissolution. Instances have occurred;\nAmerica, when barrels badly made and hooped, and which had been filled with potash, were soon after found to be half empty.\n\nPearl-ash is well known to be potash purified by calcination. To this end the potash is put into a kiln, constructed in an oval form, of platter of Paris; the inside of which being made otherwise perfectly close, is horizontally intersected by an iron grate, on which the potash is placed. Under this grate a fire is made, and the heat reverberated by the arched upper part of the kiln, completes the calcination, and converts the potash into pearl-ash, which is taken out of the kiln, and, when completely cooled, packed in barrels. The process of calcination lasts about an hour. Pearl-ash is proportionally more heavy than potash, on account of its greater compactness, and the loss of weight experienced by the latter, though the calcination is very trifling. Although pearl-ash is less liable to deliquesce by the air than potash, yet the barrels in which it is packed are of the same fort and structure of those in which the latter salt is barrelled. They are of different sizes, and contain from 200 to 300 pounds. Potash as well as pearl-ash is sold by tons in the course of trade; and it is not lawful to export either before it is duly inspected by the public searchers, who are appointed for this purpose in all the places where pearl or potash is manufactured.\n\nThe manufacture of sugar from the maple tree, Acer saccharinum Linn., called by the Indians oselota, is peculiar to the United States of America. The whole country to the northward of Pennsylvania, abounds with these trees, and also to the southward upon approaching the mountains. In the western territory they everywhere abound. Very considerable quantities of sugar are made from them; so as to afford to the inhabitants an abundant supply of that valuable commodity. The medium produce of a tree standing in the midst of a wood, is three pounds of sugar. The average produce of trees standing on ground which has been cleared of all other woods, is from five to seven pounds per tree. A barrel of the first juice which comes from the maple tree will yield seven pounds of sugar, and four if it stand in the midst of other wood. The ordinary price of this sugar is 1s. per pound. A barrel of the second juice will yield three gallons and a half of treacle. Four or five barrels of the third juice will yield one barrel of a good and pleasant vinegar. The vinegar is found to be better in proportion, as the juice is more concentrated by boiling. Hence some persons brew but one barrel of vinegar from 10 barrels of the third juice. To clarify this vinegar it must be boiled with leaves. The third juice, when not used for vinegar, yields, if mixed with an equal quantity of water, a fermented liquor of an excellent flavour. The longer the first juice is boiled, the better and finer the sugar becomes. In order that the trees may continue productive, they require to be tapped with extraordinary care, that is, the fissures or wounds made in them for extracting the juice, must neither be too deep nor too wide; so that no water may settle in them, and that the wood may close again in the space of a twelvemonth. During the time the juice is flowing out, which lasts about six weeks, and generally begins about the commencement of the month of February, all the days on which it freezes or rains are lost; so that the number of days on which the business can be pursued to advantage, is frequently from these circumstances much diminished. Yet during the above time, two persons can often make from 500 to 600 pounds of good sugar, and this quantity is increased in proportion to the number of workmen employed. As the maple tree, wherever it is encouraged upon a moist soil, multiplies with astonishing rapidity, there is no other limit to the manufacture than the want of people to engage in it, or the limited demand for the commodity in a thinly peopled country. (For other particulars respecting this interesting subject, see Sugar.)\n\nShip-building is an art much practised in the northern states upon the sea coast. The Americans are unacquainted to perform considerable skill in this branch of business, and to perform their work both in a substantial and frugal manner. In building vessels in New England, they make the beams which support the deck from the trunk of the spruce fir; taking care that these, and some other parts which are framed of this timber, have a sufficient thickness of wood, and be sufficiently riveted together. The rest of the vessel is made of oak planks. It is only of late that the spruce fir has been used in building ships in this quarter. The ship-builders affirm, that it is an improvement to the vessels, though in all probability, the scarcity of oak which now begins to be felt on the sea coast of New England, has been the chief cause of the innovation. It is said, however, that the spruce fir resists, better than almost any other kind of wood, the action of the sun and the weather, which in the American climate put all kinds of timber to a severe trial. The planks of the body of their ships, to the water's edge, are often made, not of oak, but of beech wood, or of the wood of the black birch, which is reckoned equally hard and good. The keel is of the wood of the beech, of the sugar maple, or of what is called the rock maple. By using these kinds of wood for so many purposes, there is often not above a fifth part of the ship made of oak. The ship-builders maintain, that the beech, the black birch, and the maple, are very serviceable for the preservation of iron, which the saline particles of the oak are apt to consume. Instead of using tallow for those purposes in shipbuilding, to which it has been usually applied, all the ship-carpenters in America make use of train oil very plentifully laid on. By these devices, they have reduced the expense of shipbuilding to half of what it formerly was, to the great emolument of the persons engaged in it.\n\nThe fisheries are a branch of industry in which the Fisheries Americans engage to a considerable extent. The cod, the whole coast of Massachusetts, and especially of the district of Maine, is inhabited by fishermen engaged in the fishing of cod, upon the great bank of Newfoundland, or in the sea in their own neighbourhood. They bring all the fish on shore, where they receive the last dressing. The fish are washed and laid in heaps, that the water may run off. Thereafter they are exposed for two or three days to the air; after which they are placed on hurdles that are about four or five feet in breadth, three or four feet above the ground, and as long as the field on which they are erected. The fish are laid separately, and frequently turned, that they may get thoroughly dry; which happens under a bright\nbright American fish in about six days. At last they are packed in cases, pressed down, and exported either to the West Indies or to Europe. The best fish, that is, those caught in the first fishing months, are superior to the rest, from being dried more slowly. They are sent to Spain, excepting a few that are usually befocked by the better sort of people in the neighbourhood, and are sold at double the price of those which are caught later in the year, when the heat is more intense. The fish caught on the coasts of Massachusetts and of Maine are neither so large nor so plentiful as those taken at the Great Bank near Newfoundland; yet this fishery employs a considerable number of vessels, which proceed only five or six miles from the coast, and return home every week.\n\nBesides this, and the salmon and herring fisheries, which are considerable, the Americans also engage extensively in the whale fishery, on the coast of Brazil, and in the Pacific ocean in the same latitude, and in the West Indian seas, as far eastward as to the Cape of Good Hope, from the 18th to the 24th degree of latitude. This business is sometimes also prosecuted in Hudson's bay and the seas adjacent to the coasts of Greenland and Labrador, which abound more than the southern seas in whales, and those of a larger size, and such as afford oil of a better quality. But as the vast masses of ice which infest the seas in these northern latitudes render the fishing dangerous, the Americans in general abandon the fishery in the north to the European fishermen. Of late years, the whales have altogether abandoned the coasts of the United States, though they were formerly found in considerable numbers in that quarter. The spermaceti whales are chiefly found in the Indian ocean, on the coasts of Africa and Madagascar, in the Pacific ocean, and on the coasts of Peru and Chili. A voyage to this fishing occupies from ten to eighteen months. The crew receive no wages, but have a certain share of the blubber; the captain has a fifth; the pilot a five-and-fortieth, or a sixtieth, part of what is taken. The owners never make less than 20 per cent. upon the adventure; and the captain, from a successful voyage, in common years, and at ordinary prices, usually receives about eight or nine hundred dollars. A ship of 160 tons has a crew of 15 persons and two boats. At their return, the blubber which has been barrelled at sea is put into fresh barrels, and cleared from its sediment before it is carried to market; for though the sediment be as fit as the rest for use in the soap-works, yet the oil in which it appears is regarded as of inferior quality in the European market. This sediment, and a lot of white flesh which is found in the head and belly of the whale, are then squeezed in a press. A new quantity of oil of the best quality is thus obtained. The residue which remains after the first pressing is put again into the press, and more forcibly squeezed than before. It affords a certain quantity of oil; and it is the produce of this last squeezing which, after undergoing a boiling, is poured into moulds, and forms spermaceti candles: These are sold for half a dollar a pound. Those which are called spermaceti fishes yield this matter in great quantity. In their heads alone there are often five or six tons of this matter; though the other whales have the head differently composed, and do not afford above a quarter of a ton out of each head. Thus all whales yield more or less of this matter, which is so much valued as a material for candles.\n\nThough the Americans have few manufactures, they engage extensively in every kind of trade. In the interior of the country, almost every person who can command the requisite capital is an innkeeper, or keeps a store. The employment of innkeeper is there perfectly respectable, and is carried on by persons of distinguished character. What is called a store in America is a shop or place where all kinds of commodities intended for consumption are to be found and sold by retail. Nothing is excluded from it. Train oil and candles, stationery, wares, hardware, and cloth, together with distilled spirits, sugar, wines, and coffee, are all kept in it in the same manner as in the shops of some of the remote villages in Scotland. In some situations in America, these stores produce considerable profit, and are made subservient to other speculations. When a man engages in the clearing of land, and can at the same time afford to lay in the goods necessary for keeping a store, he is enabled to get back from the workmen whom he employs the greatest part of the wages he has paid them, in the form of profit upon the goods which they purchase at his store. In this way, he contrives to have his work performed at a price which ultimately does not amount to more than a half of what is paid by others for the same labour.\n\nWith regard to foreign trade, the United States have of late years possessed a very great proportion of trade that which has been carried on among civilized nations. The vast extent of sea coast, amounting to nearly 20,000 miles, which spreads before the United States, the number of excellent harbours, the numerous creeks and immense bays which indent the coast, and the rivers and lakes which peninsulate the whole country, to habituate all young persons in America to the idea of a maritime life, and to a fondness for navigation, that great numbers of them are at all times found ready to engage in it. The enterprising spirit of the people favours this tendency; and accordingly, every kind of commercial speculation easily finds men ready to embark in it. For some time after the treaty of peace with Britain, by which their independence was acknowledged in 1783, while each state continued to have its particular laws, prohibitions, and regulations; while the customhouse rates changed every year, according to momentary considerations; and while an active jealousy and rivalry subsisted between the different states, the commerce of the whole remained on a very precarious footing. It was only from the period of the establishment of their new constitution that a consistent system of national commerce could be adopted. It so happened, that this period proved extremely favourable to their engaging extensively in foreign trade. The violent shock, or rather the utter ruin, which the revolution brought along with it to the manufactures and commerce of France, forced her to open the ports of her colonies to the vessels of neutral powers. From that moment, the Americans engrossed all the commerce of the French colonies, which they were so well situated to carry on to advantage. The other powers of Europe, which had also colonies in the West Indies, being all successively engaged in the war, opened the ports of their colonies in like manner to the Americans, or at least considerably diminish-\nAmerica, ed their prohibitive regulations. Thus the commerce of the United States had the victualling of the West India islands, as well as an exclusive trade with the French and Dutch colonies; not only in provisions, but also in commodities of every kind. Their ships were freighted to carry West India produce to Europe, and to bring back in return the articles necessary for the consumption both of the United States and of those same colonies. Add to this, that, in consequence of the great scarcity of provisions that during various years prevailed either in France or in Great Britain, the Americans found in these countries a ready and profitable market for all the productions of their country. By these means, aided by the establishment of banks, and by an inexpensive, though efficient, government, the commerce of the United States soon became extremely extensive. It reached the East Indies, China, and every part of the known world. It is true, that by the rashness of their speculations, many American merchants suffered; but the tide of commercial prosperity was very great upon the whole, and almost unexampled; so that great fortunes have been rapidly acquired in all the maritime towns of the United States.\n\nWhether this commercial prosperity will be permanent, now that the European nations have returned to the enjoyment of peace, and consequently have recovered the power of carrying on their own commerce without danger or interruption, with all the advantages of an abundant population, and of inferior wages of labour, is a question about which many doubts have been entertained. It remains, however, with men of sound reflection in America, a question of some difficulty, whether, in the present state of their affairs, the attempt that has been made to conduct an extensive foreign commerce, is, upon the whole, favourable to the prosperity of their empire. Distant navigations are undoubtedly unfavourable to the progress of population, by the great number of men which they consume, and by preventing the increase of families. This kind of commerce, also, by keeping up a taste for foreign luxuries, induces a people that have no manufactures to lavish away the necessaries of life on the purchase of superfluities, and thus to introduce a costly style of living, which is said already to prevail too much in the United States, and which in every country has been found to be the greatest enemy to the increase of the people.\n\nOne circumstance in the mode of managing the American commerce ought not to pass unnoticed. In Europe, we are accustomed to imagine that a man cannot be qualified to act as captain of a ship till he has made a number of voyages, and passed through a regular course of study; whereas, in New England the merchants do not hesitate to entrust their ships to young persons, who have frequently been only one year at sea. As they have grown up in the business of the counting-house, they are perfectly acquainted with the price, the quality, and the sale of each different commodity. The first year, they are associated with a skilful steersman, and act at once in the capacity of captain and supercargo. Their vessels do not suffer shipwreck more frequently than other ships which are more cautiously navigated. In the course of a few years, these young people become merchants themselves, the captain's profits being always considerable. As they are generally appointed from the families of merchants, they receive assistance from their employers.\n\nThere is one kind of commerce which, in speaking of the trade of the United States, ought not to be omitted, as it is altogether peculiar to North America; that is, the traffic of land. This trade is founded upon the considerable mass of land in the territory of the United States, in comparison with their present population, and upon the probability of the rapid augmentation of that population, either by the natural and ordinary means of reproduction, or by foreign emigrations. This, like all other branches of trade, and more than any other, is a traffic of speculation. At the end of the revolution, the waste lands, which amounted to more than four-fifths of the American empire, were found to belong to different states, which, as sovereigns, now inherited this property from the sovereignty of the crown of Great Britain. The lands granted by the kings of Great Britain have, with some exceptions, remained in the possession of the grantees; but the amount of these was infinitely small in proportion to the mass of the uncultivated land. The small states near the sea having been longer inhabited, possessed but a small portion; and some had none at all; while the great states, whose territory extended far into the interior, such as Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York, were in possession of immense quantities of forest lands. It was necessary for these states to sell the waste lands, to afford encouragement to their growing population, to prevent a bait to foreign emigration, and to liquidate the debts resulting from the war without burdening the people with new taxes, which at that time they were little able to bear. Among the lands to be sold were the confiscated estates of the royalists, who had given assistance to the British during the war. To bring these lands to sale, the states opened land offices, where persons who meant to purchase received warrants to have the lands they pointed out surveyed by the surveyor of the state, possession being delayed till payment of the price, or fulfilment of some part of the conditions of the transfer. Great speculations immediately began, land being purchasable of all the states at a very low price. The states were then inundated with paper money, peculiar to each, and all in a state of depreciation. By buying up this paper at a trifling price throughout the country, and delivering it to the states as the price of territory, many speculators acquired land with a real value of two or three cents, or hundredth part of a dollar per acre, payable in five or eight years, with a discount from the treasury of the state for prompt payment, according to the value at which the land was rated by the law. Other speculators, without adopting such a mode of payment, made purchases merely upon the hope entertained by every American of an immediate increase of population, by emigration and otherwise, which would necessarily soon raise the price of lands. Considerable quantities of land were also bestowed by the states upon the officers and soldiers that had been employed in their armies during the war, as a remuneration for their services. By these grants, and by purchases made by individuals from the land offices of the several states, or from commissioners appointed...\nAmerica pointed to put up large portions to public sale, a great extent of territory in all the states soon came to be held, and continues to this day to be speculated upon, by private persons. The speculators in land who hold great quantities of that commodity, endeavour to turn it to account chiefly in three ways: 1st, By selling the land in large parcels to men of fortune in Europe or America; 2ndly, By selling it in small parcels to families who mean to settle upon it; and, lastly, By preserving it till time and a diminution of the quantity of this sort of merchandise have raised the value of it to a price answerable to their expectation.\n\nThe first of these modes, is that which is most generally desired. To accomplish it, agents have at different times been sent to Europe. Several great sales were by their means effected in England upon advantageous terms, which raised the price of the remaining lands, increased the confidence of the speculators, added to their numbers, and extended their schemes. The opinion of an immense emigration, to which the French revolution and the situation of Europe gave rise, conspired for some time to give confidence to these speculators. The great sales to Europeans were facilitated by the periods of the payments to be made to the states, which were always distant, and by the delays of these payments which could not be obtained without much difficulty. In the states of Pennsylvania and Maryland, every foreigner could buy and possess land as well as a citizen. In some others, although this privilege was not given by law to foreigners in general, yet it was readily permitted by the legislature when applied for. In all the states, a foreigner may hold land in the name of an inhabitant; and the great interest the states had in selling, and in buying foreign capitals into their territory, has always given entire security to this borrowed right of possession. In making bargains of this kind, the conditions are various according to the views of the parties. The periods of payments are generally short; at least a large part of the purchase money is paid down when the bargain is concluded. The conditions imposed by the states in the contracts of sale are binding by law upon the new purchasers; but very often the old purchaser remains responsible, in case of their not being fulfilled by the new one. The new purchasers become speculators themselves, and in order to turn their new property to account, have recourse to the same means that were employed by those of whom they bought it.\n\nLand is sold in small parcels in several ways: either out and out for ready money, a mode of sale which though not unfrequent, is not the most common; or out and out, but to be paid for by instalments; in which case the title deeds are not delivered till after the purchase money is entirely paid; and the seller retains a right of ejecting the new settler from his land, if the conditions of payment be not fulfilled. Sometimes the seller only requires a small part of the price of the land in ready money; and the land remains subject to a perpetual rent, payable in money or in produce, which the purchaser is not always left at liberty to redeem. Sometimes the seller endeavours to let his lands, for a certain number of years, for an annual rent, or under condition of clearing annually a certain number of acres, the whole improvements being to return to himself at the termination of the lease.\n\nBut such bargains are unusual; settlers being unwilling to accept of a temporary right. Almost all the great landed proprietors, therefore, endeavour to get some persons to accept, upon moderate terms, of small lots, and to settle upon their estates; because by clearing some portions of it, they enhance the value of the rest.\n\nThe third mode of deriving advantage from purchasing chases of land, by waiting till time has raised its price, is the resource of great proprietors who have not been able to employ the two others. Some persons, however, with little capital, endeavour to wait upon the price, mere calculation of the rise that will probably take place in a given time. In these calculations, men of a sanguine temper are frequently deceived; and there are many examples of proprietors, who in the following year, would be extremely glad to sell at the price that they had refused the year before. These speculations in land, however, have been the means of making great fortunes in America; but they have also, when engaged in without sufficient capital, occasioned more distresses and greater and more disastrous bankruptcies than any other kind of commercial adventures. The lands in America are also the branch of trade, which has given occasion to the greatest number of law suits, as well on account of the titles as of the boundaries of estates, and of the fulfilment of the conditions of sale. The most certain, as well as the most advantageous means of deriving profit from a great extent of new land in America, is said to be for the purchaser to begin clearing it himself; to attract inhabitants as speedily as possible by giving them, at a low rate, and even for nothing, if necessary, a number of acres sufficient for the maintenance of their families; to erect mills, make bridges and roads, even to build a few houses, and to encourage in every way the efforts of the new settlers. There is no example of these first sacrifices, when made with intelligence and to a suitable extent, having failed rapidly to increase the value of the land reserved by the proprietor, and speedily to enrich him by attracting great numbers of emigrants from other countries. As the subduing of a vast wilderness, and filling it with men of a civilized race and character, is an event of much importance in the history of mankind, we shall here take notice of one of the instances of great success in an undertaking of this kind, that occurred to an European speculator.\n\nThe district called Genesee on the southern shore of Remark Lake Ontario, or rather that part of the district which was not then sold, was in 1791 purchased, in London, from Mr Morris for £s. per acre. He had bought it from Mr Phelps for £d per acre. The contract was concluded on the supposition that this tract of land contained 1,000,000 acres; and a condition was added that the price or sum of £5,000 sterling, which was to be paid immediately, should be returned by Mr Morris, provided that Captain Williamson, the ostensible purchaser, who was to view the lands, should not find them answerable to the description given of them. The purchaser was satisfied with the lands, and on surveying them a surplus was discovered of no less than 120,000 acres. But Mr Morris made no difficulty on transferring them, together with the rest, to Captain Williamson, without the least remuneration, because, as he observed, he had intended to fell the whole with-\nCaptain Williamson is suspected to have been only the agent of a very wealthy British baronet. But in every respect he has acted as proprietor. The district bought by him, bounded on one side by Lake Ontario, and on the other by the river Genesee, extends 80 miles in length by 30 or 40 in breadth. To preserve the continuity of his lands, he made several additional purchases, so that his estate soon amounted to 1,500,000 acres. After surveying the whole, he fixed on spots for building towns, as central points to a system of settlements. These towns were, Bath, on the creek of Conhoctoon, Williamsburg, on the river Genesee, and Great Sodus, on Lake Ontario. He immediately established a mode of communication between Philadelphia and this new tract, by forming roads in a direct line, so as to shorten the journey at least 300 miles. These new roads were made merely by felling the trees to the breadth of an ordinary road, in as straight a line as possible through the forest, and by removing them to one side of the path; their stumps to the height of several feet being still left standing. He also erected seven saw mills, and three corn mills. He built a great number of such houses as the first settlers upon lands usually require; and he began in several places to clear the woodlands. His first labourers were Germans, brought from Hamburg; but they spent their time in idleness and drunkenness, and soon left him. They were replaced by Irishmen, by whose assistance his roads were soon put into what the Americans account good condition in such a situation; that is, he made lanes through the woods in the way already mentioned.\n\nThe result was, that his lands, which at first sold at one dollar per acre, in two years time, sold for 3 dollars. The produce of about 800,000 acres disposed of in this way, not only refunded the purchase money, and the whole amount of the other expenses incurred, but is also understood to have yielded a net profit of £50,000 sterling. To obtain this success, however, Captain Williamson found it necessary to reside in the woods in the midst of his possessions. When he sold small shares of 500 or 1000 acres, he always stipulated that one family should come to settle upon each share within 18 months, under the penalty of a forfeiture of the bargain. When larger portions were sold, he stipulated, that a proportional number of acres should be cleared of wood. His terms of payment were, to discharge half the purchase money in 3 years, and the remainder at the expiration of five years; the payment of interest to commence within 18 months after the bargain. Thus, a purchaser who instantly set about clearing the ground, could easily obtain its produce before the interest became due; and his crops frequently assisted him towards the payment of the first instalment. He also established stores of provisions in different places; but these he never opened for sale unless the settlers could not otherwise supply themselves, that the sale of the produce of their lands might not be injured. He likewise built a school at Bath, and endowed it with some hundred acres of land. He gradually built inns, and even a sessions house and a prison, for the public use. By all these efforts, added to great care in preventing litigation among the settlers; by fixing in a precise manner the boundaries of the several pieces of property sold, these extensive forests were in a few years reduced under the dominion of man, and put into a train of speedily becoming populous and valuable.\n\nFrom what has been already said concerning the state of manufactures in America, and the general situation of the country, it will easily be conceived, that the greater number of the people must be still engaged in agriculture. Indeed, it is understood, that nine-tenths of the inhabitants of the United States follow this employment. Concerning the state of it, when considered as an art, it is difficult to speak with precision, on account of the variety of forms in which it is practised in different districts of that great country. It may justly be said, that the art of agriculture exists in America in all its known degrees and varieties, both of perfection and of imperfection. The ancient state of Massachusetts is as much cultivated as France or England. The houses stand near to each other, in the midst of the fields and farms to which they belong; some of the roads seem to be one continued village; and to support this population much industry is exerted upon the soil. Most of the fences are made of stone. The harvest is always completely secured in houses, and a great part of the ground is always periodically laid down in grass. Numbers of horses employed in country labour are seen in the fields; but they are not remarkable for beauty. The cattle are of a fine breed, and all the pasture grounds are covered with them. But the agriculture of Massachusetts, and of some other parts of the New England states, affords no proper criterion by which to judge of the state of this important art in the greater part of America. The general rule with regard to husbandry in that country is, that it is extremely defective and slovenly. This does not arise so much from the want of skill on the part of the Americans, as from the nature of their situation. In that country, land is plentiful and cheap; but men are few, and labour is consequently dear. An American husbandman, therefore, is more studious to make the most of the labour that he can command, than to raise great crops from a small portion of soil. Having abundance of fertile land to waste, he finds it more profitable to turn over negligently, with as little toil as possible, a large portion of it, than to labour any part of it perfectly. In this way he derives the greatest benefit from his own personal industry, or from the labour of those persons whom it is in his power to engage for hire. This negligent mode of cultivation, however, is laid aside in the neighbourhood of the great towns, where land is valuable and dear; and it prevails in proportion to the remoteness of the situation, and the facility with which land is obtained. In some places, in consequence of the multitude of streams that are to be found in America, the valuable land practice of flooding land is adopted; and the American husbandmen are said to practice this branch of the art of agriculture with considerable ingenuity and industry. Instead of attempting to level their ground, however, they manage to convey considerable streams of water through the valleys to the summits of the eminences, or high grounds, by means of tubes or pipes, formed of the trunks of trees bored or hollowed out. In other respects, however, the practice of American husbandry is undoubtedly very imperfect. Even in those parts of the country in which timber has become dear, the\nthe Americans still continue from habits to use wooden fences. No such thing as a hedge is to be seen in any of the states. The farmers say, that the thorn does not thrive in their climate. This point has not perhaps been well ascertained by experiments; but there can be no doubt, that out of the endless variety of native plants and shrubs, some might easily have been found that are capable of being used as a living fence. All the cultivated fields at the first clearing of the ground are inclosed with fences, which consist of poles of wood once split and laid zig-zag upon another without any stakes. These fences are afterwards exchanged for regular palings of different kinds of wood, which are necessarily attended with all the defects of that mode of attempting to secure either corn or stock; running rapidly into decay, and requiring constant repairs.\n\nThe Americans have an expensive mode of securing their grain. Instead of building it up in stacks, they are at the trouble of bringing it all into houses or barns. They say, that it would not be secure in stacks against the sudden and violent torrents of rain that occur in their climate; an error into which they have undoubtedly been led by building and covering their stacks in an unskillful and improper manner. They do not reap their grain with the sickle, but cut it down with the scythe, which must undoubtedly produce considerable waste. But this is perhaps done from necessity, in consequence of the high price of labour, or rather the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of labourers to perform this work in another manner. Instead of thrashing, they use in many places, and particularly in Virginia, the ancient custom of treading out the corn by means of cattle, by whose feet it must, no doubt, be considerably bruised and damaged.\n\nThe simplest and least artful kind of American husbandry is that practised in the formation of new settlements. When a family have come to a resolution to settle in a particular district, they usually proceed in the following manner: The husband in the latter end of summer repairs to the spot where the settlement is to be made. The first thing he does is to cut down the small trees on one or two acres. He next fells the larger trees. This last operation consists of cutting off a circle of bark from the tree all round with a hatchet, penetrating at the same time a short way into the wood; the effect of which operation is, that on the following year, the tree produces few or no leaves to prevent the sun from reaching the soil. In that climate, trees thus barked or girdled speedily decay, and in a few years are overturned by any storm; after which they can be burnt with little trouble on the ground. Among the trees thus barked, and upon the ground that has been cleared, the new settler breaks up the soil, by dragging along it a common harrow with iron teeth. Without further preparation, and without the use of a plough, he sows wheat or rye. Wheat thus sown produces from 20 to 25 bushels an acre, of an excellent quality; and, in consequence of the great fertility of the soil, and its natural soilness, being wholly formed of rotten leaves and grass, good crops of wheat are obtained with no greater degree of industry during several years in succession. Having sown his grain in this way, the settler, with the wood which he has felled, constructs a small log-house, and makes suitable fences around it; a labour which may be performed in about a month's time; after which, the new plantation is left to itself for the winter. It is to be observed that a log-house is built by laying trees upon each other at right-angles in such a way as to enclose a square space; the interstices being filled up with stone and clay, or only with loam, and the roof covered with trees and turf. A chimney is usually built, in one corner, of stones and clay. In the beginning of spring, this adventurer brings his family and the best of his cattle to his new settlement. His cows are turned into the woods to graze. He plants potatoes, and sows Indian corn, and thus is enabled to provide for the first year's maintenance. While thus employed, he is at the same time clearing more ground, burning the trees he has already felled, and, as far as may be, even those which he has barked. The ashes afford a very useful manure; and in the opinion of the best judges, are employed in this way to much greater advantage than when converted into potash, the making of which is with the new settlers merely the result of necessity. For if a saw-mill be at hand, the large trees are conveyed thither by oxen. Thus, within the space of twelve months, a man may clear 15 acres; and few families cultivate more than 30. The barked trees are left standing for a longer or shorter time, according to circumstances, viz. the species of the tree, the nature of the soil, and the degree of the wetness of the season. The hemlock fir will stand eight or nine years, the oak four or five, the maple three or four; and trees, all the branches of which have been burnt off, seldom fall before this time. The stumps of the felled trees, generally two or three feet high above the ground, hardly rot sooner than the barked trees which have been left standing on the lands. Salt pork and beef are the usual food of the new settlers. Their drink is water and whisky; but there are few families unprovided with coffee and chocolate. The axe which the Americans use in felling trees has a shorter handle and a smaller head than that of European wood-cutters; and they assert, that they can do more work with this short-handled light axe than with the European.\n\nThe Americans appear to entertain fewer local attachments than the peasants of Europe; and accordingly, emigration with them is extremely common. Some families make a business of forming new settlements in the way now mentioned. After building a house, forming enclosures, cutting down a part of the wood, and putting everything into a decent train of cultivation, they fell the settlement which they have formed with so much labour, and proceed farther into the woods, to commence anew the same career of hardship and of industry. By these operations, they never fail to earn a very considerable profit, on account of the additional value which the land acquires by their efforts in the eyes of persons of greater property. The same kind of undertakings, however, are also engaged in by men of a vagrant and restless character, who delight in an idle life, the greatest part of which is spent in hunting. These men keep upon the frontiers of every new colony, and as soon as their amusements begin to be restrained by settlers occupying the country round them, they immediately fell their plantations, and proceed to more remote situations; thus becoming a kind of voluntary outcasts.\nIn America, from civilized society. In these undertakings, there is usually little personal hazard, as the wild animals are less fierce in America than in other parts of the globe. Wolves, bears, nay even panthers, usually fly before man; and the instances of their doing mischief are so rare, that the very reality of it might be doubted. The severest misfortune to which the inhabitants of the American forests are liable is the loss of their children in the woods. These unfortunate infants, over whom it is almost impossible to keep constantly a watchful eye, are apt to run out of the house, which is seldom fenced the first year, and, straying from their houses, are unable to find them again. In such cases, however, all the neighbors join in the search, and sometimes the children are found. But there are also instances of their being totally lost, or discovered only when dead of hunger or fear.\n\nBoth horses and oxen are used in agriculture in America. In some places, however, they have at times found it necessary to confine themselves exclusively to the use of the latter, because they are subject to no disease in that country. Whereas in Pennsylvania, New York, and elsewhere, almost the whole horses are sometimes carried off by a weakness which destroys them in the course of two months. The liver is blown up by a swelling, which extends into the legs and the whole mass of blood, and is called the yellow water. It is said, that in the state of Virginia the Arabian horse, with a very moderate degree of attention, thrives as in his native climate, and without degenerating. Southwardly, the heat of the sun occasions a deficiency of pasture; and northwardly the winters are too cold for the short and fine hair, and the particular sensibility of constitution of that race. Their patience of heat fits them, in that and the southern climates, even for the drudgeries of the plough; and numbers of them are exported from thence to the West India islands, as articles of luxury to the wealthy planters there.\n\nVery few sheep are reared by the American farmers. The wool is of a good enough quality; but there is little or no demand for it, unless for the supply of some manufacturers of hats. The mutton is in general not good; the carcasses being very large, and the flesh coarse from being fed on the high rank grass of the American pastures. Accordingly few farmers keep more than 18 or 20 to supply wool to be manufactured in their own families. Great numbers of swine are kept by the Americans. This is said to have been become a very favorite kind of stock among the earliest settlers in the country; from the delight which they found the swine took in hunting out and devouring all kinds of serpents, with which the country abounded, and which were objects of great terror to persons newly arrived from the cultivated countries of Europe, in which these reptiles are more rare.\n\nThe kinds of grain cultivated in America are nearly the same with those reared in Europe, with some additions. A regular succession of crops is described by an American writer, as used in recruiting worn-out lands. In Maryland and Virginia, they have long been in the practice of sowing a pint of the beans of the *cajia charnecytha* with every bushel of oats on poor lands. The oats ripen, and are cut in July, when the beans are young, and escape the injury of the scythe. They flower in August and September. In October the leaves fall off; the seeds ripen, and the pod opens with such elasticity as to scatter the beans to some distance around. The year following the field is cultivated with Indian corn, which is sown in drills. The beans which sprout early are all destroyed by the plough and the hoe; but the more numerous part not making their appearance above ground, till the culture of the corn is ended, spring up unhurt by the instruments of agriculture, and furnish feed for the ensuing year, when the field is again sown with oats. By this alternate cultivation of Indian corn and oats with beans, the land is so far improved by the rotting of leaves and stalks of the beans, that the product is 15 bushels to the acre, on such as prior to this management would not have produced more than five. The American husbandmen are also of opinion, that the common field pea is preferable to everything else for improving lands, if the vines or straw be left to rot on the ground, instead of being given to cattle for fodder.\n\nIndian corn or maize everywhere forms a considerable article of the produce of American husbandry. The mode of rearing it is simple. Holes are made in the field, four feet asunder every way, and so as to form straight lines, for the convenience of hoeing, or ploughing. In every hole are put five or six grains previously steeped in water, to make them spring up the quicker. By day people are placed for a short time, to guard them against birds, and by night, fires are kept up till the corn has sprung, to frighten away the fox, who would otherwise turn up the ground, and eat the corn of all the rows one after another. As soon as the corn has shot out of the earth, when it mounts up, the earth is drawn towards its root, to strengthen it against the wind. Five or six ears are commonly found on each stalk. The grains are nearly of the size of a pea, and 700 grains are commonly found upon one ear. A light black soil agrees better with it than a strong and rich one. The grain is used in various ways, but chiefly in the form of a kind of porridge or gruel. Bread is also made from it, and it is sometimes used in distillation.\n\nAs in Europe, wheat is regarded as the most valuable kind of grain. In Virginia, however, near the sea coast, the cultivation of it is not a little discouraged by an insect called the *weevil*. This is a worm whose eggs are almost constantly deposited in the ear of the grain. A slight degree of heat greater than that of the common atmosphere in summer kills it, and is endeavored to be obtained in the following way: The grain is threshed as soon as it is cut, and laid up in its chaff in large heaps. The heat which is speedily produced destroys the vital principle of the eggs, and protects the corn from the inconveniences of its being hatched, while at the same time the chaff sufficiently refrains the heat from rising into putrefaction. If the grain continued in the ears without being speedily threshed, it would be destroyed by the worm which would be excluded from the eggs. This scourge, however, spreads no farther northwards than the Po townmack, and is bounded to the west by the ridge called the Blue Mountains. A few weeks after the wheat has been beaten or trodden out by horses, it is free from all danger, is winnowed, and sent to market.\n\nTobacco continues to be cultivated to a considerable extent.\nIt is yearly, however, giving place to wheat, which is of infinitely more value to the country, as having a less tendency to impoverish the soil, and contributing in a more direct manner to the encouragement of population. The culture of tobacco, on account of the constant attention and labour which it requires under a burning sun, is chiefly performed by negroes. It is difficult, troublesome, and uncertain. It is sown in the month of March, in a fat and rather moist soil. Before the time of sowing, the land is covered with small branches of trees, which are burnt for the purpose of destroying the herbs and roots that might injure the growth of the plant, and also in order to increase the fertility of the soil by their ashes. The tobacco is thickly sown on a bed in the most sheltered corner of the field. This bed is covered with branches, lest the frost should hinder the unfolding of the seed, and prevent the sprouting of the plants. When they are three or four inches high, they are transplanted into a field, which has been well manured and prepared for their reception. A negro heaps earth around the plants, which are set four feet distant from each other on all sides. The ground is constantly kept clear of weeds, and all the leaves are taken from the plant, which it is thought might injure its perfect growth, beginning always with those that are next the ground, and which might be affected by the wet. More earth is heaped around the stalk, and its head bruised with the nail to prevent its running up too high. All the shoots which thrust forth below the leaves are cut away, and all the leaves successively torn off, except eight or nine, which alone are left on the stalk. At last, when the plant is supposed to be ripe, which happens in the month of August, it is cut, left several days in the field to dry in the sun, and then carried into the barns, where every plant is suspended by its undermost part. In this position the leaves attain by defecation the last degree of maturity, but not all of them at the same time; for this defecation, which, in regard to some, is completed within two days, takes, with respect to others, several weeks. When the leaves are perfectly dry, they are taken from the stalk, and laid one upon another in small parcels. The most perfect leaves must be put together, and those of an inferior quality separated into different classes: this is at least the method followed by such planters as pay most attention to the fabrication of their tobacco. These small parcels of leaves, tied together by their tails, are then brought under the press, and afterwards pressed down into hogheads. This process varies more or less in the different plantations, but the variations are not by any means considerable. The feed for the next year is obtained from 40 or 50 stalks per acre, which are suffered to run up as high as they will grow without their heads being bruised.\n\nThe sorts of tobacco cultivated in Virginia, are the sweet-scented, the most esteemed of all; the big and little, which follow next; then the Fredericks; and, lastly, the one-and-all, the largest of all, and which yields most in point of quantity. A negro can cultivate two acres and a half; and, as each acre yields, upon an average, 1000 pounds of tobacco, each negro can consequently produce 2500 pounds. But the culture of this plant is, as already has been stated, extremely troublesome. It is exposed to a great variety of accidents, which cannot always be avoided, and which destroy many stalks, or spoil at least many leaves. After the plant has been transplanted, the root is frequently attacked by a small worm, which causes the leaf to turn yellow, and which must be taken out of the ground with the fingers, to save the plant. Humidity communicates the rot to the plant, that is, covers it with red spots, which cause it to moulder away, and the stalk is lost. Violent winds are apt to break the stalk. When the leaves are at the point of attaining their maturity, horn-worms settle in them, attack them, and completely destroy the plant, unless they can be torn off. Lastly, when the tobacco is cut and spread on the ground to dry, the wet impairs its quality.\n\nIndigo and cotton are also cultivated in some of the Indigo and southern states. Cotton in particular is exported from cotton. Charlestown in considerable quantities; and of late it has been brought down the river Mississippi, from Kentucky and other settlements to New Orleans, in such abundance as to form an important article of commerce. In South Carolina, rice is cultivated to a great extent. Rice. That country is divided by nature into Upper and Lower. The latter, which is the eastern part, adjoining to the Atlantic ocean, extends inward almost 100 miles. The land in this low district consists of marshes and swamps, intermixed with a little high land. The marshes are a second-rate land, which produces a coarse kind of grass in very great abundance. Little attention is paid to them, though they could in general be drained and cultivated. The high land is also neglected for the sake of the swamps, which are the most valuable kind of soil, consisting of a rich blue clay, or fine black earth, to the greatest depth. The rice which is cultivated upon them is sown in April and May. The ground is turned up eight or nine inches deep in furrows, into which the rice is thrown by a woman; and the negroes, who alone are employed in this cultivation, fill up the furrows. The seed shoots up in 10 or 12 days, according as the ground is more or less wet. When the blade is from five to seven inches high, and after the negroes have cleared away the weeds, the water is made to flow over the field, so that no more than the tops of the blades can be seen. In three or four weeks the water is let off, and the negroes take away the remaining weeds. The field is covered again with water, which is drawn off when the yellow colour of the ear and the hardness of the stalk denote the ripeness of the rice. It is then cut and kept in stacks till winter. It is afterwards thrashed, and put into a small wooden house, which is some feet high, and rests upon four pillars; and in the ceiling of which is fastened a large sieve, which separates it from the other parts, and the wind clears it perfectly before it falls to the ground. The rice, after being thus cleared, must be freed from the first shell that surrounds it. For this purpose, it is carried to a mill, the grinders of which are made of fir, and are about four inches thick, and two and a half in diameter. One is moveable, the other fixed. They are both scooped out in an oblique but concentric form. Against the edges thus formed, the rice is pressed; and by that means separated from the hulls. These mills are turned by a negro. On account of the rapid motion\ntion and the soft wood of which they are made, they do not last longer than one year. The rice is winnowed as soon as it comes from the mill, but still it has a second shell which must be taken off, and this is done by the negroes pounding it with clubs. These clubs, however, are sometimes put in motion by machinery turned by oxen. After the rice is pounded, it is winnowed again to cleanse it from the second shell; and it is put into another sieve for the purpose of separating the small from the larger grains. The last only are saleable. Whether the separation is carefully made or not, must depend on the honesty of the planter; and during the late dearth of provisions in Europe, when the rice bore a high price, it is said that they were not very scrupulous in this respect. The rice destined for sale is packed up in barrels, offered for the inspection of the officer appointed for that purpose, and then exported. During its growth, the rice is exposed to several dangers, which render the crop uncertain. Before the blade grows up, it is attacked by small worms, which gnaw the root. It is also frequently injured by little fishes that live in the water which covers the swamps. Against them the rice is only defended by the heron (ardea alba minor) which feeds on these little fishes and worms; and on this account is spared by the planters, as the turkey-buzzard is by the town's people. When the rice is ripe, it is assailed by innumerable quantities of small birds, which are known in Carolina by the name of rice birds. The young negroes are continually kept beside the fields to frighten them away; but these voracious birds cannot be entirely kept off. The rice swamps yield between 50 and 80 bushels of rice an acre, according to the quality of the soil. Sometimes 120 bushels have been produced from an acre; but instances of this kind have been rare. Twenty bushels of rice, with the shells, weigh about 500 pounds. Without the shells, these 20 make but eight bushels; without, however, losing much in weight. The straw is given to oxen and horses.\n\nIt will easily be believed, that the cultivation of rice has a tendency to render a hot climate, in which alone it can be practised, extremely unhealthy. The inhabitants accordingly, in the warm and damp climate of South Carolina, suffer severely every autumn from malignant bilious fevers, which cut them off in great numbers. When originally introduced, this consequence was not foreseen; but it now maintains its ground, from the difficulty of altering an established system of industry. It will probably, however, be supprest in the course of time, as white men will not engage in the operative part of the cultivation; and the unskilful labour of negroes is always expensive, which prevents the cultivation of it from being attended with any great degree of profit. The American rivers also being subject to violent inundations, which they call freshets, often sweep away the whole harvest, together with the woods and fences which surround the rice fields.\n\nThe lands that have been brought under cultivation in America do by no means extend in a regular progress at equal distances from the sea coast or from the older settlements. In consequence of the superior goodness of the soil, of the unpolished labourity of particular parts of the country, or of speculations by purchasers of land, who have held out unusual encouragements to new settlers; very remote districts are in many places inhabited, while others at a less distance from the seat of the original colonies, still remain in a state of nature. In general, however, the progress of emigration necessarily must be towards the west, and from choice, it usually is from the north to the south. The shortness of the winter in the southern territories of the union, affords a great temptation to this course of things, on account of the heavy tax which is imposed upon human industry, by the necessity of storing up great quantities of fuel for man, and food for cattle, in the more northern regions. In general, the great tract of the Alleghany mountains is left unsettled, and emigrants from the eastern parts of the union usually proceed altogether beyond them before they think of settling. It has been computed that, in some years lately, no less than 30,000 persons have crossed these mountains in search of new habitations. The state of Kentucky, adjoining to the Ohio, has been the chief point towards which these emigrants have directed their course. They usually proceed by land, across the mountains, to Fort Pitt, which is 320 miles from Philadelphia. Families are conveyed thither in waggons, by persons who engage in this employment, and take whole families of men, women, and children, and their goods, at so much per cwt. Near Fort Pitt, where many of the emigrants remain, boats are obtained at a trifling price, in which travellers commit themselves to the stream of the Ohio, which conveys them downwards to these remote regions. Other emigrants travel towards the same place by land, through the high country of Virginia, some of whom advance into the new state of Tennessee, that has been formed in the back parts of Carolina. Of the immense territory beyond the Ohio, very little is yet occupied, though the superior mildness of the climate and the fertility of the soil begin to draw emigrants thither from the eastern states.\n\nOf the principal cities and towns of the American union, we shall take notice in separate articles. In the meantime, it may be observed, that the kinds of houses used in America are no less various than the situations of men in that country, from remote and solitary families in the woods, to wealthy citizens who inhabit elegant dwellings in the streets and squares of populous towns. In general, however, houses of all kinds throughout the country of America are formed of timber. We have mentioned the log-houses which the first settlers erected. These are substantial habitations, though usually very clumsy. They are generally replaced by handsome houses, finished by carpenters, with chimneys and ovens formed of brick. The towns in the southern states, being built in this way, have repeatedly suffered great calamities by fire. The fear of this evil, together with the increasing price of timber, has introduced in the northern states very extensively the use of brick for building. Accordingly the city of Philadelphia, containing nearly 80,000 inhabitants, and which is said to be one of the most regular and beautiful in the world, has now a very great proportion of its houses built with brick. They are still, however, not a little exposed to accidental fires, as their roofs are formed of shingles or boards, so placed as that the lower edge of each overlaps the upper part of the board immediately below it, in the way that flutes or tiles are\nAmerica are laid upon each other to cover the roofs of houses in Europe. These roofs, and also the whole outside of the wooden houses, are usually very neatly painted.\n\nOne convenience that attends the use of wooden houses is, that, as they are not lofty, and their structure is very slight, if a man who has only a small house dislikes the place of the town in which he lives, he can remove his dwelling to a more agreeable neighborhood. The furniture is taken out, the brick chimneys are taken down, and the house is mounted upon very low but very strong carriages, formed for the purpose, and is wheeled away to its new situation in any other street, where ground for the purpose has been procured. When the chimneys are erected, the transference is complete.\n\nIn the United States, religion does not form, as elsewhere, a part of the political establishment of the country, but is rather to be regarded as connected with the state of manners, science, and character of the people. In consequence of the entire freedom of religious opinion and worship which has for many years been enjoyed in America, all the varieties of sects have established themselves there, though nobody has departed from the public profession of Christianity. In general, however, religion is considered as an object of more importance in the northern than in the southern states. Accordingly, the emigrants from the New England colonies, who are the most numerous of all, never fail very speedily to establish religious meetings or churches in their new settlements. Throughout the states, the prevailing forms of religious worship are those of the Church of England, and of the Presbyterians. The Independents are also numerous. In Pennsylvania, the greatest variety of religious denominations prevail; but the Quakers are the most numerous. They were the first settlers in that state in 1682, under William Penn; and maintain in that country the reputation which they have acquired in England of sobriety, industry, humanity, punctuality in their dealings, and strictness in the observance of all the peculiarities of dress, speech, and manners, that their religious opinions enjoin.\n\nThe Moravians (see Unitas Fratrum), have made several establishments in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. That at Bethlehem, 53 miles north of Philadelphia, is the oldest and the most considerable. In 1742, Count Zinzendorf purchased the district, and soon brought to it 1,400 Moravian brethren and sisters from Germany. They held everything in common: but such was their zeal, that the men soon cleared the woods, made roads, and reduced the lands into cultivation, while the women prepared their clothes and victuals. The system of common property was afterwards done away, excepting as to certain objects, such as corn mills, a tannery, a tavern and buildings, which belong to the whole community. The town of Bethlehem is inhabited by 500 or 600 persons, all of the brother or sisterhood. They are divided into five departments, each under the direction of an inspector or inspectors; and the temporal administration of the society is in some degree mixed with its discipline. The unmarried brethren live together in a separate house; that is, they eat and sleep there, but they do not work there if they can work elsewhere. The money they earn is their own, but they must pay for their board and their proportion of the public taxes. The inspectors supply them with work if they cannot find it elsewhere. Thus these brethren cost nothing to the society at large. The same is the case with regard to the unmarried sisters, some of whom are employed as servants and cookmaids in the houses of the town, where they receive board and lodgings. They pay a certain sum to the society, which preserves their right of entering to the unmarried sisters' house when they please. In this house most of the sisters are employed in sewing and embroidery, and are paid for their work by the inspectors, who sells it for the benefit of the house. The widows' house is supported by the brethren, and the widows themselves contribute their whole labour, which is not sufficient for its support. They have a school or academy which enjoys some reputation. The married people live in their own houses. No communication is allowed between the young men and the young women. When a young man wishes to marry, he mentions to the inspector the girl of whom he has made choice, but to whom he has never spoken. The inspector applies to the inspectors of the girls, and if the judge the young woman's character not incompatible with that given of the young man by the inspector, the girl is applied to, who may refuse, but is not allowed to say whom she would prefer. If an unmarried brother and sister are detected in a correspondence without marriage, the matter is kept secret by the rulers of the society, but the parties are never allowed to marry each other. They are all of German extraction, and speak that language; but their numbers are not increasing, notwithstanding the fecundity of the American women, of which the Moravian married sisters have their share. They have other settlements in the same state, particularly one at Nazareth, 10 miles north from Bethlehem, and another at Lititz, in Lancaster county. They are also settled in New Jersey and North Carolina. There is a general directory of the whole society for America, which corresponds with the general college of the society in Europe, that meets at Herrnuth in Upper Lusatia.\n\nAt Lebanon, in the state of New York, a religious society is established, of a singular nature, called the Shakers. This society is a republic governed in a despotic manner. All the members work for the benefit of the society, which supplies them with clothes and victuals, under the direction of the chief elder, whom they elect, and whose power is unlimited. Subordinate to him are inspectors of all classes, invested with different degrees of authority. The accounts reach him in a certain regular gradation, and his commands are conveyed in the same manner. It would be an unpardonable breach of order to address the chief elder himself, unless the addressee belongs to a class which enjoys this privilege. Marriage is prohibited in this society, which has been recruited merely by professedly for 80 years. Married men and women are admitted into the society, on condition that they renounce each other; and they frequently bring their children with them, who in this case are considered as belonging to the society. They make cloth, gauze, shoes, saddles, nails, cabinet work, and in short every article that finds a ready market. They sell their commodities in the neighboring towns, and the women perform such duties as is generally allotted to their sex. The society possesses considerable property.\nproperty, the amount of which, however, is known to none but the chief elder. They are an honest, good-natured people, are faithful workmen, and very moderate in their prices. Of any peculiar doctrines entertained by them little is known, excepting, that the sect was founded by a woman, called Anna Lee, whom they styled the Elect Lady. They assert, that she was the woman spoken of in the 12th chapter of the Revelations, that she spoke 72 tongues, and could converse with the dead. Their worship consists of little more than a set of whimsical gesticulations performed upon a signal given by the chief elder, along with the chanting of some hymns known only to themselves. This society has nothing in common with the Quakers.\n\nAt Ephrata, 60 miles westward of Philadelphia, is the settlement of what are called the Tunkers or Dunkers, (see Tunkers, or Dumplers.) They are a kind of Baptists, but profess a strange medley of tenets. They were instituted in this place by one Conrad Peyzel, a German. He collected them into a society, and conducted them to Pittsburg, which at that time was a wild uninhabited place. The chief of the community who succeeded Peyzel, having made some alterations in their discipline, dissensions took place; they dispersed, but afterwards united again in the same place where they were first established. A community of property is observed among them, and they make a vow of poverty and chastity. This vow is not always kept; as some of them quit the society and marry, which it cannot prevent their doing, as the law regards such vows as not obligatory. They lament the fall of our first parent, who would rather have for his wife, a carnal being, Eve, than let the celestial Sophia, a being thoroughly divine, bear a child. She would have communicated only with the spiritual nature of Adam, and thus a race would have been engendered all pure and without the least corporeal ingredient. They lament the indulgence which God showed in regard to this desire of Adam; however, God, according to their doctrine, has merely deferred the period of this state of perfection. It is certainly to arrive, and the Tunkers foresee the time, when, after the general resurrection, the divine Sophia will descend into every one of us.\n\nThree distinct races of men continue to inhabit the territory of the United States. These are the Indians; the Negroes, who were introduced as slaves from the coast of Africa; and the Whites, of European extraction. The Indians, who were the original inhabitants of the country, have now been expelled from a very large portion of it, and their numbers are rapidly declining. \"It is a melancholy reflection,\" says the American secretary at war, in a memorial addressed to the president in 1794, \"that our modes of population have been more destructive to the Indian natives than the conduct of the conquerors of Mexico and Peru. The evidence of this is the utter extirpation of nearly all the Indians in the most populous parts of the union. A future historian may mark the causes of this destruction of the human race in sable colours.\" The government of the United States has made some humane attempts to regulate the intercourse of their people with the unfortunate original inhabitants of the country. In 1796, a law was passed, with this view, which contains many salutary provisions. It ordains, that the boundaries of the Indian territory shall be ascertained and marked as clearly as possible. All persons are prohibited to hunt upon the territory acknowledged by treaty to belong to the Indians, or to carry off cattle from it, on pain of a fine of 100 dollars, and six months imprisonment. None are allowed to enter the Indian territory without a passport. Any fraud, robbery, or other crime, committed against an Indian, is to be punished by a fine and restitution, and the United States bind themselves to see the restitution made, providing the Indian do not himself take vengeance for the injury; in which case he loses his claim. To kill an Indian of any tribe, in amity with the United States, is declared a capital crime. None are allowed to trade with the Indians without a license, and those to whom this privilege is granted are prohibited to purchase any implements of hunting, agriculture, or household economy; and the troops of the United States are authorized to apprehend white men, who transgress against these laws, even upon the Indian territory; and they may also be apprehended in any part of the United States where they are found. An Indian guilty of any crime may be apprehended within the territory of the United States. If he escape, the person injured by him may state his complaint to the agent of the United States on the frontier of the Indian territory, who is to demand reparation from the tribe to which the offending Indian belongs, and to acquaint the president with the result of his demand. If reparation be not made, the injured party is indemnified from the treasury of the United States, and the sum thus applied is deducted from the subsidies granted by the United States to that tribe. The courts of the United States, and also, when the cause is not capital, the courts of the individual states, take cognizance of offenses against this law, even when they have been committed within the territories belonging to the Indians.\n\nAnother law enacted in the same year 1796, with a view to secure to the Indians fair treatment in their commercial dealings with the white people, establishes a trade with them to be carried on under the authority of the president. One hundred and fifty thousand dollars are appropriated to this trade, of which the objects are, to furnish the Indians with such supplies and implements as their wants require, and to purchase from them skins and furs. The law directs, that the prices of the articles sold to the Indians be so regulated as barely to prevent the United States from losing any part of their capital. It restrains the agents employed in their trade from trafficking directly or indirectly on their own account. It forbids them to cheat the Indians, and subjects them to fines of different magnitudes, in proportion to the nature of the offenses by which they transgress these regulations. The district courts of the state, where the storehouses are established for the commerce with the Indians, take cognizance of these offenses.\n\nIt is understood, that the just and liberal provisions of these laws, have never been punctually reduced to practice. The extremity of the United States, bordering on the territory of the Indians, is inhabited by a few men who are in constant hostility with them. This class of inhabitants is universally admitted to hostile to the very worst men in all America. The Indian kind\nkind of persons who in Europe became robbers, thieves, poachers, and smugglers; in short, the restless spirits, of whom some exist in every community, who can never be confined to regular habits of industry, emigrate in America to the frontiers, and become voluntary exiles from society and civilization. They live, like the savages, by hunting and fishing, or by other trifling exertions of industry, but more frequently, when they find it practicable, they engage in plundering the neighbouring Indians. Accordingly, where these are concerned, the sentiments and even the idea of honesty and humanity are unknown to those remote settlers. With very slight shades of discrimination between them, they are uniformly a plundering and ferocious banditti, who consider an Indian as a being not belonging to the human species, and whom they may justly plunder or destroy. Hence it most commonly happens, in those quarters, that neither accusers, witnesses, nor juries, can be found to convict a white man guilty of a trespass or crime against an Indian. The oppressions, the usurpations, and the crimes committed by the whites against the Indians are therefore never punished, or at least the instances of punishment are so rare, that it would be difficult to find an example of its having occurred.\n\nThe Indian, on the other hand, harassed and plundered by a set of men, the meanest of whom possesses more art and more powerful means of doing mischief than himself, contracts the habit of robbery and pilferage, of which he sees the example, and is the constant victim. As he extends, according to the practice of savages, his vengeance to every individual of the same colour with the person who has injured him, the whites, even of the best character, are compelled, as a measure of safety, to hold themselves in a state of hostility against the Indians, and thus acquire a spirit of enmity towards them. This hostility uniformly ends to the disadvantage of the original inhabitants of this great country, not only because they are less skilful in war, but because the losses of men which they sustain are not rapidly repaired by reproduction, as happens to a civilized people, who know how to rear upon a fertile soil all the means of subsistence in abundance. It is not a little remarkable, that the Indians say, it is the worst class of their whole tribes that habitually continue near the frontiers, engaged in a constant state of fraud and violence.\n\nThe government of the United States does not profess upon its remote frontier sufficient strength to repel the irregularities now mentioned. The governments of the individual states do not attend to them. Every person admits, that the evil arises principally and originally from the lawless aggressions of the whites; but as the evil is become habitual, and so inveterate that it is not easy to discover a remedy, it is usually spoken of by the white Americans without horror. In the meantime, the Indians as a people are the only sufferers by it. They are the weaker party. Every contest ends in their discomfiture, and every transaction tends to their disadvantage; whereas the wandering and restless class of white men that constantly keep upon the frontier of the settled country are of essential service to their country. They act as a kind of pioneers in preparing the way for the establishment of persons of better character, who gradually succeed them.\n\nIt is an established opinion in America, among the most exempt from prejudices, that the Indians never can be civilized; that the strictest education, the most affiduous and persevering cares, cannot destroy their savage habits, to which they recur with the most ardent passion, from the tranquillity and from the manners of the white people; and an infinite number of examples are cited, of Indians brought up at Philadelphia and New York, and even in Europe, who never ceased to fish after their tribe. The opinion that has been reared upon these facts has, no doubt, had a considerable effect in diminishing the exertions of benevolent persons towards their civilization. It has been justly remarked, however, that we have no reason to be surprized by the conduct of those educated Indians who returned their original habits. \"The Indians,\" says the duke de la Rochefoucault Liancourt, \"whose education has been attempted, or said to be, had already passed some years of their life in the tribe to which they belonged. Transported alone from their species into the midst of white people, different in language, habits, and in colour, and often even in clothing, they became as it were insulated; they were regarded by the whites as a different species of men; they did not attempt even to make them forget that they were from a nation still existing, whose manners and habits had riveted their first attention, and made the deepest impression upon them. If, when arrived at the age of manhood, they should have imbibed for a white woman that affection which naturally created the desire of an union with her, the difference of colour became almost an insurmountable obstacle. Is it to be wondered, then, that these Indians should wish to return to their tribe, of which they had filled the most lively memory, and where alone they were able to find companions of similar manners to their own, and those pleasures which cause in man an attachment to life?\"\n\nThere are, however, in Connecticut, and in the state of New York, a considerable number of Indians, both men and women, who serve as domestics in white American families, and who perform their duty as well and as faithfully as those of any other race. One tribe only of Indians, the Onondagas, in the back parts of the state of New York, on the shore of Lake Ontario, appears to have acquired what can be said to resemble civilization. They cultivate the ground with success, and have a considerable number of villages. They are mild and peaceful, and kindly officious in performing little services to the whites. On the whole, they are accounted excellent neighbours.\n\nIn the meantime it is evident, from the ordinary progress of things, that, unless the other tribes of Indians shall resolve, which seems extremely unlikely, to submit by agriculture, they must speedily yield to the encroachments of American population and industry. In the territory of the United States, beyond the Ohio, which, with some trifling exceptions, is still occupied by the Indians, it is believed there exists a population of about 50,000 souls. Between the head of the Ohio at Fort Pitt and the northern lakes, a few thousands more are to be found. In the states of Carolina and Georgia, and Florida, belonging to Spain, about ten or twelve thousand are still to be found; so that, in the territory of the United States there is probably, in all, between sixty and seventy thousand Indians. The territories\nAmerica. Territories occupied by the Indians are acknowledged to be their own, and that they cannot be taken away by force. But this affords no protection to these people. A little whisky will bribe their chieftains to give their consent to the largest transfers. It is perfectly common for great tracts of the finest territory in the world to be bartered away, with the consent of all parties, for a few rings, a few handkerchiefs, some barrels of rum, and perhaps some money, which the unfortunate natives know not how to convert to any valuable use. The European nations and their descendants have long been accustomed to regard all the world as their property, and the rest of mankind as a kind of intruders, or an inferior race, whom they have a right to dispel when it suits their convenience. We are apt to treat as absurd the right which the pope, as high priest of the European states, once claimed, to give away at his pleasure whole empires, and immense tracts of unknown territory which never belonged to him; but the conduct of the parties to the treaty of Paris in 1783 was probably neither less unjust nor less absurd, when the king of Great Britain gave up, and the American states were undertook to acquire, a right of undivided sovereignty over an immense territory inhabited by independent nations. The states of America, accordingly, consider themselves as possessing the supreme right to the property of the territory belonging to the Indians; and though they do not feign that territory by force, or transfer it by sale, they readily do what is nearly equivalent; they sell to private persons the right to purchase certain portions of it from the Indians. Thus the state of Massachusetts sold to Messrs Phelps and Gorham the exclusive privilege of purchasing from the Indians a large territory upon the river Genesee, whenever they should consent to part with it. Messrs Phelps and Gorham sold this privilege of purchase to Mr Morris, who again sold it to the Dutch Company; binding himself at the same time to prevail with the Indians to relinquish their right to a certain part at least of the lands. Thus four different sets of purchasers succeeded each other in regard to an object concerning the sale of which the consent of the true original owners had not yet been obtained; and four different contracts were entered into, founded on the supposition, that it would be an easy matter to remove the Indians from those distant corners to which they had retired; a point about which their more polished neighbours were well assured.\n\nThe smallpox has at different periods proved extremely fatal to the Indians, and has greatly diminished their numbers. But the most dangerous enemy which they have to encounter is their attachment to spirituous liquors, which the whites cannot be prevented from selling to them, and which they cannot refrain themselves from purchasing. These liquors are peculiarly fatal to their strength and health, and daily render their marriages less prolific.—So that, from a complication of evils, the hostility and oppression of the neighbouring white people, the imprudent sales which they make of their territory, and the diseases to which they are exposed, the Indian tribes are gradually expatriated and decreasing in number. Every nation is now divided into different branches; the families are dispersed abroad; and whisky is rapidly diminishing the number of those which yet remain. A few years more, and these nations will disappear from the surface of the earth, as civilized people approach.\n\nNegroes originally imported from the coast of Africa, and held in slavery or emancipated, form another part of the population of the United States. The British nation, which refused to pollute its population at home by the existence of domestic slavery, had nevertheless tolerated the practice in its distant colonies, where the character of the people was accounted of less importance to the empire, and where the interests of commerce were regarded as the primary object of attention. In the convention which formed the constitution of the American union, the southern states were successful in obtaining an enactment in favour of the slave trade, which was couched in the following ambiguous terms: \"The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the congress, prior to the year 1808; but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.\" There are no slaves in the commonwealth of Massachusetts; and this is the only state in the union that is entirely exempt from the disgrace of personal slavery. It was abolished in the following manner. No law in New England had positively authorized slavery; but it prevailed under the sanction of custom and of public opinion. Several laws indeed presupposed it; as they authorized the reclaiming of negroes who quitted their masters, enjoined the necessity of restoring them, and prohibited the intermarriage of blacks with free people. The new constitution of Massachusetts, like those of the other states, declared an equality of rights for all men. In 1781, some negroes, prompted by private suggestion, maintained that they were not slaves, and they found advocates who brought their cause before the supreme court. Their counsel pleaded, if That no law established slavery, and that the laws supposing it were the result of error in the legislators who had an authority to enact them; adly, They contended, that all such laws were annulled by the new constitution. They gained the cause upon both these principles; and, as there were only few slaves in Massachusetts, all further idea of slavery was banished. But in the other New England states, under similar laws, and in similar circumstances, a contrary decision was given.\n\nIt is to be observed, that in 1778, the general census or enumeration of the population of Massachusetts included 18,000 slaves; whereas, the subsequent census of 1790, exhibits only 6,000 blacks. It appears that a great proportion of the emancipated negroes went to the towns, where making an indirect use of their newly acquired freedom, many of them addicted themselves to the intemperate use of spirituous liquors, and died in consequence; others engaged as sailors even on board foreign ships. The generality of those who did not disappear became servants; some are tradesmen, or even farmers; and a tolerable number, considering their education and the habits which slavery produces, have attained to independence. They have not fallen under the lash of public justice more frequently than the whites, in proportion to the numbers of each class.\n\nIn the eastern part of Virginia, one-fifth of the population is still said to consist of Negro slaves, and farther\nAmerica farther south where rice is cultivated, the proportion of negroes is still greater. In Pennsylvania, and the other middle or northern states, measures have been adopted for their gradual emancipation. Such measures have become popular, not only from the general temper of the age, but from the conviction now generally diffused of the tendency of domestic slavery to degrade the character of the free white men.\n\nWith regard to the whites, who form the third and last class of the people of this great country; it may be observed, that when the American constitution ordained the enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States, within three years after its acceptance, it enacted also, that the same enumeration should be renewed every ten years, and left it to the congress to make a law for regulating the manner of performing it. A law was accordingly passed for this purpose in 1790. The marshal of every district, who is a kind of sheriff, is ordered to superintend the enumeration. In this work he may call in what aid he thinks proper. He must make a return to the president of the United States, distinguishing in the table of population, the number of free males under and over the age of sixteen years; and also the free women and girls; and the slaves. The Indians are not included in the list of population. The lists are exhibited upon public places, for the correction of the inhabitants, and the heads of families are required, under a pecuniary penalty, to state correctly the number of their families. The whole enumeration is required to be performed in nine months. The total expense of it is estimated at 40,000 dollars every time it is made.\n\nThe enumeration of the people taken in 1791, by virtue of this law, announced a population of 3,929,326 inhabitants, of whom 3,231,629 were free. Among the free persons were 57,777 negroes, or mulattoes. The slaves amounted to 697,691. By the latest enumeration, the population of the United States amounted to about 5,000,000.\n\nThe character of the inhabitants of the United States of America is necessarily various, according to the climate which they inhabit, and the laws and history of the different states. The use of slaves, in particular, has itself produced a considerable effect upon the character and habits of the free men of those parts of the empire in which they abound. Certain features of character, however, are in some measure common to the whole inhabitants of the states; and it may be observed in general, that the British nation, which was the founder and the parent of these people, has no reason to be ashamed of them. Indeed, in a country which belonged to Great Britain for a long time, which was peopled from it, of which the most numerous and nearest connexions are yet with Great Britain, and which carries on with us almost all its commerce, the manners of the people must necessarily in a great degree resemble our own. Accordingly, the American manners particularly those relative to living, are the same as in England, or the fourth of Scotland; and New York and Philadelphia are faithful copies, in this respect, of Liverpool and of Glasgow. As to the dress, the English fashions are as faithfully copied, as the transmission of merchandise from England, and the correspondence of tailors and mantua-makers, will admit of. The distribution of the apartments in their houses is like that of Great Britain. The furniture is British; the town carriages are either British or in the British taste, and it is no small merit in the fashionable world, to have a coach newly arrived from London, of the newest fashion there. The cookery is British; and as in Britain, after dinner, the ladies withdraw, and give place to drinking wine, a custom which the Americans carry at least to as great a length, as the natives of the parent state. Indeed, frequent and sumptuous dinners are said to be held in as high consideration in the new, as in the old world.\n\nIn the United States, the British character is modified by the situation in which the inhabitants of this new empire find themselves. The most general qualities common to all Americans, are understood to be, intrepidity, an ardour for enterprise, a high opinion of themselves, humanity, and a boundless love of gain. These qualities, some of which are so apparently discordant, are nevertheless found to unite in the American character. They who consider candidly the history of the war of the revolution, the instances of individual courage which they exhibited in it, and the perseverance which the whole people displayed under repeated difficulties, will be fully satisfied concerning their firmness and courage. Habituated to fatigue from their infancy, having for the most part made their fortunes by their labour and their industry, fatigue and labour are not yet become repugnant, even to those in easy circumstances. While they wish to enjoy the luxuries of life, they do not regard them as absolute wants. They know how to dispense with them, and to quit them and to travel in the woods whenever their interest requires it. They can forget them whenever a reverse in the current of their affairs takes them away. They are not depressed by disappointment, but instantly resume the pursuit of fortune when she has most cruelly deceived them.\n\nGreat pride of spirit, and a high notion of their own worth, are also striking parts of the American character. A committee of the house of representatives of the United States, appointed to prepare an answer to the address of the president, in December 1796, gave a notable instance of this. These gentlemen very modestly thought fit, to call their countrymen the most enlightened nation of the whole world; and very great labour and long discussions, were necessary before the majority of the house could be prevailed upon to sacrifice this superlative, which it is said would not have embarrassed the modesty of their constituents. No white American will so far degrade himself, as to consent to accept of the situation of a domestic menial servant or footman. Hence it is said, that throughout the whole extent of the United States, 20 native Americans are not to be found in the state of domestic servants. This class of domestics in America, is composed of emigrant priests, Germans, and negroes or mulattoes. As soon as the former of these have acquired a little money, they quit a station which they find to be regarded with such contempt, and establish themselves in a small trade, or upon land which they clear and cultivate. Hence it may easily be inferred, that a good domestic man servant is not readily to be found in America.\n\nThe prejudice which causes the men in America to have so great a repugnance to the state of domestic servitude,\nservitude, does not influence the women in the same degree. And accordingly, nothing is more common than to see young women of good families, in the situation of servants during the first years of their youth.\n\nAt the same time, it must not be imagined, that pure republican manners prevail in America. Though there are no distinctions of rank, formally acknowledged by law in the United States, yet fortune and the nature of professions form different classes; the first class is occupied by the great merchants, the lawyers, the physicians, the clergy, and the land-owners who do not cultivate their land themselves; the number of whom is small from the state of Delaware to the north, but is great in the states of the south, where slavery prevails. The second class consists of the inferior merchants, the farmers, and the artisans. And the third class is composed of workmen, who let themselves to labour by the day, the month, &c. In balls, concerts, and public amusements, these classes do not mix; though, except ordinary labourers, and common sailors, every one calls himself, and is called by others, a gentleman. A small income is sufficient for the assumption of this title; as it easily carries men from one class to another. It is said, indeed, that the struggle for rank between different classes produces, in the great towns, a very ruinous degree of ostentation. In New York and Philadelphia, luxury is very high, and makes a dangerous progress every year, by increasing the expense of living, and altering the public opinion with regard to what constitutes easy circumstances and a competent fortune. Still, however, the inferior classes of workmen entertain a higher opinion of themselves than elsewhere. They find the road to independence more practicable, and as the price of their labour is high, their circumstances are easy, and they endeavour to throw aside, as far as possible every appearance of ruffianism. They see all ranks of men engaged in business; they do not therefore account themselves degraded by being compelled to labour, especially as they find their skill and industry sought after by others, while it is productive of affluence to themselves; for in the United States there is not a family, even in the most miserable hut, who do not eat butchers meat twice a day at least, and drink tea and coffee; nor is there a man who drinks pure water. Having heard much of the modes of living usual among persons of their rank in other nations, they are led to entertain an unbounded value for themselves and their country.\n\nDid not the practice of slavery still stand in the way, the Americans would not be surpassed in the reputation of generosity and humanity. When a brother or a father dies, leaving orphan children, they are readily adopted into the families of their uncles and other kindred, who treat them entirely as their own. This conduct is so common in America, that it meets with no praise, and is considered merely as the performance of the most ordinary duty, and as requiring no effort. Hospitality to strangers is also exerted to a great extent, and in a way that even perplexes for some time the modesty of an European. In cases of unusual calamity also, great liberality is displayed by them. The unfortunate sufferers by the fires of Charlestown and Savannah, and by the dreadful disaster which raged at Philadelphia, New York, and America, other cities, were relieved by the abundant subscriptions of the citizens of all the American towns where these disasters did not occur. The inhabitants of the French West India islands who fled to the shores of America, in consequence of the events of the late terrible revolution, were relieved by voluntary contributions, to the amount of more than 200,000 dollars. Whole families of them were supported for one or two years, according to their necessities, by individual Americans, in their houses, merely because they were unfortunate. There also exists a very considerable number of charitable societies for various purposes, in the United States. Some of these are marine societies, whose purpose is in some towns to provide a subsistence for the wives and children of those who die at sea, or to provide assistance to all vessels wrecked upon their coasts. There are also societies for the affluence of emigrants, that is to say, for affluence with advice and favours those strangers who arrive from Europe, with an intention of establishing themselves in America. Others subscribe for the support of hospitals and schools, and for the distribution of proper medicines. There are societies for the civilization of the Indians, and others for the purposes of ameliorating the situation of prisoners. Indeed, it is with regard to this last subject that the Americans are entitled to boast that the triumph of humanity has been more complete in some parts at least of their country than anywhere else in the world. At Philadelphia, the administration of the prisons has been established upon the most enlightened and benevolent principles, and is conducted with a degree of advantage to the public, and to imprisoned criminals, that has hitherto been unknown in the history of mankind. The jailors receive ample salaries; a constant inspection is exerted over them, by the most respectable characters in the state; the convicts are treated with the utmost mildness; yet licentiousness is banished, they are enabled to support themselves, and sometimes to carry out with them a sum of money, or to support their families during their confinement; and in almost all cases, the much wished-for, but hitherto unattainable end, is said to be gained, of rendering punishment the means of accomplishing the reformation of the criminal. Such is said to be the admirable effect of the humane and skilful management which has been here adopted, chiefly, it is understood, by means of the members of the sect of Quakers; that, instead of the prisons containing what are called old offenders, it usually happens, that of 100 convicts discharged, either in consequence of pardons, or at the expiration of the term of their sentence, there are never above two committed for new crimes, although imprisonment for a longer or shorter period is the only punishment adopted for all great crimes; no crime being capital excepting only wilful murder.\n\nBut the most remarkable feature in the American character, and indeed their ruling passion, is a boundless thirst after gain. This passion, however, is in them altogether different from that timid and hoarding appetite which with us is sometimes seen to quench all the energies of the human mind, and to extinguish every generous and liberal sentiment. In truth, the avarice of an American is nothing more than the passion of ambition directed to the acquisition of wealth.\nAmerica as the only means of attaining distinction in the state of society in which he is placed. Accordingly, he endeavours to gratify his love of riches, not so much by the flow and sure mode of saving what he already possesses, and of suffering it to accumulate, as by entering into bold and hazardous speculations, with a view to the sudden acquisition of fortune. If his speculation is unsuccessful, he thinks not the worse of himself on that account, nor is discouraged from repeatedly encountering similar hazards. If he is at last successful, his wealth is used in such a manner as evidently demonstrates, that the love of riches has not fully engrossed his mind. He is luxurious, ostentatious, generous to the unfortunate, and ready to contribute to every scheme of public beneficence or utility. Still, this ardent passion for the acquisition of money which occupies so much of the thoughts of every American, never fails to appear disgusting to men of letters, or to men of rank who have at any time gone from Europe to America. They are astonished to find physicians, lawyers, and priests, deeply engaged in stockjobbing and commercial speculations, and that every part of society is composed of men whose ruling passion and great subject of meditation is, the sudden acquisition in some way or other of great pecuniary gain.\n\nThe Americans marry very young, especially in the country. Young men, who generally establish themselves very early either in some new lands or in some trade, have occasion for a wife to assist them in their labours; and this conduces to their early marriages as much as the general purity of manners. If a wife die, she is, for the same reason, very speedily replaced by another. Both in town and country, she is an indispensable resource for domestic affairs, when her husband is engaged in his own affairs, as every one is in America. She is also necessary as a companion in a country where the children soon quit their parents, and where the men, constantly engaged in some kind of business, find it inconvenient to leave their own families in search of society. The manners of the Americans in their conduct towards the other sex are represented as very pure. Young women of uncommon beauty travel alone from 15 to 25 miles to Philadelphia to market with eggs, fowls, butter, and other commodities, beginning their journeys at the commencement of the night, without finding that their youth and beauty expose them to any hazard or inconvenience.\n\nAll travellers agree in representing the American women as highly virtuous and respectable; as faithful and industrious wives, and affectionate mothers. The young women enjoy entire freedom, and the commerce of the sexes is free from gallantry and from jealousy. The crime of adultery, which attacks society in its first elements, is said to be unknown. One quality ascribed in a remarkable degree to the American women ought not to pass unnoticed, which is, a remarkable attention to cleanliness, both in their persons and their houses. The French who took refuge in the United States during the revolution, though attentive enough in this respect to the appearance of their persons, were regarded as so slovenly and dirty in the management of their houses and furniture, that they soon rendered themselves altogether odious to the Americans.\n\nThe state of education and of literature is still defective in most parts of America. The physical or natural part of the education of the Americans is said to be less excellent. Left to themselves from their tenderest age, they are exposed without precaution to the rigours of heat and cold, with their feet and legs bare, and with few clothes. The children of the rich are not brought up much more tenderly than those in less easy circumstances. In the country, they often go alone twice a day to schools, two or three miles distant from home. There are few American children who cannot swim boldly, and at ten years of age, manage a gun and hunt without danger: and not one who does not ride with great courage, or who fears fatigue. This liberty given to children teaches them to take care of themselves, and, bold as they are, they avoid dangers better than children brought up with much greater care. They become strong and enterprising men, whom no difficulties daunt; and produce a growing generation, which will be as invincible in its territory, as that which preceded it was found to be.\n\nThe instructive part of education has not attained the same perfection. Massachusetts is the only state in which a system of education has hitherto been established by law. It was enacted in 1789, that each town or township containing 50 families or houses shall have a schoolmaster of good character, to instruct the children in the English language, reading, writing, and arithmetic. The school to be open six months in the year. The towns or townships of 100 families, are to have schools of the same kind, which are to be open during the whole year. Those of 150 families are bound to have two schools, one for 12 months and one for six. Those of 200 families, or more, are bound to have two schools, one for 12 and one for six months, and in addition to these, a grammar school, in which the Greek, Latin, and English languages are to be taught grammatically. The expense of supporting the schoolmasters, together with the school houses, the fuel, and drink that may be necessary, are defrayed by a general tax or assessment upon the whole people. The parents pay their share of this assessment, in proportion only to their wealth, and not to the number of their children. They supply their children with the necessary books, and with pens and paper. Colleges are also established; but in these the professors receive fees from the students. The books read at the schools are regulated by law; and we are informed, that the Latin grammar which the state of Massachusetts has preferred is that of Dr Alexander Adam, rector of the High School of Edinburgh, author also of the celebrated treatise upon Roman Antiquities, and other works illustrative of classical literature.\n\nThough the state of Massachusetts is the only one that has established a system of education by law, the manners of the people in the whole New England states have produced such a degree of attention to literature, that there are few or no white persons there who cannot read the English language, and the people at large possess a considerable degree of literature. In proportion, however, to the distance from New England southward, education becomes gradually defective, and in the Carolinas and Georgia, a school is scarcely to be found. In different states, however, there are colleges and universities, in which the sciences are taught, and degrees conferred.\nThe education of youth in America is conducted as in Scotland, with a view rather to introduce young persons quickly into life, than to render them men of profound learning. A young man in America hardly arrives at the age of 16 years before his parents are desirous of placing him in the counting-house of a merchant, or in the office of a lawyer; hence he is never likely to resign himself to the sciences and to letters. He soon loses all other ideas than those which can hurry him on to the acquisition of a fortune. He sees no other views in those around him, or in society; and that his whole consideration is attached to this kind of success. Hence it will not appear surprising, that there should be few learned men in the United States. Indeed, the number of learned, ingenious, and well-informed individuals, which is very considerable, that have appeared there, must be ascribed rather to their own native energy of character than to their education, or the state of society in which they were placed.\n\nIn the American schools, the instruction in Latin is seldom extended farther than the first classical authors, including Cornelius Nepos, Ovid, and some orations of Cicero. A little of Virgil and Horace are read in the colleges. The New Testament in Greek, and a little of Homer in some colleges, is the limit of classical instruction in that language. Mathematical instruction is usually confined to the Elements of Euclid, and the first principles of conic sections. Practical geometry, however, for the purposes of land-surveying and navigation, is much valued, on account of its connexion with those branches of business which lead to riches. Mechanics, hydrostatics, and hydraulics, are taught after the works of Nicolson, Ferguson, or Enfield. Medicine, however, and the branches of science connected with it, are said to be well taught in some American universities; and that profession has produced many respectable and well-informed men. Still it is probable, that however enlightened the Americans may account themselves, the nature of their pursuits is such, that a considerable time will elapse before they can exhibit any great number of men of profound and extensive learning. Such accomplishments, however, as their situation acquires they possess in much perfection. In the debates of congress, speeches full of correct reasoning, drawn from a knowledge of mankind and of history, and expressed with purity and eloquence, are often heard; and almost all persons engaged in business aspire in their correspondence to display much elegance of expression, though their style is apt to swell out into verbosity.\n\nThe most common vices of the American people are, an ostentatious luxury, on the part of the rich in great towns; and of the inferior class, a too free use of spirituous liquors. This they are led to by their easy circumstances, and by a great fondness for society. These vices are greater and more remarkable in the southern states than in the northern. In the south, also, men are more fond of gaming than in the north, and the energetic qualities of the American character are less conspicuous; a circumstance which is supposed to arise from the existence of slavery, which in these states renders labour and personal industry less respectable. But, in general, the character of the Americans is rendered pure by the train of constant industry in which all persons are engaged. One of the most troublesome of their faults, however, ought not to pass unnoticed: They are, upon the whole, a very litigious people, and lawyers abound and flourish among them to a great degree. But, in common with all the countries that have derived any part of their constitution or their laws from England, they possess a very pure administration of justice. This has always been the singular privilege and the glory of the English nation. No people that attains to it can fail to possess sound morals, nor consequently to enjoy all the prosperity of which a nation is capable. To the habits of integrity, and a respect for the laws and the magistrates, which it produces, we must ascribe the internal tranquillity of America. Politics forms the only science which all men study there; and political zeal hurries the different parties into the most uncharitable misrepresentations of each other's views and conduct. But no man has preferred his own personal aggrandizement to the authority of the law or the welfare of his country; no usurpation has defaced the fair page of the American history; and if rebellion has occurred, it has been bloodless, and has only afforded to all ranks of men an opportunity of displaying their attachment to public order.\n\nUpon the whole, though men exclusively attached to the pursuits of literature, and to the enjoyment of idle, but polished society, would find themselves ill situated in America, yet we must undoubtedly regard the United States as forming at this moment the most prosperous empire upon the globe. It contains an active people, easy in their circumstances and happy; and every day gives an accretion of population and of strength to this new country.\n\nINDEX\n\nA\n\nAct, stamp, framed, received

Not far from hence is a mountain called AMERSFORT-BERG, on which is planted a villa of trees, which reaches to Utrecht.\n\nAMESHAM, or AGMONDESHAM, a market town in Buckinghamshire, consisting of about 200 houses, with a free-school, and four almshouses. It sends two members to parliament, and has a market on Tuesday. It is a rectory rated at £81.16s.8d. in the king's books. The market-house is a very handsome structure. W. Long. 0° 15'. N. Lat. 51° 47'.\n\nAMES, WILLIAM, D.D., a learned independent divine, celebrated for his controversial writings, was born in 1576, and educated at Christ's college, in Cambridge. In the reign of King James I., he left the university, and soon after the kingdom, on account of his being unwilling to conform to the rules of the church; and retired to the Hague, where he had not been long before he was invited to accept of the divinity chair in the university of Franeker, in Friesland, which he filled with admirable abilities for above twelve years; during which his fame was so great, that many came from remote nations to be educated under him. He from thence removed to Rotterdam for a change of air, which his health required; and here he continued during the remainder of his life. His controversial writings, which compose the greatest part of his works, are chiefly against Bellarmine and the Arminians. He also wrote, 1. A fresh Suit against the ceremonies. 2. Levitones in Psalms Davidis. 3. Medulla Theologiae; and several pieces relative to the sciences. He died of an asthma at Rotterdam, in November 1633.\n\nAMESTRATUS, a town of Sicily (Cicero); Amebratus (Stephanus); Amalfra (Silius Italicus); Mulibratus (Polybius): Now Molfretta, in the Val di Demona, on the river Halefus. It was a very strong fort of the Carthaginians, befellged in vain by the Romans for seven months with considerable loss; at length, after another siege, taken and razed (Diodorus Siculus).\n\nAMETHYST, a transparent gem of a purple colour, which seems composed of a strong blue and a deep red; and, according as either of these prevails, affording different tinges of purple, sometimes approaching to violet, and sometimes even fading to a pale rose colour. Though the amethyst is generally of a purple colour, it is nevertheless sometimes found naturally colourless, and may at any time be easily made so by putting it into the fire; in which pellucid or colourless state, it so resembles the diamond, that its want of hardness seems the only way of distinguishing it. Some derive the name amethyst from its colour, which resembles wine mixed with water; whilst others, with more probability, think it got its name from its supposed virtue of preventing drunkenness; an opinion which, however imaginary, prevailed to that degree among the ancients, that it was usual for great drinkers to wear it about their necks. Be this as it will, the amethyst is scarcely inferior to any of the gems in the beauty of its colour; and in its purest state is of the same hardness, and at least of equal value, with the ruby and sapphire. It is found of various sizes, from the bigness of a small vetch to an inch and a half in diameter, and often to much more than that in length. Its shape is extremely various, sometimes roundish, sometimes oblong, and at others flattened, at least on one side; but its most common appearance is in a crystaliform figure, consisting of a thick column, composed of four planes, and terminated by a flat and short pyramid, of the same number of sides; or else, of a thinner and longer hexangular column; and sometimes of a long pyramid, without any column. It makes the gayest figure in the last of these states, but is hardest and most valuable in the roundish and pebble-like form. The amethyst is found in the East and West Indies, and in several parts of Europe; the oriental ones, at least some of the finer specimens, being so hard and bright as to equal any of the coloured gems in value. However, by far the greater number of amethysts fall infinitely short of these; as all the European ones, and not a few of those brought from the East and West Indies, are very little harder than common crystal.\n\nCounterfeit or Fictitious AMETHYST. Spars and crystals tinged red and yellow, &c., are sold for amethysts. The false ones come from Germany, are tinged by vapours in the mines, and contain some lead.\n\nAmethysts may be counterfeited by glass, to which the proper colour or stain is given. There were fine ones made in France about the year 1690, which may even impose on connoisseurs, unless the stone be taken out of the collet.—The method of giving this colour to glass is directed as follows: Take crystal frit, made with the most perfect and fine taro: Then prepare a mixture of manganese in powder, one pound; and zaffire prepared, one ounce and a half: Mix these powders well together; and add to every pound of the frit an ounce of this powder. Let it be put into the pots with the frit, not into the prepared metal. When the whole has stood long enough in fusion to be perfectly pure, work it into vessels, and they will resemble the colour of the amethyst.\n\nAMETHYST, in Heraldry, a term for the purple colour in the coat of a nobleman, in use with those who blazon with precious stones, instead of metals and colours. This, in a gentleman's escutcheon, is called Purpure; and in those of sovereign princes, Mercury.\n\nAMETHYSTINE, AMETHYST. See BOTANY Index.\n\nAMETHYSTINE is applied, in Antiquity, to a kind of purple garment dyed of the hue of amethyst. In this sense amethystine differed from Tyrian as well as from hyacinthine purple, being a kind of medium between both.\n\nAMHAR, or AMHARA, a province of Abyssinia, said to extend 40 leagues from east to west. It is considered as the most noble in the whole empire, both on account of its being the usual residence of the Abyssinian\nAmhurft byllfian monarchs, and having a particular dialect different from all the rest, which, by reason of the emperors being brought up in this province, is become the language of the court and of the politer people. Here is the famed rock Amba-geffen, where the young monarchs were formerly confined. See Amba and Abyssinia.\n\nAmhurst, Nicholas, an English poet and political writer of the 18th century, was born at Mar- den in Kent, and entered of St John's college, Oxford; from whence he was expelled for irregularity of conduct and libertine principles. Retaining great resentment against the university on this account, he abused its learning and discipline, and some of the most respectable characters in it, in a poem published in 1724 called Oculus Britanniae, and in a book entitled Terre Filius. He published, A Miscellany of Poems, sacred and profane; and, The Convocation, a poem in five cantos, which was a satire on the Bishop of Bangor's antagonists. But he is best known for the share he had in the political paper called The Craftsman: though, after having been the drudge of his party for near 20 years, he was as much forgotten in the famous compromise of 1742 as if he had never been born; and, when he died in that year of a broken heart, was indebted to the charity of his bookseller for a grave.\n\nAmianthus, or Earth-flax, in Mineralogy, a fibrous, flexible, elastic, mineral substance, consisting of short, abrupt, and interwoven filaments. It is found in Germany, in the strata of iron ore, sometimes forming veins of an inch in diameter. Its fibres are so flexible that cloth has been made of them, and the shorter filaments that separate in the washing of the stone may be made into paper in the common manner. For the method of its preparation for manufacture into cloth, see Asbestos.\n\nAmianthus is classified by Mr Kirkwan in the muriatic genus of earths, because it contains about a fifth part of magnesia. Its other constituents are, flint, mild calcareous earth, barytes, clay, and a very small proportion of iron. It is fusible per se in a strong heat, and also with the common fluxes. See Mineralogy Index.\n\nAmicable, in a general sense, denotes anything done in a friendly manner, or to promote peace.\n\nAmicable Benches, in Roman Antiquity, were, according to Plutarch, lower and less honourable seats allotted for the Judices pedanei, or inferior judges, who, upon being admitted of the emperor's council, were dignified by him with the title amici.\n\nAmicable Numbers, denote pairs of numbers, of which each of them is mutually equal to the sum of all the aliquot parts of the other. So the first or least pair of amicable numbers are 220 and 284; all the aliquot parts of which, with their sums, are as follows, viz.\n\nof 220, they are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55,\n110, their sum 284;\n\nof 284, they are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, and their sum is 220.\n\nThe second pair of amicable numbers are 17296 and 18416, which have also the same property as above.\n\nAnd the third pair of amicable numbers are 936384 and 9437056.\n\nThese three pairs of amicable numbers were found by F. Schooten, sect. 9, of his Exercitationes Mathematicae, who, it is said, first gave the name of amicable to such numbers, though such properties of numbers, it seems, had before been treated of by Rudolph, Descartes, and others.\n\nTo find the first pair, Schooten puts $4x$ and $4yz$, or $a'x$ and $a'yz$ for the two numbers where $a = 2$; then making each of these equal to the sum of the aliquot parts of the other, gives two equations, from which are found the values of $x$ and $z$, and consequently assuming a proper value for $y$, the two amicable numbers themselves $4x$ and $4yz$.\n\nIn like manner for the other pairs of such numbers; in which he finds it necessary to assume $16x$ and $16yz$ or $a'x$ and $a'yz$ for the 2nd pair, and $128x$ and $128yz$ or $a'x$ and $a'yz$ for the 3rd pair.\n\nSchooten then gives this practical rule, from Descartes, for finding amicable numbers, viz. assume the number 2, or some power of the number 2, such that if unity or 1 be subtracted from each of these three following quantities, viz:\n\nfrom three times the assumed number,\nalso from 6 times the assumed number,\nand from 18 times the square of the assumed number,\n\nthe three remainders may be all prime numbers; then the last prime number being multiplied by double the assumed number, the product will be one of the amicable numbers sought, and the sum of its aliquot parts will be the other.\n\nThat is, if $a$ be put = the number 2, and $n$ some integer number, such that $3a^n - 1$, and $6a^n - 1$, and $18a^n - 1$ be all three prime numbers; then is $18a^n - 1 \\times 2a^n$ one of the amicable numbers; and the sum of its aliquot parts is the other.\n\nAmictus, in Roman Antiquity, was any upper garment worn over the tunic.\n\nAmictus, among Ecclesiastical Writers, the uppermost garment anciently worn by the clergy; the other five being the alba, fimbria, stola, manipulus, and planeta. The amictus was a linen garment, of a square figure, covering the head, neck, and shoulders, and buckled or clasped before the breast. It is still worn by the religious abroad.\n\nAmiculum, in Roman Antiquity, a woman's upper garment, which differed from the pala. It was worn both by matrons and courtezans.\n\nAmicus curiae, a law term, to denote a bystander who informs the court of a matter in law that is doubtful or mistaken.\n\nAmid-Amid, in Geography, a lofty ridge of mountains in Abyssinia. See Abyssinia.\n\nAmida, a god worshipped by the Japanese; who has many temples erected to him in the island of Japan, of which the principal is at Jeddo. The Japanese have such a confidence in their idol Amida, that they hope to attain eternal felicity by the frequent invocation of his name. One of the figures of this idol is represented at Rome.\n\nAmida, in Ancient Geography, a principal city of Mesopotamia, otherwise called Amorra; situated on a high mountain, on the borders of Assyria, on the Tigris, where it receives the Nymphius. It was taken from the Romans, in the time of the emperor Constans, by Saporos king of Persia. The siege is said to have cost him 30,000 men; however, he reduced\nAmiens ced it to such ruin, that the emperor afterwards wept over it. According to Ammianus Marcellinus, the city was razed; the chief officers were crucified; and the rest, with the soldiers and inhabitants, either put to the sword or carried into captivity, except our historian himself, and two or three more, who, in the dead of the night, escaped through a portal unperceived by the enemy. The inhabitants of Nisibis, however, being obliged to leave their own city by Jovian's treaty with the Persians, soon restored Amida to its former strength; but it was again taken by Cavades in 501, but was restored to the Romans in 503. On the declension of the Roman power, it fell again into the hands of the Perians; but was taken from them by the Saracens in 899. It is now in the possession of Turks. Here are above 20,000 Christians, who are better treated by the Turks than in other places. A great trade is carried on in this city of red Turkey leather, and cotton cloth of the same colour. The Arabian name of Amida is Diarbekir, and the Turkish one Kara-Amid. E. Long. 39° 6' N. Lat. 36° 53'.\n\nAMIENS, a large handsome city of France, the capital of Picardy. It is agreeably situated on the river Somme, and said to have received its Latin name Ambianum from being everywhere encompassed with water. It is a place of great antiquity; being mentioned by Cæsar as a town that had made a vigorous resistance against the Romans, and where he convened a general assembly of the Gauls after having made himself master of it. The emperors Antoninus and Marcus Aurelius enlarged it; and Constantine, Conflans, Julian, and several others, resided here a considerable time. The town is encompassed with a wall and other fortifications; and the ramparts are planted with trees, which form a delightful walk. The river Somme enters Amiens by three different channels, under as many bridges; and these channels, after washing the town in several places, where they are of use in its different manufactures, unite at the other end by the bridge of St Michael. Here is a quay for the boats that come from Abbeville with goods brought by sea. At the gate of Nyon there is a suburb remarkable for the abbey of St Achen. Next to this gate you come to that of Paris, where they have a long mall between two rows of trees. The houses are well built; the streets spacious, embellished with handsome squares and good buildings; and the number of inhabitants is between 40,000 and 50,000. The cathedral, dedicated to our Lady, is one of the largest and most magnificent churches in France; adorned with handsome paintings, fine pillars, chapels, and tombs; particularly the nave is greatly admired. The other places worth seeing are the palace of the bailiwick, the town-house, the square des Fleurs, and the great market place.\n\nAmiens was taken by the Spaniards, in 1597, by the following stratagem: Soldiers, disguised like peasants, conducted a cart laden with nuts, and let a bag of them fall just as the gate was opened. While the guard was busy in gathering up the nuts, the Spaniards entered and became masters of the town. It was retaken by Henry IV., who built a citadel here. The definitive treaty of peace, entered into by the different European powers in 1802, was negotiated here.\n\nThis town is the seat of a bishop, suffragan of Rheims, as also of a prelatical, bailiwick, vidam, a chamber of accounts, and a generality. The bishop's revenue is Amilcar 30,000 livres. They have some linen and woollen manufactures, and they also make a great quantity of black and green soap. It lies in E. Long. 2° 18'. N. Lat. 49° 53'.\n\nAMILCAR, the name of several Carthaginian captains. The most celebrated of them is Amilcar Barca, the father of Hannibal, who, during five years, infested the coast of Italy; when the Romans sending out their whole naval strength, defeated him near Trapani, 242 years before Christ; and this put an end to the first Punic war. Amilcar began the second, and landed in Spain, where he subdued the most warlike nations; but as he was preparing for an expedition against Italy, he was killed in battle, 228 years before the Christian era. He left three sons, whom he had educated, as he said, like three lions, to tear Rome in pieces; and made Hannibal, his eldest son, swear an eternal enmity against the Romans.\n\nAMILICTI, in the Chaldaic Theology, denote a kind of intellectual powers, or persons in the divine hierarchy. The amilicti are represented as three in number; and constitute one of the triads, in the third order of the hierarchy.\n\nAMIRANTE, in the Spanish Polity, a great officer of state, answering to our lord high admiral.\n\nAMISUS, in Ancient Geography, the chief city of the ancient kingdom of Pontus. It was built by the Miletians, and peopled partly by them and partly by a colony from Athens. It was at first a free city, like the other Greek cities in Asia; but afterwards subdued by Pharnaces king of Pontus, who made it his metropolis. It was taken by Lucullus in the Mithridatic war, who restored it to its ancient liberty. Closer by Amisus stood another city called Eupatoria, from Mithridates Eupator its founder. This city was likewise taken by Lucullus, who levelled it with the ground; but it was afterwards rebuilt by Pompey, who united it with Amisus, giving them the name of Pompeiopolis. It was taken during the war between Cæsar and Pompey, by Pharnaces king of Pontus, who put most of its inhabitants to the sword; but Cæsar, having conquered Pharnaces, made it again a free city.\n\nAMITERNUM, a town of the Sabines, in Italy, (Liv., Pliny); now extinct. The ruins are to be seen on the level ridge of a mountain, near St Vittorino, and the springs of the Aternus; not far from Aquila, which rose out of the ruins of Amiternum.\n\nAMITTERE LEGEM TERRÆ, among Lawyers, a phrase importing the loss of liberty of swearing in any court: The punishment of a champion overcome or yielding in battle, of jurors found guilty in a writ of attaint, and of a person outlawed.\n\nAM-KAS, in History, a name given to a spacious saloon in the palace of the Great Mogul, where he gives audience to his subjects, and where he appears on solemn festivals with extraordinary magnificence. His throne is supported by six large steps of maffly gold, set with rubies, emeralds, and diamonds, estimated at 60,000,000l.\n\nAMMA, among Ecclesiastical Writers, a term used to denote an abbess or spiritual mother.\n\nAMMAN, or AMMANT, in the German and Belgic Polity, a judge who has the cognizance of civil causes.\nAMMANNIA. — It is also used among the French for a public notary, or officer, who draws up instruments and deeds.\n\nAMMANNIA. See Botany Index.\n\nAMMIL, Bishop's weed. See Botany Index.\n\nAMMIANUS MARCELLINUS, a Roman historian of the fourth century, was a native of Greece, born in the city of Antioch. Having served several years in the early part of his life in the army, he was afterwards promoted to the honourable station of protector domesticus. In the year 350 he entered the service of Constantius, the emperor of the east, and, under the command of Ursicinus, a general of the horse, he served during several expeditions. According to his own modest relation, it appears that he acquired considerable military fame, and that he deserved well of his sovereign. He attended the emperor Julian in his expedition into Persia, but history is silent whether or not he rose to any higher military rank than that which has already been mentioned. He was either in the city or the vicinity of Antioch when the conspiracy of Theodorus was discovered, under the reign of Valens, and was an eye witness of the severe torments to which many persons were exposed by the emperor on that account.\n\nBut his lasting reputation was not to be acquired from military exertions. He left the army, and retired to Rome, where he employed his time and talents in writing the history of that empire during the period of three centuries. Though a native of Greece, he wrote in the Latin language; but, according to the remark of Vossius, his Latin shows that he was a Greek, and also a folder. His history begins with the reign of Nerva, and continues to the death of Valens; and the work was originally divided into 31 books. Of these the first 13 have perished, and the 18 which remain commence with the 17th year of the reign of Constantius, and terminate at the year 375. But there are several facts mentioned in the history which prove that the author was alive in the year 390. Of this number are the accession of Theodosius to the eastern empire, the character of Gratian, and the consulate of Neotorius. Similar to the manner in which Herodotus, the father of Grecian history, read his history, Marcellinus read his books in public with general approbation. Some have reckoned the style harsh and redundant, but this may easily be excused, from his education and military life; and the valuable information communicated abundantly compensates for that defect. Candour and impartiality are leading features in his history. The character given him by Mr Gibbon appears to be accurate, when he says that he is \"an accurate and faithful guide, who composed the history of his own times without indulging the prejudices and passions which usually affect the mind of a contemporary.\"\n\nA difference of opinion has obtained, whether or not our historian was a Christian or a Pagan. But the respectful manner in which he speaks of Pagan deities, and of the advantage of heathen auguries to foretell future events, render it abundantly evident that he was a heathen. The favourable account which he gives of the religion, manners, and fortitude of Christians, are the result of his candour and impartiality as an historian. The work of Marcellinus has passed through several editions; but that printed at Leyden in 1693, with explanatory notes, is esteemed the best. (Gen. Annianus.)\n\nAMIRATO, Scipio, an eminent Italian historian, born at Lecco in Naples in 1531. After travelling over great part of Italy, without settling to his satisfaction, he was engaged by the great duke of Tuscany to write The History of Florence; for which he was presented to a canonry in the cathedral there. He wrote other works while in this station; and died in 1600.\n\nAMMOCHRYSONS, from ἀμμος, sand, and χρυσος, gold, a name given by authors to a stone very common in Germany, and seeming to be composed of a golden sand. It is of a yellow gold-like colour, and its particles are very glistening, being all fragments of a coloured talc. It is usually so soft as to be easily rubbed to a powder in the hand; sometimes it requires grinding to powder in a mortar, or otherwise. It is used only as sand to strew over writing. The Germans call it katzenzöld. There is another kind of it less common, but much more beautiful, consisting of the same sort of glossy spangles, but those not of a gold colour, but of a bright red, like vermilion.\n\nAMMODYTES, or SAND-BEL. See Ichthyology Index.\n\nAMMON, anciently a city of Marmarica (Ptolemy). Arrian calls it a place, not a city, in which stood the temple of Jupiter Ammon, round which there was nothing but sandy wastes. Pliny says, that the oracle of Ammon was 12 days journey from Memphis, and among the nomi of Egypt he reckons the nomoi Ammoniaci: Diodorus Siculus, That the district where the temple stood, though surrounded with deserts, was watered by dews which fell nowhere else in all that country. It was agreeably adorned with fruitful trees and springs, and full of villages. In the middle stood the Acropolis or citadel, encompassed with a triple wall; the first and innermost of which contained the palace; the others the apartments of the women, the relations and children, as also the temple of the god, and the sacred fountain for ablutions. Without the Acropolis stood, at no great distance, another temple of Ammon, shaded by a number of tall trees: near which there was a fountain, called that of the sun, or Solis Fons, because subject to extraordinary changes according to the time of the day; morning and evening warm, at noon cold, at midnight extremely hot. A kind of fossil salt was said to be naturally produced here. It was dug out of the earth in large oblong pieces, sometimes three fingers in length, and transparent as crystal. It was thought to be a profuse worthy of kings, and used by the Egyptians in their sacrifices.—From this natural ammoniac has taken its name.\n\nAMMON, or HAMMON, in Heathen Mythology, the name of the Egyptian Jupiter, worshipped under the figure of a ram.\n\nBacchus having subdued Asia, and passing with his army through the deserts of Africa, was in great want of water: but Jupiter, his father, assuming the shape of a ram, led him to a fountain, where he refreshed himself and his army; in gratitude for which favour, Bacchus built there a temple to Jupiter, under the title of Ammon, from the Greek ἀμμος, which signifies sand, alluding to the sandy desert where it was built. In this\nthis temple was an oracle of great note, which Alexander the Great consulted, and which lasted till the time of Theodoius.\n\nHammon, the god of the Egyptians, was the same with the Jupiter of the Greeks; for which reason these latter denominate the city which the Egyptians call No-Hammon, or the habitation of Ammon, Dipsas or the city of Jupiter. He is thought to be the same with Ham, who peopled Africa, and was the father of Mizraim, the founder of the Egyptians.\n\nAmmon, or Ben-Ammi, the son of Lot, was the father of the Ammonites, and dwelt to the east of the Dead sea, in the mountains of Gilead. See Ammonitis and Ammonites.\n\nAmmon, or Ammonius, Andreas, an excellent Latin poet, born at Lucca in Italy, was sent by Pope Leo X. to England, in the characters of protonotary of the Apotheotic See, and collector-general of that kingdom. He was a man of singular genius and learning, and soon became acquainted with the principal literati of those times; particularly with Erasmus, Colet, Grocin, and others, for the sake of whose company he resided some time at Oxford. The advice which Erasmus gives him, in regard to pushing his fortune, has a good deal of humour in it, and was certainly intended as a satire on the artful methods generally practised by the selfish and ambitious part of mankind: \"In the first place (says he), throw off all sense of shame; thrust yourself into every one's buffets, and elbow out whomsoever you can; neither love nor hate any one; measure everything by your own advantage; let this be the scope and drift of all your actions. Give nothing but what is to be returned with usury, and be complaisant to everybody. Have always two strings to your bow. Feign that you are solicited by many from abroad, and get everything ready for your departure. Show letters inviting you elsewhere, with great promises.\" Ammon was Latin secretary to Henry VIII., but at what time he was appointed does not appear. In 1512 he was made canon and prebendary of the collegiate chapel of St Stephen, in the palace of Westminster. He was likewise prebendary of Wells; and in 1514 was presented to the rectory of Dychial in that diocese. About the same time, by the king's special recommendation, he was also made prebendary of Salisbury. He died in the year 1517, and was buried in St Stephen's chapel in the palace of Westminster. He was esteemed an elegant Latin writer, and an admirable poet. The epistles of Erasmus to Ammon abound with encomiums on his genius and learning. His works are, 1. Epistolae ad Erasmum, lib. i. 2. Scotici conflicti historia, lib. i. 3. Bucolicae vel eclogae, lib. i. Basil 1546, 8vo. 4. De rebus nihil, lib. i. 5. Panegyricus quidam, lib. i. 6. Varii generis epigrammata, lib. i. 7. Poemata diversa, lib. i.\n\nAMMONIA, or Volatile Alkali. See Chemistry Index.\n\nAMMONIAC, a concrete gummy resinous juice, brought from the East Indies, usually in large masses, composed of little lumps or tears, of a milky colour, but soon changing, upon being exposed to the air, of a yellowish hue. We have no certain account of the plant which affords this juice: the seeds usually found among the tears resemble those of the umbelliferous class. It has been, however, alleged, and not without some degree of probability, that it is an exudation ammoniac, from a species of the Ferula, another species of which, Sal Ammoniac, produces the afaetida. The plant producing it is said to grow in Nubia, Abyssinia, and the interior parts of Egypt. It is brought to the western parts of Europe from Egypt, and to England from the Red Sea, by some of the ships belonging to the East India Company trading to those parts. Such tears as are large, dry, free from little stones, seeds, or other impurities, should be picked out, and preferred for internal use: the coarser kind is purified by solution and colature, and then carefully infusing it; unless this be artfully managed, the gum will lose a considerable deal of its more volatile parts. There is often vended in the shops, under the name of strained gum ammoniacum, a composition of ingredients much inferior in virtue.\n\nAmmoniac has a nauseous sweet taste, followed by a bitter one; and a peculiar smell, somewhat like that of galbanum, but more grateful: it softens in the mouth, and grows of a whiter colour upon being chewed. Thrown upon live coals, it burns away in flame: it is in some measure soluble in water and in vinegar, with which it assumes the appearance of milk; but the resinous part, amounting to about one half, sublimes on flanking.\n\nAmmoniac is an useful deobstruent, and frequently prescribed for opening obstructions of the abdominal viscera, and in hysterical disorders occasioned by a deficiency of the menstrual evacuations. It is likewise supposed to deterge the pulmonary veffels; and proves of considerable service in some kinds of asthmas, where the lungs are oppressed by viscid phlegm; in this intention, a solution of gum ammoniac in vinegar of squills proves a medicine of great efficacy, though not a little unpleasant. In long and obstinate colics proceeding from viscid matter lodged in the intestines, this gummy resin has produced happy effects, after the purges and the common carminatives had been used in vain. Ammoniac is most commodiously taken in the form of pills; about a scruple may be given every night, or oftener. Externally, it softens and ripens hard tumours: a solution of it in vinegar stands recommended by some for resolving even scirrous swellings. A platter made of it and squill-vinegar is recommended by some in white swellings. A dilute mixture of the same is likewise rubbed on the parts, which are also fumigated with the smoke of juniper berries. In the shops is prepared a solution of it in pennyroyal water, called from its milky colour lac ammoniaci. It is an ingredient also in the squill pills.\n\nSal Ammoniac, the old name of muriate of ammonia, a native salt, composed of ammonia, or volatile alkali, and muriatic acid, was generated in those large inns or caravanserais where the crowd of pilgrims coming from the temple of Jupiter Ammon used to lodge; who, in those parts, travelling upon camels, and those creatures when in Cyrene, a province of Egypt, where that celebrated temple stood, urinating in the stables, or (say some) in the parched sands, out of this urine, which is remarkably strong, arose a kind of salt, denominated sometimes (from the temple) Ammoniac, and sometimes (from the country) Cyrenaic. Since the cessation of these pilgrimages, no more of this salt is produced there; and, from this deficiency,\nAmmonian Ammonites, some suspect there never was any such thing; but this suspicion is removed, by the large quantities of a salt, nearly of the same nature, thrown out by Mount Aetna.\n\nThe modern sal ammoniac is entirely fictitious. See Chemistry Index.\n\nAMMONIAN philosophy. See AMMONIUS.\n\nAMMONITÆ, in Natural History. See CORNU AMMONIS.\n\nAMMONITES, a people descended from Ammon the son of Lot. The Ammonites defeated those giants which they called Zamzummims (Deut. ii. 19—21), and seized upon their country. God forbade Moses, and by him the children of Israel (id. 19.), to attack the Ammonites; because he did not intend to give their lands unto the Hebrews. Before the Israelites entered the land of Canaan, the Amorites had by conquest got great part of the countries belonging to the Ammonites and Moabites. This Moses retook from the Amorites, and divided between the tribes of Gad and Reuben. In the time of Jephtha, the Ammonites declared war against the Israelites (Judg. xii.), under pretence that they detained a great part of the country which had formerly been theirs before the Amorites possessed it. Jephtha declared, that as this was an acquisition which the Israelites had made in a just war, and what they had taken from the Amorites, who had long enjoyed it by right of conquest, he was under no obligation to restore it. The Ammonites were not satisfied with this reason; wherefore Jephtha gave them battle and defeated them. The Ammonites and Moabites generally united whenever there was any design set about of attacking the Israelites. After the death of Othniel (id. iii.), the Ammonites and Amalekites joined with Eglon king of Moab to oppress the Hebrews; whom they subdued, and governed for the space of 18 years, till they were delivered by Ehud the son of Gera, who slew Eglon king of Moab. Some time after this, the Ammonites made war against the Israelites, and greatly distressed them. But these were at last delivered by the hands of Jephtha; who having attacked the Ammonites, made a very great slaughter among them (chap. xi.) In the beginning of Saul's reign (1 Sam. xi.), Nahshon king of the Ammonites having sat down before Jabesh-gilead, reduced the inhabitants to the extremity of demanding a capitulation. Nahshon answered, that he would capitulate with them upon no other conditions than their submitting to have every one his right eye plucked out, that so they might be made a reproach to Israel: but Saul coming seasonably to the relief of Jabesh, delivered the city and people from the barbarity of the king of the Ammonites. David had been the king of Ammon's friend; and after the death of this prince, he sent ambassadors to make his compliments of condolence to Hanun his son and successor; who, imagining that David's ambassadors were come as spies to observe his strength, and the condition of his kingdom, treated them in a very injurious manner (2 Sam. x. 4.) David revenged this indignity thrown upon his ambassadors, by subduing the Ammonites, the Moabites, and the Syrians their allies. Ammon and Moab continued under the obedience of the kings David and Solomon; and, after the separation of the ten tribes, were subject to the kings of Israel till the death of Ahaz in the year of the world 3157. Two Ammonites years after the death of Ahaz, Jehoram his son, and successor of Ahaziah, defeated the Moabites (2 Kings iii.); but it does not appear that this victory was so complete as to reduce them to his obedience. At the same time, the Ammonites, Moabites, and other people, made an irruption into the lands belonging to Judah; but were forced back and routed by Jehoshaphat (2 Ch. xx., 2.) After the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, were carried into captivity by Tiglath-pileser in the year 3264, the Ammonites and Moabites took possession of the cities belonging to these tribes. Jeremiah (xlix. i.) reproaches them for it. The ambassadors of the Ammonites were some of those to whom this prophet (chap. xxvii. 2—4.) presented the cup of the Lord's fury, and directed to make bonds and yokes for themselves; exhorting them to submit themselves to Nebuchadnezzar, and threatening them, if they did not, with captivity and slavery. Ezekiel (xxv. 4—10.) denounces their entire destruction; and tells them that God would give them up to the people of the east, who should set their palaces in their country, so that there should be no more mention of the Ammonites among the nations. It is believed that these misfortunes happened to the Ammonites in the fifth year after the taking of Jerusalem, when Nebuchadnezzar made war against all the people that dwelt upon the confines of Judea, in the year of the world 3420.\n\nIt is also thought probable, that Cyrus gave the Ammonites and Moabites the liberty of returning into their own country, from whence they had been removed by Nebuchadnezzar: for we see them in the place of their former settlement, exposed to those revolutions which were common to the people of Syria and Palestine; subject sometimes to the kings of Egypt, and at other times to the kings of Syria. We are told by Polybius, that Antiochus the Great took Rabbath, or Philadelphia, their capital, demolished the walls, and put a garrison in it in 3806. During the persecutions of Antiochus Epiphanes, Josephus informs, that the Ammonites showed their hatred to the Jews, and exercised great cruelties against such of them as lived about their country. Justin Martyr says, That in his time there were still many Ammonites remaining; but Origen affirms us, that when he was living they were known only under the general name of Arubians. Thus was the prediction of Ezekiel (xxv. 4.) accomplished; who said that the Ammonites should be destroyed in such a manner as not to be remembered among the nations.\n\nAMMONITIS, in Ancient Geography, a country of Arabia Petraea, occupied by the children of Ammon, whence the appellation. Its limits partly to the west and partly to the north were the river Jabbok, whose course is nowhere determined; though Josephus says, that it runs between Rabbath-Ammon, or Philadelphia, and Gerara, and falls into the Jordan.\n\nAMMONIUS, surnamed SACCAS, was born in Alexandria, and flourished about the beginning of the third century. He was one of the most celebrated philosophers of his age; and, adopting with alterations the Ecclectic philosophy, laid the foundations of that sect which was distinguished by the name of the New Platonics. See Eclectics and Platonism.\nThis learned man was born of Christian parents, and educated in their religion; the outward profession of which, it is said, he never entirely deserted. As his genius was vast and comprehensive, so were his projects bold and singular: For he attempted a general coalition of all sects, whether philosophical or religious, by framing a system of doctrines which he imagined calculated to unite them all, the Christians not excepted, in the most perfect harmony. In pursuance of this design, he maintained, that the great principles of all philosophical and religious truth were to be found equally in all sects; that they differed from each other only in their method of expressing them, and in some opinions of little or no importance; and that, by a proper interpretation of their respective sentiments, they might easily be united into one body. Accordingly, all the Gentile religions, and even the Christian, were to be illuminated and explained by the principles of this universal philosophy; and the fables of the priests were to be removed from Paganism, and the comments and interpretations of the disciples of Jesus from Christianity. In conformity to this plan, he insisted, that all the religious systems of all nations should be restored to their original purity, and reduced to their primitive standard, viz., the ancient philosophy of the east, preserved uncorrupted by Plato: and he affirmed, that this project was agreeable to the intentions of Jesus Christ; whose sole view in defending upon earth was to fetter bounds to the reigning superstition, to remove the errors that had blended themselves with the religions of all nations, but not to abolish the ancient theology from which they were derived. He therefore adopted the doctrines which were received in Egypt concerning the universe and the Deity, considered as constituting one great whole; concerning the eternity of the world, the nature of souls, the empire of Providence, and the government of the world by demons. He also established a system of moral discipline; which allowed the people in general to live according to the laws of their country and the dictates of nature; but required the wise to exalt their minds by contemplation, and to mortify the body, so that they might be capable of enjoying the presence and affluence of the demons, and of ascending after death to the presence of the Supreme Parent. In order to reconcile the popular religions, and particularly the Christian, with this new system, he made the whole history of the Heathen gods an allegory; maintaining that they were only celestial ministers, entitled to an inferior kind of worship. And he acknowledged that Jesus Christ was an excellent man, and the friend of God; but alleged that it was not his design entirely to abolish the worship of demons, and that his only intention was to purify the ancient religion. This system, though plausible in its first view, but too comprehensive and complying in its progress, has been the source of innumerable errors and corruptions in the Christian church. At its first establishment it is said to have had the approbation of Athenagoras Pantanensis, and Clemens the Alexandrian, and of all who had the care of the public school belonging to the Christians at Alexandria. It was afterwards adopted by Longinus the celebrated author of the treatise on the Sublime, Plotinus, Herennius, Origen, Porphyry, Iamblichus the disciple of Porphyry, Sopater, Edipius, Eustathius, Maximus of Ephesus, Priscus, Chrysanthius the master of Julian, Julian the Apostate, Hierocles, Proclus, and many others both Pagans and Christians.\n\nThe above opinions of Ammonius are collected from the writings and disputations of his disciples the modern Platonists: for he himself left nothing in writing behind him; nay, he imposed a law upon his disciples not to divulge his doctrines among the multitude; which injunction, however, they made no scruple to neglect and violate.\n\nAMMUNITION, a general name for all warlike provisions; but more particularly powder, ball, &c.

From his childhood he laboured under the infirmity of extreme deafness, which led him to amuse himself in the want of society, by studying geometry and mechanics. He learned designing and surveying, and was employed in many public works. He presented to the Academy of Sciences, in the year 1687, an hygrometer upon a new construction, which was highly approved. In 1695, he published, in French, a treatise, entitled \"Observations on a new Hour-Glass, and Barometers, Thermometers, and Hygrometers.\" This work was dedicated to the Academy of Sciences, of which he became a member in the year 1699. Upon his admission, he read a paper on friction, in which a new theory upon that subject is proposed: the paper will be found in the memoirs of the academy. He discovered a method of conveying intelligence speedily to a great distance by means of signals, from one person to another, placed at as great a distance as they could be seen by means of telephones: he may therefore be esteemed the inventor of the telegraph. This ingenious man, who was distinguished for his ingenuity in inventing, and his accuracy in executing experiments, died in the year 1705.

To this island criminals were banished. It was famous for a fine flax called Emorigis.\n\nAMORITES, a people descended from Amoræus, according to the Septuagint and Vulgate; E-moræus, according to other expositors; Hæmorï, according to the Hebrew; or Emorite, according to our version of the Bible; who was the fourth son of Canaan, Gen. x. 16.\n\nThe Amorites first of all peopled the mountains lying to the west of the Dead sea. They had likewise establishments to the east of the same sea, between the brooks of Jabbok and Arnon, from whence they formed the Ammonites and Moabites, Numb. xiii. 30. xvi. 29. Joh. v. 1. and Judges xi. 19. 20. Moles made a conquest of this country from their kings Sihon and Og, in the year of the world 2553.\n\nThe prophet Amos (ii. 9.), speaking of the gigantic stature and valour of the Amorites, compares their height with that of cedars, and their strength with that of an oak. The name Amorite is often taken in Scripture for all Canaanites in general. The lands which the Amorites possessed on this side Jordan were given to the tribe of Judah, and those which they had enjoyed beyond this river were distributed between the tribes of Reuben and Gad.\n\nAMORIUM, a town of Phrygia Major, near the river Sangarius, on the borders of Galatia.—It was taken from the Romans by the Saracens in 668; but soon after retaken by the Romans. A war breaking out again between these two nations in 837, the Roman emperor Theophilus destroyed Sozopetra the birthplace of the caliph Al' Motafem, notwithstanding his earnest entreaties to him to spare it. This enraged the caliph, that he ordered every one to engrave upon his shield the word Amorium, the birthplace of Theophilus, which he resolved at all events to destroy. Accordingly he laid siege to the place, but met with a vigorous resistance. At length, after a siege of 55 days, it was betrayed by one of the inhabitants who had abjured the Christian religion. The caliph, exasperated at the loss he had sustained during the siege, put most of the men to the sword, carried the women and children into captivity, and levelled the city with the ground. His forces being distressed for want of water on their return home, the Christian prisoners rode upon some of them, and murdered them; upon which the caliph put 6000 of the prisoners to death. According to the eastern historians, 30,000 of the inhabitants of Amorium were slain, and as many carried into captivity.\n\nAMORPHA, FALSE INDIGO. See Botany Index.\n\nAMORTIZATION, in Law, the alienation of lands or tenements to a corporation or fraternity and their successors. See Mortmain.\n\nAMOS, the fourth of the small prophets, who in his youth had been a herdman in Tekoa, a small town about four leagues southward of Jerusalem, was sent to the king of Bashan, that is, to the people of Samaria, or the kingdom of Israel, to bring them back to repentance and an amendment of their lives; whence it is thought probable that he was born within the territories of Israel, and only retired to Tekoa on his being driven from Bethel, by Amaziah the priest of the golden calves at Bethel.\n\nThe prophet being thus retired to Tekoa, in the kingdom of Judah, continued to prophesy. He complains in many places of the violence offered him, by endeavouring to oblige him to silence. He boldly remonstrates against the crying sins that prevailed among the Israelites, as idolatry, oppression, wantonness, and obstinacy. He likewise reproves those of Judah, such as their carnal security, sensuality, and injustice. He terrifies them both with frequent threatenings, and pronounces that their sins will at last end in the ruin of Judah and Israel, which he illustrates by the visions of a plumb-line and a basket of summer-fruit. It is observable in this prophecy, that as it begins with denunciation of judgment and destruction against the Syrians, Philistines, Tyrians, and other enemies of the Jews, so it concludes with comfortable promises of restoring the tabernacle of David, and erecting the kingdom of Christ. Amos was chosen to the prophetic office in the time of Uzziah king of Judah, and Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake (Amos i. 1.), which happened in the 24th or 25th year of Uzziah, according to the rabbins and most of the modern commentators; or the year of the world 3219, when this prince usurped the priest's office, and attempted to offer incense to the Lord: but it is observed, that this cannot be the case, because Jotham the son of Uzziah, who was born in 3221, was of age to govern, and consequently was between 15 and 20 years of age, when his father undertook to offer incense, and was struck with a leprosy.\n\nThe first of the prophecies of Amos, in order of time, are those of 7th chapter: the rest he pronounced in the town of Tekoa, whither he retired. He foretold the misfortunes which the kingdom of Israel should fall into after the death of Jeroboam II, who was then living; he foretold the death of Zechariah, the invasion of the lands belonging to Israel by Pul and Tiglath Pilnefer kings of Assyria; and he speaks of the captivity of the ten tribes, and their return.\n\nThe time and manner of this prophet's death are not known. Some old authors relate that Amaziah, priest of Bethel, provoked by the discourses of the prophet, had his teeth broken, in order to silence him. Others say, that Hosea or Uzziah, the son of Amaziah, struck him with a stake upon the temples, knocked him down, and wounded him much; in which condition he was carried to Tekoa, where he died, and was buried with his fathers; but it is generally thought that he prophesied a long time at Tekoa, after the adventure which he had with Amaziah; and the prophet himself taking no notice of the ill treat-\nment which he is said to have received, is an argument that he did not suffer in the manner they relate.\n\nSt Jerome observes, that there is nothing great or sublime in the style of Amos. He applies the words of St. Paul (2 Cor. vi. 6.) to him, 'rude in speech though not in knowledge.' And he farther observes, that he borrows his comparisons from the flate and profession to which he belonged.\n\nAMOY, an island in the province of Fokien, in China, where the English had a factory: but they have abandoned it on account of the impositions of the inhabitants.

It does not effervescence with acids. The amphilites, though much inferior to jet in many respects, is yet a very beautiful fossil; and, for a body of so compact a structure, remarkably light. Examined by the microscope, it appears composed of innumerable very small and thin plates, laid closely and firmly on one another; and full of very small specks of a blacker and more shining matter than the rest, which is evidently a purer bitumen than the general mass. These specks are equally diffused over the different parts of the masses. There is a large quarry of it near Alençon in France. It is dug in many parts of England, but the finest is in Lancashire and Cheshire; it lies usually at considerable depths. It makes a very brisk fire, flaming violently for a short time, and after that continuing red and glowing hot a long while; and finally is reduced into a small proportion of gray ashes, the greater part of its substance having flown off in the burning.—It is capable of a very high and elegant polish; and in the countries where it is produced, is turned into a vast number of toys, as snuff-boxes and the like, which bear all the nicety of turning, and are made to pass for jet. Husbandmen smear their vines with it, as it kills the vermin which infests them. It is likewise used for the dying of hair black. In medicine, it is reputed good in colics, against worms, and of being in general an emollient and diuretic; but the present practice takes no notice of it.\n\nAMPELUSIA, in Ancient Geography, a promontory of Mauritania Tingitana, called Cotes by the natives, which is of the same signification with a town of the same name not far from the river Lixus, near the straits of Gibraltar; now Cape Spartel.

He was believed to excel in divining by dreams, and is said to be the first who divined by fire. Amphiarus knowing, by the spirit of prophecy, that he should lose his life in the war against Thebes, hid himself in order to avoid engaging in that expedition: but his wife Erigyle, being prevailed upon by a present, discovered the place in which he had concealed himself; so that he was obliged to accompany the Amphiarus princes who marched against Thebes. This proved fatal to him; for the earth being split asunder by a thunderbolt, both he and his chariot were swallowed up in the opening. Amphiarus, after his death, was ranked among the gods; temples were dedicated to him; and his oracle, as well as the spots instituted to his honour, were very famous.\n\nAMPHIARTHROSIS, in Anatomy, a term for such junctures of bones as have an evident motion, but different from the diarthrosis, &c. See DIARTHRO-\n\nAMPHIBIA, in Zoology, the name of Linnaeus's third class of animals; including all those which live partly in water and partly on land. This class he subdivides into four orders, viz. the amphibia reptiles; the amphibia serpentes; the amphibia nantes; and the amphibia meantes.\n\nIt has been a question whether the animals commonly called amphibious, live most in the water or on land. If we consider the words ἀμφίβιον (amphibion, both ways), and βίος (vita, life), from which the term amphibious is derived; we should understand, that animals, having this title, should be capable of living as well by land, or in the air, as by water; or of dwelling in either constantly at will: but it will be difficult to find any animal that can fulfill this definition, as being equally qualified for either. An ingenious naturalist *, therefore, * Dr. Parkinson considering their economy respectively, divides them into two orders, viz. 1. Such as enjoy their chief functions by land, but occasionally go into the water. Royal Society go ashore. What he advances on this subject is curious, and well illustrates the nature of this class.\n\n1. Of the first order, he particularly considers the phocae; and endeavours to show, that none of them can live chiefly in the water, but that their chief enjoyment of the functions of life is on shore.\n\nThese animals (he observes) are really quadrupeds; but, as their chief food is fish, they are under a necessity of going out to sea to hunt their prey, and to great distances from shore; taking care that, however great the distance, rocks or small islands are at hand, as resting places when they are tired, or when their bodies become too much macerated in the water; and they return to the places of their usual resort to sleep, copulate, and bring forth their young, for the following reasons, viz. It is well known, that the only essential difference (as to the general structure of the heart) between amphibious and mere land animals, or such as never go into the water, is, that in the former the oval hole remains always open. Now, in such as are without this hole, if they were to be immersed in water for but a little time, respiration would cease, and the animal must die; because a great part of the mass of blood passes from the heart by the pulmonary artery through the lungs, and by the pulmonary veins returns to the heart, while the aorta is carrying the greater part of the mass to the head and extremities, &c.\n\nNow, the blood passes through the lungs in a continual uninterrupted stream, while respiration is gentle and moderate: but when it is violent, then the circulation is interrupted, for inspiration and expiration are now carried to their extent; and in this state the blood cannot pass through the lungs either during the total inspiration\nAmphibia inspiration or total expiration of the air in breathing; for, in the former case, the inhalation compresses the returning veins; and in the latter, by the collapse of the lungs, these veins are interrupted also; so that it is only between these two violent actions that the blood can pass; and hence it is, that the lives of animals are shortened, and their health impaired, when they are subjected to frequent violent respiration; and thus it is, that when animals have once breathed, they must continue to respire ever after, for life is at an end when that ceases.\n\nThere are three necessary and principal uses of respiration in all land animals, and in those kinds that are counted amphibious. The first is that of promoting the circulation of the blood through the whole body and extremities. In real fishes, the force of the heart is alone capable of sending the blood to every part, as they are not furnished with limbs or extremities; but in the others mentioned, being all furnished with extremities, respiration is an assistant force to the arteries in sending blood to the extremities; which, being so remote from the heart, have need of such assistance, otherwise the circulation would be very languid in these parts: thus we see, that in persons subject to asthmatic complaints, the circulation grows languid, the legs grow cold and edematous, and other parts suffer by the defect in respiration.—A second use of breathing is, that in respiration, the variety of particles, of different qualities, which float always in the air, might be drawn into the lungs, to be infused into the mass of blood, being highly necessary to temperate and cool the agitated mass, and to contribute refined palatum to the finer parts of it, which, meeting with the daily supply of chyle, serves to assimilate and more intimately mix the mass, and render its constitution the fitter for supporting the life of the animal. Therefore it is, that valetudinarians, by changing foul or unwholesome air for a free, good, open air, often recover from lingering diseases.—A third principal use of respiration is, to promote the exhibition of voice in animals: which all those that live on the land do according to their specific natures.\n\nFrom these considerations it appears, that the phoca of every kind are under an absolute necessity of making the land their principal residence. But there is another very convincing argument why they reside on shore the greatest part of their time: namely, that the flesh of these creatures is analogous to that of other land animals; and therefore, by over long maceration, added to the fatigue of their chasing their prey, they would suffer such a relaxation as would destroy them. It is well known, that animals which have lain long under water are reduced to a very lax and even putrid state; and the phoca must bask in the air on shore: for while the solids are at rest, they acquire their former degree of tension, and the vigour of the animal is restored: and while he has an uninterrupted placid respiration, his blood is refreshed by the new supply of air, as explained above, and he is rendered fit for his next cruise: for action wastes the most exalted fluids of the body, more or less, according to its duration and violence; and the restorative rest must continue a longer or shorter time, according to the quantity of the previous fatigue.\n\nLet us now examine by what power these animals are capable of remaining longer under water than land Amphibia animals.\n\nAll these have the oval hole open between the right and left auricles of the heart; and, in many, the canalis arteriosus also: and while the phoca remains under water, which he may continue an hour or two more or less, his respiration is stopped; and the blood, not finding the passage through the pulmonary artery free, rushes through the hole from the right to the left auricle, and partly through the arterial canal, being a short passage to the aorta; and thence to every part of the body, maintaining the circulation: but, upon rising to come ashore, the blood finds its passage again through the lungs the moment he respites.\n\nThus the fetus in utero, during its confinement, having the lungs compressed, and consequently the pulmonary arteries and veins impervious, has the circulation of the blood carried on through the oval hole and the arterial canal. Now, so far the phoca in the water, and the fetus in utero, are analogous; but they differ in other material circumstances. One is, that the fetus having never respired, remains sufficiently nourished by the maternal blood circulating through him, and continues to grow till the time of his birth, without any want of respiration during nine months confinement: the phoca, having respired the moment of his birth, cannot live very long without it, for the restors given before; and this hole and canal would be closed in them, as it is in land animals, if the dam did not, soon after the birth of the cub, carry him to very frequently into the water to teach him; by which practice these passages are kept open during life, otherwise they would not be capable of attaining the food designed for them by Providence.\n\nAnother difference is, that the phoca, as was said before, would be relaxed by maceration in remaining too long in the water; whereas the fetus in utero suffers no injury from continuing its full number of months in the fluid it swims in: the reason is, that water is a powerful solvent, and penetrates the pores of the skins of land animals, and in time can dissolve them; whereas the liquor amnii is an infipid loft fluid, impregnated with particles more or less mucilaginous, and utterly incapable of making the least alteration in the cutis of the fetus.\n\nOtters, beavers, and some kinds of rats, go occasionally into the water for their prey, but cannot remain very long under water. \"I have often gone to shoot otters (says our author), and watched all their motions; I have seen one of them go softly from a bank into the river, and dive down; and in about two minutes rise at 10 or 15 yards from the place he went in, with a middling salmon in his mouth, which he brought on shore: I shot him, and saved the fish whole.\" Now as all fetuses have these passages open, if a whelp of a true water spaniel was immediately after its birth, served as the phoca does her cubs, and immersed in water, to stop respiration for a little time every day, it is probable that the hole and canal would be kept open, and the dog be made capable of remaining as long under water as the phoca.\n\nFrogs, how capable forever of remaining in the water, yet cannot avoid living on land, for they respire; and if a frog be thrown into a river, he makes to the shore as fast as he can.\nThe lizard kind, such as may be called water-lizards (ee Lacerta), are all obliged to come to land, in order to deposit their eggs, to rest, and to sleep. Even the crocodiles, who dwell much in rivers, sleep and lay their eggs on shore; and, while in the water are compelled to rise to the surface to breathe; yet, from the texture of his scaly covering, he is capable of remaining in the water longer by far than any species of the phoca, whose skin is analogous to that of a horse or cow.\n\nThe hippopotamus, who wades into the lakes or rivers, is a quadruped, and remains under the water a considerable time; yet his chief residence is upon land, and he must come on shore for respiration.\n\nThe testudo, or sea-tortoise, though he goes out to sea and is often found far from land; yet being a respiring animal, cannot remain long under water. He has indeed a power of rendering himself specifically heavier or lighter than the water, and therefore can let himself down to avoid an enemy or a storm: yet he is under a necessity of rising frequently to breathe, for reasons given before; and in most usual situations, while at sea, is upon the surface of the water, feeding upon the various substances that float in great abundance everywhere about him; these animals sleep securely upon the surface, but not under water; and can remain longer at sea than any other of this class, except the crocodile, because as it is with the latter, his covering is not in danger of being too much macerated; yet they must go on shore to copulate and lay their eggs.\n\n2. The consideration of these is sufficient to inform us of the nature of the first order of the class of amphibious animals; let us now see what is to be said of the second in our division of them, which are such as chiefly inhabit the waters, but occasionally go on shore;\n\nThese are but of two kinds: the eels, and water serpents or snakes of every kind. It is their form that qualifies them for locomotion on land, and they know their way back to the water at will; for by their structure they have a strong peristaltic motion, by which they can go forward at a pretty good rate: whereas all other kinds of fish, whether vertical or horizontal, are incapable of a voluntary locomotion on shore; and therefore, as soon as such fish are brought out of the water, after having flounced a while, they lie motionless and soon die.\n\nLet us now examine into the reason why these vermicular fish, the eel and serpent kinds, can live a considerable time on land, and the vertical and horizontal kinds die almost immediately when taken out of the water: and, in this research, we shall come to know what analogy there is between land animals and those of the waters. All land animals have lungs, and can live no longer than while they are inflated by the ambient air, and alternately compelled for its expulsion; that is, while respiration is duly carried on, by a regular inspiration and expiration of air.\n\nIn like manner, the fish in general have, instead of lungs, gills or branchiae: and as in land animals the lungs have a large portion of the mass of blood circulating through them, which must be flopped if the air has not a free ingress and egress into and from them; so, in fish, there is a great number of blood vessels that pass through the branchiae, and a great portion of their blood circulates through them, which must in like manner be totally flopped, if the branchiae are not perpetually wet with water. So that, as the air is to the lungs in land animals a constant afflant to the circulation; so is the water to the branchiae of those of the rivers and seas: for when these are out of the water, the branchiae very soon grow crisp and dry, the blood vessels are shrunk, and the blood is obstructed in its passage; so, when the former are immersed in water, or otherwise prevented from having respiration, the circulation ceases, and the animal dies.\n\nAgain, as land animals would be destroyed by too much maceration in water; so fishes would, on the other hand, be ruined by too much evaporation: the latter being, from their general structure and constitution, made fit to bear, and live in, the water; the former, by their constitution and form, to breathe and dwell in the air.\n\nBut it may be asked, Why eels and water snakes are capable of living longer in the air than the other kinds of fish? This is answered, by considering the providential care of the great Creator for these and every one of his creatures: for since they were capable of locomotion by their form, which they need not be if they were never to go on shore, it seemed necessary that they should be rendered capable of living a considerable time on shore, otherwise their locomotion would be in vain.\n\nHow is this provided for? Why, in a most convenient manner; for this order of fishes have their branchiae well covered from the external drying air; they are also furnished with a slimy mucus, which hinders their becoming crisp and dry for many hours; and their very skins always emit a mucous liquor, which keeps them supple and moist for a long time: whereas the branchiae of other kinds of fish are much exposed to the air, and want the slimy matter to keep them moist. Now, if any of these, when brought out of the water, were laid in a vessel without water, they might be preserved alive a considerable time, by only keeping the gills and surface of the skin constantly wet, even without any water to swim in.\n\nIt has been advanced, that man may, by art, be rendered amphibious, and able to live under water as well as frogs. As the fetus lives in utero without air, and the circulation is there continued by means of the foramen ovale; by preserving the passage open, and the other parts in statu quo, after the birth, the same faculty would still continue. Now, the foramen, it is alleged, would be preserved in its open state, were people accustomed, from their infancy, to hold their breath a considerable time once a day, that the blood might be forced to resume its primitive passage, and prevent its drying up as it usually does. This conjecture seems, in some measure, supported by the practice of divers, who are taught from their childhood to hold their breath, and keep long under water, by which means the ancient channel is kept open.—A Calabrian monk at Madrid laid claim to this amphibious capacity, making an offer to the king of Spain, to continue twice twenty-four hours under water, without ever coming up to take breath. Kircher gives an account of a Sicilian, named the ffb Colas, who by a long habitute from his youth, had so accustomed himself to live in water, that his nature seemed to be quite altered; so that he lived rather after the manner of a fish than a man.\n\nAMPHIBOLE.\nAMPHIBOLOGY, in Grammar and Rhetoric, a term used to denote a phrase susceptible of two different interpretations. Amphibology arises from the order of the phrase, rather than from the ambiguous meaning of a word.\n\nOf this kind was that answer which Pyrrhus received from the oracle: *Ai te, Εακίδα, Ρομανός ωνερε ποσί;* where the amphibology consists in this, that the words *te* and *Romanos,* may either of them precede, or either of them follow, the words *posse vincere,* indifferently. See Oracle.\n\nThe English language usually speaks in a more natural manner, and is not capable of any amphibologies of this kind: nor is it so liable to amphibologies in the articles, as the French and most other modern tongues.\n\n**AMPHIBRACHYS,** in Greek and Latin Poetry, the name of a foot consisting of three syllables, whereof that in the middle is long, and the other two short; such are the words [ἀβίτη, ἀμάρα.]\n\n**AMPHICOME,** in Natural History, a kind of figured stone, of a round shape, but rugged, and befit with eminences, celebrated on account of its use in divination. The word is originally Greek, *ἀμφικομήν,* q. d. *utrinque comata,* or, \"hairy on all sides.\" This stone is also called *Erythros,* *Ερυθρός,* *Amatoria,* probably on account of its supposed power of creating love. The amphicome is mentioned by Democritus and Pliny. Mercatus takes it for the same with *lapis lambriacus,* of which he gives a figure.\n\n**AMPHICTYONS,** in Grecian Antiquity, an assembly composed of deputies from the different states of Greece; and resembling, in some measure, the diet of the German empire. Some suppose the word *Amphictyons* to be formed of *αὐτοῖς,* \"about,\" and *κύρων* or *κύρων,* in regard the inhabitants of the country round about met here in council; others, with more probability, from Amphictyon, son of Deucalion, whom they suppose to have been the founder of this assembly; though others will have Acrifius, king of the Argives, to have been the first who gave a form and laws to it.\n\nAuthors give different accounts of the number of the Amphictyons, as well as of the states who were entitled to have their representatives in this council. According to Strabo, Harpocration, and Suidas, they were twelve from their first institution, sent by the following cities and states; the Ionians, Dorians, Perhaebians, Boeotians, Magnesians, Achaeans, Phthians, Melians, Dolopians, Ænianians, Delphians, and Phocians. Æschines reckons no more than eleven: instead of the Achaeans, Ænianians, Delphians, and Dolopians, he only gives the Thebans, Octans, and Locrians. Lastly, Pausanias's list contains only ten viz. the Ionians, Dolopians, Thebans, Ænianians, Magnesians, Melians, Phthians, Dorians, Phocians, and Locrians.\n\nIn the time of Philip of Macedon, the Phocians were excluded the alliance, for having plundered the Delphian temple, and the Lacedemonians were admitted in their place; but the Phocians, 60 years after, having behaved gallantly against Brennus and his Gauls, were restored to their seat in the Amphictyonic council. Under Augustus, the city Nicopolis was admitted into the body; and to make room for it, the Magnesians, Melians, Phthians, and Ænianians, who till then had distinct voices, were ordered to be numbered with the Thebans, and to have only one common representative. Strabo speaks as if this council were extinct in the times of Augustus and Tiberius; but Pausanias, who lived many years after, under Antoninus Pius, affirms it remained entire in his time, and that the number of Amphictyons was then 30.\n\nThe members were of two kinds. Each city sent two deputies, under different denominations; one called *ἐπικομητής,* whose business seems to have been more immediately to inspect what related to sacrifices and ceremonies of religion; the other, *ἡγούμενος,* charged with hearing and deciding of causes and differences between private persons. Both had an equal right to deliberate and vote, in all that related to the common interests of Greece. The *hieromennon* was elected by lot, the *pylogoras* by plurality of voices.\n\nThough the Amphictyons were first instituted at Thermopylae, M. de Valois maintains, that their first place of residence was at Delphi; where, for some ages, the tranquillity of the times found them no other employment than that of being, if we may call it, church-wardens of the temple of Apollo. In aftertimes, the approach of armies frequently drove them to Thermopylae, where they took their station, to be nearer at hand to oppose the enemies progress, and orderly timely succour to the cities in danger. Their ordinary residence, however, was at Delphi.\n\nHere they decided all public differences and disputes between any of the cities of Greece; but before they entered on business, they jointly sacrificed an ox cut into small pieces, as a symbol of their union. Their determinations were received with the greatest veneration, and even held sacred and inviolable.\n\nThe Amphictyons, at their admission, took a solemn oath never to divest any city of its right of deputation; never to avert its running waters; and if any attempts of this kind were made by others, to make mortal war against them: more particularly, in case of any attempt to rob the temple of any of its ornaments, that they would employ hands, feet, tongue, their whole power, to revenge it.—This oath was backed with terrible imprecations against such as should violate it; e.g. If they meet all the vengeance of Apollo, Diana, Minerva, &c., their soil produce no fruit, their wives bring forth nothing but monsters, &c.\n\nThe stated terms of their meeting were in spring and autumn; the spring meeting was called *Ευρών Περίστασις,* that in autumn *Μηνομένη.* On extraordinary occasions, however, they met at any time of the year, or even continued sitting all the year round.\n\nPhilip of Macedon usurped the right of presiding in the assembly of the Amphictyons, and of first consulting the oracle which was called *Νεομενία.*\n\n**AMPHIDROMIA,** a feast celebrated by the ancients on the fifth day after the birth of a child.\n\n**AMPHIDRYON,** in Ecclesiastical Writers, denotes the veil or curtain which was drawn before the door of the *leona* in ancient churches.\n\n**AMPHILOCHIA,** in Ancient Geography, the territory of the city of Argos in Arcadia; *Amphilocheum,* (Thucydides); called *Amphiliachi* (from the people), in the lower age, (Stephanus.) A town also of Spain, in Galicia, built by Teucer, and denominated\nAMPHILCHUS, bishop of Iconium, in the fourth century, was the friend of St Gregory Nazianzen and St Basil. He assisted at the first general council of Constantinople in 381; presided at the council of Side; and was a strenuous opponent of the Arians. He died in 394; and his works were published in Greek and Latin at Paris in 1644, by Francis Combes.\n\nAMPHILCHUS, son of Amphiarus and Eriphyle, was a celebrated diviner. He had an altar erected to him at Athens, and an oracle at Mallus in Cilicia, which city was founded by him and Mopsus. The answers of this oracle were given by dreams; the party inquiring used to pass a night in the temple, and that night's dream was the answer. Dion Cassius mentions a picture done by order of Sextus Condianus, representing the answer he received from the oracle, in the reign of the emperor Commodus.\n\nAMPHIMACER, in Ancient Poetry, a foot consisting of three syllables, whereof the first and last are long, and that in the middle short; such is the word [callitás].\n\nAMPHION, son of Jupiter and Antiope; who, according to the poets, made the rocks follow his music; and at his harp the stones of Thebes danced into walls and a regular city.\n\nAMPHIPOLIS, in Antiquity, the principal magistrates of Syracuse. They were established by Timoleon in the 100th Olympiad, after the expulsion of the tyrant Dionysius. They governed Syracuse for the space of 300 years: and Diodorus Siculus affirms us, that they subsisted in his time.\n\nAMPHIPOLIS, in Ancient Geography, a city of Macedonia, an Athenian colony, on the Strymon, but on which side is not certain: Pliny places it in Macedonia, on this side; but Scylax, in Thrace, on the other. The name of the town, Amphipolis, however, seems to reconcile their difference; because, as Thucydides observes, it was washed on two sides by the Strymon, which dividing itself into two channels, the city stood in the middle, and on the side towards the sea there was a wall built from channel to channel. Its ancient name was Ennea Æda, the Nine ways (Thucydides, Herodotus.) The citizens were called Amphipolitans, (Livy). It was afterwards called Chrytopolis; now Chirnopolis, or Chirpolis, (Hollandius.)\n\nAMPHIPOLIS, in Ancient Geography, a town of Syria, on the Euphrates, built by Seleucus, called by the Syrians Turmeda, (Stephanus): the same with Thapsacus, (Pliny); and supposed to have been only renewed and adorned by Seleucus, because long famous before his time, (Xenophon.)\n\nAMPHIPPITI, in Grecian Antiquity, soldiers who, in war, used two horses without saddles, and were dexterous enough to leap from one to the other.\n\nAMPHIPRORÆ, in the naval affairs of the ancients, vessels with a prow at each end. They were used chiefly in rapid rivers and narrow channels, where it was not easy to tack about.\n\nAMPHIPROSTYLE, in the architecture of the ancients, a temple which had four columns in the front, and as many in the apse behind.\n\nAMPHISBENA. See Ophiology Index.\n\nAMPHISBENA Aquatica. See Gordius, Helminthology Index.\n\nAMPHISCII, among Geographers, a name applied to the people who inhabit the torrid zone. The Amphiscii, as the word imports, have their shadows one part of the year towards the north, and the other towards the south, according to the sun's place in the ecliptic. They are also called Afei. See Asci.\n\nAMPHISSA, in Ancient Geography, the capital of the Locri Oxolae, 120 stadia (or 15 miles) to the west of Delphi, (Pausanias.) So called, because surrounded on all sides by mountains, (Stephanus.) Hence Amphissi, the inhabitants; who plundered the temple at Delphi (Demosthenes.)—Also a town of Magna Graecia, at the mouth of the Sagra, on the coast of the Farther Calabria, situated between Locri and Caulonia; now called Roccella. Amphissus the epithet, (Ovid.)\n\nAMPHITHEATRE, in Ancient Architecture, a building of an elliptical form, of two or more stories of open arcades, with a number of interior galleries and arched passages, which served both as a communication and support to several rows of seats which rose above each other, and were arranged round a large space called the arena. The derivation of the word amphitheatre, indicates that it is a place where the spectators, circuitously arranged, saw the performance equally well on all sides.\n\nThe history of amphitheatres is of considerable importance, in consequence of its connexion with ancient manners. These structures owed their origin to the barbarity of the ancients, and their ruin to the humanity of the moderns. They are the production of Roman invention in the last ages of the republic. The ferocious disposition of the Romans was inmoderately fond of every species of amusement; but especially that which was of a bloody and horrible nature. The political rulers improved this general feature in the Roman character, to rouse and foster that martial spirit which rendered them masters of the world. After the Samnite war had extended the Roman sceptre over Etruria and the whole peninsula of Italy, the first gladiatorial conflicts were exhibited in Rome in the year of the city 490. Lucius Metellus brought into the circus the elephants which were part of the spoil of the Carthaginians, in the year 502, and this proved the introduction of wild beasts into the spectacles of Rome. This addition was equally agreeable to the Roman taste; and those who counted the popular favour, vied with each other in entertaining the people in this barbarous manner. This soon gave birth to a profession of men denominated gladiators, who were trained to the combat, and for reward slaughtered one another in the forum, whilst every devouring animal which the wilds of Asia or Africa produced, added to the horrid scene.\n\nIn the days of Pompey and Caesar these barbarous amusements were given with an astonishing profusion. In these games given by Pompey, the elephants attempted to break down the barrier between them and the people, and the situation of the circus prevented the people from seeing equally well: this induced Caesar to alter the original form, and construct edifices where the populace might be entertained without danger or interruption. Amphitheatres were suited\nto this purpose; therefore they were adopted, and became the common place for the exhibitions both of gladiators and wild beasts.\n\nIt is supposed, that the first amphitheatre was composed of those singular machines, formed by Caius Curio; for the games which Caesar presented among the funeral honours of his father. In a semicircular form Caius made two large theatres, and opposed their backs to each other: and, having amused the people in these the one half of the day, then they wheeled round, forming one spacious theatre where the gladiators contended during the remainder of the day. Pliny is the only one who makes mention of this amphitheatre; and from his account it is difficult to ascertain whether this was the first idea of an amphitheatre, or whether the previous sight of one had suggested this huge and wonderful structure. It is reported, that Julius Caesar, a few years after, formed a hunting theatre of wood; and, in consequence of the circular position of the seats, it obtained the name of an amphitheatre. This appears to have been of very superior kind and in great estimation.\n\nIn the reign of Augustus, Statilius Taurus erected one of stone, but it seems to have been seldom used; and, from its being consumed by fire in the time of Nero, it is evident that it was not wholly of stone. These wooden buildings appear to have been temporary, and a few of them permanent from the embellishment conferred upon them. The politic spirit of Augustus induced him to erect several of these, and Caligula began one, which he left unfinished. Nero formed a large and spacious one, which is said to have been a year in building. Herod of Judea erected amphitheatres both in Jerusalem and in Caesarea. During the reign of Tiberius, one was built at Fidenae, which Tacitus informs us fell while the games were performing, and slew or hurt about 50,000 persons. There was another at Placentia, reported to have been the most spacious in Italy; but it was destroyed by fire in the contest between Vitellius and Otho.\n\nThe unfortunate accidents, which happened to these wooden buildings, led the public to construct others of a more durable and stronger nature, where the crowd might be entertained without danger. This honour was referred to Vespasian and Titus. In his eighth consulate, the former began the Flavian amphitheatre, which the latter finished during his reign. It is said, that the expense of this building would have erected a capital city, and it is deservedly esteemed one of the most celebrated edifices of ancient times. Dio says, that 9000 wild beasts were destroyed at the dedication of this huge building, but Eutropius restricts their number to 5000. After the hunting of these ferocious animals was ended, instantly the arena was filled with water, and sea animals were made to contend, and a sea-fight exhibited. This immense building obtained the appellation of the Colosseum. See Plate XX. fig. 1.\n\nThis amphitheatre became the model of other amphitheatres throughout the empire. Compared with the original model, these were merely natural valleys, with seats formed in the surrounding heights similar to the amphitheatre at Corinth. On the declivity of two hills seats of stone were sometimes placed, and the extremes formed by regular works of stone.\n\nOf this kind was that of Gortyna in Candia. One in the vicinity of Sandwich in Kent had its benches formed of turf; and similar must have been those amphitheatres, which were formed along with the camps and military stations of the Roman soldiers.\n\nWhen Christianity became the religion of the empire, it meliorated the dispositions of the Romans, and induced them to lay aside this barbarous custom. Constantine the Great terminated the gladiatorial combats in the east during his reign; but they were not finally abolished at Rome until the beginning of the fifth century, in the reign of Honorius. The combats of wild beasts continued, however, some time longer; but during the progress of the fifth century these gradually declined, until they were finally abolished, and the amphitheatres were abandoned to the ravages of time and accident. During the middle ages they were sometimes employed for judicial conflicts, tilts, and tournaments; but these practices having been discontinued, the amphitheatres experienced universal neglect and ruin.\n\nIt is very difficult to give an accurate description of Construct an amphitheatre. It is scarcely possible to give a clear idea of the manner in which such immense crowds of people were seated and arranged, and how they had a convenient entrance and a returning. It has already been mentioned, that these buildings were circuitous, and that the exterior circuit was composed of two or more stories of arcades; and it may now be added, that the number of these stories varied according to the nature of the building. A corresponding number of arched passageways and staircases opened upon the ground floor towards these stories in the direction of radii towards the arena. These communications were again intersected by arched passageways which encircled the whole structure, and afforded an uninterrupted entrance to every part of the amphitheatre. Sometimes an intermediate gallery surrounded the whole in the centre of the fabric, and served as a common place of resort to all the stairs which led to the higher galleries. This was the form of one at Nîmes. Sometimes each staircase had its distinct communication by itself. Such was the case with one at Verona. See Plate XX. fig. 2.\n\nThe four radiating entries on the diameter were usually more capacious; and by the two principal of these the emperor, the senate, and other persons of distinction, were conducted to their seats on a place which was called the podium. The other two led to the arena, and by these the gladiators and beasts made their entrance. The various ranks of the people passed by the staircases, which led to their respective seats. The doors which opened from the staircases were called vomitories, and varied in magnitude, according to the extent of the amphitheatre, and the number of exterior arches. The number of seats between the several vomitories was unequal, and seems to have been subject to no positive regulation. These benches were about one foot and eight inches in height, and about two feet four inches in breadth. A platform four feet eight inches broad was formed of one of these benches, which served as a circular communication to the whole building. These obtained the name of prelusions, and the boundaries on the side were called belts. The latter were surmounted by balustrades, to protect the persons from falling who occupied\noccupied the benches in the vicinity. The podium was more spacious than the precincts, and was a platform encircling the arena. From one precinct to the belt of another, a flight of stairs two feet five inches in breadth defended opposite to every vomitory. Small canals were cut in the tops of the benches, by which the rain and urine were conducted from bench to bench, until they reached the instruments prepared to convey them to the drains below. These stairs radiated from the highest bench to the podium; so that, with the precincts, they separated the whole cavity into wedge-like divisions, which the people occupied according to their rank.\n\nThe amphitheatre called the Coliseum, was of an elliptical form, whose longest diameter was about 615 English feet six inches, and the shortest 510. The length of the diameter of the arena was about 281 feet, and the breadth 176, reserving a space for the seats and galleries of about 157 feet in breadth. The external circumference covered a superficiality of about five acres and a half, and could scarcely be included in a parallelogram of seven acres. Three stories of arcades, adorned with columns of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, and enclosed with a pilasterade of the Corinthian order, composed the external elevation. The first story rose about four feet from the ground, and the pavement supported the bases of the columns. The columns which supported the upper stories were placed upon pedestals. A flylobata supported the pilasterade, in which were the windows of an intermediate gallery, and in every second interpillar was a window to illuminate the highest gallery. A cantilever cornice, perforated with square holes, through which the erect pieces of wood palled that supported the awning to a range of corbels, about the centre of the pilasterade, crowned the building. These various columns, pilasters, and stories, appear to have been continued without interruption around the whole edifice. The height of the first story is about 33 feet six inches, the second about 39, and the third about 38; the pilasterade about 40; and the whole, including the blocking course and the steps, was about 164 feet in height.\n\nAn ellipsis of 80 open arches formed the exterior circuit of the ground plan; the piers, with three-quarter columns in front, of about two feet ten inches diameter. The four which corresponded to the four semi-diameters formerly mentioned, were about 14 feet two inches, and 76 of the arches were about 13 feet eight inches. These arches led to a large double corridor, that encircled the whole; this corridor is a magnificent and distinguishing feature in the Coliseum theatre. Square openings in the precipitation above, illuminated the interior corridor, and the corridor which was united with the wall of the podium appears to have been illuminated in a similar manner. A double corridor was seen on the floor of the second story directly above the corridor of the lower floor, and an interior corridor, which sent forth stairs leading to a range of vomitories on the one hand, and on the other hand an intermediate corridor which formed a mezzanine floor above the double corridor of the interior circuit. Here the stairs began to ascend to the next story, and square holes in the upper floor enlightened this gallery. A double corridor formed the third story, and it appears that here the stairs commenced that led to the galleries above. There were also some win- dows in the interior wall, and vomitories which opened to the uppermost cunei of benches. In a similar manner were other three stories constructed and filled above the whole, composing a most magnificent and spacious structure.\n\nJulius Lipfus supposes that this amphitheatre was capable of containing 87,000 spectators on the benches; and Fontana adds 22,000 for the galleries and other passages. Upon a fair calculation it appears, that if all was crowded, it might contain about 80,000. This magnificent structure certainly excelled both the monuments of Grecian and Egyptian genius which have reached our times. When this amphitheatre was in its glory, and crowded with Romans, the fight must have been magnificent and striking. If the report is accurate, that this was completed in two years and nine months, it affords an astonishing instance of Roman vigour and persevering industry. Besides former depredations, Michael Angelo removed near the one half of the external wall to build the Palazzo Farnese. To prevent these depredations, Pope Benedict XIV. consecrated these ruins, and erected several altars, which were much frequented on the Sundays and Fridays, before the revolution in France. To guard these relics, a hermit was stationed in a small dwelling near the centre.\n\nThe different kinds of amusement have already been Amuse-mentioned during the progress of the history. Gladiators contended together, or entered the lists with wild beasts. These wild animals were hunted or encountered, or left to devour each other, according to the humour of the times or the taste of him who gave the entertainment. It appears also, that criminals were sometimes forced to fight with these ferocious creatures for the entertainment of the people of Rome; and, in the dawn of Christianity, many of the Christians suffered death in this brutal manner. It is also reported, that artificial mountains were sometimes constructed with caves below, from whence these devouring animals rushed forth to attack their prey.\n\nInformation concerning the laws that regulated the amphitheatre is rather scanty; but the following are among the number. In the centre of one side of the podium was the emperor's seat, called the regium, and highly adorned. The remainder of the podium was occupied by senators; and when this space was not sufficient, several of the adjacent wedges were appropriated to the other senators and to persons of distinction. The equestrians, and the civil and military tribunes, had their places next assigned them. From this order both the liberti and the legati were excluded. The married men sat by themselves. The young men were also arranged by themselves, and their tutors sat near them to observe their conduct. The attendants and servants occupied the highest gallery. The veils were seated, and frequently the princesses and the ladies of distinguished rank sat along with them. The front of the gallery was assigned to the women, who were placed on chairs, and the lowest order of plebeians stood behind them. It appears also, that for the better accommodation of the people, the different tribes had particular wedges allotted to them. It is also proper to remark, that the arrangements in the different provinces, was different from that of Rome.\nAMP\n\nas circumstances varied. The general direction of the amphitheatre was under the care of an officer, named *villius amphitheatri*; and different officers who were called *locarii*, had the direction of the cunei. By carefully preventing any person from occupying a place to which he was not entitled, all confusion was prevented, and strict order maintained.\n\nThe means used by Pope Benedict to preserve the Coliseum at Rome, have already been mentioned. Of one which was erected at Verona, only four arches of the external circuit remained in the commencement of the eighteenth century. These consist of three stories of about 90 English feet. The whole building was erected without cement, and joined and secured by iron cramps, overlaid with lead. The whole superficies is about four acres and nearly one third. One has been erected at Nimes, which has suffered much dilapidation; but the remains are yet worthy of the attention of the traveller. In the year 1533, Francis I. gave orders to have the rubbish removed; but his misfortunes prevented this order from being carried into execution. Louis XVI. issued a similar order, but the work is not yet finished. This amphitheatre is said, by Governor Pownall, to be occupied with houses arranged in the form of streets, and resembles a small walled town. The galleries are converted into wretched dwellings, but the exterior gallery of the second story, and that of the attic, were in their original state.\n\nAt Pola in Istria, there are the remains of an amphitheatre built on the declivity of a hill. The whole of the exterior circuit was standing, except a few yards of the parapet, when Maife visited these remains. It was erected of stone, with cramps of iron; and all the benches and other parts constructed of wood, have been destroyed.\n\n**AMPHITHEATRE**, in Gardening, certain dispositions of trees and shrubs on the sides of hilly places, which, if the hill or rising be naturally of a circular figure, always have the best effect. They are to be formed of evergreens, such as hollies, phyllereys, lauriflumes, bays, and such plants, observing to plant the shortest growing trees in the front, and those which will be the tallest behind, such as pines, firs, cedars of Lebanon, &c.\n\nAmphitheatres are also sometimes formed of slopes on the sides of hills, covered only with turf; and, when well kept, they are a great ornament to large gardens.\n\n**AMPHITRITE**, (from *ἀμφιρρύνω, circumferendo*), in the Heathen Mythology, the wife of Neptune, and goddess of the sea, sometimes taken for the sea.\n\n**AMPHITRYON**, son of Alceus, and the father of Hercules, less known by his own exploits than from his wife Alcmena's adventure. See **ALCHEMA**.\n\n**AMPHORA**, in Antiquity, a liquid measure among the Greeks and Romans. The Roman amphora contained 48 sextaries, equal to about seven gallons one pint English wine measure; and the Grecian or Attic amphora contained one-third more.\n\n**AMPHORA** was also a dry measure used by the Romans, and contained about three bushels.\n\n**AMPHORA**, among the Venetians, is the largest measure used for liquids, containing about 16 quarts.\n\n**AMPHORARIUM VINUM**, in Antiquity, denotes that which is drawn or poured into *amphora* or pitchers; by way of distinction from *vinum doliare*, or cask wine.—The Romans had a method of keeping wine in *amphora* for many years to ripen, by fastening the lids tight down with pitch or gypsum, and placing them either in a situation within reach of smoke, or under ground.\n\n**AMPHOTIDES**, in Antiquity, a kind of armour or covering for the ears, worn by the ancient pupilles, to prevent their adversaries from laying hold of that part.\n\n**AMPHRYSUS**, or **AMPHYSSUS**, in Ancient Geography, a river of Phthiotis, a district of Thessaly, running by the foot of Mount Othrys, from south to north, into the Enipeus at Thebes of Thessaly; where Apollo fed the herds of King Admetus (Virgil, Lucan). Another Amphryssus in Phrygia, rendering women barren, according to Pliny: Hence the epithet *Amphryssacus* (Statius). Also a town of Phocis, at the foot of Mount Parnassus, encompassed with a double wall by the Thebans in the war with Philip (Pausanias): *Amphryssa Vates*, in Virgil, denotes the Sibyl.\n\n**AMPHTHILL**, a town of Bedfordshire in England, situated pleasantly between two hills, near the centre of the county, but in a barren soil. W. Long. o. 29. N. Lat. 52. 2.\n\n**AMPLIATION**, in a general sense, denotes the act of enlarging or extending the compass of a thing. On a medal of the emperor Antoninus Pius, we find the title *Ampliator orbium* given him, on account of his having extended the *jus civitatis*, or right of citizenship, to many states and people before excluded from that privilege. In effect, it is generally supposed to have been this prince that made the famous constitution, whereby all the subjects of the empire were made citizens of Rome.\n\n**AMPLIATION**, in Roman Antiquity, was the referring to past sentence in certain causes. This the judge did, by pronouncing the word *amplius*; or by writing the letters *N. L.* for *non liquet*; thereby signifying, that, as the cause was not clear, it would be necessary to bring further evidence.\n\n**AMPLIFICATION**, in Rhetoric, part of a discourse or speech, wherein a crime is aggravated, a praise or commendation heightened, or a narration enlarged, by an enumeration of circumstances; so as to excite the proper emotions in the souls of the auditors. Such is the pallage in Virgil, where, instead of saying merely that Turnus died, he amplifies the circumstances of his death:\n\n> *Aff illi folcuntur frigore membra,  \nVitaque cum gemitu fugit indignata sub umbra.*\n\nThe matters of eloquence make an amplification to be the soul of discourse. See **ORATORY**.\n\n**AMPLITUDE**, in Astronomy, an arch of the horizon intercepted between the east or west point and the centre of the sun, or a planet, at its rising or setting; and so is either north and south, or ortive and occative.\n\n**Magnetical Amplitude**, the different rising or setting of the sun from the east or west points of the compass. It is found by observing the sun, at his rising and setting, by an amplitude compass.\n\n**AMPSAGA**, a river of ancient Numidia.

The ancient poets imagined that this gulf led to hell. The Moffeta is thus described by Mr Swinburne: \"We were led into a narrow valley, extending a considerable way to the south-west, and pellucid on both sides by high ridges thickly covered with copes of oak. The bottom of the dell is bare and arid; in the lowest part, and close under one of the hills, is an oval pond of muddy ash-coloured water, not above 50 feet in diameter; it boils up in several places with great force in irregular fits, which are always preceded by a hissing sound. The water was several times spouted up as high as our heads in a diagonal direction, a whirlpool being formed round the tube, like a basin, to receive it as it fell. A large body of vapour is continually thrown out with a loud rumbling noise. The stones on the rising ground that hang over the pool are quite yellow, being stained with the fumes of sulphur and sal ammoniac. A most nauseous smell rising with the steam obliged us to watch the wind, and keep clear of it, to avoid suffocation. The water is quite infipid both as to taste and smell; the clay at the edges is white, and carried into Puglia to rub upon scabby sheep, on which account the lake is farmed out at 100 ducats a-year. On a hill above this lake stood formerly a temple dedicated to the goddess Mephitis; but I perceived no remains of it.\"\n\nAMPULLA, in Antiquity, a round big-bellied vessel which the ancients used in their baths, to contain oil for anointing their bodies; also the name of a cup for drinking out of at table.\n\nAMPULLA, among Ecclesiastical Writers, denotes one of the sacred vessels used at the altars. Ampullae were also used for holding the oil used in chrismation, consecration, coronation, &c. Among the ornaments of churches we find frequent mention made of ampuls or vials. In the inventory of the cathedral of Lincoln we meet with ampuls of crystal, variously enriched with silver feet and covers; one containing a tooth of St Christopher, another a tooth of St Cecily, another a bone of the head of St John Baptist.\n\nKnights of St AMPULLA, belong to an order instituted by Clovis I., king of France; at the coronation they bear up the canopy under which the ampulla is carried in procession.\n\nAMPURA, a province of the kingdom of Peru, before its conquest by the Spaniards. Here the inhabitants worshipped two lofty mountains from a principle of gratitude, because of the descent of the water from them by which their lands were fertilized. It is said to have been conquered by Virachocha the eighth inca.\n\nAMPURIAS, the capital of the territory of Ampurdan, in Catalonia, seated at the mouth of the river Fluvià, in E. Long. 2° 56'. N.

The kings who were in league with Amraphel worsted those of Pentapolis, plundered their city, and carried off abundance of captives, among whom was Lot, Abraham's nephew: but Abraham pursued them, retook Lot, and recovered all the spoil. See ABRAHAM.\n\nAMRAS, a strong castle of Germany, seated in Tirol; by some German writers called Arx Ambrosiana, which was a house of pleasure for the archdukes to retire in the heat of the summer. By others this fort is called Ombrasi; a name derived from the design of it, which was to be a shady summer house. It is most delightfully situated at the foot of a mountain, but has no great external beauty. All the furniture of ordinary use has been carried away; yet it is still remarkable for its galleries, which contain a very large collection of antiquities, and both natural and artificial curiosities. It excels all others in its curious collection of armour and coats of mail, many of which belonged to very great men. There is also a great collection of gold medals, which weigh, as they affirm, about 16 pounds; there are also 3000 cameos and intaglios, but few of them very fine. A great part of these antiquities were sent to this place by Charles V. On the walls and ceiling there are some very good paintings; and, among the rest, they have an admirable picture of Noah's ark, done by Baffano, for which the grand duke of Tuscany is said to have offered 100,000 crowns. They have a library, which is not in very good order; and a gallery full of busts and other pieces of antiquity, besides many other apartments adorned with pictures of great value. E. Long. 11° 45'. N. Lat. 47° 8'.\n\nAMRU-EBN-AL-AS, one of the most famous of the first race of Saracen leaders, was descended of Aas, of the tribe of Koreith, by a notorious prostitute. In his youth he indulged in poetry, and wrote satirical verses against the person and doctrine of Mahomet. His zeal in opposing the new religion prompted him to undertake an embassy to the king of Ethiopia, to stimulate him against the converts whom he had taken under his protection. It is uncertain by what arguments he was induced to change his religious sentiments; but he returned a convert to the Mahometan faith, and, along with Caled, joined the fugitive prophet at Medina. The military talents of Amru had begun to attract general attention when Abubeker resolved to make a new attack upon Syria, in which he obtained the chief command. After several displays of his military valour and address in some successful enterprises, he rose to the elevated station of chief in Irak, when Caled requested the attendance of all the Arabian generals before Damascus. During the caliphate of Omar, he also served in Palestine, under Abu Obeidah. While besieging Cesarea, he held a memorable conference with Constantine, the son of the emperor Heraclius. Historians mention that their time was chiefly occupied in producing genealogical arguments to prove the affinity of the Greeks and Arabs, and the consequent rights of the latter as their descendants. Amru concluded with the candid declaration, \"That the Arabians were tired of living\nin their scorching deserts, and were resolved to re-enter into the possession of the delightful country which was the inheritance of their forefathers.\" He withdrew from the conference, after denouncing perpetual enmity against the Greeks, unless they should either become converts to the Mahometan faith or tributaries to that government. In the year of the Hegira 17, A.D. 638, Amru took Cesarea, and reduced to subjection all the maritime towns of Syria.\n\nAfter the death of Obeidah, Amru assumed the chief command in Syria, in which he was confirmed by the caliph, notwithstanding the opposition of Othman. An expedition against Egypt being formerly resolved upon, Amru wrote to the caliph, informing him that he would instantly march into Egypt. During the progress of his march, attended only by 4000 Arabs, a messenger from Omar arrived with a letter, containing directions to return, if he should receive this letter in the territories of Syria; but if he should receive it in those of Egypt, he might advance, and all needful assistance would be instantly sent him. Anticipating the contents, he hastened on to the frontiers of Egypt, and there collecting his principal officers, he opened and read the instructions of the caliph. Then requesting some of the inhabitants to be brought before them, and enquiring at them in what country they were, and being informed that they were in Egypt, Amru replied, \"Let us, then, continue our march.\" Having taken Pharsa, he advanced to Mitrah, the ancient Memphis, and besieged it during the space of seven months. Although numerous reinforcements arrived, he would have found it very difficult to storm the place previous to the inundation of the Nile, if Mokawwas had not treacherously deserted the forces of the citadel, which was accordingly taken by storm; and the Greeks who remained there were either made prisoners or put to the sword. On the same spot Amru erected a city named Fostat, the ruins of which are now known by the name of Old Cairo. The Coptic Christians, who composed the great majority of the Egyptian natives, and who were enemies to the Catholic Greeks, after this victory submitted to Amru, and engaged to provide quarters and support for the Muslim army.\n\nAmru pursued the Greeks to Alexandria, and, after an obstinate and bloody siege of 14 months, the city was taken, A.D. 640. During the siege, the general, along with one of his officers and a slave, was taken prisoner, and brought before the governor, who was at that time ignorant of the value of his prisoner. The manner, however, in which the general at first conducted himself induced the governor to suppose that he was a person of rank, therefore he ordered him to be beheaded. This order would have immediately been carried into effect, had not the slave, who understood the Greek tongue, in which the command was given, fortunately chastised the imprudent language of Amru by giving him a box on the ear. This circumstance changed the mind of the governor, and obtained a repeal of his order. By an engagement to propose an accommodation, the captive officer obtained the release of all the three; and the acclamations of the army on the return of their general first informed the governor of his egregious mistake. Amru prevailed upon his soldiers to refrain from the pillage of Alexandria, and to content themselves with the preservation of the money, jewels, and other valuable articles, to defray the expense of the war. Amru was disposed to preserve the famous library, and to have given it in a present to John the grammarian, but, by the command of the caliph, he was obliged to commit it to the flames. If the relation is not exaggerated, such was the number of books in that famous library, that they afforded fuel to 5000 baths during the space of six months.\n\nThe capital being taken, all Egypt soon fell into the hands of the conqueror. Amru observed a wise and equitable policy, although his pecuniary demands were great. Egypt became the storehouse to fattening Arabia, and camels carrying provisions covered the whole road from Memphis to Medina. Amru also employed his army in opening the canal from the Nile to the Red Sea. The adjacent parts of Africa next felt the conquering power of Amru, but, upon the elevation of Othman, he was succeeded in the government of Egypt by Abdallah-ibn-Said. The inhabitants were so displeased with this change, that they formed a confederacy, and delivered up the city to a Grecian fleet. Amru was despatched in haste to retake Alexandria, which, after an obstinate defence, was taken with great slaughter. The general at length interpolating his authority, the slaughter was stopped, and upon the spot where the massacre ceased the Mosque of Mercy was erected. To prevent future rebellion, he dismantled the town, and was again succeeded by Abdallah; and he himself retired to Medina.\n\nWhen Ali ascended the throne, he became an adversary, and united himself to the interest of Moawiyah, whom he acknowledged caliph, and swore allegiance to him. Ali proposed to decide the quarrel by single combat, and the valour of Amru inclined him to urge his master to accept of the proposal; but Moawiyah positively declined the challenge. Amru, however, continued firm to the interest of Moawiyah, and took possession of Egypt in his name, having defeated the governor of Ali. About this time, he fortunately escaped assassination by the hands of the fanatic Charadites, who had marked him out as one of the three who, by their death, was to restore peace to the contending parties. The assassin waited his arrival at the mosque, but being prevented by a fit of the colic, his friend who was sent to officiate for him was slain in his stead.\n\nIn the year 663, of the Hegira 43, he died in his government of Egypt, highly esteemed, and much regretted by his countrymen. In a pathetic oration to his children on his deathbed, he bitterly lamented his youthful offence in satirizing the prophet, although Mahomet had forgiven the offence, and had frequently affirmed \"that there was no Muslim more sincere and steadfast in the faith than Amru.\" It is reported, that one day the caliph desired to see the sword of Amru, which had cut in pieces so many Christians. Amru drew his sword, which was a short and common scimitar; and when Omar manifested signs of unusual surprise, he exclaimed, \"Alas! the sword itself, without the arm of its master, is neither sharper nor more weighty than the sword of Pharaon the poet.\" The greatness of the man, the firmness of the friend, the valour of the general, the policy of the statesman, and\nAMSANCTI. See AMPSANCTI.\n\nAMSBURY, or AMBERSBURY. See AMBRESBURY.\n\nAMSDORTIANS, in Church History, a sect of Protestants in the 16th century, who took their name from Amstorf their leader. They maintained, that good works were not only unprofitable, but were obstructions to salvation.\n\nAMSTERDAM, the capital city of the province of Holland and of the United Netherlands, is seated on the river Amstel and an arm of the sea called the Wye. The air is but indifferent, on account of the marshes that surround it, and render the city almost inaccessible; but this inconvenience is abundantly recompensed by the utility of its commerce, which the port serves greatly to promote; for it will contain above 1000 large ships.\n\nIn 1224, it was nothing but a small castle, called Amstel from the name of the river, which its lords made a retreat for fishermen, who at first lived in huts covered with thatch: but it soon became considerable, and had a bridge and towers built about it, inasmuch that it rose to a small city; though, till the year 1492, it was surrounded with nothing but a weak pallidado. The walls were then built with brick, to defend it from the incursions of the inhabitants of Utrecht, with whom the Hollanders were often quarrelling; but some months afterwards it was almost reduced to ashes.\n\nIn 1512, it was besieged by the people of Gelderland; who not being able to take it, set fire to the ships in the harbour. In 1525, an Anabaptist leader, with 600 of his followers, got into the city in the night-time, attacked the townhouse, and defeated those that made any resistance. At length they barricaded, with wool and hop sacks, the avenues to the market place, where these enthusiasts were posted; and so put a stop to their fury till day appeared, at which time the citizens fell upon them on all sides, and forced them to retire into the townhouse, where most of them were cut to pieces.\n\nAbout ten years after, there was another tumult raised by a parcel of fanatics, consisting of men and women, who ran about the streets stark naked, and had a design of making themselves masters of the townhouse. Their shrieks and cries, which were dreadful enough, soon alarmed the inhabitants, who seized the greatest part of them, and gave them the chastisement they deserved.\n\nAmsterdam was one of the last cities that embraced the reformed religion. It was besieged by the Hollanders in 1578, and submitted after a siege of ten months. One article of the capitulation was, a free exercise of the Roman Catholic religion: but this was not observed by the Protestants; for they soon drove the ecclesiastics, monks, and nuns, out of the city, broke the images, and demolished the altars. From this time it became the general rendezvous of all nations and of every sect, which raised it to that degree of grandeur and opulence it now enjoys. The inhabitants were often obliged to enlarge the bounds of their city, and in 1675 it was increased to its present extent. It was surrounded with a brick wall, and a large ditch 80 feet broad full of running water. The walls were fortified with 26 bastions, on each of which there is now a windmill. There are eight gates towards the land, and one towards the water.\n\nAmsterdam being seated on a marshy soil, is built on piles of wood; for which reason no coaches are allowed, except to great men and physicians, who pay a tax for that privilege; and all kinds of goods are drawn on sledges. It stands so low, that they would be exposed to inundations, if they did not secure themselves by dykes and sluices. The finest streets are, the Keyfar's Graft, or Emperor's Canal; the Heer Graff, or Lords Canal; the Cingel; and the street of Haarlem. The principal canal is remarkable for its houses, which are magnificent structures of an equal height. Here are three prodigious sluices, and a great number of canals which cross the city in many parts, and render the streets clean and pleasant. The canals are deep, their sides are lined with hewn stones; they have generally rows of trees planted on each side, and many stone bridges over different parts of them.\n\nThe finest is that called the Amarrack, which is formed by the waters of the Amstel, into which the tide comes up, and on the sides of which are two large quays. This canal has several bridges. The principal is that next the sea, called Pont Neuf, or the New Bridge: it is 600 feet long, and 70 broad, with iron balustrades on each side; it has 36 arches, of which 11 are very high, and eight are shut up to enclose the yachts. From this bridge there is a most charming prospect of the city, port, and sea. The port is a mile and a half in length, and above 1000 paces in breadth. It is always filled with a multitude of vessels, which look like a forest, or rather a floating city. The streets in general are well paved, and the houses built of brick or stone. Towards the sides of the haven, the city is enclosed with great poles driven into the ground, which are joined by large beams placed horizontally. There are openings to let the ships in and out, which are shut every night at the ringing of a bell.\n\nAmsterdam is computed to be half as big as London, including the fortifications, and almost as populous in proportion. There are people here of almost every nation and religion in Europe, who are all tolerated in their respective persuasions; but none admitted to any share in the government except the Calvinists. There are 11 churches for the Dutch of the established or Calvinistical religion, with two French and one High Dutch. The English have also three churches in this city: one for the Presbyterians, whose ministers are paid by the magistrates; a second for those of the church of England, whose minister is paid by his Britannic Majesty; and a third for the Brownists, who maintain their own ministers. None but the Calvinists are allowed to have bells, and their ministers are maintained by the magistrates. All these churches or congregations make up only a third part of the inhabitants of the city. The Roman Catholics, who have 27 houses or chapels for their worship, form another third part. Here they have a long square of houses for their beguines (a kind of nuns) to live in; who are not shut up in cloisters as other nuns in Roman Catholic countries, but have liberty to walk abroad, and may even marry when they are tired of this kind of life. These chapels of the Roman Catholics have no bells allowed.\nAmsterdam.\n\nlowed them, being looked upon as conventicles, and may be shut up and opened according as the government pleases. The other third part of the city is made up of Jews, Lutherans, Arminians, Anabaptists, &c., none of whom, as was said of the Roman Catholics, are allowed to have bells in their churches. Those who marry, and are not of the established religion, are obliged to be joined first by the magistrates, and then they may perform the ceremony in their own assemblies. The Jews, who are very considerable in this place, have two synagogues; one of which, namely the Portuguese, is the largest in Europe. Within the court yard, where their synagogue stands, they have several rooms or schools, where their children are taught Hebrew, and very carefully instructed in the Jewish religion.\n\nThe most remarkable of the religious buildings is the New Church, dedicated to St Catherine. It was begun in the year 1498, others say 1414; and was 100 years of building. It had the misfortune of being burnt in the year 1645, but was in a short time after built in a more magnificent manner. The foundation of a steeple is laid before this church, which was designed to be very high. The piles on which it was to be erected are not above 100 feet square, and yet they are 6334 in number, and those very large. Nevertheless it was thought that these vast piles, or rather the ground, were not able to support the prodigious weight they intended to lay upon it; for which reason the steeple remains unfinished. The pulpit is a masterpiece of the kind, where the four evangelists and many other curious pieces of sculpture are represented. The glass windows are adorned with paintings, among which the emperor Maximilian is described, presenting an imperial crown to the burgomasters of Amsterdam for the crest of the arms of this city. The organ is very large, and reckoned one of the best in the world. It has a set of pipes that counterfeit a chorus of voices, and has 52 whole stops besides half stops, with two rows of keys for the feet, and three rows of keys for the hands. Those who hear it play for the first time imagine they hear a human voice. The grate dividing the chancel from the body of the church is all of Corinthian brass. The branches of candlesticks are the richest in the Seven Provinces. There is a very fine marble monument erected to Admiral Ruyter, who was killed at Messina.\n\nThe public buildings of a civil nature are very magnificent. The stadhofse was founded in 1648. It is built upon 14,000 wooden piles; and its front is 282 feet long, its sides 235 feet, and its height to the roof 116. There is a marble pediment in the front, whereon a woman is carved in relief, holding the arms of the city; she is seated in a chair, supported by two lions, with an olive branch in her right hand; on each side are four Naiads who present her with a crown of palm and laurel, and two other marine goddesses present her with different sorts of fruit; besides, there is Neptune with his trident, accompanied with Tritons, a sea-unicorn, and a sea-horse. On the top stand three statues in bronze, representing Justice, Strength, and Plenty. On the top of the structure is a round tower, 50 feet above the roof, adorned with statues, and an harmonious chime of bells, the biggest of which weighs about 7000 pounds, and the next 6000. They are made to play different tunes every month. It has not one handsome gate, but only seven doors to answer to the number of the United Provinces. On the floor of the great hall are two globes, the celestial and terrestrial, which are 22 feet in diameter and 69 in circumference. They are made of black and white marble, and are inlaid with jasper and copper. In general, all the chambers are enriched with paintings, carvings, and gildings. While this stadhofse was building, the old one was set on fire, and consumed with all the archives and registers.\n\nUnder the stadhofse is a prodigious vault, wherein is kept the bank of Amsterdam, where there is a vast quantity of ingots both of gold and silver, as also bags which are supposed to be full of money. The doors are proof against patauds, and are never opened but in the presence of one of the burgomasters. The prisons for debtors and criminals are likewise under the stadhofse; as also the guard-room for the citizens, wherein the keys of the city are locked every night. At the end of the great hall is the scheepen or aldermen's chamber, where civil causes are tried. Besides these, there are the chambers of the senate and council, the burgomasters chamber, the chambers of accounts, &c. In the second story is a large magazine of arms; and on the top of the building are six large cisterns of water, which may be conveyed to any room in the house in case of fire; to prevent which the chimneys are lined with copper.\n\nThe bourse, or exchange, where the merchants assemble, is all of free-stone, and built upon 2000 wooden piles. Its length is about 250 feet, and its breadth 140. The galleries are supported by 26 marble columns, upon each of which are the names of the people that are to meet there. They are all numbered; and there is a place fixed for every merchandise under some one of these numbers. On the right hand of the gate is a superb staircase which leads to the galleries; on one side of which there are several shops, and on the other a place to sell clothes. It is not unlike the royal exchange in London.\n\nThe admiralty office is in a house which belonged formerly to the princes of Orange. The arsenal for their men of war is in the harbour. This is a very handsome building, 200 feet long and 22 broad. The ground floor is filled with bullets; the second floor contains the arms and cordage; the third their sails, pulleys, flags, &c. This arsenal contains a great many curiosities; among the rest an Indian canoe brought from the straits of Davis, and a conservatory of water, on the top of the house that holds 1600 tons of water, which may be distributed in case of fire into 16 different parts by leaden pipes. Hard by this edifice you see the dock or yard where they build their men of war. This dock is 508 feet long, and contiguous to it are houses for lodging the ship carpenters. The dock is plentifully supplied with everything necessary for the construction of ships.\n\nThe East India Company occupy a large building divided into several offices or apartments. In some of these they have great stores of packed goods, and likewise a room with all sorts of drugs, tea, wax, ambergris, and musk. Here they have a magazine full of medicaments for surges' chests, to furnish the Company's ships and garrisons in the Indies; as also large\nlarge magazines of nutmegs, cloves, mace, and cinnamon. In the court-yard there is a guard chamber, where every night the housekeeper has a watch; and on the other side of the gate there is a chemist, who with his men prepares medicines for the Indies; and adjoining to this court-yard is their warehouse and packhouse for pepper and groats goods. In the new part of this city they have a magazine or palace, which may properly be called an arsenal. The ground on which this building stands is 2000 feet, and square every way, reckoning the moats or burgwall about it. The two rope-alleys are 1800 feet long, on the backside of which is a store of 500 large anchors besides small ones. In this arsenal they build the ships belonging to the India chamber of Amsterdam; for which reason they have all sorts of workhouses here for the artificers that serve the Company.\n\nThe academy called the Illustrious School, is likewise a very fine building. It was formerly a convent belonging to the nuns of St Agnes. Here they teach Latin, the oriental languages, theology, philosophy, history, &c. The lawyers and physicians have likewise their schools.\n\nBesides these, there are several hospitals, or houses for orphans, for poor widows, for sick persons, and for mad people; all which are regulated with much prudence. The raft-house, which was formerly a nunnery, is now a sort of a workhouse for men that behave ill. They are commonly set to saw or raft Brazil wood; and if they will not perform their task, they are put into a cellar which the water runs into, where if they do not almost constantly ply the pump, they run the risk of being drowned. There is likewise a spinhouse for debauched women, where they are obliged to spin wool, flax, and hemp, and do other work. All the hospitals are extremely neat, and richly adorned with pictures. They are maintained partly by voluntary contributions, which are raised by putting money into the poor's boxes fixed up all over the city; and partly by taxing all public diversions, as well at fairs as elsewhere. Likewise every person that passes through any of the gates at candle-light pays a penny for the same use. These charities are taken care of by certain officers called deacons. The governors are nominated by the magistrates out of the most considerable men in the city.\n\nThe common fort have places of diversion called Spiel-houses, where there are music and dancing. They are much of the same kind as the hops which were so frequent about London. If strangers go there, they must take care not to make their addresses to a woman that is engaged to any other man.\n\nThere are two suburbs to this city; one at the gate of the regulars; and the other goes as far as Overtoon, a village a little way from Amsterdam, where boats which come from Leyden are rolled over land upon wooden rollers. There is likewise in this city an hospital for those that are infected with the plague; which was built in the year 1630, and has 360 windows.\n\nThis city is governed by a senate or council, which consists of 36 persons called a Vroedtchap, who enjoy their places for life; and when any of them dies, the remainder choose another in his stead. This senate elects deputies to be sent to the States of Holland, and appoints the chief magistrates of the city called Burgomasters or Echevins, who are like our aldermen. The number is twelve; out of which four are chosen every year to execute the office, and are called Burgomasters regent. Three of these are discharged every year, to make room for three others. One of the four is kept in to inform the new ones of the state of affairs, and also presides the three first months in the year, and the others three months each; so that when they are in this office, they may be compared to the lord mayor of the city of London. These alterations and appointments are made by their own body. They dispose of all inferior offices which become vacant during their regency. They have likewise the direction of all public works, which regard the safety, tranquillity, and embellishment of the city. The keys of the famous bank of this city are in the hands of their magistrates.\n\nThe college consists of new burgomasters or echevins who are judges in all criminal affairs, without appeal; but in civil causes they may appeal to the council of the province. There are two treasurers, a bailiff, and a penitentiary. The bailiff continues in his office three years; and searches after criminals, takes care to prosecute them, and sees their sentence executed. The penitentiary is the minister of the magistracy, is well versed in the laws, makes public harangues, and is the defender of the interests of the city. The city of Amsterdam contributes to the public income above 50,000 livres per day, besides the excise of beer, flesh, and corn; which in all amounts to above 1,600,000l. a-year. This is more than is paid by all the rest of the provinces put together; and yet Amsterdam bears but the fifth rank in the assembly of the states of Holland, with this distinction, that whereas other cities send two members, this sends four.\n\nThe militia of Amsterdam is very considerable. They have 60 companies, each of which has from 200 to 300 men. Jews and Anabaptists are excluded from this service, not being admitted to bear arms: But they are obliged to contribute to the maintenance of the city-guard, which consists of 1400 soldiers; as also to the night-watch, who patrol about the streets and proclaim the hour. Besides these, there are trumpeters on every church steeple, who sound every half hour; and if there happens a fire, they ring the fire-bell, and show where it is. The inhabitants have excellent contrivances to extinguish it speedily.\n\nThe trade of Amsterdam is prodigious: for almost the whole trade of the East India Company centres in this city, which besides carries on a commerce with all the rest of the world, inasmuch that it may be called the magazine or storehouse of Europe. They import a vast deal of corn from the Baltic, not so much for present consumption, as to lay up against times of scarcity. The richest spices are entirely in the hands of the East India Company, who furnish all Europe therewith. They have vast quantities of military stores, with which they supply several nations; which is owing to their engrossing most of the iron-works on the Rhine and other great rivers that run into Holland. Such was the state of Amsterdam before the late revolution. Since that period, it has probably undergone considerable changes, as well in its internal government, as in its foreign connexions. The longitude of Amsterdam is 4° 30' E.; the latitude, 52° 25' N.\n\nAmsterdam, or Tongataboo, is also the name of an island.\nIsland in the South sea, said to have been discovered by Tasman a Dutch navigator. It was also visited by Captain Cook. Its greatest extent from east to west is about 21 miles, and from north to south about 13. It is broad at the east end, and runs taper towards the west, where it turns, and runs to a point due north. It is about five leagues to the west of Middleburgh. The shore is surrounded by a coral rock; and its most elevated parts are not above five or eight yards above the level of the sea. S. Lat. 21. 11. W. Long. 175. It is wholly laid out in plantations, in which are cultivated some of the richest productions of nature.\n\nHere are bread-fruit, cocoa-nut trees, plantains, bananas, yuccas, yams, and some other roots, sugar-canes, and a fruit like a nectarine called by the natives fighega. There did not appear an inch of waste ground: the roads occupied no more space than was absolutely necessary: the fences did not take up above four inches each; and even these were not wholly lost, for in many grew some useful trees or plants: it was everywhere the same, change of place altered not the scene: nature, assisted by a little art, nowhere appeared with more splendour than on this island. Water is not so plentiful here as at the Society islands; but the chief pointed out a pool of fresh water unfished, to supply the ships with that necessary article. Cañarinas, pandans, and wild sago palms, appear here with their various tints of green, and baringtonia as big as the loftiest oaks. The bread-fruit does not, however, thrive here with the same luxuriance as at the Society islands; the coral rock, which composes the basis of this spot, being much more thinly covered with mould.\n\nBoth men and women are of the common size of Europeans, and their colour is that of a lightish copper; they are well shaped, have regular features, are active, brisk, and lively. They have fine eyes, and in general good teeth, even to an advanced age. The women are the merriest creatures imaginable, and incessant talkers. In general, they appear to be modest; although there was no want of those of a different stamp. Among the natives, who swam about the ship very vociferously, were a considerable number of women, who wanted in the water like amphibious creatures, and were easily persuaded to come on board perfectly naked; but none of them ventured to stay there after sunset, but returned to the shore to pass the night, like the greater part of the inhabitants, under the shade of the wild wood which lined the coast. There they lighted great fires, and were heard conversing almost the whole night. The hair of both sexes in general is black, but especially that of the women; both sexes wear it short, except a single lock on the top of the head, and a small quantity on each side. The men cut or shave their beards quite close; which operation they perform with two shells. The hair of many was observed to be burnt at the ends, and strewed with a white powder, which was found, on examining it, to be lime made of shell or coral, which had corroded or burnt the hair; some made use of a blue powder, and others, both men and women, of an orange-coloured powder made of turmeric.\n\nThe dress of both sexes consists of a piece of cloth or matting wrapped round the waist, and hanging down below the knees. From the waist upwards they are generally naked; and it seems to be a custom to anoint these parts every morning. The practice of tattooing, or puncturing the skin, likewise prevails. The men are tattooed from the middle of the thigh to above the hips; the women have it only on their arms and fingers, and on those parts but very slightly. Their ornaments are amulets, necklaces, and bracelets, the bone, shells, and beads of mother-of-pearl, tortoiseshell, &c., which are worn by men as well as women. The women also wear on their fingers neat rings made of tortoiseshell, and pieces in their ears about the size of a small quill; but here ornaments are not commonly worn, though all have their ears pierced. They have also a curious apron, made of the cocoa-nut shell; and composed of a number of small pieces sewed together in such a manner as to form stars, half-moons, little squares, &c.; it is studded with beads and shells, and covered with red feathers, so as to have a pleasing effect. They make the same kind of cloth, and of the same materials, as at Otaheite, though they have not such a variety, nor do they make any so fine; but as they have a method of glazing it, it is more durable, and will resist rain for some time, which the other cloth would not. Their colours are black, brown, yellow, purple, and red; all made from vegetables. They make various sorts of matting, some of a very fine texture, which is generally used for clothing; and the thick and stronger sort serves to sleep upon, and to make sails for their canoes, &c. Among other useful utensils, they have various sorts of baskets, some made of the same materials as their mats, and others of the twisted fibres of cocoa-nuts. These are not only durable, but beautiful, being generally composed of different colours, and studded with beads made of shells or bones. They have many little nicknacks among them, which show that they neither want taste to design, nor skill to execute, whatever they take in hand. Their fishing implements are much the same as in other islands: here was purchased a fish-net made like our casting nets, knit of very firm though slender threads.\n\nNotwithstanding their friendly disposition, these people have very formidable weapons; some of their spears have many barbs, and must be very dangerous weapons when they take effect. A large flat shell or breastplate was purchased, made of a roundish bone, white and polished like ivory, about 18 inches in diameter, which appeared to have belonged to an animal of the whale tribe.\n\nAMULET, a charm, or preservative against mischief, witchcraft, or diseases.\n\nAmulets were made of stone, metal, simples, animals, and in a word of everything that imagination suggested.\n\nSometimes they consisted of words, characters, and sentences, ranged in a particular order, and engraved upon wood, &c., and worn about the neck, or some other part of the body. See Abracadabra.\n\nAt other times they were neither written nor engraved; but prepared with many superstitious ceremonies, great regard being usually paid to the influence of the stars. The Arabs have given to this species of amulet the name of talisman.\n\nAll nations have been fond of amulets: the Jews were extremely superstitious in the use of them, to drive\nAmulet drive away diseases; and the Mishna forbids them, unless received from an approved man who had cured at least three persons before by the same means.\n\nAmong the Christians of the early times, amulets were made of the wood of the cros, or ribbands with a text of Scripture written in them, as preservatives against diseases. Notwithstanding the progress of learning and refinement, there is not any country in Europe, even at this day, where they do not believe in some charm or other. The pope is supposed to have the virtue of making amulets, which he exercises in the consecrating of Aquas Dei, &c. The sponge which has wiped his table, was formerly in great veneration as a preservative from wounds, and from death itself: on this account it was sent with great solemnity by Gregory II. to the duke of Aquitain.\n\nAmulets are now much fallen from the repute they were anciently in; yet the great Mr Boyle alleges them as an instance of the ingress of external effluvia into the habit, in order to show the great porosity of the human body. He adds, that he is persuaded some of these external medicines do answer; for that himself, having once been subject to bleed at the nose, and reduced to use several remedies to check it, found the mors of a dead man's skull, though only applied so as to touch the skin till the mors was warm thereby, the most effectual of any. The same Mr Boyle shows how the effluvia, even of cold amulets, may, in course of time, pervade the pores of a living animal; by supposing an agreement between the pores of the skin and the figure of the corpúcles. Bellini has attempted to demonstrate the possibility of the thing in his last propositions De Febribus; and the like is done by Dr Wainwright, Dr Keill, &c.\n\nAMURAT, or AMURATH I. the fourth emperor of the Turks, and one of the greatest princes of the Ottoman empire, succeeded Soliman in 1565. He took from the Greeks Gallipoli, Thrace, and Adrianople, which last he chose for the place of his residence. He defeated the prince of Bulgaria, conquered Mfinia, chastised his rebellious bashaws, and is said to have gained 36 battles. This prince, in order to form a body of devoted troops that might serve as the immediate guards of his person and dignity, appointed his officers to seize annually, as the imperial property, the fifth part of the Christian youth taken in war. These, after being instructed in the Mahometan religion, inured to obedience by severe discipline, and trained to warlike exercises, were formed into a body distinguished by the name of Janissaries, or New Soldiers. Every sentiment which enthusiasm can inspire, every mark of distinction that the favour of the prince could confer, were employed in order to animate this body with martial ardour, and with a consciousness of its own pre-eminence. The janissaries soon became the chief strength and pride of the Ottoman armies, and were distinguished above all the troops whose duty it was to attend on the person of the sultan.—At length the death of Lazarus, despot of Servia, who had endeavoured in vain to stop the progress of Amurat's arms, touched Milo, one of his servants, in a sensible manner, that, in revenge, he stabbed the sultan in the midst of his troops, and killed him upon the spot, A.D. 1380, after he had reigned 23 years.\n\nAMURAT II. the 10th emperor of the Turks, was the eldest son of Mahomet I., and succeeded his father in 1421. He besieged Constantinople and Belgrade without success; but he took Thessalonica from the Venetians, and compelled the prince of Bosnia and John Caitriot prince of Albania to pay him tribute. He obliged the latter to lend his three sons as hostages; among whom was George, celebrated in history by the name of Scanderbeg. John Hunniades defeated Amurat's troops, and obliged him to make peace with the Christian princes, in 1442. These princes afterwards breaking the peace, Amurat defeated them in the famous battle of Varna, November 10th, 1444, which proved fatal to the Christians, and in which Ladislaus king of Hungary was killed. He afterwards defeated Hunniades, and killed above 20,000 of his men; but George Caitriot, better known by the name of Scanderbeg, being re-established in the estates of his father, defeated the Turks several times, and obliged Amurat to raise the siege of Croia, the capital of Albania. Amurat died, chagrined with his ill success, and infirm with age, February 11th, 1451, at Adrianople. It is observed to this prince's honour, that he always kept his treaties with the greatest fidelity.\n\nAMURATH IV. surnamed the Valiant, was the son of Achmet I. and in the year 1622, at the age of 13 succeeded his uncle Mustapha. Bagdad fell into the hands of the Persians, and several other disastrous events clouded the commencement of his reign. The pacha of Erzerum had raised the standard of rebellion in the former reign; and, continuing his opposition, he overran many of the provinces of Lesser Asia. But the military talents of the sultan were soon roused to exertion; and, making peace with Germany, he hatched with a formidable army to regain Bagdad. But new rebellions in his Asiatic dominions, and several other causes, prevented him from recovering the city. The Spaniards rebelled at home, and several viziers were slain during the tumults of the Porte.\n\nThe natural dispositions of the young monarch were ill adapted to his situation, and extremely destructive to his people. It is reported, that a flash of lightning rushing into his chamber during the darkness of the night, strongly impaired his reason, and produced a violence and intemperance of character which remained to the end of his days. It was therefore nothing more than reasonable to expect that his policy should be variable and inconstant; it appears, however, that he actively resisted the foes who pressed upon his dominions from different quarters. The recovery of Bagdad being still his favourite object, in the year 1637, he again marched against it; and after 30 days of unremitting assault, with the expense of much blood, he took possession of the city. By putting his men forward to the attack by the point of the scimitar; and, by slaughtering 30,000 Persians in cold blood after their surrender, he displayed the brutal ferocity of his disposition. One person alone is reported to have moved his obdurate heart on the present occasion. A famous player upon the harp entreated those who were sent to massacre him, to allow him to speak to the sultan previous to his death. Informed who he was, the sultan requested him to give a specimen of his skill in his profession; with this he readily complied, and touched his harp so melodiously, and X...\nAmurath, sung in such pathetic strains the lamentations on the tragedy of Bagdad, intermixed with the praises of Amurath, that the hard heart of the cruel monarch being at length softened, he melted into tears, and saved both the musician and the remaining inhabitants. The lofs sustained by the Persians at this time, so reduced their military strength, that they were unable for a long period to attack the Ottoman empire.\n\nThe violence of Amurath soon enfeebled his constitution; and the fruits of his debaucheries and excesses were obvious even in the prime of life. At the age of 31, he fell a victim to an excess of reveling in the feast of Bairam, in the year 1640. Beholding his end approaching, he is reported to have given orders to assassinate his brother, in order to secure the throne for his favourite Mutapha; but the affection of his mother prevented the cruel mandate from being carried into effect. The manners and amorous adventures of this monarch have afforded materials for numerous Turkish descriptions full of extravagance, singularity, and cruelty. He surpassed all his predecessors in the abominable vice of intoxication, and even violated the established laws of the country, by issuing an edict permitting the sale and use of wine. But, as if it was not sufficient to violate the common law, he also opposed himself to the common usage of the country, by shutting up the coffeehouses, and prohibiting opium and tobacco upon the pain of death. The wanton cruelty of this prince was almost unexampled. During his hours of dissipation, he would rush forth into the streets with a drawn sword in his hand, and cut in pieces all the unhappy persons who chanced to be in his way. Nay, even in his calmest moments, he often discharged arrows from his upper windows at the innocent passengers as they went along. In short, to such extravagance did his cruelty extend, that the very name of Amurath carried terror along with it, and the opium-chewers fell into fits upon the simple mention thereof. The number of persons that fell victims to his cruelty during a reign of 17 years, amounted to no less than 1,400; among whom were many officers of high power and distinction in the state. The meanness of his dispositions, however, manifested themselves in his descending to familiarities with his favourites, and even joining in the meanest services. He also displayed a singular humour in making marriages between old men and girls, and young men and women of four score. It may, however, on the whole, be asserted, that if he had not been intoxicated with wine and power, the qualities of his mind and body might have rendered him a more respectable member of society. He was very remarkable for swiftness of foot and dexterity in drawing the bow. The reveries of fortune made final impression on his mind, and he pursued with resolute firmness any object in which he seriously engaged. Diffusing, avaricious, and blasphemous, he gave full proof, that his moral qualities were greatly depraved. (Mod. Un. Hist. Gen. Biog.)\n\nAMYCLAE, a city of Laconia, distant about 18 miles from the metropolis, founded by Amyclas the son of Lacedemon, and famed afterwards for the birth of Calor and Pollux the sons of Tyndarus, eighth king of Sparta. It was afterwards famed for sending a considerable colony of its own inhabitants into Upper Calabria, who built there a city which they called Ly Amygdalos the same name. This last city was situated between Cujeta and Terracina, and gave its name to the neighbouring sea. According to Pliny and Solinus, the territory of Amycla was so infested with vipers and other serpents, that the inhabitants were obliged to abandon their dwellings and settle elsewhere. Among the ancient poets, the Amycli, or inhabitants of this city, obtained the epithet of taciti, \"silent.\" The reason of this was, either because it was built by the Lacedemonians, who, as they followed the doctrine of Pythagoras, were always inculcating the precept of silence, and thence called taciti; or because of a law which obtained in this place, forbidding any one, under severe penalties, to mention the approach of an enemy. Before this law was made, the city was daily alarmed by false reports, as the enemy had been already at the gates. From terrors of this kind the above-mentioned law indeed delivered them; but, in the end, it proved the ruin of the city: for the Dorians appearing unexpectedly under the walls, no one ventured to transgress the law; so that the city was easily taken. They reduced it to an inconsiderable hamlet; in which, however, were seen some of the remains of its ancient grandeur. One of the finest buildings that escaped the common ruin, was the temple and statue of Alexandra, whom the inhabitants pretended to be the same with Cassandra the daughter of Priam.\n\nAMYGDALUS, the ALMOND and PEACH. See Botany Index.\n\nAMYLACEOUS, from amyllum, \"flarch;\" a term applied to the fine flour of farinaceous seeds, in which consists their nutritive part. See BREAD.\n\nAMYNTA, in Literary History, a beautiful pastoral comedy, composed by Tasso; the model of all dramatic pieces wherein shepherds are actors. The Pastor Fido, and Filli di Sciro, are only copies of this excellent piece.\n\nAMYNTOR, aquitae, formed of the verb aquo, I defend or avenge, properly denotes a person who defends or vindicates a cause. In this sense, Mr Toland entitles his defence of Milton's life, Amyntor, as being a vindication of that work against Mr Blackhall and others, who had charged him with questioning the authority of some of the books of the New Testament, and declaring his doubt that several pieces under the name of Christ and his Apostles, received now by the whole Christian church, were supposititious.\n\nAMYOT, JAMES, bishop of Auxerre and great almoner of France, was born of an obscure family at Melun, the 30th of October 1514, and studied philosophy at Paris, in the college of Cardinal Le Moine. He was naturally dull and heavy; but diligence and application made amends for these natural defects. He left Paris at the age of 23; and went to Bourges with the Sieur Colin, who had the abbey of St Ambroise in that city. At the recommendation of this abbot, a secretary of state took Amyot into his house to tutor to his children. The great improvements they made under his direction induced the secretary to recommend him to the Princess Margaret duchess of Berry, only sister of Francis I, and by means of this recommendation Amyot was made public professor of Greek and Latin in the university of Bourges. It was during this time he translated into French the\n\"Amours of Theagines and Chariclea,\" which Francis I. was so pleased with, that he conferred upon him the abbey of Bellosane. He also translated Plutarch's Lives, which he dedicated to the king; and afterwards undertook that of Plutarch's Morals which he ended in the reign of Charles IX, and dedicated to that prince. Charles conferred upon him the abbey of St Cornelius de Compiegne, and made him great almoner of France and bishop of Auxerre. He died in 1593, aged 79.\n\nAMYRALDISM, a name given by some writers to the doctrine of universal grace, as explained and asserted by Amyraldus, or Moses Amyrauld, and others his followers, among the reformed in France, towards the middle of the 17th century.\n\nThis doctrine principally consisted of the following particulars, viz. that God refuses the happiness of all men, and none are excluded by a divine decree; that none can obtain salvation without faith in Christ; that God refuses to none the power of believing, though he does not grant to all his affluence, that they may improve this power to saving purposes; and that many perish through their own fault. Those who embraced this doctrine were called Universalists; though it is evident they rendered grace universal in words, but partial in reality, and are chargeable with greater inconsistencies than the Supralapsarians.\n\nAMYRAULT, Moses, an eminent French Protestant divine, born at Bourguel in Touraine in 1566. He studied at Saumur, where he was chosen professor of theology; and his learned works gained him the esteem of Catholics as well as Protestants, particularly of Cardinal Richelieu, who consulted him on a plan of reuniting their churches, which however, as may well be supposed, came to nothing. He published a piece in which he attempted to explain the mystery of predestination and grace, which occasioned a controversy between him and some other divines. He also wrote, An Apology for the Protestants; a Paraphrase on the New Testament; and several other books. This eminent divine died in 1664.\n\nAMYRIS. See Botany Index.\n\nANA, among Physicians, denotes a quantity equal to that of the preceding ingredient. It is abbreviated thus, āā, or ā.\n\nAna, in Matters of Literature, a Latin termination, adopted into the titles of several books in other languages.—Anar, or books in ana, are collections of the memorable sayings of persons of learning and wit; much the same with what we otherwise call table-talk.\n\nWolfius has given the history of books in ana, in the preface to the Cathaboniana. He there observes, that though such titles be new, the thing itself is very old; that Xenophon's books of the deeds and sayings of Socrates, as well as the dialogues of Plato, are Socraticana; that the apophthegms of the philosophers collected by Diogenes Laërtius, the sentences of Pythagoras and those of Epictetus, the works of Athenaeus, Stoebus, and divers others, are so many ana. Even the Gemara of the Jews, with several other oriental writings, according to Wolfius, properly belong to the same class. To this head of ana may likewise be referred the Orphica, the Pythagorea, Æsopica, Pyrhonea, &c.\n\nScaligerana was the first piece that appeared with a title in ana. It was composed by Han de Vaflan, a young Champenois, recommended to Jof. Scaliger by Cabaillon. Being much with Scaliger, who was daily visited by the men of learning at Leyden, De Vaflan wrote down whatever things of any moment he heard Scaliger say. And thus arose the Scaligerana, which was not printed till many years after, at Geneva in 1666. Patin, Let. 431.—Soon after came the Peronniana, Thuana, Naudeana, Patineana, Sorberiana, Megagiana, Anti-Menagiana, Fucetiana, Chevranae, Leibnitziana, Arlequiniana, Poggiana, &c.\n\nANABAPTISTON, the same with Abaptist.\n\nANABAPTISTS, a name which has been indiscriminately applied to Christians of very different principles and practices; though many of them object to the denomination, and hold nothing in common, besides the opinion that baptism ought always to be performed by immersion, and not administered before the age of discretion.\n\nThe word Anabaptist is compounded of ana, \"new,\" and baptize, \"a baptist;\" and in this sense the Novatians, the Cataphrygians, and the Donatists, may be considered as a kind of Anabaptists in the earlier ages, though not then denoted by this name; for they contended, that those Christians of the Catholic church who joined themselves to their respective parties should be rebaptized. But we must not clas under the same denomination those bishops of Asia and Africa, who, in the third century, maintained, that baptism administered by those whom they called heretics was not valid, and therefore that such of them as returned into their churches ought to be rebaptized. Nor do the English and Dutch Baptists consider the denomination as at all applicable to their feet: by whom the baptism appointed by Christ is held to be \"nothing short of immersion upon a personal profession of faith;\" of which profession infants being incapable, and sprinkling being no adequate symbol of the thing intended, the baptizing of profelytes to their communion, who in their infancy had undergone the ceremony of sprinkling, cannot, it is urged, be interpreted a repetition of the baptismal ordinance.\n\nAnabaptists, in a strict and proper sense, appear to be those who not only rebaptize, when they arrive at an adult age, persons that were baptized in their infancy, but also, as often as any person comes from one of their feet to another, or as often as any one is excluded from their communion and again received into the bosom of their church, they baptize him. And such were many of the German Baptists. But the single opinion common to all the feet to which the name of Anabaptists has been indiscriminately applied, is that of the invalidity of infant baptism, in whatever way administered: And hence the general denomination of Antipadobaptists; which includes Anabaptists, Baptists, Mennonites, Waterlandians, &c., as distinguished by their respective peculiarities; though Anabaptists seems to have been adopted by most writers as the general term.\n\nTo the above peculiar notion concerning the baptismal sacrament, the Anabaptists added principles of a different nature, depending upon certain ideas which they entertained concerning a perfect church establishment, pure in its members, and free from the institutions of human policy.\nThe Anabaptists appear to have made little noise, or to have been little noticed, before the time of the reformation in Germany. The most prudent and rational part of them considered it possible, by human wisdom, industry, and vigilance, to purify the church from the contagion of the wicked, provided the manners and spirit of the primitive Christians could but recover their lost dignity and lustre; and seeing the attempts of Luther, seconded by several persons of eminent piety, prove so successful, they hoped that the happy period was arrived in which the restoration of the church to purity was to be accomplished, under the divine protection, by the labours and counsels of pious and eminent men. Others, far from being satisfied with the plan of reformation proposed by Luther, looked upon it as much beneath the sublimity of their views; and consequently undertook a more perfect reformation, or, to express more properly their visionary enterprise, they proposed to found a new church, entirely spiritual, and truly divine.\n\nThis fact was soon joined by great numbers, and (as usually happens in sudden revolutions of this nature) by many persons, whose characters and capacities were very different, though their views seemed to turn upon the same object. Their progress was rapid; for, in a very short space of time, their discourses, visions, and predictions, excited commotions in a great part of Europe, and drew into their communion a prodigious multitude, whose ignorance rendered them easy victims to the illusions of enthusiasm. The most pernicious faction of all those which composed this motley multitude, was that which pretended that the founders of the new and perfect church, already mentioned, were under the direction of a divine impulse, and were armed against all opposition by the power of working miracles. It was this faction that, in the year 1521, began their fanatical work, under the guidance of Munzer, Stubner, Storch, &c.\n\nThese persons were disciples of Luther; but well knowing that their opinions were such as would receive no sanction from him, they availed themselves of his absence to disseminate them in Wittenburg, and had the address to overreach the piety of Melanchthon. Their principal purpose was to gain over the populace, and to form a considerable party. To effect this, says Bayle, they were industrious and active, each in his own way. Storeck wanting knowledge, boasted of inspiration; and Stubner, who had both genius and erudition, laboured at commodious explications of Scripture. Not content with discrediting the court of Rome, and decrying the authority of consistories, they taught, That among Christians, who had the precepts of the gospel to direct, and the Spirit of God to guide them, the office of magistracy was not only unnecessary, but an unlawful encroachment on their spiritual liberty: that the distinctions occasioned by birth, or rank, or wealth, being contrary to the spirit of the gospel, which considers all men as equal, should be entirely abolished; that all Christians, throwing their polities into one common flock, should live together in that state of equality which becomes members of the same family; that as neither the laws of nature nor the precepts of the New Testament had placed any restraint upon men with regard to the number of wives which they might marry, they should use that liberty which God himself had granted to the patriarchs.\n\nThey employed at first the various arts of persuasion in order to propagate their doctrine. They preached, exhorted, admonished, and reasoned, in a manner that seemed proper to impress the multitude; and related a great number of visions and revelations with which they pretended to have been favoured from above. But when they saw that these methods of making proselytes were not attended with such a rapid success as they fondly expected, and that the ministry of Luther and other eminent reformers was detrimental to their cause, they then had recourse to more expedient measures, and madly attempted to propagate their fanatical doctrine by force of arms. Munzer and his associates, in the year 1525, put themselves at the head of a numerous army, composed for the most part of peasants of Swabia, Thuringia, Franconia, and Saxony; and declared war against all laws, government, and magistrates of every kind, under the chimerical pretext that Christ was now to take the reins of civil and ecclesiastical government into his own hands, and to rule alone over the nations. But this factious crowd was routed and dispersed, without much difficulty, by the elector of Saxony and other princes; and Munzer their ring-leader ignominiously put to death, and his factious counsellors scattered abroad in different places.\n\nMany of his followers, however, survived and propagated their opinions through Germany, Switzerland, and Holland. In the year 1533, a party of them settled at Munster under the direction of two Anabaptist prophets, John Matthias a baker of Haerlem, and John Bockholdt a journeyman taylor of Leyden. Having made themselves masters of the city, they deposed the magistrates, confiscated the estates of such as had escaped, and deposited the wealth they amassed together in a public treasury for common use. They made preparations of every kind for the defence of the city; and sent out emissaries to the Anabaptists in the Low Countries, inviting them to assemble at Munster, which was now dignified with the name of Mount Zion, that from hence they might be deputed to reduce all the nations of the earth under their dominion. Matthias, who was the first in command, was soon cut off in an act of frenzy by the bishop of Munster's army; and was succeeded by Bockholdt, who was proclaimed by a special designation of Heaven, as he pretended, king of Zion, and invested with legislative powers like those of Moses. The extravagancies of Bockholdt were too numerous to be recited: it will be sufficient to add, that the city of Munster was taken after a long siege and an obstinate resistance; and Bockholdt, the mock monarch, was punished with a most painful and ignominious death.\n\nIt must, however, be acknowledged, that the true rise of the numerous insurrections of this period ought not to be attributed to religious opinions. The first insurgents groaned under the most grievous oppressions; they took up arms principally in defence of their civil liberties; and of the commotions that took place, the Anabaptist leaders above mentioned seem rather to have availed themselves, than to have been the prime movers. See the article Reformation.—That a great part of the main body, indeed, confessed\nof Anabaptists, seems indisputable; and whatever fanaticism existed among them would naturally be called forth or be inflamed by the situations that occurred, and run riot in its wildest shapes. At the same time it appears from history, that a great part also confessed of Roman Catholics, and a still greater of persons who had scarcely any religious principles at all. Indeed, when we read of the vast numbers that were concerned in those insurrections, of whom it is reported that 100,000 fell by the sword, it appears reasonable to conclude that a great majority of them were not Anabaptists.\n\nBefore concluding this article, it must be remarked, that the Baptists or Mennonites in England and Holland are to be considered in a very different light from the enthusiasts we have been describing: And it appears equally uncandid and invidious, to trace up their distinguishing sentiment, as some of their adversaries have done, to those obnoxious characters, and there to stop, in order as it were to associate with it the ideas of turbulence and fanaticism, with which it certainly has no natural connexion. Their coincidence with some of those oppressed and infatuated people in denying baptism to infants, is acknowledged by the Baptists: but they disavow the practice which the appellation of Anabaptists implies; and their doctrines seem referable to a more ancient and respectable origin. They appear supported by history in considering themselves as the descendants of the Waldenses, who were so grievously oppressed and persecuted by the despotic heads of the Romish hierarchy; and they profess an equal aversion to all principles of rebellion on one hand, and to all suggestions of fanaticism on the other. See Baptists. The denomination of Mennonites, by which they are distinguished in Holland, they derive from Menno, the famous man who lately gave consternation and stability to their sect. See Mennonites.\n\nANABASII, in Antiquity, were couriers who were sent on horseback or in chariots, with despatches of importance.\n\nANABASIS. See Botany Index.\n\nANABATHRA, in Ancient Writers, denotes a kind of steps or ladder whereby to ascend to some eminence. In this sense we read of the anabathra of theatres, pulpits, &c. Anabathra appears to have been sometimes also applied to ranges of seats rising gradually over each other.\n\nAnabathra is more particularly applied to a kind of stone blocks raised by the highway sides, to afflit travellers in mounting or alighting, before the use of stirrups was invented. The first author of this contrivance among the Romans was C. Gracchus brother of Tiberius.\n\nANABLEPS, in Ichthyology, the trivial name of a species of cobitis. See Cobitis.\n\nANABOA, a small island situated near the coast of Loango in Africa, in E. Long. 9° N.; Lat. 1°. Here are several fertile valleys, which produce plenty of bananas, oranges, pine apples, lemons, citrons, tamarinds, cocoa nuts, &c., together with vast quantities of cotton. In this island are two high mountains, which, being continually covered with clouds, occasion frequent rains.\n\nANABOLOEUM, or ANABOLE, in Antiquity, a kind of great or upper coat, worn over the tunica.\n\nANABOLESUS, in Antiquity, an appellation given to grooms of the stable, or equerries, who assisted their masters in mounting their horses. As the ancients had no stirrups, or instruments that are now in use for mounting a horse, they either jumped upon his back, or were aided in mounting by anabolei.\n\nANACALYPTERIA, according to Suidas, were presents made to the bride by her husband's relations and friends, when the first uncovered her face and showed herself to men. These presents were also called ευραία: for, among the Greeks, virgins before marriage were under strict confinement, being rarely permitted to appear in public, or converse with the other sex; and when allowed that liberty, wore a veil over their faces, termed Καπνοφόροι, or Καπνοφόροι, which was not left off in the presence of men till the third day after marriage; whence, according to Hesychius, this day was also called anacalypserion.\n\nANACAMPEROS, in Botany, a synonyme of the portulaca and several other plants.\n\nANACAMPTERIA, in Ecclesiastical Antiquity, a kind of little edifices adjacent to the churches, designed for the entertainment of strangers and poor persons.\n\nANACAMPTIC, a name applied by the ancients to that part of optics which treats of reflection, being the same with what is now called Catoptrics.\n\nANACARDIUM, or CASHEW-NUT TREE. See Botany Index.\n\nANACEPHALÆOSIS, in Rhetoric, the same with Recapitulation. See Recapitulation.\n\nANACHARSIS, a Scythian philosopher, who lived about 600 years before Christ. His father was one of the chiefs of his nation, and married a woman of Greece. Influenced in the Greek language by his mother, he caught the flame for Grecian literature, and prevailed upon the king to intrust him with an embassy to Athens. Arrived in that renowned city, he was introduced to Solon by one of his own countrymen, named Foxaros; and it is reported, that when he came to the door of Solon, he requested a servant to inform his master, that Anacharsis a Scythian was at the door, and was desirous of being received as his friend and guest. Solon is said to have returned for answer, that \"friendships are best formed at home.\" To this the Scythian philosopher replied, \"then let Solon who is at home, make me his friend and receive me into his house.\" Solon was so astonished at the propriety of this reply, that he gave him admittance; and, finding him upon farther acquaintance worthy of his confidence, he honoured him with his friendship. From such a well qualified master, Anacharsis rapidly acquired a knowledge of the wisdom of Greece, and the literature then in circulation. By the influence of Solon he was introduced to the principal characters of Athens, and was the first stranger who was honoured with the title of citizen by the Athenians.\n\nAfter he had resided several years at Athens, he travelled through different countries in quest of knowledge, and then returned to his native country inflamed with the desire of instructing them in the laws and the religion of the Greeks. But his countrymen were not prepared to profit by his instructions; and while he was performing sacrifice to the goddess Cybele, correspondent to a vow which he had made on...\nAnachorete his way home, he was slain by an arrow, said to have proceeded from the king's own hand. Thus fell the Scythian philosopher a victim to the folly and ignorance of his countrymen, who wantonly rejected the wisdom and learning of Greece.\n\nThe energetic manner in which he was accustomed to express himself, gave birth to the proverbial saying, \"Scythian eloquence.\" Although the potter's wheel was invented in the days of Homer, some have inaccurately ascribed its invention to Anacharsis. The following ingenious sayings may be mentioned as a specimen of his genius. \"The best way of teaching a youth sobriety, is to set before his eyes a drunken man. The vine bears three sorts of fruit; the first pleasure, the second intoxication, the third remorse. An ape is by nature ridiculous; man by art and study. An Athenian of bad morals reproached him with being a Scythian: to him he replied, 'My country may be a disgrace to me, but you are a disgrace to your country.'\" Some suppose, that the epithets which bear his name are spurious. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nANACHORET, in Church History, denotes a hermit, or solitary monk, who retires from the society of mankind into some desert, with a view to avoid the temptations of the world, and to be more at leisure for meditation and prayer. Such were Paul, Anthony, and Hilarius, the first founders of monastic life in Egypt and Palestine.\n\nAnachorets, among the Greeks, consist principally of monks, who retire to caves or cells, with the leave of the abbot, and an allowance from the monastery; or who, weary of the fatigues of the monastery, purchase a spot of ground, to which they retreat, never appearing again in the monastery unless on solemn occasions.\n\nANACHRONISM, in Matters of Literature, an error with respect to chronology, whereby an event is placed earlier than it really happened.—The word is compounded of ἀνα, \"higher,\" and χρόνος, \"time.\" Such is that of Virgil, who placed Dido in Africa at the time of Æneas, though in reality she did not come there till 300 years after the taking of Troy.—An error on the other side, whereby a fact is placed later and lower than it should be, is called a paracronism.\n\nANACLASTIC GLASSES, a kind of famous phials or glases, chiefly made in Germany, which have the property of being flexible, and emitting a vehement noise by the human breath.—They are also called vexing glasses by the Germans (vexier glaser), on account of the fright and disturbance they occasion by their reflection. The anaclastic glasses are a low kind of phials with flat bellies, resembling inverted funnels, whose bottoms are very thin, scarce surpassing the thickness of an onion peel: this bottom is not quite flat, but a little convex. But upon applying the mouth to the orifice, and gently inhaling, or as it were sucking out the air, the bottom gives way with a prodigious crack, and of convex becomes concave. On the contrary, upon expiring or breathing gently into the orifice of the same glass, the bottom with no less noise bounds back to its former place, and becomes gibbous as before.—The anaclastic glasses first taken notice of were in the castle of Goldbach; where one of the academists Nature Curiosorum, having seen and made experiments on them, published a piece extemp on their history and phenomena. They are all made of a fine white glass. It is to be observed, 1. That if anaclastics the bottom be concave at the time of inspiration, it will burst; and the like will happen if it be convex at the time of expiration. 2. A strong breath will have the same effect even under the contrary circumstances.\n\nANACLASTICS, that part of optics which considers the refraction of light, and is commonly called Dioptries. See Dioptries.\n\nANACLETERIA, in Antiquity, a solemn festival celebrated by the ancients when their kings or princes came of age, and assumed the reins of government. It is so called, because proclamation being made of this event to the people, they went to salute their prince during the anacleteria, and to congratulate him upon his new dignity.\n\nANACLETICUM, in the Ancient Art of War, a particular blast of the trumpet, whereby the fearful and flying soldiers were rallied, and recalled to combat.\n\nANACLINOPALE, ἀνακλινωπάλη, in Antiquity, a kind of wrestling, wherein the champions threw themselves voluntarily on the ground, and continued the combat by pinching, biting, scratching, and other methods of offence. The Anaclinopale were contradistinguished from the Orthopale, wherein the champions stood erect. In the Anaclinopale, the weaker combatants sometimes gained the victory.\n\nANACLINTERIA, in Antiquity, a kind of pillows on the dining bed, whereon the guests used to lean. The ancient triclinary beds had four pillows, one at the head, another at the feet, a third at the back, and fourth at the breast. That on which the head lay, was properly called by the Greeks κεφαλής or κεφαλίστης; by the Romans fulcrum, sometimes platus.\n\nANACOLLEMA, a composition of astringent powders, applied by the ancients to the head, to prevent defluxions on the eyes.\n\nANACONDO, in Natural History, is a name given in the isle of Ceylon to a very large and terrible snake, which often devours the unfortunate traveller alive, and is itself accounted excellent and delicious fare. It is probably the Boa Constrictor.\n\nANACREON, a Greek poet, born at Teos, a city of Ionia, flourished about 532 years before the Christian era. Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, invited him to his court, and made him share with him in his business and his pleasures. He had a delicate wit, as may be judged from the inexplicable beauties and graces that thine in his works: but he was fond of pleasure, was of an amorous disposition, and addicted to drunkenness: yet, notwithstanding his debaucheries, he lived to the age of 85; when, we are told, he was choked by a grapestone which stuck in his throat as he was regaling on some new wine.\n\nThere is but a small part of Anacreon's works that remain: for, besides his odes and epigrams, he composed elegies, hymns, and iambics. His poems which are extant were rescued from oblivion by Henry Stephens, and are universally admired. The verses of Anacreon are sweeter, says Scaliger, than Indian sugar. His beauty and chief excellence, says Madame Dacier, lay in imitating nature, and in following reason; so that he presented to the mind no images but what were noble and natural. The odes of Anacreon, says Ra-\nAnaereon-pin, are flowers, beauties, and perpetual graces; it is familiar to him to write what is natural, and to the life, having an air so delicate, so easy, and graceful, that among all the ancients there is nothing comparable to the method he took, nor to that kind of writing he followed. He flows soft and easy, everywhere diffusing the joy and indolence of his mind through his verse, and tuning his harp to the smooth and pleasant temper of his soul. But none has given a juster character of his writings than the God of Love, as taught to speak by Mr Cowley:\n\nAll thy verse is softer far\nThan the downy feathers are\nOf my wings, or of my arrows,\nOf my mother's doves and sparrows:\nGraceful, cleanly, smooth, or round,\nAll with Venus' girdle bound.\n\nANACREONTIC VERSE, in Ancient Poetry, a kind of verse, so called from its being much used by the poet Anacreon. It consists of three feet and a half, usually spondees and iambules, and sometimes anapests: Such is that of Horace,\n\nLydia, die per omnes.\n\nANACRISIS, among the Ancient Greeks, was used for a kind of trial or examination, which the archons, or chief magistrates of Athens, were to undergo before their admission into that office. The anacrisis stands distinguished from the docimasia, which was a second examination in the forum. The anacrisis was performed in the senate-house. The questions here propounded to them were concerning their family, kindred, behaviour, estate, &c. Some will have it that all magistrates underwent the anacrisis.\n\nANACRISIS, among Civilians, an investigation of truth, interrogation of witnesses, and inquiry made into any fact, especially by torture.\n\nANACROSIS, in Antiquity, denotes a part of the Pythian song, wherein the combat of Apollo and Python are described.—The anacrosis was the first part, and contained the preparation to the fight.\n\nANACYCLUS. See Botany Index.\n\nANADAVADÆA, in Ornithology, a barbarous name of a species of alauda. See Alauda, Ornithology Index.\n\nANADEMA, among the Ancients, denotes an ornament of the head, wherewith victors at the sacred games had their temples bound.\n\nANADIPLOSIS, in Rhetoric and Poetry, a repetition of the last word of a line, or clause of a sentence, in the beginning of the next: Thus,\n\nPierides, vos habe faciatis maxima Gallo:\nGallo, cujus amor, &c.\nEt matutinis acrevula vocibus inflat,\nVocibus inflat, et affluens facit ore querelas.\n\nANADROMOUS, among Ichthyologists, a name given to such fishes as go from the sea to the fresh waters at stated seasons, and return back again; such as the salmon, &c. See Salmo.\n\nANADUOMENE VENUS, in the Grecian Mythology, answered to the Sea Venus in the Roman, and was the appellation given to one of the chief deities of the sea. The most celebrated picture in all antiquity was that of this goddess by Apelles; and the famous Venus of Medicis is a Sea Venus.\n\nANÆDEIA, in Antiquity, a denomination given to a silver stool placed in the Areopagus, on which the defendant, or person accused, was seated for examination. The word is Greek, ἀναδία, which imports imprudence; but according to Junius's correction, it should rather be ἀναδία, q.d. innocence. The plaintiff or accuser, was placed on an opposite stool called βυρτίς, or injury; here he propounded three questions to the party accused, to which positive answers were to be given. The first, Are you guilty of this fact? The second, How did you commit the fact? The third, Who were your accomplices?\n\nANÆSTHESIA, signifies a privation of the senses.\n\nANAGALIS, PIMPERNEL. See Botany Index.\n\nANAGNIA, in Ancient Geography, a town of Latium, capital of the Hernici; which, after a faint resistance, submitting to the Romans, was admitted to the freedom of the city, yet without the right of suffrage, (Livy). It was afterwards a colony of Drusus Caesar, and walled round, and its territory assigned to the veterans, (Frontinus). Here Antony married Cleopatra, and divorced Octavia. Now Anagni, 36 miles to the east of Rome. Long. 13. 45. N. Lat. 42. 48.\n\nANAGNOSTA, or ANAGNOSTES, in Antiquity, a kind of literary servant, retained in the families of persons of distinction, whose chief business was to read to them during meals, or at any other time when they were at leisure. Cornelius Nepos relates of Atticus, that he had always an agnostes at his meals. He never supped without reading; so that the minds of his guests were no less agreeably entertained than their appetites. The same custom, Egihard observes, was kept up by Charlemagne, who at table had the histories and acts of ancient kings read to him. This custom seems to have been a relic of that of the ancient Greeks, who had the praises of great men and heroes sung to them while at table. The ancient monks and clergy kept up the like usage, as we are informed by St Augustin.\n\nANAGOGICAL, signifies mysterious, transporting; and is used to express whatever elevates the mind, not only to the knowledge of divine things, but of divine things in the next life. This word is seldom used, but with regard to the different senses of Scripture. The anagogical sense is, when the sacred text is explained with regard to eternal life, the point which Christians should have in view: for example, the rest of the Sabbath, in the anagogical sense, signifies the repose of everlasting happiness.\n\nANAGOGY, or ANAGOGIE, among Ecclesiastical Writers, the elevation of the mind to things celestial and eternal.—It is particularly used, where words, in their natural or primary meaning, denote something sensible, but have a further view to something spiritual or invisible.\n\nANAGOGY, in a more particular sense, denotes the application of the types and allegories of the Old Testament to subjects of the New; thus called, because the veil being here drawn, what before was hidden is exposed to open sight.\n\nANAGRAM (from the Greek ανα, backwards, and γράμμα,\nAnagram (Greek, letter), in matters of literature, a transposition of the letters of some name, whereby a new word is formed, either to the advantage or disadvantage of the person or thing to which the name belongs. Thus, the anagram of Galenus is alegasus; that of Logica, caligo; that of Alstedius, sedulitias; that of Loraine is alerion, on which account it was that the family of Loraine took alerions for their armoury.—Calvin, in the title of his Institutions, printed at Straßburg in 1539, calls himself Alcuinatus, which is the anagram of Calvinus, and the name of an eminently learned person in the time of Charlemagne, who contributed greatly to the restoration of learning in that age.\n\nThose who adhere strictly to the definition of an anagram, take no other liberty than that of omitting or retaining the letter h, at pleasure; whereas others make no scruple to use e for æ, v for w, s for z, and c for k; and vice versa.\n\nBesides anagrams formed as above, we meet with another kind in ancient writers, made by dividing a single word into several; thus, fæs linea mus, are formed out of the word fæstiniamus.\n\nAnagrams are sometimes also made out of several words: such as that on the question put by Pilate to our Saviour, Quid est veritas? whereof we have this admirable anagram, viz. Eft vir qui adeit.\n\nThe Cabalists among the Jews are professed anagrammatists; the third part of their art, which they call themur, i.e. \"changing,\" being nothing but the art of making anagrams, or of finding hidden and mystical meanings in names; which they do by changing, transposing, and differently combining, the letters of those names.—Thus, of the letters of Noah's name, they make ἐλέος grace; of ἐνώπιον the Messiah, they make ἐνώπιον be shall rejoice.\n\nANAGRAMMATIST, a maker or composer of anagrams. Thomas Billon, a Provençal, was a celebrated anagrammatist, and retained by Louis XIII. with a pension of 1200 livres, in quality of anagrammatist to the king.\n\nANAGROS, in Commerce, a measure for grain used in some cities of Spain, particularly at Seville; 46 anagros make about 10½ quarters of London.\n\nANAGYRIS, STINKING BEAN-TREFOL. See Botany Index.\n\nANAGYRIS, or ANAGYRUS, in Ancient Geography, the name of a place in Attica, of the tribe Erechtheis, where a feild plant, called Anagyris, probably the same with the foregoing, grew in great plenty, (Diodorus, Pliny, Stephanus;) and the more it was handled, the stronger it smelled; hence commovere anagyrim or (anagyrum), is to bring a misfortune on one's self, (Aristophanes).\n\nANAK, the father of the Anakims, was the son of Arba, who gave his name to Kirjath-arba, or Hebron, (Josh. xiv. 15.) Anak had three sons, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, (chap. xv. 14. and Numb. xiii. 22.), who, as well as their father, were giants, and who, with their posterity, all terrible for their fierceness and extraordinary stature, were called the Anakims; in comparison of whom the Hebrews, who were sent to view the land of Canaan, reported that they were but as grasshoppers, Numb. xiii. ult. Caleb, affiliated by the tribe of Judah, took Kirjath-arba, and destroyed the Anakims (Judges i. 20. and Josh. xv. 14.) in the Anakims' year of the world 2559.\n\nANALECTA, or ANALECTES, in Antiquity, a fervent whose employment it was to gather up the offals of tables.\n\nANALECTA, Analects, in a literary sense, is used to denote a collection of small pieces; as, essays, remarks, &c.\n\nANALEmma, in Geometry, a projection of the sphere on the plane of the meridian, orthographically made by straight lines and ellipses, the eye being supposed at an infinite distance, and in the east or west points of the horizon.\n\nANALEmma, denotes likewise an instrument of brass or wood, upon which this kind of projection is drawn, with a horizon and cursor fitted to it, wherein the foliaceous colour, and all circles parallel to it will be concentric circles; all circles oblique to the eye will be ellipses; and all circles whose planes pass through the eye, will be right lines. The use of this instrument is to show the common astronomical problems; which it will do, though not very exactly, unless it be very large.\n\nANALEPSIS, the augmentation or nutrition of an emaciated body.\n\nANALEPTICS, restorative or nourishing medicines.\n\nANALOGY, in Philosophy, a certain relation and agreement between two or more things, which in other respects are entirely different.\n\nThere is likewise an analogy between beings that have some conformity or resemblance to one another; for example, between animals and plants; but the analogy is still stronger between two different species of certain animals.\n\nAnalogy enters much into all our reasoning, and serves to explain and illustrate. A great part of our philosophy, indeed, has no other foundation than analogy.\n\nIt is natural to mankind to judge of things less known, by some similitude, real or imaginary, between them and things more familiar or better known. And where the things compared have really a great similitude in their nature, when there is reason to think that they are subject to the same laws, there may be a considerable degree of probability in conclusions drawn from analogy. Thus we may observe a very great similitude between this earth which we inhabit, and the other planets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. They all revolve round the sun, as the earth does, although at different distances, and in different periods. They borrow all their light from the sun, as the earth does. Several of them are known to revolve round their axis like the earth, and, by that means, must have a like succession of day and night. Some of them have moons, that serve to give them light in the absence of the sun, as our moon does to us. They are all, in their motions, subject to the same law of gravitation as the earth is. From all this similitude, it is not unreasonable to think, that those planets may, like our earth, be the habitation of various orders of living creatures. There is some probability in this conclusion from analogy.\n\nBut it ought to be observed, that, as this kind of reasoning\nAnalogy reasoning can afford only probable evidence at best; so unless great caution be used, we are apt to be led into error by it. To give an instance of this: Anatomists, in ancient ages, seldom dissected human bodies; but very often the bodies of those quadrupeds whose internal structure was thought to approach nearest to that of the human body. Modern anatomists have discovered many mistakes the ancients were led into, by their conceiving a greater similitude between the structure of men and of some beasts than there is in reality.\n\nPerhaps no author has made a more just and a more happy use of this mode of reasoning, than Bishop Butler in his Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature. In that excellent work, the author does not ground any of the truths of religion upon analogy, as their proper evidence. He only makes use of analogy to answer objections against them. When objections are made against the truths of religion, which may be made with equal strength against what we know to be true in the course of nature, such objections can have no weight.\n\nAnalogical reasoning, therefore, may be of excellent use in answering objections against truths which have other evidence. It may likewise give a greater or a less degree of probability in cases where we can find no other evidence. But all arguments drawn from analogy are still the weaker, the greater disparity there is between the things compared; and therefore must be weakest of all when we compare body with mind, because there are no two things in nature more unlike.\n\nThere is no subject in which men have always been so prone to form their notions by analogies of this kind, as in what relates to the mind. We form an early acquaintance with material things by means of our senses, and are bred up in a constant familiarity with them. Hence we are apt to measure all things by them; and to ascribe to things most remote from matter the qualities that belong to material things. It is for this reason that mankind have, in all ages, been so prone to conceive the mind itself to be some subtle kind of matter: That they have been disposed to ascribe human figure and human organs not only to angels, but even to the Deity.\n\nTo illustrate more fully that analogical reasoning from a supposed similitude of mind to body, which appears to be the most fruitful source of error with regard to the operations of our minds, the following instance may be given. When a man is urged by contrary motives, those on one hand inciting him to do some action, those on the other to forbear it; he deliberates about it, and at last resolves to do it, or not to do it. The contrary motives are here compared to the weights in the opposite scales of a balance; and there is not perhaps any instance that can be named of a more striking analogy between body and mind. Here the phrases of weighing motives, of deliberating upon actions, are common to all languages.\n\nFrom this analogy, some philosophers draw very important conclusions. They say, that as the balance cannot incline to one side more than the other when the opposite weights are equal, so a man cannot possibly determine himself if the motives on both hands are equal; and as the balance must necessarily turn to that side which has most weight, so the man must necessarily be determined to that hand where the motive is strongest. And on this foundation some of the schoolmen maintained, that if a hungry ass were placed between two bundles of hay equally inviting, the beast must stand still and starve to death, being unable to turn to either, because there are equal motives to both. This is an instance of that analogical reasoning, which, it is conceived, ought never to be trifled; for the analogy between a balance and a man deliberating, though one of the strongest that can be found between matter and mind, is too weak to support any argument. A piece of dead inactive matter, and an active intelligent being, are things very unlike; and because the one would remain at rest in a certain case, it does not follow that the other would be inactive in a case somewhat similar. The argument is no better than this, that because a dead animal moves only as it is pushed, and if pushed with equal force in contrary directions, must remain at rest; therefore the same thing must happen to a living animal: for surely the similitude between a dead animal and a living is as great as that between a balance and a man.\n\nThe derivation of the word Analogy indicates, as Professor Caillion of Berlin * observes, a resemblance * Haerlem discernible by reason. This is confirmed by the same Memoirs in which the term is used in geometry, where it signifies an equality of ratios. In explaining this subject, vol. xxii., it is observed, there may be a resemblance between sensations and a resemblance between perceptions: the former is called physical resemblance, because it acts upon the physical or sensitive faculty; the latter moral resemblance, because it affects the moral or rational faculty of man.\n\nEvery resemblance may be reduced to an equality in sensations or perceptions; but this supposes some equality in their causes: we say some equality, because the disposition of the organs, or of the soul, must necessarily affect the sensations or perceptions; but this can influence only their degree, and not their nature.\n\nThe character of one person resembles that of another only when they both speak and act so as to excite equal perceptions, or, to speak more strictly, the same perception; when they both display vivacity or indifference, anger or meekness, on the same occasions, and both excite in the soul of the observer identical perceptions, or rather the same perception of vivacity or indifference, of anger or meekness. These identical perceptions, the degree of which will depend much on the disposition of the observer's mind, must have identical causes, or, in other words, the same cause; which is the vivacity or indifference, the anger or meekness, displayed by each of these characters.\n\nEvery physical resemblance may therefore be reduced to one or more equalities, and every moral resemblance to one or more identities. Wherever there is moral resemblance there is analogy. Analogy may, therefore be reduced to identity, and always supposes comparison.\n\nTwo objects are said to have an analogy to each other, or are called analogous, when some identity is discovered upon comparing them. An analogical conclusion is a conclusion deduced from some identity.\n\nThe principles of analogy are a comparison of two objects; and one or more identities resulting from their being thus compared. The characters of analogy are—two objects be compared—that there be one or more identities between these objects—and that this is discernible only by reason or intellect.\nPhysical resemblance is to the senses what analogy is to the understanding. The former, when perfect, becomes equality; but the latter, identity.\n\nResemblance and analogy are the foundations both of probability and of certainty. When we are not satisfied that the resemblance or the analogy is complete, we stop at probability; which becomes certainty when we are, or think we are, assured that the resemblance or the analogy is perfect.\n\nIn reasoning by analogy, we should be careful not to confound it with resemblance; and also not to deduce from the identity or identities, on which the analogy is founded, a conclusion which has either no relation, or only a partial relation, to these identities.\n\nThe principal use of analogy in the investigation of physical and moral truth, according to our author, may be reduced to the four following: 1. By means of our senses to improve, first our own judgment, and afterwards that of others, with respect to intellectual subjects. 2. To deduce a general from a particular truth. Having discovered and proved the truth of a proposition with respect to any particular object, examine whether this truth flows from a quality peculiar to this single object, or common to several objects. In the latter case all these objects may be comprehended under one general idea, founded on their common quality. Substitute this general idea instead of the particular object, and the proposition will become general, without ceasing to be true; because whatever evidently and solely results from the identity on which an analogy is founded, must necessarily be true with respect to all those objects in which the analogy is the same. 3. To prove the truth or falsehood of propositions which cannot be otherwise demonstrated. 4. To discover new truths in both natural and moral philosophy.\n\nAnalogy, among Grammarians, is the correspondence which a word or phrase bears to the genius and received forms of any language.\n\nAnalysis, in a general sense, implies the resolution of something compounded into its original and constituent parts. The word is Greek, and derived from ἀναλύειν, to resolve.\n\nAnalysis, in Mathematics, is properly the method of resolving problems by means of algebraical equations; whence we often find that these two words, analysis and algebra, are used as synonymous.\n\nAnalysis, under its present improvements, must be allowed the apex or height of all human learning: it is this method which furnishes us with the most perfect examples of the art of reasoning; gives the mind an uncommon readiness at deducing and discovering, from a few data, things unknown; and, by using signs for ideas, presents things to the imagination, which otherwise seemed out of its sphere: by this, geometrical demonstrations may be greatly abridged, and a long series of argumentations, wherein the mind cannot without the utmost effort and attention discover the connection of ideas, are hereby converted into sensible signs, and the several operations required therein effected by the combination of those signs. But, what is more extraordinary, by means of this art, a number of truths are frequently expressed by a single line, which in the common way of explaining and demonstrating things would fill whole volumes. Thus, by mere contemplation of one single line, whole sciences may be sometimes learned in a few minutes time, which otherwise could scarce be attained in many years.\n\nAnalysis is divided, with regard to its object, into that of finites and infinites.\n\nAnalysis of Finite Quantities, is what we otherwise call species arithmetic or algebra. See Algebra.\n\nAnalysis of Infinites, called also the New Analysis, is particularly used for the method of fluxions, or the differential calculus. See Fluxions.\n\nAnalysis, in Logic, signifies the method of tracing things backward to their source, and of resolving knowledge into its original principles. This is also called the method of resolution; and stands opposed to the synthetic method, or that of composition. The art of logical analysis consists principally in combining our perceptions, clasping them together with address, and contriving proper expressions for conveying our thoughts, and representing their several divisions, classes, and relations.\n\nAnalysis, in Rhetoric, is that which examines the connexions, tropes, figures, and the like, inquiring into the proposition, division, passions, arguments, and other apparatus of rhetoric.\n\nSeveral authors, as Freigius and others, have given analyses of Cicero's Orations, wherein they reduce them to their grammatical and logical principles; strip them of all the ornaments and additions of rhetoric which otherwise disguise their true form, and conceal the connexion between one part and another. The design of these authors is to have those admired harmonies just such as the judgment disposed them, without the help of imagination; so that here we may coolly view the force of each proof, and admire the use Cicero made of rhetorical figures to conceal the weak part of a cause.\n\nA collection has been made of the analyses formed by the most celebrated authors of the 16th century, in 3 vols. folio.\n\nAnalysis is also used, in Chemistry, for the decomposing of a mixed body, or the separation of the principles and constituent parts of a compound substance.\n\nTo analyze bodies, or resolve them into their component parts, is indeed the chief object of the art of chemistry. Chemistry furnishes several means for the decomposition of bodies, which are all founded on the differences of the properties belonging to the different principles of which the body to be analyzed is composed. If, for example, a body be composed of several principles, some of which have a great and others a moderate degree of volatility, and, lastly, others are fixed, its most volatile parts may be first separated by a gradual heat in distilling vessels; and then the parts which are next in volatility will pass over in distillation; and lastly, those parts which are fixed, and capable of resisting the action of fire, will remain at the bottom of the vessel.\n\nAnalysis is also used for a kind of syllabus, or table of the principal heads or articles of a continued discourse, disposed in their natural order and dependency. Analyses are more scientific than alphabetical indexes; but they are less used, as being more intricate.\n\nAnalysis is likewise used for a brief, but methodical, illustration of the principles of a science; in which\nAnalytic sense it is nearly synonymous with what we otherwise call a *synopsis*.\n\n**Analytic**, or **Analytical**, something that belongs to, or partakes of, the nature of analysis.—Thus we say, an analytical demonstration, analytical process, analytical table or scheme, analytical method of investigation, &c.\n\nThe analytic method stands opposed to the synthetic. In natural philosophy, as in mathematics, the investigation of difficult things by the analytic method ought to precede the method of composition. This analysis consists in making experiments and observations, and in drawing general conclusions therefrom by induction; and admitting of no objections against the conclusions, but such as are drawn from experiments, and other certain truths: and though the reasoning from experiments and observations by induction be no demonstration of general conclusions, yet it is the best method of reasoning which the nature of things admits of; and may be esteemed so much the stronger, as the induction is more general; and, if no exception occur from phenomena, the conclusion may be pronounced general. By this way of analysis, we may proceed from compounds to their ingredients; from motions to the forces producing them; and in general from effects to their causes, and from particular causes to more general ones, until we arrive at those which are the most general. This is the analytic method, according to the illustrious Newton.\n\nThe synthetic method consists in affixing the causes discovered and received as principles: and by them explaining the phenomena proceeding from them, and proving the explanation. See **Synthesis**.\n\n**Analytics**, *Analytica*, the science and use of analysis. The great advantage of the modern mathematics above the ancient is in point of analytics.\n\nPappus, in the preface to his seventh book of Mathematical Collections, enumerates the authors on the ancient analytics; being Euclid, in his *Data* and *Parallelograms*; Apollonius, *de Sectione Rationis*, and in his *Conics*; Aristaes, *de Locis Solidis*; and Eratothenes, *de Medis Proportionalibus*. But the ancient analytics were very different from the modern.\n\nTo the modern analytics principally belongs algebra; an historical account of which, with the several authors thereon, see under the article **Algebra**.\n\n**Anamaboa**, a populous town in the kingdom of Fantin, in Guinea. The natives are generally great cheats, and must be carefully looked after in dealing with them, and their gold well examined, for it is commonly adulterated. It lies under the cannon of the English castle. The landing is pretty difficult on account of the rocks: and therefore those that come here to trade are forced to go ashore in canoes. The earth here is very proper to make bricks; the oysters, when burnt, afford good lime; and there is timber in great abundance; so that here are all the materials for building. The country at Anamaboa is full of hills, beginning at a good distance from the town, and affording a very pleasant prospect. Indian corn and palm-wine are in great plenty. They have a green fruit called *papaya*, as big as a small melon, and which has a taste like cauliflower. Anamaboa is much frequented by the English ships and others for corn and slaves, which last are sometimes to be had in great numbers. The English fort is built on the foundation of a large old house, which subsided entire in 1679. It is a large edifice, flanked by two towers, and fortified towards the sea with two bastions: the whole of brick and stone cemented with lime. It stands upon a rock at the distance of 30 paces from the sea. It is mounted with 12 pieces of cannon and 12 patercocks; and defended by a garrison of 12 whites and 18 blacks, under the command of the chief factor.\n\nThe natives treat the garrison of this fort with great insolence, inasmuch as often to block them up, and frequently, if they dislike the governor, send him off in a canoe to Cape Coast with marks of the utmost contempt. Far from being able to oppose them, the English are glad to obtain their favour with presents. In 1701, they declared war against the English; and having assembled in a tumultuous manner before the fort, they let fire to the exterior buildings, and went on with their outrages, till they were dispersed by a discharge of the cannon from the batteries. The night following the English took their revenge, by setting fire to the town of Anamaboa: and thus hostilities continued for 20 days, till at last the natives were obliged to sue for peace. This fort was abandoned in 1733; but has been resumed by the English, who have continued in it ever since.\n\n**Anamelech**, an idol of the Sepharvaites, who are said in Scripture to have burned their children in honour of Adrammelech and Anamelech.—These idols probably signified the sun and moon. Some of the rabbins represent Anamelech under the figure of a mule, others under that of a quail or pheasant.\n\n**Ananim**, the second son of Mizraim (Gen. x. 13.) Ananim, if we may credit the paraphraff Jona- than the son of Uzziel, peopled the Mareotic; or the Pentapolis of Cyrene, according to the paraphraff of Jerusalem. Bochart is of opinion, that these Ananimims were the people that dwelt in the parts adjacent to the temple of Jupiter Ammon, and in the Nafamositis. Calmet thinks the Amanians and Garamantes to be descended from Ananim.\n\n**Anamorphosis**, in *Perspective Drawings*, is a deformed or distorted portrait or figure, generally confused and unintelligible to the common unassisted view; but when seen at a certain distance and height, or as reflected from a plain or curved mirror, will appear regular and in right proportion. See **Optics** (the Index) and **Perspective**.\n\n**Ananas**, in Botany, the trivial name of a species of bromelia. See **Bromelia**, Botany Index.\n\n**Anancitis**, in Antiquity, a kind of figured stone, otherwise called *synochitis*, celebrated for its magical virtue of nulling the shadows of the infernal gods.\n\n**Ananias**, a Sadducee, high-priest of the Jews, who put to death St James the brother of our Lord, and was deposed by Agrippa.\n\n**Ananisabta**, or **Ananisapta**, a magical word frequently found inscribed on coins and other amulets, supposed to have a virtue of preserving the wearer from the plague.\n\n**Anapæst**, in Ancient Poetry, a foot consisting of two short syllables and one long: Such is the word *foçpúlos*. It is just the reverse of the dactyl.\n\n**Anapæstic Verses**, those consisting wholly or chiefly of anapaests.\nANAPHE, in Ancient Geography, an island spontaneously emerging out of the Cretan sea, near Thera (Pliny, Strabo); now called Naxos. Its name is from the sudden appearance of the new moon to the Argonauts in a storm (Apollonius). Anaphaeus, an epithet of Apollo, who was worshipped there. Anapai, the people.\n\nANAPHORA, in Rhetoric, the repetition of the same word or words in the beginning of a sentence or verse: Thus Virgil,\n\nPan etiam Arcadia mecum se judice certet,\nPan etiam Arcadia dicat se judice victum.\n\nANAPHORA, among Physicians, the throwing off putrid matter by the mouth.\n\nANAPHRODISIA, signifies impotence, or want of power to procreate. See IMPOTENCE.\n\nANAPLASIS, signifies the replacing or setting a fractured bone.\n\nANAPLORETICS, medicines that promote the growth or granulation of the flesh in wounds, ulcers, &c.\n\nANARCHI, Anaxi, in Antiquity, a name given by the Athenians to four supernumerary days in their year, during which they had no magistrates. The Attic year was divided into 10 parts, according to the number of tribes, to whom the precedence of the senate fell by turns. Each division consisted of 35 days; what remained after the expiration of these, to make the lunar year complete, which according to their computation consisted of 354 days, were employed in the creation of magistrates, and called anaxeiou nupseis, and anaxeiou nupseis.\n\nANARCHY, the want of government in a nation, where no supreme authority is lodged either in the prince or other rulers; but the people live at large, and all things are in confusion. The word is derived from the Greek privative α, and ἀρχή, command, principality. Anarchy is supposed to have reigned after the deluge, before the foundation of monarchies. We still find it obtain in several parts, particularly of Africa and America.\n\nAnarchy is also applied to certain troublesome and disorderly periods, even in governments otherwise regular. In England, the period between the death of Cromwell and King Charles's restoration is commonly represented as anarchy. Every month produced a new scheme or form of government. Enthusiasts talked of nothing but annulling all the laws, abolishing all writings, records, and registers, and bringing all men to the primitive level. No modern nation was more subject to anarchies than Poland; where every interval between the death of one king and the election of another was a scene of great disorder, so that it was a proverb among that people, Poland is governed by confusion. The Jewish history presents numerous instances of anarchies in that state, usually denoted by this phrase, that in those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes; which is a just picture of anarchy.\n\nANARRHICAS. See ICHTHYOLOGY Index.\n\nANARROPIA, among Physicians, a tendency of the humours to the head or superior parts.\n\nANAS, in Ancient Geography, a river of Spain, rising in the territory of Laminium in the Hither Spain, and now spreading into lakes, again restraining its waters, or, burrowing itself entirely in the earth, is pleased often to reappear. It pours into the Atlantic (Pliny). Now Guadiana, rising in the south-east of New Castile, in a district commonly called Campo de Montiel, not far from the mountain Consegura, from the lakes called las Lagunas de Guadiana, and then it is called Rio Royales; and, after a course of six leagues, burying itself in the earth for a league, it then rises up again from three lakes, called los Ojos de Guadiana, near the village Villa Harta, five leagues to the north of Calatrava, and directs its course westward through New Castile, by Medelin, Merida, and Badajoz, where it begins to bend its course southwards, between Portugal and Andalusia, falling into the bay of Cadiz near Ayamonte.\n\nANAS. See ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nANASARCA, a species of droopy. See MEDICINE.\n\nANASSER. See BOTANY Index.\n\nANASSUS, or ANAXUS, in Ancient Geography, a river in the territory of Venice, (Pliny); now the Piave, which rising from the mountains of Tyrol, not far from the borders of Carinthia, runs from north to south, through the territories of Cadorina, Belluno, Feltre, and, after running from west to east, through Trevigl, falls into the Adriatic, 13 miles to the south-east of Venice.\n\nANASTATICA. See BOTANY Index.\n\nANASTASIS, a term among ancient physicians, for rising up to go to stool. It also signifies the passage of any humour, when expelled from one part, and obliged to remove to another.\n\nANASTASIIUS I., emperor of the east, succeeded Zeno in the year 491, and was inaugurated that same year on April the 1st. The Manicheans and Arians were greatly in hopes of being supported by the new emperor; the former because his mother was their friend, and favoured their sect; the latter because the emperor's uncle was of their opinion: but if Anastasius did not persecute them (as we do not find he ever did), yet it does not appear that he supported either of these sects. But in order to maintain the peace of the church, upon which the tranquillity of the state very much depends, he declared, that such bishops or other clergymen who should disturb the public tranquillity, by maintaining with too much heat either side of the question for or against the council of Chalcedon, should be deprived of their benefices. Accordingly the disputes concerning Eutychianism running to a very great height, and Euphemius being deeply concerned in them, the emperor expelled him from his see, and chose Macedonius in his stead. The hatred which the different parties entertained against one another occasioned often such tumults and seditions at Constantinople as threatened the life of the emperor himself; who, to keep the people in awe, ordered that the governor of the city should be present at all church assemblies and public processions. This was so much the more necessary, because these tumults were chiefly occasioned by a kind of doxology or short hymn which used to be sung at divine service. This doxology consisted only of the following words, ἀγαπεῖς ὁ Θεός, ἀγαπεῖς ἐξουσίας, ἀγαπεῖς ἀδιάνυστος, that is, \"Holy God, holy the powerful, holy the immortal;\" for which reason it was called.\nAnaftasius, called τριάντας, Triagius, \"three times holy;\" because the word holy was therein three times repeated. The orthodox used to sing that hymn without any addition, or by adding only to it, ἀγαπήσεις, ἀγαπήσεις, i.e., \"Holy Trinity, have mercy upon us.\" But Peter the Fuller, bishop of Antioch, pretended to add these words to it, viz. ἐκ τριάδος, ἐκ τριάδος, i.e., \"who hath been crucified for us;\" and as it was supposed that the first holy related to the Father, the second to the Son, the third to the Holy Ghost, the adding these words, who has been crucified for us, seemed to intimate that the whole consubstantial Trinity had suffered; for which reason the orthodox were resolved not to admit this addition. Anaftasius desiring to have these fatal words added to that hymn whenever it should be sung at Constantinople, this occasioned a terrible sedition in the city, as though the very fundamentals of Christianity had been overthrown. Macedonius and his clergy are said to have raised that sedition, which came to such a height, that the emperor himself was obliged to come, without his crown on his head, and in a very humble manner, to the circus, where he declared to the people that he was very willing to quit the imperial throne; but he told them at the same time, that they could not all enjoy the sovereign power, which does not admit of a partnership; and that one person still must govern them if he resigned the crown. This discourse had such a power over the raging multitude, that, as if they had been divinely inspired, they immediately requested the emperor to take up his crown, promising that they would be quiet and obedient for the future. Anaftasius is by the Popish writers represented as a great persecutor of the orthodox, because he banished and deprived Euphemius and Macedonius; but they should prove that these two prelates had been unjustly banished, which is a very hard task. As to his civil government, it is confessed that at the beginning of his reign he showed himself a very good prince: he eased the people of a very heavy tax called θρησκευτικόν, under which they had groaned for a long time; he prohibited the fighting with wild beasts; he raised several buildings; and avoided being involved in dangerous wars as much as lay in his power. Anaftasius reigned 27 years three months and three days, or, according to F. Pagl, wanting three days; and died July the 10th, A.D. 518, in the 88th year of his age.\n\nAnaftasius II, whose proper name was Artemius, was in the year 713 elevated to the throne of Constantinople, from the low station of a secretary, by the free voice of the senate and Roman people. His natural talents, improved by education and daily exertion, enabled him to manage with great prudence the affairs of the empire during the time that he was secretary to his predecessor Philippius. The Saracens had made incursions upon Asia Minor, in the beginning of his reign; but he sent a strong army to the frontiers of Syria for its protection, under the command of Leo the Illyrian, a man of great military experience. These enemies of the empire also meditated the design of taking Constantinople; but the vigilance of Anaftasius defeated their purpose, by providing a formidable naval force, repairing and strengthening the walls of the city, and by forcing all the inhabitants either to provide themselves with provisions for three years, or instantly to depart from the city. Disappointed in their design, the Anaftasius enemy's fleet sailed to Phoenicia, and the imperial fleet assembled at Rhodes to watch the motions of the enemy. But the measures of the emperor received a severe check from the conduct of the sailors, who raised a mutiny and flew their admiral for no other cause but his honourable endeavours to maintain proper discipline in the fleet. Justly dreading severe punishment, the seamen raised the standard of rebellion, declared Anaftasius unworthy to reign, and conferred the purple upon one Theodoreus, a person of mean birth.\n\nInformed of this sedition, Anaftasius fled from his tottering throne to Nice. The new emperor hastened to besiege Constantinople, which, after a feeble defence of six months, he reduced to his subjection. The late emperor being allured of his life, abandoned his claim to the crown, assumed the character of a monk, and was banished to Thebaulonia, having worn the purple only during the space of two years. Having, however, prevailed upon the Bulgarians to espouse his cause, he laid aside the habit of the monk for that of the warrior, and in the year 719, in the time of the emperor Leo, he resumed his claim to the throne. A numerous army of these barbarians hastened to the capital; but, being unable to reduce it, they delivered up the unhappy Anaftasius to the emperor, who put him to death along with his principal associates. (Anc. Un. Hist.)\n\nAnastasius, surnamed Bibliothecarius, a Roman abbot, library-keeper of the Vatican, and one of the most learned men of the ninth century, assisted in 869 at the fourth general council, the acts and canons of which he translated from the Greek into Latin. He also composed the lives of several popes, and other works; the best edition of which is that of the Vatican.\n\nANASTATICA, the rose of Jericho. See Botany Index.\n\nANASTOMOSIS, in Anatomy, the opening of the mouths of vessels, in order to discharge their contained fluids. It is likewise used for the communication of two vessels at their extremities; as the inoculation of a vein with a vein, of an artery with an artery, or of an artery with a vein.\n\nANASTOMATICS, medicines supposed to have the power of opening the mouths of the vessels, and promoting the circulation; such as deobstruent, cathartic, and sudorific medicines.\n\nANASTROPHE, in Rhetoric and Grammar, denotes the inversion of the natural order of the words; such is, saxa per et scopulos, for per saxa et scopulos.\n\nANASUS, or Anisus, in Ancient Geography, now the Enns, a river of Germany; which rising on the borders of the territory of Salzburg; then separating Upper Styria from Upper Austria, and washing the town of Enns, falls, at the distance of a mile below it, into the Danube, in a course from south to north.\n\nANATHEMA, among Ecclesiastical Writers, imports whatever is let apart, separated, or divided; but is most usually meant to express the cutting off a person from the privileges of society and communion with the faithful.\n\nThe anathema differs from excommunication in the circumstances of being attended with curses and execrations. It was practised in the primitive church against notorious offenders; and the form of that pronounced\nAnathema pronounced by Synecus against one Andronicus is as follows: \"Let no church of God be open to Andronicus, but let every sanctuary be shut against him. I admonish both private men and magistrates to receive him neither under their roof nor to their table; and priests more especially, that they neither converse with him living, nor attend his funeral when dead.\"\n\nSeveral councils also have pronounced anathemas against such as they thought corrupted the purity of the following form: Si quis diversit, &c. anathema sit.\n\nThere are two kinds of anathemas, the one judicatory and the other abjuratory. The former can only be denounced by a council, a pope, or a bishop; the latter makes a part of the ceremony of abjuration, the convert being obliged to anathematize the hereby he abjures.\n\nAnathema, in Heathen Antiquity, was an offering or present made to some deity, and hung up in the temple. Whenever a person left off his employment, it was usual to dedicate the tools to the patron deity of the trade. Persons too who had escaped from imminent danger, as shipwreck and the like, or had met with any other remarkable instance of good fortune, seldom failed to testify their gratitude by some present of this kind.\n\nANATHOTH, a hamlet of Palestine, very near Jerusalem (Josephus), about three miles and a half to the north; the ruins of which are still to be seen. It was the birthplace of the prophet Jeremiah, and one of the Levitical towns in the tribe of Benjamin.\n\nANATIFERA CONCHA, the trivial name of a species of the lepas, a tellaceous animal. See LEPAS.\n\nANATOCISM, ANATOCISMS, an furious contract, wherein the interests arising from the principal sum are added to the principal itself, and interest exacted upon the whole. The word is originally Greek, but used by Cicero in Latin; whence it is descended into most other languages. It comes from the preposition ἀνά, which in composition signifies repetition or duplication, and ὑστερήσις, usury. Anatocism is what we properly call interest upon interest, or compound interest. This is the worst kind of usury, and has been severely condemned by the Roman law, as well as by the common laws of most other countries. See INTEREST.\n\nANATOLIA. See NATOLIA.\n\nANATOMY,\n\nIn its most general sense, is the art of dissecting, or artificially separating and taking to pieces the different parts of organized bodies, in order to an exact discovery of their situation, structure, and economy; but here we limit its signification to animal bodies. The word is Greek, ἀνατομή; derived from ἀνατέμνω, to dissect, or separate by cutting.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\n§ 1. History of Anatomy.\n\nThis art seems to have been very ancient; though, for a long time, known only in an imperfect manner.—The first men who lived must have soon acquired some notions of the structure of their own bodies, particularly of the external parts, and of some even of the internal, such as bones, joints, and sinews, which are exposed to the examination of the senses in living bodies.\n\nThis rude knowledge must have been gradually improved, by the accidents to which the body is exposed, by the necessities of life, and by the various customs, ceremonies, and superstitions, of different nations. Thus, the observance of bodies killed by violence, attention to wounded men, and to many diseases, the various ways of putting criminals to death, the funeral ceremonies, and a variety of such things, must have shown men every day more and more of themselves; especially by curiosity and self-love would here urge them powerfully to observation and reflection.\n\nThe brute creation having such an affinity to man in outward form, motion, senses, and ways of life; the generation of the species, and the effect of death upon the body, being observed to be so nearly the same in both; the conclusion was not only obvious, but unavoidable, that their bodies were formed nearly upon the same model. And the opportunities of examining the bodies of brutes were so easily procured, indeed so necessarily occurred in the common business of life, that the huntman in making use of his prey, the priest in sacrificing, the augur in divination, and above all, the butcher, or those who might out of curiosity attend upon his operations, must have been daily adding to the little stock of anatomical knowledge. Accordingly we find, in fact, that the South sea islanders, who have been left to their own observation and reasoning, without the assistance of letters, have yet a considerable share of rude or wild anatomical and physiological knowledge. Dr Hunter informs us, that when Omai was in his museum with Mr Banks, though he could not explain himself intelligibly, they plainly saw that he knew the principal parts of the body, and something likewise of their uses; and manifested a great curiosity or desire of having the functions of the internal parts of the body explained to him; particularly the relative functions of the two sexes, which with him seemed to be the most interesting object of the human mind.\n\nWe may further imagine, that the philosophers of the most early ages, that is, the men of curiosity, observation, experience, and reflection, could not overlook an instance of natural organization, which was so interesting, and at the same time so wonderful, more especially such of them as applied to the study and cure of diseases. We know that physic was a branch of philosophy till the age of Hippocrates.\n\nThus the art must have been circumstanced in its beginning. We shall next see from the testimony of historians\nhistorians and other writers, how it actually appeared as an art, from the time that writing was introduced among men; how it was improved, and conveyed down to us through a long series of ages.\n\nCivilization, and improvements of every kind, would naturally begin in fertile countries and healthful climates, where there would be leisure for reflection, and an appetite for amusement. Accordingly, writing, and many other useful and ornamental inventions and arts, appear to have been cultivated in the eastern parts of Asia long before the earliest times that are treated of by the Greek or other European writers; and that the arts and learning of those eastern people were in subsequent times gradually communicated to adjacent countries, especially by the medium of traffic. The customs, superstitions, and climate of eastern countries, however, appear to have been as unfavourable to practical anatomy as they were inviting to the study of astronomy, geometry, poetry, and all the softer arts of peace.\n\nAnimal bodies there run so quickly into nauseous putrefaction, that the early inhabitants must have avoided such offensive employments as anatomical inquiries, like their posterity at this day. And in fact it does not appear, by the writings of the Grecians, or Jews, or Phoenicians, or of other eastern countries, that anatomy was particularly cultivated by any of those eastern nations. In tracing it backwards to its infancy, we cannot go farther into antiquity than the times of the Grecian philosophers. As an art in the state of some cultivation, it may be said to have been brought forth and bred up among them as a branch of natural knowledge.\n\nThe era of philosophy, as it was called, began with Thales the Milesian being declared, by a very general consent of the people, the most wise of all the Grecians, 480 years before Christ. The philosophers of his school, which was called the Ionian, cultivated principally natural knowledge. Socrates, the seventh in succession of their great teachers, introduced the study of morals, and was thence said to bring down philosophy from heaven, to make men truly wise and happy.\n\nIn the writings of his scholar and successor Plato, we see that the philosophers had carefully considered the human body, both in its organization and functions; and though they had not arrived at the knowledge of the more minute and intricate parts, which required the successive labour and attention of many ages, they had made up very noble and comprehensive ideas of the subject in general. The anatomical descriptions of Xenophon and Plato have had the honour of being quoted by Longinus (§ xxxiii.) as specimens of sublime writing; and the extract from Plato is still more remarkable for its containing the rudiments of the circulation of the blood. \"The heart (says Plato) is the centre or knot of the blood vessels, the spring or fountain of the blood, which is carried impetuously round; the blood is the paludum or food of the flesh; and for the purpose of nourishment, the body is laid out into canals, like those which are drawn through gardens, that the blood may be conveyed, as from a fountain, to every part of the previous body.\"\n\nHippocrates was nearly contemporary with the great philosophers of whom we have been speaking, about 400 years before the Christian era. He is said to have separated the profession of philosophy and physic, and to have been the first who applied to physic alone as the business of his life. He is likewise generally supposed to be the first who wrote upon anatomy. We know of nothing that was written expressly upon the subject before; and the first anatomical dissection which has been recorded was made by his friend Democritus of Abdera.\n\nIf, however, we read the works of Hippocrates with impartiality, and apply his accounts of the parts to what we know of the human body, we must allow his descriptions to be imperfect, incorrect, sometimes extravagant, and often unintelligible, that of the bones only excepted. He seems to have studied these with more success than the other parts, and tells us that he had an opportunity of seeing a human skeleton.\n\nFrom Hippocrates to Galen, who flourished towards the end of the second century, in the decline of the Roman empire, that is, in the space of 600 years, anatomy was greatly improved; the philosophers still considering it as a most curious and interesting branch of natural knowledge, and the physicians as a principal foundation of their art. Both of them, in that interval of time, contributed daily to the common stock, by more accurate and extended observations, and by the lights of improving philosophy.\n\nAs these two great men had applied very particularly to the study of animal bodies, they not only made great improvements, especially in physiology, but raised the credit of natural knowledge, and spread it as wide as Alexander's empire.\n\nFew of Aristotle's writings were made public in his lifetime. He affected to say that they would be unintelligible to those who had not heard them explained at his lectures; and, except the use which Theophrastus made of them, they were lost to the public for above 130 years after the death of Theophrastus; and at last came out defective from bad preservation, and corrupted by men, who, without proper qualifications, presumed to correct and to supply what was lost.\n\nFrom the time of Theophrastus, the study of natural knowledge at Athens was for ever on the decline; and the reputation of the Lyceum and Academy was almost confined to the studies which are subservient to oratory and public speaking.\n\nThe other great institution for Grecian education was at Alexandria in Egypt. The first Ptolemies, both from their love of literature, and to give true and permanent dignity to their empire, and to Alexander's favourite city, set up a grand school in the palace itself, with a museum and a library, which, we may say, has been the most famed in the world. Anatomy, among other sciences, was publicly taught; and the two distinguished anatomists were Erasistratus the pupil and friend of Theophrastus, and Herophilus. Their voluminous works are all lost; but they are quoted by Galen almost in every page. These professors were probably the first who were authorized to dissect human bodies; a peculiarity which marks strongly the philosophical magnanimity of the first Ptolemy, and fixes a great era in the history of anatomy. And it was no doubt, from this particular advantage which the Alexandrians had above all others, that their school not only gained, but for many centuries preserved, the first reputation.\ntation for medical education. Ammianus Marcellinus, who lived about 650 years after the schools were set up, says, they were so famous in his time, that it was enough to secure credit to any physician if he could say that he had studied at Alexandria.\n\nHerophilus has been said to have anatomized 700 bodies. We must allow for exaggeration. Nay, it was said, that both he and Erasistratus made it a common practice to open living bodies, that they might discover the more secret springs of life. But this, no doubt, was only a vulgar opinion, rising from the prejudices of mankind; and accordingly, without any good reason, such tales have been told of modern anatomists, and have been believed by the vulgar.\n\nAmong the Romans, though it is probable they had physicians and surgeons from the foundation of the city, yet we have no account of any of these applying themselves to anatomy for a very long time. Archagathus was the first Greek physician established in Rome, and he was banished the city on account of the severity of his operations.—Aclepiades, who flourished in Rome 101 years after Archagathus, in the time of Pompey, attained such a high reputation as to be ranked in the same class with Hippocrates. He seemed to have some notion of the air in respiration acting by its weight; and in accounting for digestion, he supposed the food to be no farther changed than by a commination into extremely small parts, which being distributed to the several parts of the body, is assimilated to the nature of each. One Cassius, commonly thought to be a disciple of Aclepiades, accounted for the right side of the body becoming paralytic on hurting the left side of the brain in the same manner as has been done by the moderns, viz. from the crossing of the nerves from the right to the left side of the brain.\n\nFrom the time of Aclepiades to the second century, physicians seem to have been greatly encouraged at Rome; and in the writings of Celsus, Rufus, Pliny, Celsus Aurelianus, and Arateus, we find several anatomical observations, but mostly very superficial and inaccurate. Towards the end of the second century lived Claudius Galenus Pergamus, whose name is so well known in the medical world. He applied himself particularly to the study of anatomy, and did more in that way than all that went before him. He seems, however, to have been at a great loss for human subjects to operate upon; and therefore his descriptions of the parts are mostly taken from brute animals. His works contain the fullest history of anatomists, and the most complete system of the science, to be met with anywhere before him, or for several centuries after; so that a number of passages in them were reckoned absolutely unintelligible for many ages, until explained by the discoveries of succeeding anatomists.\n\nAbout the end of the fourth century, Nimefius bishop of Emilia wrote a treatise on the nature of man, in which it is said were contained two celebrated modern discoveries; the one, the uses of the bile, boasted of by Sylvius de la Boe; and the other, the circulation of the blood. This last, however, is proved by Dr Freind, in his History of Physic, p. 229, to be falsely ascribed to this author.\n\nThe Roman empire beginning now to be oppressed by the barbarians, and sunk in gross superstition, learning of all kinds decreased; and when the empire was totally overwhelmed by those barbarous nations, every appearance of science was almost extinguished in Europe. The only remains of it were among the Arabians in Spain and in Asia.—The Saracens, who came into Spain, destroyed at first all the Greek books which the Vandals had spared; but though their government was in a constant struggle and fluctuation during 800 years before they were driven out, they received a taste for learning from their countrymen of the east; several of their princes encouraged liberal studies; public schools were set up at Cordova, Toledo, and other towns, and translations of the Greeks into the Arabic were universally in the hands of their teachers.\n\nThus was the learning of the Grecians transferred to the Arabians. But though they had so good a foundation to build upon, this art was never improved while they were masters of the world; for they were satisfied with commenting upon Galen; and seem to have made no dissections of human bodies.\n\nAbdollahiphi, who was himself a teacher of anatomy, a man eminent in his time (at and before 1202) for his learning and curiosity; a great traveller, who had been bred at Bagdad, and had seen many of the great cities and principal places for study in the Saracen empire; who had a favourable opinion of original observation, in opposition to book learning; who boldly corrected some of Galen's errors, and was persuaded that many more might be detected; this man, we say, never made or saw, or seemed to think of a human dissection. He discovered Galen's errors in the ophthalmology, by going to burying grounds, with his students and others, where he examined and demonstrated the bones; he earnestly recommended that method of study, in preference even to the reading of Galen, and thought that many farther improvements might be made; yet he seemed not to have an idea that a fresh subject might be dissected with that view.\n\nPerhaps the Jewish tenets which the Mahometans adopted about uncleanness and pollution, might prevent their handling dead bodies; or their opinion of what was supposed to pass between an angel and the dead person, might make them think disturbing the dead highly sacrilegious. Such however, as Arabian learning was, for many ages together there was hardly any other in all the western countries of Europe. It was introduced by the establishment of the Saracens in Spain in 711, and kept its ground till the restoration of learning in the end of the 13th century. The state of anatomy in Europe, in the times of Arabian influence, may be seen by reading a very short system of anatomy drawn up by Mundinus, in the year 1315. It was extracted principally from what the Arabians had preserved of Galen's doctrine; and, rude as it is, in that age it was judged to be so masterly a performance, that it was ordered by a public decree, that it should be read in all the schools of Italy; and it actually continued to be almost the only book which was read upon the subject for above 200 years. Cortesius gives him the credit of being the great restorer of anatomy, and the first who dissected human bodies among the moderns.\n\nA general prejudice against dissection, however, prevailed till the 16th century. The emperor Charles V. ordered a consultation to be held by the divines of Salamanca, in order to determine whether or not it was lawful\nHistory, lawful in point of conscience to dissect a dead body.\n\nIn Mulcovy, till very lately, both anatomy and the use of skeletons were forbidden; the first as inhuman, and the latter as subservient to witchcraft.\n\nIn the beginning of the 15th century, learning revived considerably in Europe, and particularly physic, by means of copies of the Greek authors brought from the lack of Constantinople; after which the number of anatomists and anatomical books increased to a prodigious degree.—The Europeans becoming thus professed of the ancient Greek fathers of medicine, were for a long time so much occupied in correcting the copies they could obtain, studying the meaning, and commenting upon them, that they attempted nothing of their own, especially in anatomy.\n\nAnd here the late Dr Hunter introduces into the annals of this art, a genius of the first rate, Leonardo da Vinci, who had been formerly overlooked, because he was of another profession, and because he published nothing upon the subject. He is considered by the Doctor as by far the best anatomist and physiologist of his time: and was certainly the first man we know of who introduced the practice of making anatomical drawings.\n\nVallare, in his Lives of the Painters, speaks of Leonardo thus, after telling us that he had composed a book of the anatomy of a horse, for his own study:\n\n\"He afterwards applied himself with more diligence to the human anatomy; in which study he reciprocally received and communicated assistance to Marc Antonio della Torre, an excellent philosopher, who then read lectures in Pavia, and wrote upon this subject; and who was the first, as I have heard, who began to illustrate medicine from the doctrine of Galen, and to give true light to anatomy, which till that time had been involved in clouds of darkness and ignorance. In this he availed himself exceedingly of the genius and labour of Leonardo, who made a book of studies, drawn with red chalk, and touched with a pen, with great diligence, of such subjects as he had himself dissected; where he made all the bones, and to those he joined, in their order, all the nerves, and covered them with the muscles.\n\nAnd concerning those, from part to part, he wrote remarks in letters of an ugly form, which are written by the left hand, backwards, and not to be understood but by those who know the method of reading them; for they are not to be read without a looking-glass. Of these papers of the human anatomy, there is a great part in the possession of M. Francefco da Melzo, a Milanese gentleman, who, in the time of Leonardo, was a most beautiful boy, and much beloved by him, as he is now a beautiful and gentle old man, who reads those writings, and carefully preserves them, as precious relics, together with the portrait of Leonardo of happy memory. It appears impossible that that divine spirit should reason so well upon the arteries, and muscles, and nerves, and veins; and with such diligence of every thing,\" &c. &c.\n\nThose very drawings and the writings are happily found to be preserved in his majesty's great collection of original drawings, where the Doctor was permitted to examine them; and his sentiments upon the occasion he thus expresses: \"I expected to see little more than such designs in anatomy as might be useful to a painter in his own profession; but I saw, and indeed with astonishment, that Leonardo had been a general and a deep student. When I consider what pains he has taken upon every part of the body, the superiority of his universal genius, his particular excellence in mechanics and hydraulics, and the attention with which such a man would examine and see objects which he was to draw, I am fully persuaded that Leonardo was the best anatomist at that time in the world. We must give the 15th century the credit of Leonardo's anatomical studies, as he was 55 years of age at the close of that century.\"\n\nIn the beginning of the 16th century, Achillius and Benedictus, but particularly Berengarius and Malpighi, followed out the improvement of anatomy in Italy, where they taught it, and published upon the subject. These first improvers made some discoveries from their own dissections: but it is not surprising that they should have been diffident of themselves, and have followed Galen almost blindly, when his authority had been so long established, and when the enthusiasm for Greek authors was rising to such a pitch.\n\nSoon after this, we may say about the year 1540, the great Vesalius appeared. He was studious, laborious, and ambitious. From Bruges, the place of his birth, he went to Louvain, and thence to Paris, where anatomy was not yet making a considerable figure; and then to Louvain to teach; from which place, very fortunately for his reputation, he was called to Italy, where he met with every opportunity that such a genius for anatomy could desire, that is, books, subjects, and excellent draughtsmen. He was equally laborious in reading the ancients, and in dissecting bodies. And in making the comparison, he could not but feel, that there was great room for improvement, and that many of Galen's descriptions were erroneous. When he was but a young man, he published a noble system of anatomy, illustrated with a great number of elegant figures.—In this work he found so many occasions of correcting Galen, that his contemporaries, partial to antiquity, and jealous of his reputation, complained that he carried his turn for improvement and criticisms to licentiousness. The spirit of opposition and emulation was presently roused; and Sylvius in France, Columbus, Fallopius, and Enniachini in Italy, who were all in high anatomical reputation about the middle of this 16th century, endeavoured to defend Galen at the expense of Vesalius. In their disputes they made their appeals to the human body: and thus in a few years the art was greatly improved. And Vesalius being detected in the very fault which he condemns in Galen, to wit, describing from the dissections of brutes, and not of the human body, it exposed so fully that blunder of the older anatomists, that in succeeding times there has been little reason for such complaint.—Besides the above, he published several other anatomical treatises. He has been particularly serviceable by imposing names on the muscles, most of which are retained to this day. Formerly they were distinguished by numbers, which were differently applied by almost every author.\n\nIn 1561, Gabriel Fallopius, professor of anatomy at Padua, published a treatise of anatomy under the title of Observationes Anatomicae. This was designed as a supplement to Vesalius; many of whose descriptions he corrects, though he always makes mention of him.\nin an honourable manner. Fallopius made many great discoveries, and his book is well worth the perusal of every anatomist.\n\nIn 1563, Bartholomeus Eustachius published his *Opuscula Anatomica* at Venice, which have ever since been justly admired for the exactness of the descriptions, and the discoveries contained in them. He published afterwards some other pieces, in which there is little of anatomy; but never published the great work he had promised, which was to be adorned with copperplates representing all the parts of the human body. These plates, after lying buried in an old cabinet for upwards of 150 years, were at last discovered and published in the year 1714, by Lancisi the pope's physician; who added a short explicationary text, because Eustachius's own writing could not be found.\n\nFrom this time the study of anatomy gradually diffused itself over Europe: insomuch that for the last hundred years it has been daily improving by the labour of a number of professed anatomists almost in every country of Europe.\n\nWe may form a judgment about the state of anatomy even in Italy, in the beginning of the 17th century, from the information of Cortesius. He had been professor of anatomy at Bologna, and was then professor of medicine at Pisa; where, though he had a great desire to improve himself in the art, and to finish a treatise which he had begun on practical anatomy, in 24 years he could twice only procure an opportunity of dissecting a human body, and then it was with difficulties and in hurry; whereas he had expected to have done so, he says, once every year, according to the custom in the famous academies of Italy.\n\nIn the very end of the 16th century, our great Harvey, as was the custom of the times, went to Italy to study medicine; for Italy was still the favourite seat of the arts: And in the very beginning of the 17th century, soon after Harvey's return to England, his master in anatomy, Fabricius ab Aquapendente, published an account of the valves in the veins, which he had discovered many years before, and no doubt taught in his lectures when Harvey attended them.\n\nThis discovery evidently affected the established doctrine of all ages, that the veins carried the blood from the liver to all parts of the body for nourishment. It set Harvey to work upon the use of the heart and vascular systems in animals; and in the course of some years he was so happy as to discover, and to prove beyond all possibility of doubt, the circulation of the blood. He taught his new doctrine in his lectures about the year 1616, and printed it in 1628.\n\nIt was by far the most important step that has been made in the knowledge of animal bodies in any age. It not only reflected useful lights upon what had been already found out in anatomy, but also pointed out the means of further investigation. And accordingly we see, that from Harvey to the present time, anatomy has been so much improved, that we may reasonably question if the ancients have been further outdone by the moderns in any other branch of knowledge. From one day to another there has been a constant succession of discoveries, relating either to the structure or functions of our bodies; and new anatomical processes, both of investigation and demonstration, have been daily invented. Many parts of the body which were not known in Harvey's time have since then been brought to light; and of those which were known, the internal composition and functions remained unexplained; and indeed must have remained inexplicable without the knowledge of the circulation.\n\nHarvey's doctrine at first met with considerable opposition; but in the space of about 20 years it was generally and warmly embraced, that it was imagined every thing in physic would be explained. But time and experience have taught us, that we still are, and probably must long continue to be, very ignorant; and that in the study of the human body, and of its diseases, there will always be an extensive field for the exercise of sagacity.\n\nAfter the discovery and knowledge of the circulation of the blood, the next question would naturally have been about the passage and route of the nutritious part of the food or chyle from the bowels to the blood vessels: And, by good fortune, in a few years after Harvey had made his discovery, Acellius, an Italian physician, found out the lacteals, or vessels which carry the chyle from the intestines; and printed his account of them, with coloured prints, in the year 1627, the very year before Harvey's book came out.\n\nFor a number of years after these two publications, the anatomists in all parts of Europe were daily opening living dogs, either to see the lacteals or to observe the phenomena of the circulation. In making an experiment of this kind, Pecquet in France was fortunate enough to discover the thoracic duct, or common trunk of all the lacteals, which conveys the chyle into the subclavian vein. He printed his discovery in the year 1651. And now the lacteals having been traced from the intestines to the thoracic duct, and that duct having been traced to its termination in a blood vessel, the passage of the chyle was completely made out.\n\nThe same practice of opening living animals furnished occasions of discovering the lymphatic vessels. This good fortune fell to the lot of Rudbeck first, a young Swedish anatomist; and then to Thomas Bartholin, a Danish anatomist, who was the first who appeared in print upon the lymphatics. His book came out in the year 1653, that is, two years after that of Pecquet. And then it was very evident that they had been seen before by Dr Higmore and others, who had mistaken them for lacteals. But none of the anatomists of those times could make out the origin of the lymphatics, and none of the physiologists could give a satisfactory account of their use.\n\nThe circulation of the blood and the passage of the chyle having been satisfactorily traced out in full grown animals, the anatomists were naturally led next to consider how these animal processes were carried on in the child while in the womb of the mother. Accordingly the male and female organs, the appearances and contents of the pregnant uterus, the incubated egg, and every phenomenon which could illustrate generation, became the favourite subject for about 30 years with the principal anatomists of Europe.\n\nThus it would appear to have been in theory; but Dr Hunter believes, that in fact, as Harvey's matter Fabricius laid the foundation for the discovery of the circulation of the blood by teaching him the valves of the veins, and thereby inviting him to consider that subject; so Fabricius, by his lectures, and by his elegant\ngant work *De Formato Fictu, et de Formatione Ovi et Pulii*, probably made that likewise a favourite subject with Dr Harvey. But whether he took up the subject of generation in consequence of his discovery of the circulation, or was led to it by his honoured master Fabricius, he spent a great deal of his time in the inquiry; and published his observations in a book *De Generatione Animalium*, in the year 1651, that is, five years before his death.\n\nIn a few years after this, Swammerdam, Van Horn, Steno, and De Graaf, excited great attention to the subject of generation, by their supposed discovery that the females of viviparous animals have ovaria, that is, clutches of eggs in their loins, like oviparous animals; which, when impregnated by the male, are conveyed into the uterus; so that a child is produced from an egg as well as a chick; with this difference, that one is hatched within, and the other without, the body of the mother.\n\nMalpighi, a great Italian genius, some time after, made considerable advances upon the subject of generation. He had the good fortune to be the first who used magnifying glasses with address in tracing the first appearances in the formation of animals. He likewise made many other observations and improvements in the minutiae of anatomy by his microscopical labours, and by cultivating comparative anatomy.\n\nThis distinguished anatomist gave the first public specimen of his abilities by printing a dissertation on the lungs, anno 1661, a period so remarkable for the study of nature, that it would be injustice to pass it without particular notice.\n\nAt the same time flourished Laurentius Bellinus at Florence, and was the first who introduced mathematical reasoning in physic. In 1662, Simon Pauli published a treatise *De albuminis Officibus*. He had long been admired for the white skeletons he prepared; and at last discovered his method, which was by exposing the bones all winter to the weather.\n\nJohannes Swammerdam of Amsterdam also published some anatomical treatises; but was most remarkable for his knowledge of preserving the parts of bodies entire for many years, by injecting their vessels. He also published a treatise on respiration; wherein he mentioned his having figures of all the parts of the body, as big as the life, cut in copper, which he designed to publish, with a complete system of anatomy. These, however, were never made public by Swammerdam; but, in 1683, Gothofridus Bidloo, professor of anatomy at Leyden, published a work entitled *Anatomia Corporis Humani*, where all the parts were delineated in very large plates almost as big as the life. Mr Cowper, an English surgeon, bought 300 copies of these figures; and in 1698, published them, with an English text, quite different from Bidloo's Latin one; to which were added letters in Bidloo's figures, and some few figures of Mr Cowper's own. To this work Cowper's name was prefixed, without the least mention of Bidloo, except on purpose to confute him. Bidloo immediately published a very ill-natured pamphlet, called *Gulielmus Cowperus ciuitatis coram tribunali*; appealing to the Royal Society, how far Cowper ought to be punished as a plagiarist of the worst kind, and endeavouring to prove him an ignorant deceitful fellow. Cowper answered him in his own style, in a pamphlet called his *Vindiciae*; endeavouring to prove, either that Bidloo did not understand his own tables, or that they were none of his. It was even alleged that those were the tables promised by Swammerdam, and which Bidloo had got from his widow. This, however, appears to have been only an injurious rumour, there being unquestionable evidence that they were really the performance of Bidloo.\n\nSoon after, Ibrandus Diembroeck, professor of anatomy at Utrecht, began to appear as an author. His work contained very little original; but he was at great pains to collect from others whatever was valuable in their writings, and his system was the common standard among anatomical students for many years.\n\nAbout the same time, Antonius Leeuwenhoek of Delft improved considerably on Malpighi's use of microscopes. These two authors took up anatomy where others had dropped it; and, by this new art, they brought a number of amazing things to light. They discovered the red globules of the blood; they were enabled to see the actual circulation of the blood in the transparent parts of living animals, and could measure the velocity of its motion; they discovered that the arteries and veins had no intermediate cells or spongy substance, as Harvey and all the preceding anatomists had supposed, but communicated one with the other by a continuation of the same tube.\n\nLeeuwenhoek was in great fame likewise for his discovery of the animalcula in the semen. Indeed there was scarcely a part of the body, solid or fluid, which escaped his examination; and he almost everywhere found, that what appeared to the naked eye to be rude indigested matter, was in reality a beautiful and regular compound.\n\nAfter this period, Nuck added to our knowledge of the absorbent system already mentioned by his injections of the lymphatic glands; Ruych, by his description of the valves of the lymphatic vessels; and Dr Meckel, by his accurate account of the whole system, and by tracing those vessels in many parts where they had not before been described.\n\nBesides these authors, Drs Hunter and Monro have called the attention of the public to this part of anatomy, in their controversy concerning the discovery of the office of the lymphatics.\n\nWhen the lymphatic vessels were first seen and traced into the thoracic duct, it was natural for anatomists to suspect, that as the lacteals absorbed from the cavity of the intestines, the lymphatics, which are similar in figure and structure, might possibly do the same office with respect to other parts of the body; and accordingly, Dr Glisson, who wrote in 1654, supposed these vessels arose from cavities, and that their use was to absorb; and Frederic Hoffman has very explicitly laid down the doctrine of the lymphatic vessels being a system of absorbents. But anatomists in general have been of a contrary opinion: for from experiments, particularly such as were made by injections, they have been persuaded that the lymphatic vessels did not arise from cavities, and did not absorb, but were merely continuations from small arteries. The doctrine, therefore, that the lymphatics, like the lacteals, were absorbents, as had been suggested by Glisson and by Hoffman, has been revived by Dr Hunter and Dr Monro, who have controverted the experiments of their\ntheir predecessors in anatomy, and have endeavoured to prove that the lymphatic vessels are not continued from arteries, but are absorbents.\n\nTo this doctrine, however, several objections have been started, particularly by Haller (Elem. Phys. 1. 24. § 2, 3); and it has been found, that before the doctrine of the lymphatics being a system of absorbents can be established, it must first be determined whether this system is to be found in other animals besides man and quadrupeds. Mr Hewson claims the merit of having proved the affirmative of this question, by discovering the lymphatic system in birds, fish, and amphibious animals. See Phil. Trans. vol. lviii. and lxix.—And latterly, Mr Cruikshank has traced the ramifications of that system in almost every part of the body; and from his dissections, figures have been made and lately published to the world. To Mr Sheldon also we are much indebted for his illustration of this system, which promises to give great satisfaction, but of which only a part has been yet published.\n\nThe gravid uterus is a subject likewise which has received considerable improvements, particularly relating to one very important discovery; viz. that the internal membrane of the uterus, which Dr Hunter has named decidua, constitutes the exterior part of the fœtus or after-birth, and separates from the rest of the uterus every time that a woman either bears a child or suffers a miscarriage. This discovery includes another, to wit, that the placenta is partly made up of an excrecence or efflorescence from the uterus itself.\n\nThese discoveries are of the utmost consequence, both in the physiological question about the connexion between the mother and child, and likewise in explaining the phenomena of births and abortions, as well as in regulating obstetrical practice.\n\nThe anatomists of this century have improved anatomy, and have made the study of it much more easy, by giving us more correct as well as more numerous figures. It is amazing to think of what has been done in that time. We have had four large folio books of figures of the bones, viz. Chefelden's, Albinius's, Sue's and Trew's. Of the muscles, we have had two large folios; one from Cowper, which is elegant; and one from Albinius, which, from the accuracy and labour of the work, we may suppose will never be outdone. Of the blood vessels we have a large folio from Dr Haller. We have had one upon the nerves from Dr Meckel, and another by Dr Monro junior. We have had Albinius's, Roederer's, Jentz's, and Hunter's works upon the pregnant uterus; Weitbrecht and Leber on the joints and fresh bones; Soemerring on the brain; Zinn on the eye; Cotunnius, Meckel junior, &c. on the ear; Walter on the nerves of the thorax and abdomen; Dr Monro on the bursae mucosae, &c.\n\nIt would be endless to mention the anatomical figures that have been published in this century of particular and smaller parts of the body, by Morgagni, Ruyech, Valvalva, Sanctorini, Heitleiter, Vater, Cant, Zimmermann, Walterus, and others.\n\nThose elegant plates of the brain, however, just published by M. Vicq. d'Azyr, must not pass without notice, especially as they form part of an universal system of anatomy and physiology, both human and comparative, proposed to be executed in the same splendid style. Upon the brain alone 19 folio plates are employed; of which several are coloured. The figures are delineated with accuracy and clearness; but the colouring is rather beautiful than correct. Such parts of this work as may be published, cannot fail to be equally acceptable to the anatomist and the philosopher: but the entire design is apparently too extensive to be accomplished within the period of a single life. In our own country, also, a very great anatomical work is carrying on by Andrew Bell, F. S. A. S. engraver to his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, with the approbation of Dr Monro, and under the inspection of his very ingenious assistant Mr Fyfe. It is to compose a complete illustration, both general and particular, of the human body, by a selection from the best plates of all the greatest anatomists, as well foreign as of this country, exhibiting the latest discoveries in the science, and accompanied with copious explanations. The whole number of plates mentioned in the Prospectus is 242, of which 152 are already done; all in royal folio.\n\nTo the foreign treaties already mentioned may be added those recently published by Sabatier and Plenck on anatomy in general. Among ourselves, the writings of Keil, Douglas, Chefelden, the first Monro, Winiflow, &c. are too well known to need description. The last of these used to be recommended as a standard for the students of anatomy; but it has of late given place to a more accurate and comprehensive system, in three volumes, published by Mr Elliot of Edinburgh, upon a plan approved of by Dr Monro, and executed by Mr Fyfe. Dr Simmons of London has also obliged the world with an excellent system of anatomy; and another work, under the title of \"Elements of Anatomy and the Animal Economy:\" in which the subjects are treated with uncommon elegance and perspicuity.\n\nIn the latter part of the last century, anatomy made two great steps, by the invention of injections, and the method of making what we commonly call preparations. These two modern arts have really been of infinite use to anatomy; and besides have introduced an elegance into our administrations, which in former times could not have been supposed to be possible. They arose in Holland under Swammerdam and Ruyech, and afterwards in England under Cowper, St André, and others, where they have been greatly improved.\n\nThe anatomists of former ages had no other knowledge of the blood vessels than what they were able to collect from laborious dissections, and from examining the smaller branches of them, upon some lucky occasion, when they were found more than commonly loaded with red blood. But filling the vascular system with a bright coloured wax, enables us to trace the large vessels with great ease, renders the smaller much more conspicuous, and makes thousands of the very minute ones visible, which from their delicacy, and the transparency of their natural contents, are otherwise imperceptible.\n\nThe modern art of corroding the fleshy parts with a menstruum, and of leaving the moulded wax entire, is so exceedingly useful, and at the same time so ornamental, that it does great honour to the ingenious inventor Dr Nicholls.\n\nThe wax-work art of the moderns might deserve notice in any history of anatomy, if the matters in that way had not been so careless in their imitation. Many of the wax figures are so tawdry, with a show of unnatural colours, and so very incorrect in the circumstances of\nIntro.\n\nANATOMY.\n\nGeneral view of figure, situation, and the like, that though they strike a vulgar eye with admiration, they must appear ridiculous to an anatomist. But those figures which are cast in wax, plaster, or lead, from the real subject, and which of late years have been frequently made here, are, of course, very correct in all the principal parts, and may be considered as no insignificant acquisition to modern anatomy. The proper, or principal, use of this art is, to preserve a very perfect likeness of such subjects as we but seldom can meet with, or cannot well preserve in a natural state; a subject in pregnancy, for example.\n\nThe modern improved methods of preserving animal bodies, or parts of them, has been of the greatest service to anatomy; especially in saving the time and labour of the anatomist in the nicer dilutions of the small parts of the body. For now, whatever he has prepared with care, he can preserve; and the object is ready to be seen at any time. And in the same manner he can preserve anatomical curiosities, or rarities of every kind; such as, parts that are uncommonly formed; parts that are diseased; the parts of the pregnant uterus and its contents. Large collections of such curiosities, which modern anatomists are striving almost everywhere to procure, are of infinite service to the art, especially in the hands of teachers. They give students clear ideas about many things which it is very essential to know, and yet which it is impossible that a teacher should be able to show otherwise, were he ever so well supplied with fresh subjects.\n\n§ 2. View of the Subject in general, and Plan of the following Treatise.\n\nThe etymology of the word anatomy, as above given, implies simply division; but by this term something more is usually understood.\n\nIt is every day made use of to express a knowledge of the human body; and a person who is said to understand anatomy, is supposed to be conversant with the structure and arrangement of the different solid parts of the body.\n\nIt is commonly divided into Anatomy, properly so called; and Comparative Anatomy: the first of these is confined solely to the human body; the latter includes all animals, so far as a knowledge of their structure may tend to perfect our ideas of the human body.\n\nThe term anatomy may also have another and more extensive signification: it may be employed to express not only a knowledge of the structure and disposition of the parts, but likewise of their economy and use. Considered in this light, it will seldom fail to excite the curiosity of people of taste, as a branch of philosophy; since, if it is pleasing to be acquainted with the structure of the body, it is certainly more so to discover all the springs which give life and motion to the machine, and to observe the admirable mechanism by which so many different functions are executed.\n\nAstronomy and anatomy, as Dr Hunter, after Fontenelle, observes, are the studies which present us with the most striking view of the two greatest attributes of the Supreme Being. The first of these fills the mind with the idea of his immensity, in the largeness, distances, and number of the heavenly bodies; the last astonishes with his intelligence and art in the variety and delicacy of animal mechanism.\n\nThe human body has been commonly enough known by the name of microcosmus, or the little world; as if it did not differ so much from the universal system of nature in the symmetry and number of its parts as in their size.\n\nGalen's excellent treatise De Uso Partium, was composed as a profane hymn to the Creator; and abounds with as irrefutable proofs of a supreme Cause and governing Providence, as we find in modern physico-theology. And Cicero dwells more on the structure and economy of animals than on all the productions of nature besides, when he wants to prove the existence of the gods from the order and beauty of the universe. He there takes a survey of the body of man in a most elegant synopsis of anatomy, and concludes thus: \"Quibus rebus expeditis, satis docuisti videor, hominis natura, quanto omnes anteiret animantes. Ex quo debet intelligi, nec figuram fitumque membrorum, nec ingenii mentique vim talent effici potuisse fortuna.\"\n\nThe satisfaction of mind which arises from the study of anatomy, and the influence which it must naturally have upon our minds as philosophers, cannot be better conveyed than by the following passage from the same author: \"Que contuens animus, accepit ab his cognitionem deorum, ex qua oritur pietas: cui conjuncta justitia est, reliquaeque virtutes: ex quibus vita beata exsiftit, par et similes deorum, nulla alia renifi immortalitate, quae nihil ad bene vivendum pertinet, cedens caelestibus.\"\n\nIt would be endless to quote the animated passages of this sort which are to be found in the physicians, philosophers, and theologians, who have considered the structure and functions of animals with a view towards the Creator. It is a view which must strike one with a most awful conviction. Who can know and consider the thousand evident proofs of the astonishing art of the Creator, in forming and sustaining an animal body such as ours, without feeling the most pleasant enthusiasm? Can we fervently reflect upon this awful subject, without being almost lost in adoration? without longing for another life after this, in which we may be gratified with the highest enjoyment which our faculties and nature seem capable of, the seeing and comprehending the whole plan of the Creator, in forming the universe, and in directing all its operations?\n\nBut the more immediate purposes of anatomy concern those who are to be the guardians of health, as this study is necessary to lay a foundation for all the branches of medicine. The more we know of our fabric, the more reason we have to believe, that if our senses were more acute, and our judgment more enlarged, we should be able to trace many springs of life which are now hidden from us: by the same sagacity we should discover the true causes and nature of diseases; and thereby be enabled to restore the health of many, who are now, from our more confined knowledge, said to labour under incurable disorders. By such an intimate acquaintance with the economy of our bodies, we should discover even the seeds of diseases, and destroy them before they had taken root in the constitution.\n\nThat anatomy is the very basis of surgery every body allows. It is division alone that can teach us, where we may cut the living body with freedom and despatch; and where we may venture with great circumspection and\nand delicacy; and where we must not upon any account attempt it. This informs the head, gives dexterity to the head, and familiarizes the heart with a sort of necessary inhumanity, the use of cutting instruments upon our fellow-creatures.\n\nBesides the knowledge of our body, through all the variety of its structure and operations in a sound state, it is by anatomy only that we can arrive at the knowledge of the true nature of most of the diseases which afflict humanity. The symptoms of many disorders are often equivocal; and diseases themselves are thence frequently mistaken, even by sensible, experienced, and attentive physicians. But by anatomical examination after death, we can with certainty find out the mistake, and learn to avoid it in any similar case.\n\nThis use of anatomy has been so generally adopted by the moderns, that the cases already published are almost innumerable: Mangetus, Morgagni, indeed many of the best modern writings in physic, are full of them. And if we look among the physicians of the best character, and observe those who have the art itself, rather than the craft of the profession at heart; we shall find them constantly taking pains to procure leave to examine the bodies of their patients after death.\n\nAfter having considered the rise and progress of anatomy; the various discoveries that have been made in it, from time to time; the great number of diligent observers who have applied themselves to this art; and the importance of the study, not only for the prevention and cure of diseases, but in furnishing the liveliest proofs of divine wisdom; the following questions seem naturally to arise: For what purpose is there such a variety of parts in the human body? Why such a complication of nice and tender machinery? Why was there not rather a more simple, less delicate, and less expensive frame (A)?\n\nIn order to acquire a satisfactory general idea of this subject, and find a solution of all such questions, let us, in our imagination, make a man; in other words, let us suppose that the mind, or immaterial part, is to be placed in a corporeal fabric, in order to hold a correspondence with other material beings by the intervention of the body; and then consider, a priori, what will be wanted for her accommodation. In this inquiry, we shall plainly see the necessity or advantage, and therefore the final cause, of most of the parts which we actually find in the human body. And if we consider that, in order to answer some of the requisites, human wit and invention would be very insufficient; we need not be surprised if we meet with some parts of the body whose use we cannot yet perceive, and with some operations or functions which we cannot explain. We can see that the whole bears the most striking characters of excelling wisdom and ingenuity; but the imperfect senses and capacity of man cannot pretend to reach every part of a machine, which nothing less than the intelligence and power of the Supreme Being could contrive and execute.\n\nFirst, then, The mind, the thinking immaterial agent, must be provided with a place of immediate residence, which shall have all the requisites for the union of spirit and body; accordingly she is provided with the brain, where she dwells as governor and superintendent of the whole fabric.\n\nIn the next place, As she is to hold a correspondence with all the material beings around her, she must be supplied with organs fitted to receive the different kinds of impressions which they will make. In fact, therefore, we see that she is provided with the organs of sense, as we call them; the eye is adapted to light; the ear to sound; the nose to smell; the mouth to taste; and the skin to touch.\n\nFurther: She must be furnished with organs of communication between herself in the brain and these organs of sense, to give her information of all the impressions that are made upon them; and she must have organs between herself in the brain and every other part of the body, fitted to convey her commands and influence over the whole. For these purposes the nerves are actually given. They are chords, which rise from the brain, the immediate residence of the mind, and distribute themselves in branches through all parts of the body. They convey all the different kinds of sensations to the mind, in the brain; and likewise carry out from thence all her commands or influence to the other parts of the body. They are intended to be occasional monitors against all such impressions as might endanger the wellbeing of the whole, or of any particular part; which vindicates the Creator of all things, in having actually subjected us to those many disagreeable and painful sensations which we are exposed to from a thousand accidents in life.\n\nMoreover, the mind, in this corporeal system, must be endued with the power of moving from place to place, that she may have intercourse with a variety of objects; that she may fly from such as are disagreeable, dangerous, or hurtful, and pursue such as are pleasant or useful to her. And accordingly she is furnished with limbs, and with muscles and tendons, the instruments of motion, which are found in every part of the fabric where motion is necessary.\n\nBut to support, to give firmness and shape to the fabric; to keep the looser parts in their proper places; to give fixed points for, and the proper direction to its motions, as well as to protect some of the more important and tender organs from external injuries; there must be some firm prop-work interwoven through the whole. And in fact, for such purposes the bones are given.\n\nThe prop-work must not be made into one rigid fabric, for that would prevent motion. Therefore there are a number of bones.\n\nThese pieces must all be firmly bound together, to prevent their dislocation. And this end is perfectly well answered by the ligaments.\n\nThe extremities of these bony pieces, where they move and rub upon one another, must have smooth and slippery surfaces for easy motion. This is most happily provided for by the cartilages and mucus of the joints.\n\n(A) The following beautiful representation is taken from the late Dr Hunter's Introductory Lecture in Anatomy.\nThe interfaces of all these parts must be filled up with some soft and ductile matter, which shall keep them in their places, unite them, and at the same time allow them to move a little upon one another. And these purposes are answered by the cellular membrane or adipose substance.\n\nThere must be an outward covering over the whole apparatus, both to give it compactness and to defend it from a thousand injuries; which, in fact, are the very purposes of the skin and other integuments.\n\nLastly, The mind being formed for society and intercourse with beings of her own kind, she must be endowed with powers of expressing and communicating her thoughts by some sensible marks or signs; which shall be both easy to herself, and admit of great variety; and accordingly she is provided with the organs and faculty of speech, by which she can throw out signs with amazing facility, and vary them without end.\n\nThus we have built up an animal body which would seem to be pretty complete; but as it is the nature of matter to be altered and worked upon by matter; so in a very little time such a living creature must be destroyed, if there is no provision for repairing the injuries which she must commit upon herself, and those which she must be exposed to from without. Therefore a treasure of blood is actually provided in the heart and vascular system, full of nutritious and healing particles, fluid enough to penetrate into the minutest parts of the animal; impelled by the heart, and conveyed by the arteries, it washes every part, builds up what was broken down, and sweeps away the old and useless materials. Hence we see the necessity or advantage of the heart and arterial system.\n\nWhat more there was of this blood than enough to repair the present damages of the machine, must not be lost, but should be returned again to the heart; and for this purpose the venous system is actually provided.\n\nThese requisites in the animal explain, *a priori*, the circulation of the blood.\n\nThe old materials which were becoming useless, and are swept off by the current of blood, must be separated and thrown out of the system. Therefore glands, the organs of secretion, are given for straining whatever is redundant, vapid, or noxious, from the mass of blood; and when strained, they are thrown out by emunctories, called organs of excretion.\n\nBut now, as the machine must be constantly wearing, the reparation must be carried on without intermission, and the strainers must always be employed. Therefore there is actually a perpetual circulation of the blood, and the secretions are always going on.\n\nEven all this provision, however, would not be sufficient; for that store of blood would soon be consumed, and the fabric would break down, if there were not a provision made for fresh supplies. These we observe, in fact, are profusely scattered round her in the animal and vegetable kingdoms; and she is furnished with hands, the finest instruments that could have been contrived, for gathering them, and for preparing them in a variety of ways for the mouth.\n\nBut these supplies, which we call food, must be considerably changed; they must be converted into blood. Therefore she is provided with teeth for cutting and bruising the food, and with a stomach for melting it down: In short, with all the organs subservient to digestion. The finer parts of the aliment only can be useful in the constitution: these must be taken up and conveyed into the blood, and the dregs must be thrown off. With this view the intestinal canal is actually given. It separates the nutritious part, which we call chyle, to be conveyed into the blood by the system of absorbent vessels; and the faeces pass downwards, to be conducted out of the body.\n\nNow we have got our animal not only furnished with what is wanted for its immediate existence, but also with the powers of protracting that existence to an indefinite length of time. But its duration, we may presume, must necessarily be limited: for as it is nourished, grows, and is raised up to its full strength and utmost perfection; so it must in time, in common with all material beings, begin to decay, and then hurry on to final ruin. Hence we see the necessity of a scheme for renovation. Accordingly wise Providence, to perpetuate as well as preserve his work, besides giving a strong appetite for life and self-preservation, has made animals male and female, and given them such organs and passions as will secure the propagation of the species to the end of time.\n\nThus we see, that by the very imperfect survey which human reason is able to take of this subject, the animal man must necessarily be complex in his corporeal system, and in its operations.\n\nHe must have one great and general system, the vascular, branching through the whole for circulation: Another, the nervous, with its appendages the organs of sense, for every kind of feeling: And a third, for the union and connexion of all those parts.\n\nBesides these primary and general systems, he requires others which may be more local or confined: One for strength, support, and protection; the bony compasses: Another for the requisite motions of the parts among themselves, as well as for moving from place to place; the muscular part of the body: Another to prepare nourishment for the daily recruit of the body; the digestive organs: And one for propagating the species; the organs of generation.\n\nAnd in taking this general survey of what would appear, *a priori*, to be necessary for adapting an animal, to the situations of life, we observe, with great satisfaction, that man is accordingly made of such systems, and for such purposes. He has them all; and he has nothing more except the organs of respiration. Breathing it seemed difficult to account for *a priori*: we only knew it to be in fact essential and necessary to life. Notwithstanding this, when we saw all the other parts of the body, and their functions, so well accounted for, and so wisely adapted to their several purposes, there could be no doubt that respiration was so likewise: And accordingly, the discoveries of Dr Priestley have lately thrown light upon this function also, as will be shown in its proper place.\n\nOf all the different systems in the human body, the use and necessity are not more apparent, than the wisdom and contrivance which has been exerted in putting them all into the most compact and convenient form: in disposing them so, that they shall mutually receive and give helps to one another; and that all, or many of the parts, shall not only answer their principal end or purpose, but operate successfully and usefully in a variety of secondary ways.\nIf we consider the whole animal machine in this light, and compare it with any machine in which human art has exerted its utmost; suppose the best constructed ship that ever was built, we shall be convinced beyond the possibility of doubt, that there are intelligence and power far surpassing what humanity can boast of.\n\nOne superiority in the natural machine is peculiarly striking. In machines of human contrivance or art, there is no internal power, no principle in the machine itself, by which it can alter and accommodate itself to any injury which it may suffer, or make up any injury which admits of repair. But in the natural machine, the animal body, this is most wonderfully provided for, by internal powers in the machine itself; many of which are not more certain and obvious in their effects, than they are above all human comprehension as to the manner and means of their operation. Thus, a wound heals up of itself; a broken bone is made firm again by a callus; a dead part is separated and thrown off; noxious juices are driven out by some of the emunctories; a redundancy is removed by some spontaneous bleeding; a bleeding naturally stops of itself; and a great loss of blood, from any cause, is in some measure compensated by a contracting power in the vascular system, which accommodates the capacity of the vessels to the quantity contained. The stomach gives information when the supplies have been expended; represents, with great exactness, the quantity and the quality of what is wanted in the present state of the machine; and in proportion as the meets with neglect, rises in her demand, urges her petition in a louder tone, and with more forcible arguments. For its protection, an animal body resists heat and cold in a very wonderful manner, and preserves an equal temperature in a burning and in a freezing atmosphere.\n\nA further excellence and superiority in the natural machine, if possible, still more astonishing, more beyond all human comprehension, than what we have been speaking of, is the following: Besides those internal powers of self-preservation in each individual, when two of them co-operate, or act in concert, they are endowed with powers of making other animals, or machines, like themselves, which again are possessed of the same powers of producing others, and so of multiplying the species without end.\n\nThese are powers which mock all human invention or imitation. They are characteristics of the divine Architect.\n\nHaving premised this general account of the subject, we shall next consider the method to be observed in treating it.\n\nAnatomy, it has been already observed is divided into two parts; Anatomy, properly so called, or the anatomy of the human body, and Comparative Anatomy. In the following treatise we shall adopt the same arrangement. In the first part we shall treat of the Anatomy of the Human Body, and in the second of Comparative Anatomy.\n\nPART I.\n\nANATOMY OF THE HUMAN BODY.\n\nThe study of the human body, as already noticed, is commonly divided into two parts. The first, which is called Anatomy, relates to the matter and structure of its parts; the second, called Physiology and animal economy, relates to the principles and laws of its internal operations and functions.\n\nAs the body is a compound of solids and fluids, Anatomy is divided into,\n\n1. The Anatomy of the solids, and\n2. The Anatomy of the fluids.\n\n1. The solids, by which we mean all parts of our body which are not fluid, are generally divided into two classes, viz.\n\n1. The hard solids or bones. This part of anatomy is called Osteology; which signifies the doctrine of the bones.\n\n2. The softer solids; which part is called Sarcology, viz. the doctrine of flesh.\n\nThis division of the solids, we may observe, has probably taken its origin from the vulgar observation, that the body is made of bone and flesh. And as there are many different kinds of what are called soft or fleshy parts, Sarcology is subdivided into,\n\n(1.) Angiology, or the doctrine of vessels; by which is commonly understood blood vessels;\n(2.) Adenology, of glands;\n(3.) Neurology, of nerves;\n\n(4.) Myology, of muscles: and,\n(5.) Splanchnology, of the viscera or bowels. There is, besides, that part which treats of the organs of sense and of the integuments.\n\nThis division of the solids has been here mentioned, rather for the sake of explaining so many words, which are constantly used by anatomists, than for its importance or accuracy. For besides many other objections that might be urged, there are in the body three species of solids, viz. gristle or cartilage, hair, and nails; which are of an intermediate nature between bone and flesh; and therefore cannot be properly brought into the osteology or the sarcology. The cartilages were clasped with the bones: because the greatest number of them are appendages to bones: and for the like reason the hair and the nails were clasped with the integuments.\n\nII. The fluids of the human body may be divided into three kinds, which Dr Hunter calls the crude, the general or perfect, and the local or secreted fluid.\n\n1. By the crude fluid is meant the chyle, and whatever is absorbed at the surfaces of the body; in other words, what is recently taken into the body, and is not yet mixed with or converted into blood.\n\n2. The general or perfect fluid is the blood itself; viz. what is contained in the heart, arteries, and veins, and is going on in the round of the circulation.\nChap. I.\n\nANATOMY.\n\n3. The local or secreted, are those fluids peculiar to particular parts of the body, which are strained off from the blood, and yet are very different in their properties from the blood. They are commonly called secretions; and some are useful, others excrementious.\n\nIn treating of the Physiology, it is very difficult to say what plan should be followed; for every method which has been yet proposed is attended with manifest inconvenience. The powers and operations of the machine have such a dependence upon one another, such connexions and reciprocal influence, that they cannot well be understood or explained separately. In this sense our body may be compared to a circular chain of powers, in which nothing is first or last, nothing fo-\n\nlitary or independent; so that wherever we begin, we find that there is something preceding which we ought to have known. If we begin with the brain and the nerves, for example, we shall find that these cannot exist, even in idea, without the heart: if we set out with the heart and vascular system, we shall presently be sensible that the brain and nerves must be supposed; or, should we take up the mouth, and follow the course of the aliment, we should see that the very first organ which presented itself, supposed the existence both of the heart and brain: Wherefore we shall incorporate the Physiology with the Anatomy, by attempting to explain the functions after we have demonstrated the organs.\n\nCHAP. I. OSTEOLoGY.\n\nWE begin with the bones, which may be considered as the great support of the body, tending to give it shape and firmness.—But before we enter into the detail of each particular bone, it will be necessary to describe their composition and connexions, and to explain the nature of the different parts which have an immediate relation to them: as the cartilages, ligaments, periosteum, marrow, and synovial glands.\n\nSect. I. Of the Bones in general, with their Appendages, &c.\n\nThe bones are of a firm and hard (a) substance, of a white colour, and perfectly insensible. They are the most compact and solid parts of the body, and serve for the attachment or support of all the other parts.\n\nThree different substances are usually distinguished in them; their exterior or bony part, properly so called: their spongy cells; and their reticular substance. The first of these is formed of many laminae or plates, composing a firm hard substance.—The spongy or cellular part is so called on account of its resemblance to a sponge, from the little cells which compose it. This substance forms almost the whole of the extremities of cylindrical bones. The reticular part is composed of fibres, which cross each other in different directions. This net-work forms the internal surface of these bones which have cavities.\n\nThe flat bones, as those of the head, are composed only of the laminae and the cellular substance. This last is usually found in the middle of the bone, dividing it into two plates, and is there called diploe.\n\nGagliardi, who pretended to have discovered an infinite number of claviculi (c) or bony processes, which he describes as traversing the laminae to unite them together, has endeavoured to support this pretended discovery by the analogy of bones to the bark of trees, in which certain woody nails have been remarked; but his opinion seems to be altogether fanciful.\n\nVol. II. Part I.\n\n(b) Mr Scheele discovered that bones contain the phosphoric acid united with calcareous earth; and that to this combination they owe their firmness.\n\n(c) In his Anat. efflum nov. invent. illustrat., he describes four kinds of these claviculi or nails, viz. the perpendicular, oblique, headed, and crooked.\nOsteology. Cavities either extend quite through its substance, or appear only as depressions. The former are called foramina or holes, and these foramina are sometimes termed canals or conduits, according to their form and extent. Of the depressions some are useful in articulation. These are called cotyloid when they are deep, as is the case with the os innominatum, where it receives the head of the os femoris; or glenoid when they are superficial, as in the scapula, where it receives the os humeri. Of the depressions that are not designed for articulation, those which have small apertures are called sinuses; others that are large, and not equally surrounded by high rims, are styled fossae; such as are long and narrow, furrows; or if broad and superficial without rims, sinuosity. Some are called digital impressions, from their resemblance to the traces of a finger on soft bodies.\n\nWe shall abridge this article, which is exceedingly diffuse in the generality of anatomical books, and will endeavour to describe it with all the clearness it will allow.\n\nThe bones composing the skeleton are so constructed, that the end of every bone is perfectly adapted to the extremity of that with which it is connected, and this connexion forms what is called their articulation.\n\nArticulation is divided into diarthrosis, synarthrosis, and amphiarthrosis, or moveable, immoveable, and mixed articulation. Each of the two first has its subdivisions. Thus the diarthrosis, or moveable articulation, includes, 1. The enarthrosis, as it is called, when a large head is admitted into a deep cavity, as in the articulation of the os femoris with the os innominatum. 2. Arthroidea, when a round head is articulated with a superficial cavity, as is the case of the os humeri and scapula. 3. Ginglimus, or hinge-like articulation, as in the connexion of the thigh-bone with the tibia. The enarthrosis and arthroidea allow of motion to all sides; the ginglimus only of flexion and extension.\n\nThe synarthrosis, or immoveable articulation, includes, 1. The suturae, when the two bones are indented into each other, as is the case with the parietal bones. 2. Gomphosis, when one bone is fixed into another, in the manner the teeth are placed in their sockets.\n\nThe term amphiarthrosis is applied to those articulations which partake both of the synarthrosis and diarthrosis, as is the case with the bones of the vertebrae, which are capable of motion in a certain degree, although they are firmly connected together by intermediate cartilages.\n\nWhat is called symphyses is the union of two bones into one; as in the lower jaw, for instance, which in the fetus consists of two distinct bones, but becomes one in a more advanced age, by the ossification of the uniting cartilage.\n\nWhen bones are thus joined by the means of cartilages, the union is styled synchondrosis; when by ligaments, synarthrosis.\n\nCartilages are white, solid, smooth, and elastic substances, between the hardness of bones, and ligaments, and seemingly of a fibrous texture. We are not able to trace any vessels into their substance by injection, nor are they ever found tinged in animals that have been fed with madder.\n\nThey may be distinguished into, 1st, Those which are connected with the bones; and 2ndly, Those which belong to other parts of the body. The first serve either to cover the ends and cavities of bones intended for motion, as in the articulations, where by their smoothness they facilitate motions, which the bones alone could not execute with so much freedom; or, they serve to unite bones together, as in the lymphatic pubis, or to lengthen them as in the ribs.\n\nMany of them ossify as we advance in life, their number is less in the adult than in the fetus, and of course there are fewer bones in the old than in the young subject.\n\nOf the second class of cartilages, or those belonging to the soft parts, we have instances in the larynx, where we find them useful in the formation of the voice, and for the attachment of muscles.\n\nThe periosteum is a fine membrane of a compact cellular texture, reflected from one joint to another, and serving as a common covering to the bones. It has sanguiferous and lymphatic vessels, and is supplied with nerves from the neighbouring parts. It adheres very firmly to their surface, and by its smoothness facilitates the motion of muscles. It likewise supports the vessels that go to be distributed through the substance of the bones, and may serve to strengthen the articulations. At the extremities of bones, where it is found covering a cartilage, it has by some been improperly considered as a distinct membrane, and named perichondrium. This, in its use and structure, resembles the periosteum. Where it covers the bones of the skull, it has got the name of pericranium.\n\nThe periosteum is not a production of the dura mater, as the ancients, and after them Flavers, imagined; nor are the bones formed by the ossification of this membrane, at least when it is in a sound state, as some late writers have supposed.\n\nThe periosteum is deficient in the teeth above the sockets, and in those parts of bones to which ligaments or tendons are attached.\n\nThe marrow is a fat oily substance, filling the cavities of bones. In the great cavities of long bones it is of a much firmer consistence than in the cells of their spongy part. In the former it inclines somewhat to a yellowish tinge, and is of the consistence of fat; in the latter it is more fluid, and of a red colour. This difference in colour and consistence is owing to accidental causes; both kinds are of the same nature, and may both be described under the common name of marrow, though some writers give this name only to the fat-like substance, and call the other the medullary juice.\n\nThe marrow is contained in a very fine and transparent membrane, which is supplied with a great number of blood vessels, chiefly from the periosteum. This membrana medullaris adheres to the inner surface of the bones, and furnishes an infinite number of minute bags or vesicles for enclosing the marrow, which is likewise supported in the cavities of the bones by the long filaments of their reticular substance.\n\nBesides the vessels from the periosteum, the membrana medullaris is filled with others, which in the long bones may be seen passing in near the extremities of the bone, and sending off numerous branches that ramify through all the vesicles of this membrane.\n\nThe bones, and the cells containing the marrow, are\nANATOMY.\n\nOsteology are likewise furnished with lymphatics. By their means, the marrow, like the fat, may be taken up in a greater quantity than it is secreted; and hence it is that so little is found in the bones of those who die of lingering diseases.\n\nIt is still a matter of controversy, Whether the marrow is sensible or not? We are certainly not able to trace any nerves to it; and from this circumstance, and its analogy to fat, Haller has ventured to consider it as insensible. On the other hand, Duverney affirms, that an injury done to this substance in a living animal was attended with great pain. In this dispute physiologists do not seem to have sufficiently discriminated between the marrow itself and the membranous cells in which it is contained. The former, like the fat, being nothing more than a secreted, and of course an inorganic matter, may with propriety be ranked among the insensible parts, as much as infusorial mucus or any other secreted matter in the body; whereas the membrana medullaris being vascular, though it possesses but an obscure degree of feeling in a sound state, is not perfectly insensible.\n\nThe marrow was formerly supposed to be intended for the nourishment and renewal of the bones; but this doctrine is now pretty generally and deservedly exploded. It seems probable that the marrow is to the bones what fat is to the soft parts. They both serve for some important purposes in the animal economy; but their particular use has never yet been clearly ascertained. The marrow, from the transmutation of the oil through the bones of a skeleton, is supposed to diminish their brittleness; and Havers, who has written professedly on the bones, describes the canals by which the marrow is conveyed through every part of their substance, and divides them into longitudinal and transverse ones. He speaks of the first as extending through the whole length of the bone; and of the latter, as the passages by which the longitudinal ones communicate with each other. The familiarity of these to the large canals in burnt bones, and the transmutation of the oil through the bones of the skeleton, seems to prove that some such passages do actually exist.\n\nThe synovial glands are small bodies (p), supposed to be of a glandular structure, and exceedingly vascular, secreting a fluid of a clear mucilaginous nature, which serves to lubricate the joints. They are placed in small cavities in the articulations, so as to be capable of being gently compressed by the motion of the joint, which expels their juice in proportion to the degree of friction. When the synovia is wanting, or is too thick a consistence, the joint becomes stiff and incapable of flexion or extension. This is what is termed ankylosis.\n\nLigaments are white, glinting, inelastic bands, of a compact substance, more or less broad or thick, and serving to connect the bones together. They are distinguished by different names adapted to their different forms and uses. Those of the joints are called either round or bursal. The round ligaments are white, tendinous, and inelastic. They are strong and flexible, and are found only in the joint of the knee, and in the articulation of the os femoris with the os innominatum. The bursal, or capsular ligaments, surround the whole joint like a purse, and are to be found in the articulations which allow motion every way, as in the articulation of the arm with the scapula.\n\nOf those fascia called Bursae Mucosae, a few were of the known to former anatomists, but by much the greater number have been since discovered by Dr Munro (e), who observes, that they are to be met with in the extremities of the body only; that many of them are placed entirely on the inner sides of the tendons, between these and the bones. Many others cover not only the inner, but the outer sides of the tendons, or are interposed between the tendons and external parts, as well as between those and the bones.\n\nSome are situated between the tendons and external parts only or chiefly, some between contiguous tendons, or between the tendons or the ligaments and the joints. A few such fascia are observed where the processes of bones play upon the ligaments, or where one bone plays upon another. Where two or more tendons are contiguous, and afterwards separate from each other, we generally find a common bursa divided into branches, with which it communicates; and a few fascia of contiguous tendons communicate with each other. Some, in healthy children, communicate with the cavities of the joints; and in many old people he has seen such communications formed by use or worn by friction, independent of disease.\n\nTheir proper membrane is thin and transparent, but very dense, and capable of confining air or any other fluid. It is joined to the neighbouring parts by the common cellular substance. Between the bursa and the hard substance of bone a thin layer of cartilage or of tough membrane is very generally interposed. To the cellular substance on the outside of the bursa, the adipose substance is connected except where the bursa covers a tendon, cartilage, or bone, much exposed to pressure or friction.\n\nIn several places a mass of fat, covered with the continuation of the membrane of the bursa, projects into its cavity. The edges of this are divided into fringes.\n\nThe inner side of the membrane is smooth, and is extremely slippery from the liquor secreted in it.\n\nThe structure of the bursa bears a strong resemblance to that of the capsular ligaments of the joints. 1. The inner capsular layer of the ligament, like that of the bursa, is thin gaments of and dense. 2. It is connected to the external ligaments the joints by the common cellular substance. 3. Between it and the bones, layers of cartilage, or the articular cartilages, are interposed. 4. At the sides of the joints, where it is not subject to violent pressure and friction, the adipose substance is connected with the cellular membrane. 5. Within the cavities of the joints we observe masses of fat projecting, covered with similar\n\n---\n\n(p) It is now much doubted, however, whether the appearances in the joints, which are usually called glands, are anything more than assemblages of fat.\n\n(e) See Description of the Bursae Mucosae, &c.\nOsteology blood vessels, and with similar fimbriae hanging from their edges. In the knee the upper part of such a mass of fat seems what has been called the mucilaginous gland of the joint, and the under part projects into the bursa behind the ligament which ties the patella to the tibia. The liquor which lubricates the bursa has the same colour, consistence, and properties, as that of the joints, and both are affected in the same manner by heat, mineral acids, and ardent spirits. In some places the bursa constantly communicate with the cavities of the joints, in others they generally do so; from which we may infer a sameness of structure.\n\nWhen we examine the fimbriae common to the fatty bodies of the joints and bursa, and which have been supposed to be the ducts of glands lodged within the masses of fat, we are not able to discover any glandular appearance within them. And although we observe many vessels dispersed upon the membranes of the fatty bodies and fimbriae; and that we cannot doubt that these fimbriae consist of ducts which contain a lubricating liquor, and can even press such a liquor from them; yet their cavities and orifices are so minute, that they are not discoverable even by the assistance of magnifying glasses. These fimbriae appear, therefore, to be ducts like those of the urethra, which prepare a mucilaginous liquor without the assistance of any knotty or glandular organ.\n\nUpon the whole, the synovia seems to be furnished by invisible exhalent arteries by the ducts of the fimbriae, and by oil exuding from the adipose follicles by passages not yet discovered.\n\nThe word skeleton, which by its etymology implies simply a dry preparation, is usually applied to an assemblage of all the bones of an animal united together in their natural order. It is said to be a natural skeleton, when the bones are connected together by their own proper ligaments; and an artificial one, when they are joined by any other substance, as wire, &c.\n\nThe skeleton is generally divided into the head, trunk, and extremities. The first division includes the bones of the cranium and face. The bones of the trunk are the spine, ribs, sternum, and bones of the pelvis.\n\nThe upper extremity on each side consists of the two bones of the shoulder, viz. the scapula and clavicle; the bone of the arm or os humeri; the bones of the fore-arm, and those of the hand.\n\nThe lower extremity on each side of the trunk consists of the thigh-bone and the bones of the leg and foot.\n\nSect. II. Of the Bones of the Head.\n\nThe head is of a roundish figure, and somewhat oval (f). Its greatest diameter is from the forehead to the occiput; its upper part is called vertex, or crown of the head; its anterior or fore part the face; and the upper part of this fusciput, or forehead; its sides the temples; its posterior, or hind part, the occiput; and its inferior part the basi.\n\nThe bones of the head may be divided into those of the cranium and face.\n\n§ 1. Bones of the Cranium and Face.\n\nThere are eight bones of the cranium, viz. the coronal bone, or os frontis; the two parietal bones or osa bregmatias; the os occipitis; the two temporal bones; the sphenoid bone; and the os ethmoides or cribriforme.\n\nOf these, only the os occipitis and osa bregmatias are considered as proper to the cranium; the rest being common both to the cranium and face.\n\nThese bones are all harder at their surface than in their middle; and on this account they are divided into two tables, and a middle spongy substance called diploe.\n\nIn this, as in all the other bones, we shall consider its figure, structure, processes, depressions, and cavities; and the manner in which it is articulated with the other bones.\n\nThe os frontis has some resemblance in shape to the shell of the cockle. Externally it is convex, its concave side being turned towards the brain. This bone, in the places where it is united to the temporal bones, is very thin, and has there no diploe. It is likewise exceedingly thin in that part of the orbit of the eye which is nearest to the nose. Hence it is, that a wound in the eye, by a sword, or any other pointed instrument, is sometimes productive of immediate death. In these cases, the sword passing through the weak part of the bone, penetrates the brain, and divides the nerves at their origin; or perhaps opens some blood-vessel, the consequences of which are soon fatal.\n\nWe observe on the exterior surface of this bone five apophyses or processes, which are easily to be distinguished. One of these is placed at the bottom and narrowest part of the bone, and is called the nasal process, from its supporting the upper end of the bones of the nose. The four others are called angular or orbital processes. They assist to form the orbits, which are the cavities on which the eyes are placed. In each of these orbits there are two processes, one at the interior or great angle, and the other at the exterior or little angle of the orbit. They are called the angular processes. Between these a ridge is extended in form of an arch, and on this the eyebrows are placed. It is called the orbital or superciliary ridge, and in some measure covers and defends the globe of the eye. There is a hole in this for the passage of the frontal vessels and nerves. This arch is interrupted near the nose by a small pit, in which the tendon of the musculus obliquus major of the eye is fixed. From the under part of each superciliary ridge a thin plate runs a considerable way backwards, and has the name of orbitar; the external and fore part of this plate forms\n\n(f) The bones of the foetus being perfectly distinct, and the muscles in young persons not acting much, the shape of the head has been supposed to depend much on the management of children when very young. Vesalius, who has remarked the difference in people of different nations, observes for instance, that the head of a Turk is conical, from the early use of the turban; whilst that of an Englishman is flattened by the chin-strap. Some of the latest physiologists suppose, with good reason, that this difference is chiefly owing to certain natural causes with which we are as yet unacquainted.\nOsteology forms a sinuosity for lodging the lachrymal gland. Between the orbital plates there is a large discontinuation of the bone, which is filled up by the cribriform part of the os ethmoides.\n\nOn examining the inner surface of this bone at its under and middle part, we observe an elevation in form of a ridge, which has been called the spinous process; it ascends for some way, dividing the bone into two considerable fossae, in which the anterior lobes of the brain are placed. To a narrow furrow in this ridge is attached the extremity of the falx, as the membrane is called, which divides the brain into two hemispheres. The furrow becoming gradually wider, is continued to the upper and back part of the bone. It has the falx fixed to it, and part of the longitudinal sinus lodged in it. Besides the two fossae, there are many depressions, which appear like digital impressions, and owe their formation to the prominent circumvolutions of the brain.\n\nIn the fetus, the forehead is composed of two distinct bones; so that in them the sagittal suture reaches from the os occipitis to the nose. This bone is almost everywhere composed of two tables and a diploe. These two tables separating from each other under the eyes, form two cavities, one on each side of the face, called the frontal sinuses. These sinuses are lined with a soft membrane, called membrana pituitaria. In these sinuses a mucus is secreted, which is constantly passing through two small holes into the nostrils, which it serves to moisten.\n\nThe os frontis is joined by sutures to many of the bones of the head, viz., to the parietal, maxillary, and temporal bones; to the os ethmoides; os sphenoides; os uncini; and os naso. The suture which connects it with the parietal bones is called the coronal suture.\n\nThe parietal bones are two in number; they are very thin, and even transparent in some places. The particular figure of each of these bones is that of an irregular square, bordered with indentations through its whole circumference, except at its lower part. It will be easily conceived, that these bones which compose the superior and lateral parts of the cranium, and cover the greatest part of the brain, form a kind of vault. On their inner surface we observe the marks of the vessels of the dura mater; and at their upper edge the groove for the superior longitudinal sinus.\n\nThe os parietalia are joined to each other by the sagittal suture; to the os sphenoides and os temporum by the squamous suture; to the os occipitis by the lambdoidal suture (α), so called from its resemblance to the Greek letter lambda; and to the os frontis by the coronal suture.\n\nIn the fetus, the parietal bones are separated from the middle of the divided os frontis by a portion of the cranium then unossified.\n\nThe occipital bone forms the posterior and inferior parts of the skull; it approaches nearly to the shape of a lozenge, and is indented throughout three parts of its circumference.\n\nThere is a considerable hole in the inferior portion of this bone, called the foramen magnum, through which the medulla oblongata passes into the spine. The nervi accessorii, and vertebral arteries, likewise pass through it. Behind the condyles are two holes for the passage of cervical veins into the lateral sinuses; and above them are two others for the passage of the eighth pair and accessory nerves out of the head. At the sides, and a little on the anterior part of the foramen magnum, are two processes, called the condyles, one on each side; they are of an oval figure, and are covered with cartilage.\n\nThe external surface of this bone has a large transverse arched ridge, under which the bone is very irregular, where it affords attachment to several muscles. On examining its inner surface, we may observe two ridges in form of a cross; one ascending from near the foramen magnum to the top of the bone; the upper end of this, in which the falx is fixed, is hollow, for lodging the superior longitudinal sinus; and the under end has the third process of the dura mater fixed to it. The other ridge, which runs horizontally, is likewise hollow for containing the lateral sinuses. Four fossae are formed by the cross, two above and two below. In the former are placed the posterior lobes of the brain, and in the latter the lobes of the cerebellum.\n\nAt the basis of the cranium, we observe the cuneiform process (which is the name given to the great apophysis at the fore part of this bone); it serves for the reception of the medulla oblongata.\n\nThe os occipitis is of greater strength and thickness than either of the other bones of the head, though irregularly so; at its inferior part, where it is thinnest, it is covered by a great number of muscles.\n\nThis bone, from its situation, being more liable to be injured by falls than any other bone of the head, nature has wisely given it the greatest strength at its upper part, where it is most exposed to danger.\n\nIt is joined to the parietal bones by the lambdoidal suture, and to the os temporum by the additamentum of the temporal suture. It is likewise connected to the os sphenoides by the cuneiform process. It is by means of the os occipitis that the head is united to the trunk, the two condyles of this bone being connected to the superior oblique processes of the first vertebra of the neck.\n\nThere are two temporal bones, one on each side. Of the temple we may distinguish in them two parts; one of which parotid bones is called the squamous or scaly part, and other pars petrota from its hardness. This last is shaped like a pyramid.\n\nEach of these divisions affords processes and cavities; externally there are three processes; one anterior, called the zygomatic process; one posterior, called the mastoid mamillary process, from its resemblance to a nipple; and one inferior, called the styloid process, because it is shaped like a filetto, or dagger.\n\nThe cavities are, 1. The meatus auditorius externus. 2. A large fossa which serves for the articulation of the lower jaw; it is before the meatus auditorius, and immediately under the zygomatic process. 3. The stylo-mastoid\n\n(α) The lambdoidal suture is sometimes very irregular, being composed of many small sutures, which surround so many little bones called os trigonum, though perhaps improperly, as they are not always triangular.\nOsteology. Stylo-mastoid hole, so called from its situation between the styloid and mastoid processes; it is likewise styled the aqueduct of Fallopian, and affords a passage to the portio dura of the auditory, or seventh part of nerves.\n\nBelow, and on the fore part of the last foramen, we observe part of the jugular fossa, in which the beginning of the internal jugular vein is lodged. Anterior and superior to this fossa is the orifice of a foramen, through which passes the carotid artery. This foramen runs first upwards and then forwards, forming a kind of elbow, and terminates at the end of the os petrosum.\n\nAt this part of each temporal bone, we may observe the opening of the Eustachian tube, a canal which passes from the ear to the back part of the nose.\n\nIn examining the internal surface of these bones, we may remark the triangular figure of their petrous part which separates two fossae; one superior and anterior; the other inferior and posterior; the latter of these composes part of the fossa, in which the cerebellum is placed; and the former, a portion of the least fossa for the basis of the brain. On the posterior side of the pars petrosum, we observe the meatus auditorius internus, into which enters the double nerve of the seventh pair. On the under side of this process, part of a hole appears, which is common to the temporal and occipital bones; through it the lateral sinus, the eighth pair, and accessory nerves, pass out of the head.\n\nThe pars petrosum contains several little bones called the bones of the ear; which, as they do not enter into the formation of the cranium, shall be described when we are treating of the organs of hearing.\n\nThe os temporum are joined to the os malarum, by the zygomatic sutures; to the parietal bones by the squamous sutures; to the os occipitis, by the lambdoidal suture; and to the sphenoid bone, by the suture of that name.\n\nThis bone, from its situation amidst the other bones of the head, has been sometimes called cuneiforme. It is of a very irregular figure, and has been compared to a bat with its wings extended.\n\nIt is commonly divided into its middle part or body, and its sides or wings.\n\nThe fore part of the body has a spine or ridge, which makes part of the leptom narium. The upper part of each wing forms a flare of the temple. The fore part of this belongs to the orbit; while the under and back part, termed spinous process, is lodged in the base of the skull at the point of the pars petrosum. But two of the most remarkable processes are the pterygoid or aliform, one on each side of the body of the bone, and at no great distance from it. Each of these processes is divided into two wings, and of these the exterior one is the widest. The other terminates in a hook-like process.\n\nThe internal surface of this bone affords three fossae. Two of these are formed by the wings of the bone, and make part of the lesser fossa of the basis of the cranium. The third, which is smaller, is on the top of the body of the bone; and is called sella turcica, from its resemblance to a Turkish saddle. This fossa, in which the pituitary gland is placed, has posteriorly and anteriorly processes called the clinoid processes.\n\nThere are twelve holes in this bone, viz. six on each side. The first is the passage of the optic nerve and ocular artery; the second, or large slit, transmits the third, fourth, fifth, and first part of the fifth pair of nerves with the ocular vein; the third hole gives passage to the second branch of the fifth pair; and the fourth hole to the third branch of the fifth pair of nerves. The fifth hole is the passage of the artery of the dura mater. The sixth hole is situated above the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone; through it a reflected branch of the second part of the fifth pair passes.\n\nWithin the substance of the os sphenoides there are two sinuses separated by a bony plate. They are lined with the pituitary membrane; and, like the frontal sinuses, separate a mucous which passes into the nostrils.\n\nThe os sphenoides is joined to all the bones of the cranium; and likewise to the os maxillaria, os malarum, os palati, and vomer.\n\nThis bone makes part of the basis of the skull, assists in forming the orbits, and affords attachment to several muscles.\n\nThe os ethmoides is situated at the fore part of the basis of the cranium, and is of a very irregular figure. From the great number of holes with which it is pierced, it is sometimes called os cribiforme, or sieve-like bone.\n\nIt consists of a middle part and two sides. The middle part is formed of a thin bony plate, in which are an infinite number of holes that afford a passage to filaments of the olfactory nerve. From the middle of this plate, both on the outside, and from within, there rises up a process, which may be easily distinguished. The inner one is called cribrum galii, from its supposed resemblance to a cock's comb. To this process the falx of the dura mater is attached. The exterior process, which has the same common basis as the cribrum galii, is a fine lamella which is united to the vomer; and divides the cavity of the nostrils, though unequally, it being generally a little inclined to one side.\n\nThe lateral parts of this bone are composed of cellular substance; and these cells are so very intricate, that their figure or number cannot be described. Many writers have on this account called this part of the bone the labyrinth. These cells are externally covered with a very thin bony lamella. This part of the bone is called the os planum, and forms part of the orbit.\n\nThe different cells of this bone, which are numerous, and which are everywhere lined with the pituitary membrane, evidently serve to enlarge the cavity of the nose, in which the organ of smelling resides.\n\nThis bone is joined to the os sphenoides, os frontis, os maxillaria, os palati, os naso, os unguis, and vomer.\n\nThe ancients, who considered the brain as the seat of all the humours, imagined that this viscus discharged its redundant moisture through the holes of the ethmoid bone. And the vulgar still think, that abscesses of the brain discharge themselves through the mouth and ears, and that snuff is liable to get into the head; but neither snuff nor the matter of an abscess are more capable of passing through the cribiform bone, than the ferocity which they supposed was discharged through it in a common cold. All the holes of the ethmoid bone are filled up with the branches of the olfactory nerve. Its inner part is likewise covered with the dura mater, and its cells are everywhere lined with\nOsteology, with the pituitary membrane; so that neither matter nor any other fluid can possibly pass through this bone either externally or internally. Matter is indeed sometimes discharged through the nostrils; but the seat of the disease is in the sinuses of the nose, and not in the brain; and impotations are observed to take place in the ear, which suppurate and discharge themselves externally.\n\nBefore we leave the bones of the head, we wish to make some general observations on its structure and figure. As the cranium might have been composed of a single bone, the articulation of its several bones being absolutely without motion, it may be asked perhaps, Why such a multiplicity of bones, and so great a number of sutures? Many advantages may possibly arise from this plurality of bones and sutures, which may not yet have been observed. We are able, however, to point out many useful ends, which could only be accomplished by this peculiarity of structure. In this, as in all the other works of nature, the great wisdom of the Creator is evinced, and cannot fail to excite our admiration and gratitude.\n\nThe cranium, by being divided into several bones, grows much faster and with greater facility, than if it was composed of one piece only. In the fetus, the bones, as we have before observed, are perfectly distinct from each other. The ossification begins in the middle of each bone, and proceeds gradually to the circumference. Hence the ossification, and of course the increase of the head, is carried on from an infinite number of points at the same time, and the bones consequently approach each other in the same proportion. To illustrate this doctrine more clearly, if it can want further illustration, suppose it necessary for the parietal bones which compose the upper part of the head, to extend their ossification, and form the fore part of the head likewise.—Is it not evident, that this process would be much more tedious than it is now, when the os frontis and the parietal bones are both growing at the same time? Hence it happens, that the heads of young people, in which the bones begin to touch each other, increase slowly; and that the proportionate increase of the volume of the head is greater in three months in the fetus, than it is perhaps in twenty-four months at the age of fourteen or fifteen years.\n\nThe sutures, exclusive of their advantages in suspending the processes of the dura mater, are evidently of great utility in preventing the too great extent of fractures of the skull.—Suppose, for instance, that by a fall or blow, one of the bones of the cranium becomes fractured. The fissure, which in a head composed of only one bone, would be liable to extend itself through the whole of it, is checked and sometimes perhaps stopped by the first suture it meets, and the effects of the injury are confined to the bone on which the blow was received. Ruylich indeed, and some others, will not allow the sutures to be of any such use; but cases have been met with where they seemed to have had this effect, and in young subjects their utility in this respect must be still more obvious.\n\nThe spherical shape of the head seems likewise to render it more capable of resisting external violence than any other shape would do. In a vault, the parts mutually support and strengthen each other, and this happens in the cranium.\n\n§ 2. Proper Bones of the Face.\n\nThe face, which consists of a great number of bones, is commonly divided into the upper and lower jaws; bones of the upper jaw consist of thirteen bones, exclusive of the face, the teeth. Of these, six are placed on each side of the maxilla superior, and one in the middle.\n\nThe bones, which are in pairs, are the os maxillare, os maxillaria, os naso, os unguis, os palati, and os spongiosum inferius. The single bone is the vomer.\n\nThese are the prominent square bones which are placed under the eyes, forming part of the orbits and malarum, the upper part of the cheeks. Each of them affords three surfaces; one exterior and a little convex; a second superior and concave, forming the inferior part and sides of the orbit; and a third posterior, irregular, and hollowed for the lodgment of the lower part of the temporal muscle.\n\nThe angles of each bone form four processes, two of which may be called orbital processes; of these the upper one is joined by suture to the os frontis, and that below to the maxillary bone. The third is connected with the os sphenoides by means of the transverse suture; and the fourth is joined to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, with which it forms the zygoma.\n\nThese bones, which are of a very irregular figure, are so called because they form the most considerable portion of the upper jaw. They are two in number, and generally remain distinct through life.\n\nOf the many processes which are to be seen on these bones, and which are connected with the bones of the face and skull, we shall describe only the most remarkable.\n\nOne of these processes is at the upper and fore part of the bone, making part of the side of the nose, and called the nasal process. Another forms a kind of circular sweep at the inferior part of the bone, in which are the alveoli or sockets for the teeth: this is called the alveolar process. A third process is united to the os maxilla on each side. Between this and the nasal process there is a thin plate, which forms a share of the orbit, and lies over a passage for the superior maxillary vessels and nerves.—The alveolar process has posteriorly a considerable tuberosity on its internal surface, called the maxillary tuberosity.\n\nBehind the alveolar process we observe two horizontal lamellae, which uniting together, form part of the roof of the mouth, and divide it from the nose. The hollowness of the roof of the mouth is owing to this partition's being seated somewhat higher than the alveolar process.—At the fore part of the horizontal lamellae there is a hole called foramen incisivum, through which small blood vessels and nerves go between the mouth and nose.\n\nIn viewing these bones internally, we observe a fossa in the inferior portion of the nasal process, which, with the os unguis and os spongiosum inferius, forms a passage for the lachrymal duct.\n\nWhere these two bones are united to each other, they project somewhat upwards and forwards, leaving between them a furrow, into which the lower portion of the septum nasi is admitted.\n\nEach of these bones being hollow, a considerable fi-\nOsteology. nus is formed under its orbital part. This cavity, which is usually named after Highmore, though it was described by Fallopius and others before his time, is lined with the pituitary membrane. It is intended for the same purposes as the other sinuses of the nose, and opens into the nostrils.\n\nThe os maxillaria are connected with the greater part of the bones of the face and cranium, and assist in forming not only the cheeks, but likewise the palate, nose, and orbits.\n\nThe os nasoform two irregular squares. They are thicker and narrower above than below. Externally they are somewhat convex, and internally slightly concave. These bones constitute the upper part of the nose. At their fore part they are united to each other, above to the os frontis, by their sides to the os maxillaria superiores, posteriorly and inferiorly to the septum narium, and below to the cartilages that compose the rest of the nostrils.\n\nThese little transparent bones owe their name to their supposed resemblance to a finger nail. Sometimes they are called os lacrymalia, from their concurring with the nasal process of each maxillary bone in forming a lodgment for the lacrimal sac and duct.\n\nThe os unguis are of an irregular figure. Their external surface consists of two smooth parts, divided by a middle ridge. One of these parts, which is concave and nearest to the nose, serves to support the lacrimal sac and part of the lacrimal duct. The other, which is flat, forms a small part of the orbit.\n\nEach of these bones is connected with the os frontis, os ethmoides, and os maxillare superius.\n\nThese bones, which are situated at the back part of the roof of the mouth, between the os sphenoides and the os maxillaria superiores, are of a very irregular shape, and serve to form the nasal and maxillary fossa, and a small portion of the orbit. Where they are united to each other, they rise up into a spine on their internal surface. This spine appears to be a continuation of that of the superior maxillary bones, and helps to form the septum narium.\n\nThese bones are joined to the os maxillaria superiores, os ethmoides, os sphenoides, and vomer.\n\nThis bone derives its name from its resemblance to a ploughshare. It is a long and flat bone, somewhat thicker at its back than at its fore part. At its upper part we observe a furrow extending through its whole length. The posterior and largest part of this furrow receives a process of the sphenoid bone. From this the furrow advances forwards, and becoming narrower and shallower, receives some part of the nasal lamella ethmoides; the rest serves to support the middle cartilage of the nose.\n\nThe inferior portion of this bone is placed on the nasal spine of the maxillary and palate bones, which we mentioned in our description of the os palati.\n\nThe vomer is united to the os sphenoides, os ethmoides, os maxillaria superiores, and os palati. It forms part of the septum narium, by dividing the back part of the nose into two nostrils.\n\nThe parts which are usually described by this name, do not seem to deserve to be distinguished as distinct bones, except in young subjects. They consist of a spongy lamina in each nostril, which is united to the spongy lamina of the ethmoid bone, of which they are considered as a part.\n\nEach of these lamellae is longest from behind forwards; with its convex surface turned towards the septum narium, and its concave part towards the maxillary bone, covering the opening of the lacrimal duct into the nose.\n\nThese bones are covered with the pituitary membrane; and besides their connexion with the ethmoid bone, are joined to the os maxillaria superiores, os palati, and os unguis.\n\nThe maxilla inferior, or lower jaw, which in its shape resembles a horse shoe, consists of two distinct bones inferior in the fetus; but these unite together soon after birth, so as to form only one bone. The upper edge of this bone, like the os maxillare superius, has an alveolar process, furnished with sockets for the teeth.\n\nOn each side the posterior part of the bone rises almost perpendicularly into two processes. The highest of these, called the coronoid process, is pointed and thin, and serves for the insertion of the temporal muscle. The other, or condylar process, as it is called, is shorter and thicker, and ends in an oblong rounded head, which is received into a fossa of the temporal bone, and is formed for a moveable articulation with the cranium. This joint is furnished with a moveable cartilage. At the bottom of each coronoid process, on its inner part, we observe a foramen extending under the roots of all the teeth, and terminating at the outer surface of the bone near the chin. Each of these canals transmits an artery, vein, and nerve, from which branches are sent off to the teeth.\n\nThe lower jaw is capable of a great variety of motion. By sliding the condyles from the cavity towards the eminences on each side, we bring it horizontally forwards, as in biting; or we may bring the condyles only forward, and tilt the rest of the jaw backwards, as in opening the mouth. We are likewise able to slide the condyles alternately backwards and forwards from the cavity to the eminence, and vice versa, as in grinding the teeth. The cartilages, by adapting themselves to the different inequalities in these several motions of the jaw, serve to secure the articulation, and to prevent any injuries from friction.\n\nThe alveolar processes are composed of an outer and inner bony plate, united together by thin partitions, which at the fore part of the jaw divide the processes into as many sockets as there are teeth. But at the back part of the jaw, where the teeth have more than one root, we find a distinct cell for each root. In both jaws these processes begin to be formed with the teeth; they likewise accompany them in their growth, and gradually disappear when the teeth are removed.\n\n§ 3. Of the Teeth.\n\nThe teeth are bones of a particular structure, formed for the purposes of mastication and the articulation of the voice. It will be necessary to consider their composition and figure, their number and arrangement, and the time and order in which they appear.\n\nIn each tooth we may distinguish a body, a neck, and a root or fangs.\n\nThe body of the tooth is that part which appears above\nThe root is fixed into the socket, and the neck is the middle part between the two.\n\nThe teeth are composed of two substances, viz. enamel and bone. The enamel, or the vitreous or cortical part of the tooth, is a white and very hard and compact substance peculiar to the teeth, and appears fibrous or striated when broken. This substance is thickest on the grinding surface, and becoming gradually thinner, terminates indefinitely at the neck of the tooth. Ruyfch * affirmed, that he could trace the arteries into the hardest part of the teeth; Leeuwenhoek † suspected the fibres of the enamel to be fo many vessels; and Monro ‡ says, he has frequently injected the vessels of the teeth in children, so as to make the inside of the cortex appear perfectly red. But it is certain, that it is not tinged by a madder diet, and that no injection will ever reach it, so that it has no appearance of being vascular.\n\nThe bony part, which composes the inner substance of the body, neck, and root of the tooth, resembles other bones in its structure, but it is much harder than the most compact part of bones in general. As a tooth when once formed receives no tinge from a madder diet, and as the minutest injections do not penetrate into its substance, this part of a tooth has, like the enamel, been supposed not to be vascular. But when we consider that the fangs of a tooth are invested by a periosteum, and that the swellings of these fangs are analogous to the swellings of other bones, we may reasonably conclude, that there is a similarity of structure; and that this bony part has a circulation through its substance, although from its hardness we are unable to demonstrate its vessels.\n\nIn each tooth we find an inner cavity, into which enter an artery, vein, and nerve. This cavity begins by a small opening, and becoming larger, terminates in the body of the tooth. In advanced life this hole sometimes closes, and the tooth is of course rendered infensible.\n\nThe periosteum surrounds the teeth from their fangs to a little beyond their bony sockets, where we find it adhering to the gums. This membrane, while it encloses the teeth, serves at the same time to line the sockets; so that it may be considered as common to both.\n\nThe teeth are likewise secured in their sockets by means of the gums; a red, vascular, firm, and elastic substance, that possesses but little sensibility. In the gums of infants we find a hard ridge extending through their whole length, but no such ridge is to be seen in old people who have lost their teeth.\n\nThe number of the teeth in both jaws at full maturity, usually varies from twenty-eight to thirty-two. They are commonly divided into three classes, viz. incisors, canini, and grinders or molars (ii). The incisors are the four teeth in the fore part of each jaw. They have each of them two surfaces; one anterior and convex, the other posterior and slightly concave, both of which terminate in a sharp edge. They are called incisors from their use in dividing the food. They are usually broader and thicker in the upper than in the under jaw; and, by being placed somewhat obliquely, generally fall over the latter.\n\nThe canini derive their name from their resemblance to a dog's tusks, being the longest of all the teeth. We find one on each side of the incisors, so that there are two canini in each jaw. Their fang resembles that of the incisors, but is much larger; and in their shape they appear like an incisor with its edge worn off, so as to terminate in a narrow point.\n\nThese teeth not being calculated for cutting and dividing the food like the incisors, or for grinding it like the molares, seem to be intended for laying hold of substances (i).\n\nThe molares or grinders, of which there are ten in each jaw, are so called, because from their shape and size they are fitted for grinding the food. Each of the incisors and canini is furnished only with one fang; but in the molares of the under jaw we constantly find two fangs, and in those of the upper jaw three fangs. These fangs are sometimes separated into two points, and each of these points has sometimes been described as a distinct fang.\n\nThe two first of the molares, or those nearest to the canine teeth on each side, differ from the other three, and are with great propriety named bicuspides by Mr Hunter. They have sometimes only one root, and seem to be of a middle nature between the incisors and the larger molares. The two next are much larger. The fifth or last grinder on each side is smaller and shorter than the rest; and from its not cutting the gum till after the age of twenty, and sometimes not till much later in life, it is called dens sapientiae.\n\nThere is in the structure and arrangement of all these teeth an art which cannot be sufficiently admired. To understand it properly, it will be necessary to consider the under jaw as a kind of lever, with its fixed points at its articulations with the temporal bones: it will be right to observe, too, that its powers arise from its different muscles, but in elevation chiefly from the temporalis and masseter; and that the aliment constitutes the object of resistance. It will appear, then, that the molares, by being placed nearest the centre of motion, are calculated to press with a much greater force than the other teeth, independent of their grinding powers which they possess by means of the pterygoid muscles; and that it is for this reason we put between them any hard body we wish to break.\n\nThe canini and incisors are placed farther from this point, and of course cannot exert so much force; but\n\n---\n\n(ii) Mr Hunter has thought proper to vary this division. He retains the old name of incisors to the four fore teeth, but he distinguishes the canine teeth by the name of the cupidati. The two teeth which are next to these, and which have been usually ranked with the molares, he calls the bicuspides; and he gives the name of grinders only to the three last teeth on each side.\n\n(i) Mr Hunter remarks of these teeth, that we may trace in them a similarity in shape, situation, and use, from the most imperfectly carnivorous animal, which we believe to be the human species, to the lion, which is the most perfectly carnivorous.\nthey are made for cutting and tearing the food, and this form seems to make amends for their deficiency in strength.\n\nThere are examples of children who have come into the world with two, three, and even four teeth; but these examples are very rare; and it is seldom before the seventh, eighth, or ninth month after birth, that the incisors, which are the first formed, begin to pass through the gum. The symptoms of dentition, however, in consequence of irritation from the teeth, frequently take place in the fourth or fifth month. About the twentieth or twenty-fourth month, the canines and two molars make their appearance.\n\nThe dangerous symptoms that sometimes accompany dentition, are owing to the pressure of the teeth on the gum, which they irritate so as to excite pain and inflammation. This irritation seems to occasion a gradual wasting of the gum at the part, till at length the tooth makes its appearance.\n\nThe symptoms are more or less alarming, in proportion to the resistance which the gum affords to the teeth, and according to the number of teeth which may chance to seek a passage at the same time. Were they all to appear at once, children would fall victims to the pain and excessive irritation; but Nature has so wisely disposed them, that they usually appear one after the other, with some distance of time between each. The first incisor that appears is generally in the lower jaw; and is followed by one in the upper jaw. Sometimes the canine, but more commonly one of the molars, begins to pass through the gum first.\n\nThese 20 teeth, viz. eight incisors, four canines, and eight molars, are called temporary or milk teeth, because they are all shed between the age of seven and 14, and are succeeded by what are called the permanent or adult teeth. The latter are of a firmer texture, and have larger fangs.\n\nThese adult teeth being placed in a distinct set of alveoli, the upper sockets gradually disappear, as the under ones increase in size, till at length the temporary, or upper teeth, having no longer any support, consequently fall out.\n\nTo these 20 teeth which succeed the temporary ones, 12 others are afterwards added, viz. three molars on each side in both jaws; and in order to make room for this addition, we find that the jaws gradually lengthen in proportion to the growth of the teeth; so that with 32 teeth, they seem to be as completely filled as they are afterwards with 32. This is the reason why the face is rounder and flatter in children than in adults.\n\nWith regard to the formation of the teeth, we may observe, that in a fetus of four months, the alveolar process appears only as a shallow longitudinal groove, divided by minute ridges into a number of intermediate depressions; in each of which we find a small pulpy substance, surrounded by a vascular membrane. This pulp gradually ossifies, and its lower part is lengthened out to form the fang. When the bony part of the tooth is formed, its surface begins to be incrustated with the enamel. How the latter is formed and deposited, we are not yet able to determine.\n\nThe rudiments of some of the adult teeth begin to be formed at a very early period, for the pulp of one of the incisors may generally be perceived in a fetus of eight months, and the ossification begins in it soon after birth. The first bicuspids begins to ossify about the fifth or sixth, and the second about the seventh year. The first adult grinder cuts the gum about the 12th, the second about the 18th, and the third, or dens sapientiae, usually between the 20th and 30th year.\n\nThe teeth, like other bones, are liable to be affected by disease. Their removal is likewise the natural consequence of old age; for as we advance in life, the alveoli fill up, and the teeth, especially the incisors, fall out. When this happens, the chin projects forward, and the face is much shortened.\n\n§ 4. Of the Os Hyoides (k).\n\nThe os hyoides, which is placed at the root of the tongue, was so called by the ancients on account of its supposed resemblance to the Greek letter υ.\n\nIt will be necessary to distinguish in it, its body, horns, and appendices.\n\nThe body, which is the middle and broadest part of the bone, is so placed that it may be easily felt at the fore part of the throat. Anteriorly it is irregularly convex, and its inner surface is unequally concave. Its cornua, or horns, which are flat and a little bent, being much longer than the body part, may be described as forming the sides of the υ. The appendices, or little horns, as they are called by M. Windlow and some other writers, are two processes which rise up from the articulation of the cornua with the body, and are usually connected with the styloid process on each side, by means of a ligament.\n\nThe uses of this bone are to support the tongue, and afford attachment to a great number of muscles; some of which perform the motions of the tongue, while others act on the larynx and fauces.\n\nSect. III. Of the Bones of the Trunk.\n\nThe trunk of the skeleton consists of the spine, the thorax, and the pelvis.\n\n§ 1. Of the Spine.\n\nThe spine is composed of a great number of bones called vertebrae, forming a long bony column, in figure not much unlike the letter J. This column, which extends from the head to the lower part of the body, may be said to consist of two irregular and unequal pyramids, united to each other in that part of the loins where the last lumbar vertebra joins the os sacrum.\n\nThe vertebrae of the upper and longest pyramid are called\n\n(k) This bone is very seldom preserved with the skeleton, and cannot be included among the bones of the head or in any other division of the skeleton. Thomas Bartholin has perhaps very properly described it among the parts contained in the mouth; but the generality of anatomical writers have placed it, as it is here, after the bones of the face.\nChap. I.\n\nANATOMY.\n\nOsteology, called true vertebrae, in contradistinction to those of the lowermost pyramid, which, from their being immovable in the adult, are styled false vertebrae. It is upon the bones of the spine that the body turns; and it is to this circumstance they owe their name, which is derived from the Latin verb vertere, to turn.\n\nThe true vertebrae are divided into three classes of cervical, dorsal, and lumbar vertebrae.—The false vertebrae consist of the os sacrum and os coccygis.\n\nIn each vertebra, as in other bones, it will be necessary to remark the body of the bone, its processes, and cavities.\n\nThe body, which is convex before, and concave behind, where it assists in forming the cavity of the spine, may be compared to part of a cylinder cut off transversely.\n\nEach vertebra affords seven processes. The first is at the back part of the vertebra, and from its shape and direction is named the spinous process. On each side of this are two others, which, from their situation with respect to the spine, are called transverse processes. The four others are styled oblique or articular processes. They are much smaller than the spinous or transverse ones. Two of them are placed on the upper, and two on the lower part of each vertebra, rising from near the basis of each transverse process. They have gotten the name of oblique processes, from their situation with respect to the processes with which they are articulated; and they are sometimes styled articular processes, from the manner in which they are articulated with each other; the two superior processes of one vertebra being articulated with the two inferior processes of the vertebra above it. Each of these processes is covered with cartilage at its articulation, and their articulations with each other are by a species of ginglimus.\n\nIn each vertebra, between its body and its processes, we find a hole large enough to admit a finger. These holes are foramina, correspond with each other through all the vertebrae, and form the long bony channel in which the spinal marrow is placed. We may likewise observe four notches in each vertebra. Two of these notches are at the upper, and two at the lower part of the bone, between the oblique processes and the body of the vertebra. Each of these notches meeting with a similar opening in the vertebra above or below it, forms a foramen for the passage of blood vessels, and of the nerves out of the spine.\n\nThe bones of the spine are united together by means of a substance, which in young subjects appears to be of a ligamentous, but in adults more of a cartilaginous nature. This intervertebral substance, which forms a kind of partition between the several vertebrae, is thicker and more flexible between the lumbar vertebrae than in the other parts of the spine, the most considerable motions of the trunk being performed on those vertebrae. This substance being very elastic, the extension and flexion of the body, and its motion backwards and forwards, or to either side, are performed with great facility. This elasticity seems to be the reason why people who have been long standing, or have carried a considerable weight, are found to be shorter than when they have been long in bed. In the two first instances the intervertebral cartilages (as they are usually called) are evidently more exposed to compression than when we are in bed in a horizontal posture.\n\nIn advanced life these cartilages become shrivelled, and of course lose much of their elasticity. This may serve to account for the decrease in stature and the slopping forward which are usually to be observed in old people.\n\nBesides the connexion of the several vertebrae by means of this intervertebral substance, there are likewise many strong ligaments, both external and internal, which unite the bones of the spine to each other. Their union is also strengthened by a variety of strong muscles that cover and surround the spine.\n\nThe bones of the spine are found to diminish in density, and to be less firm in their texture in proportion as they increase in bulk; so that the lowermost vertebrae, though the largest, are not so heavy in proportion as the upper ones. By this means the size of these bones is increased without adding to their weight; a circumstance of no little importance in a part like the spine, which, besides flexibility and suppleness, seems to require lightness as one of its essential properties.\n\nIn very young children, each vertebra consists of three bony pieces united by cartilages which afterwards ossify.\n\nThere are seven vertebrae of the neck—they are of a firmer texture than the other bones of the spine. Their of the neck, transverse processes are forked for the lodgment of muscles, and at the bottom of each we observe a foramen, through which pass the cervical artery and vein. The first and second of these vertebrae must be described more particularly. The first approaches almost to an oval shape.—On its superior surface it has two cavities which admit the condyles of the occipital bone with which it is articulated. This vertebra, which is called atlas from its supporting the head, cannot well be described as having either body or spinous process, being a kind of bony ring. Anteriorly, where it is articulated to the odontoid process of the second vertebra, it is very thin. On its upper surface it has two cavities which admit the condyles of the occipital bone. By this connexion the head is allowed to move forwards and backwards, but has very little motion in any other direction.\n\nThe second vertebra has gotten the name of dentata, from its having, at its upper and anterior part, a process called the odontoid or tooth-like process, which is articulated with the atlas, to which this second vertebra may be said to serve as an axis. This odontoid process is of a cylindrical shape, somewhat flattened, however, anteriorly and posteriorly. At its fore part where it is received by the atlas, we may observe a smooth, convex, articulating surface. It is by means of this articulation that the head performs its rotatory motion, the atlas in that case moving upon this odontoid process as upon a pivot. But when this motion is in any considerable degree, or, in other words, when the head moves much either to the right or left, all the cervical vertebrae seem to assist, otherwise the spinal marrow would be in danger of being divided transversely by the first vertebra.\n\nThe spinous process of each of the cervical vertebrae is shorter, and their articular processes more oblique, of the back, than in the other bones of the spine.\n\nThese 12 vertebrae are of a middle size between those of the neck and loins. At their sides we may observe two depressions, one at the upper and the other at the lower\nlower part of the body of each vertebra; which uniting with similar depressions in the vertebra above and below, form articulating surfaces, covered with cartilages, for receiving the heads of the ribs; and at the fore part of their transverse processes (excepting the two last) we find an articulating surface for receiving the tuberosity of the ribs.\n\nThe five vertebrae differ only from those of the back in their being larger, and in having their spinous processes at a greater distance from each other. The most considerable motions of the trunk are made on these vertebrae; and these motions could not be performed with so much ease, were the processes placed nearer to each other.\n\nOs sacrum. The os sacrum, which is composed of five or six pieces in young subjects, becomes one bone in more advanced age.\n\nIt is nearly of a triangular figure, its inferior portion being bent a little forwards. Its superior part has two oblique processes, which are articulated with the last of the lumbar vertebrae; and it has likewise commonly three small spinous processes, which gradually become shorter, so that the lowermost is not so long as the second, nor the second as the uppermost. Its transverse processes are formed into one oblong process, which becomes gradually smaller as it descends. Its concave or anterior side is usually smooth, but its posterior convex side has many prominences (the most remarkable of which are the spinous processes just now mentioned), which are filled up and covered with the muscular and tendinous parts behind.\n\nThis bone has five pair of holes, which afford a passage to blood vessels, and likewise to the nerves that are derived from the spinal marrow, which is continued even here, being lodged in a triangular cavity, that becomes smaller as it descends, and at length terminates obliquely at the lower part of this bone. Below the third division of the os sacrum, this canal is not completely bony as the rest of the spine, being secured at its back part only by a very strong membrane, so that a wound at this part must be extremely dangerous.\n\nThe os sacrum is united laterally to the os innominata or hip-bones, and below to the coccyx.\n\nThe coccyx, which, like the os sacrum, is in young people made up of three or four distinct parts, usually becomes one bone in the adult state.\n\nIt serves to support the intestinum rectum; and, by its being capable of some degree of motion at its articulation with the sacrum, and being like that bone bent forwards, we are enabled to fit with ease.\n\nThis bone is nearly of a triangular shape, being broadest at its upper part, and from thence growing narrower to its apex, where it is not bigger than the little finger.\n\nIt has got its name from its supposed resemblance to a cuckow's beak. It differs greatly from the vertebrae, being commonly without any processes, and having no cavity for the spinal marrow, or foramina for the transmition of nerves.\n\nThe spine, of which we have now finished the anatomical description, is destined for many great and important uses. The medulla spinalis is lodged in its bony canal secure from external injury. It serves as a defence to the abdominal and thoracic viscera, and at the same time supports the head, and gives a general firmness to the whole trunk.\n\nWe have before compared it to the letter S, and its different turns will be found to render it not very unlike the figure of that letter.—In the neck we see it projecting somewhat forward to support the head, which, without this affixture, would require a greater number of muscles. Lower down, in the thorax, we find it taking a curved direction backwards, and of course increasing the cavity of the chest. After this, in the loins, it again projects forwards in a direction with the centre of gravity, by which means we are easily enabled to keep the body in an erect posture, for otherwise we should be liable to fall forwards. Towards its inferior extremity, however, it again recedes backward, and thus affixes in forming the pelvis, the name given to the cavity in which the urinary bladder, intestinum rectum, and other viscera are placed.\n\nIf this bony column had been formed only of one piece, it would have been much more easily fractured than it is now: and by confining the trunk to a stiff situation, a variety of motions would have been altogether prevented, which are now performed with ease by the great number of bones of which it is composed.\n\nIt is firm, and yet to this firmness there is added a perfect flexibility. If it be required to carry a load upon the head, the neck becomes stiff with the affixture of its muscles, and accommodates itself to the load, as if it was composed only of one bone.—In stooping likewise, or in turning to either side, the spine turns itself in every direction, as if all its bones were separated from each other.\n\nIn a part of the body like the spine, that is made up of so great a number of bones, and intended for such a variety of motion, there must be a greater danger of dislocation than fracture; but we shall find, that this is very wisely guarded against in every direction by the processes belonging to each vertebra, and by the ligaments, cartilages, &c., by which these bones are connected with each other.\n\n§ 2. Of the Bones of the Thorax.\n\nThe thorax, or chest, is composed of many bones, viz. the sternum which is placed at its anterior part, twelve ribs on each side which make up its lateral parts, and the dorsal vertebrae which constitute its posterior part. These last have been already described.\n\nThe sternum is the long bone which extends itself from the upper to the lower part of the breast anteriorly, and to which the ribs and the clavicles are articulated.\n\nIn children it is composed of several bones united by cartilages; but as we advance in life, most of these cartilages ossify, and the sternum in the adult state is found to consist only of three pieces, and sometimes becomes one bone. It is however generally described as being composed of three parts—one superior, which is broad, thick, and short; and one in the middle, which is thinner, narrower, and longer than the other.\n\nIt terminates at its lower part by a third piece, which is called the xiphoid, or sword-like cartilage, from its supposed resemblance to the blade of a sword, and because in young subjects it is commonly in a cartilaginous state.\nWe have already observed, that this bone is articulated with the clavicle on each side. It is likewise joined to the fourteen true ribs, viz. seven on its right and seven on its left side.\n\nThe ribs are bones shaped like a bow, forming the sides of the chest. There are twelve on each side. They are distinguished into true and false ribs: The seven upper ribs which are articulated to the sternum are called true ribs, and the five lower ones that are not immediately attached to that bone are called false ribs.\n\nOn the inferior and interior surface of each rib, we observe a fineness for the lodgment of an artery, vein, and nerve.\n\nThe ribs are not bony through their whole length, their anterior part being cartilaginous. They are articulated with the vertebrae and sternum. Every rib (or at least the greater number of them) has at its posterior part two processes; one at its extremity, called the head of the rib, by means of which it is articulated with the body of two vertebrae; and another, called its tuberosity, by which it is articulated with the transverse process of the lowest of these two vertebrae. The first rib is not articulated by its extremity to two vertebrae, being firmly attached to the upper part of the first vertebra of the back. The seven superior or true ribs are articulated anteriorly with the sternum by their cartilages; but the false ribs are supported in a different manner—the eighth, which is the first of these ribs, being attached by its cartilages to the seventh; the ninth to the eighth, &c.\n\nThe two lowermost ribs differ likewise from all the rest in the following particulars: They are articulated only with the body of a vertebra, and not with a transverse process; and anteriorly, their cartilage is loose, not being attached to the cartilages of the other ribs; and this seems to be, because the most considerable motions of the trunk are not performed on the lumbar vertebrae alone, but likewise on the two last vertebrae of the back: so that if these two ribs had been confined at the fore part like the other ribs, and had been likewise articulated with the bodies of two vertebrae, and with the transverse processes, the motion of the two last vertebrae, and consequently of the whole trunk, would have been impeded.\n\nThe ribs help to form the cavity of the thorax; they afford attachment to different muscles; they are useful in respiration; and they serve as a security to the heart and lungs.\n\n§ 3. Of the Bones of the Pelvis.\n\nThe pelvis is composed of the os sacrum, os coccygis, and two osa innominata. The two first of these bones were included in the account of the spine, to which they more properly belong.\n\nIn children, each os innominatum is composed of three distinct bones; but as we advance in life the intermediate cartilages gradually ossify, and the marks of the original separation disappear, so that they become one irregular bone; still, however, continuing to retain the names of ilium, ischium, and pubis, by which their divisions were originally distinguished, and to be described as three different bones by the generality of anatomists. The os ilium forms the upper and most considerable part of the bone, the os ischium its lower and posterior portion, and the os pubis its fore part.\n\nThe os ilium or haunch-bone, is articulated posteriorly to the os sacrum by a firm cartilaginous substance, and is united to the os pubis before and to the os ischium below. Its superior portion is thin, and terminates in a ridge called the cribrum or spine of the ilium, and more commonly known by the name of the haunch. This cribrum rises up like an arch, being turned somewhat outward, so as to resemble the wings of a phaeton.\n\nExternally this bone is unequally prominent and hollowed for the lodgment of muscles; internally we find it smooth and concave. At its lower part there is a considerable ridge on its inner surface. This ridge extends from the os sacrum, and corresponds with a similar prominence both on that bone and the ischium; forms with the inner part of the osa pubis what in midwifery is termed the brim of the pelvis.\n\nThe cribrum, or spine, which at first is an epiphysis, has two considerable tubercles; one anteriorly, and the other posteriorly, which is the largest of the two. These, from their projecting more than the parts of the bone below them, have gotten the name of spinal processes. From the anterior spinous process, the iliacus and tensor vaginae femoris muscles have their origin; and below the posterior process we observe a considerable niche in the bone, which, in the recent subject, is formed into a large foramen, by means of a strong ligament that is stretched over its lower part from the os sacrum to the sharp-pointed process of the ischium. This hole affords a passage to the great sciatic nerve, and to the posterior crural vessels under the pyriform muscle, part of which likewise passes out here.\n\nThe os ischium, or hip-bone, which is of a very irregular figure, constitutes the lower lateral parts of the pelvis, and is commonly divided into its body, tuberosity, and ramus. The body forms the lower and most considerable portion of the acetabulum, and sends a sharp-pointed process backwards, called the spine of the ischium. To this process the ligament adheres, which was just now spoken of, as forming a foramen for the passage of the sciatic nerve. The tuberosity, which is the lowest part of the trunk, and supports us when we sit, is large and irregular, affording origin to several muscles. From this tuberosity we find the bone becoming thinner and narrower. This part, which has the name of ramus or branch, passes forwards and upwards, and connects with the ramus of the os pubis, to form a large hole called the foramen magnum ischi, or thyroideum, as it is sometimes named from its resemblance to a door or shield. This hole, which in the recent subject is closed by a strong membrane called the obturator ligament, affords through its whole circumference attachment to muscles. At its upper part where we observe a niche in the bone, it gives passage to the obturator vessels and nerves, which go to the inner part of the thigh. Nature seems everywhere to avoid an unnecessary weight of bone, and this foramen, no doubt, serves to lighten the bones of the pelvis.\n\nThe os pubis or thac-bone, which with its fellow os pubis forms the fore part of the pelvis, is the smallest division of the os innominatum. It is united to its fellow by\nby means of a strong cartilage, which forms what is called the symphysis pubis.\n\nIn each os pubis we may distinguish the body of the bone, its angle, and ramus. The body or outer part is united to the os ilium. The angle comes forwards to form the symphysis, and the ramus is a thin process which unites with the ramus of the ilium, to form the foramen thyroidum.\n\nThe three bones we have described as composing each os innominatum, all assist in forming the acetabulum, in which the head of the os femoris is received.\n\nThis cavity is everywhere lined with a smooth cartilage, excepting at its inner part, where we may observe a little fossa, in which are lodged the mucilaginous glands of the joint. We may likewise notice the pit or depression made by the round ligament, as it is improperly called, which, by adhering to this cavity and to the head of the thigh-bone, helps to secure the latter in the socket.\n\nThese bones, which are united to each other and to the spine, by many very strong ligaments, serve to support the trunk, and to connect it with the lower extremities; and at the same time to form the pelvis or basin, in which are lodged the intestines and urinary bladder, and in women the uterus; so that the study of this part of osteology is of the utmost importance in midwifery.\n\nIt is worthy of observation, that in women the os sacrum is usually shorter, broader, and more hollowed, the os ilia more expanded, and the inferior opening of the pelvis larger, than in men.\n\nSect. IV. Of the Extremities.\n\nThe parts of the skeleton consist of the upper extremity and the lower.\n\n§ I. Of the Upper Extremities.\n\nThis consists of the shoulder, the arm, and the hand.\n\n1. Of the Shoulder.\n\nThe shoulder consists of two bones, the clavicle and the scapula.\n\nThe former, which is so named from its resemblance to the key in use among the ancients, is a little curved at both its extremities like an Italic f. It is likewise called jugulum, or collar bone, from its situation. It is about the size of the little finger, but longer, and being of a very spongy substance, is very liable to be fractured. In this, as in other long bones, we may distinguish a body and two extremities. The body is rather flattened than rounded. The anterior extremity is formed into a slightly convex head, which is nearly of a triangular shape. The inferior surface of the head is articulated with the sternum. The posterior extremity, which is flatter and broader than the other, is connected to a process of the scapula, called acromion. Both these articulations are secured by ligaments, and in that with the sternum we meet with a moveable cartilage, to prevent any injury from friction.\n\nThe clavicle serves to regulate the motions of the scapula, by preventing it from being brought too much forwards, or carried too far backwards. It affords origin to several muscles, and helps to cover and protect the subclavian vessels, which derive their name from their situation under this bone.\n\nThe scapula, or shoulder-blade, which is nearly of the form of a triangular shape, is fixed to the posterior part of the true ribs, somewhat in the manner of a buckler. It is of a very unequal thickness, and like all other broad flat bones, is somewhat cellular. Externally it is convex, and internally concave, to accommodate itself to the convexity of the ribs. We observe in this bone three unequal sides, which are thicker and stronger than the body of the bone, and are therefore termed its coffee. The largest of the three, called also the basis, is turned towards the vertebrae. Another, which is less than the former, is below this; and the third, which is the least of the three, is at the upper part of the bone. Externally the bone is elevated into a considerable spine, which rising small at the basis of the scapula, becomes gradually higher and broader, and divides the outer surface of the bone into two fossae. The superior of these, which is the smallest, serves to lodge the supra spinatus muscle; and the inferior fossa, which is much larger than the other, gives origin to the infra spinatus. This spine terminates in a broad and flat process at the top of the shoulder, called the processus acromion, to which the clavicle is articulated. This process is hollowed at its lower part to allow a passage to the supra and infra spinati muscles. The scapula has likewise another considerable process at its upper part, which, from its resemblance to the beak of a bird, is called the coracoid process. From the outer side of this coracoid process, a strong ligament passes to the processus acromion, which prevents a luxation of the os humeri upwards. A third process begins by a narrow neck, and ends in a cavity called glenoid, for the connexion of the os humeri.\n\nThe clavicle is articulated with the clavicle and os humeri, to which last it serves as a fulcrum; and by varying its position it affords a greater scope to the bones of the arm in their different motions. It likewise gives origin to several muscles, and posteriorly serves as a defence to the trunk.\n\n2. Bones of the Arm.\n\nThe arm is commonly divided into two parts, which are articulated to each other at the elbow. The upper part retains the name of arm, properly so called, and the lower part is usually called the fore-arm.\n\nThe arm is composed of a single bone called os humeri. This bone, which is almost of a cylindrical shape, may be divided into its body and its extremities.\n\nThe upper extremity begins by a large, round smooth head, which is admitted into the glenoid cavity of the scapula. On the upper and fore part of the bone there is a groove for lodging the long head of the biceps muscle of the arm; and on each side of the groove, at the upper end of the bone, there is a tubercle to which the spinati muscles are fixed.\n\nThe lower extremity has several processes and cavities. The principal processes are its two condyles, one exterior and the other interior, and of these the last is the largest. Between these two we observe two lateral protuberances, which, together with a middle cavity,\nANATOMY.\n\nOsteology, vity, form as it were a kind of pulley upon which the motions of the fore-arm are chiefly performed. At each side of the condyles, as well exteriorly as interiorly, there is another eminence which gives origin to several muscles of the hand and fingers. Posteriorly and superiorly, speaking with respect to the condyles, we observe a deep fossa which receives a considerable process of the ulna; and anteriorly and opposite to this fossa, we observe another, which is much less, and receives another process of the same bone.\n\nThe body of the bone has at its upper and anterior part a furrow which begins from behind the head of the bone, and serves to lodge the tendon of a muscle. The body of the os humeri is hollow through its whole length, and like all other long bones has its marrow.\n\nThis bone is articulated at its upper part to the scapula. This articulation, which allows motion every way, is surrounded by a capsular ligament that is sometimes torn in luxation, and becomes an obstacle to the easy reduction of the bone. Its lower extremity is articulated with the bones of the fore-arm.\n\nThe fore-arm is composed of two bones, the ulna and radius.\n\nThe ulna or elbow bone is much less than the os humeri, and becomes gradually smaller as it descends to the wrist. At its upper part it has two processes and two cavities. Of the two processes, the larger, which is situated posteriorly, and called the olecranon, is admitted into the posterior fossa of the os humeri. The other process is placed anteriorly, and is called the coronoid process. In bending the arm it enters into the anterior fossa of the os humeri. This process being much smaller than the other, permits the fore-arm to bend inwards; whereas the olecranon, which is shaped like a hook, reaches the bottom of its fossa in the os humeri as soon as the arm becomes straight, and will not permit the fore-arm to be bent backwards. The ligaments likewise oppose this motion.\n\nBetween the two processes we have described, there is a considerable cavity called the sigmoid cavity, divided into two fossae by a small eminence, which passes from one process to the other; it is by means of this cavity and the two processes, that the ulna is articulated with the os humeri by ginglymus.\n\nAt the bottom of the coronoid process posteriorly, there is a small sigmoid cavity, which serves for the articulation of the ulna with the radius.\n\nThe body of the ulna is of a triangular shape: Its lower extremity terminates by a small head and a little styloid process. The ulna is articulated above to the os humeri—both above and below to the radius, and to the wrist at its lower extremity. All these articulations are secured by means of ligaments. The chief use of this bone seems to be to support and regulate the motions of the radius.\n\nThe radius, which is so named from its supposed resemblance to the spoke of a wheel, is placed at the inside of the fore-arm. It is somewhat larger than the ulna, but not quite so long as that bone. Its upper part is cylindrical, hollowed superiorly to receive the outer condyle of the os humeri. Laterally it is admitted into the little sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and the cylindrical part of the bone turns in this cavity in the motions of pronation and supination (1). This bone follows the ulna in flexion and extension, and may likewise be moved round its axis in any direction. The lower extremity of the radius is much larger and stronger than its upper part; the ulna, on the contrary, is smaller and weaker below than above; so that they serve to supply each other's deficiencies in both those parts.\n\nOn the external side of this bone, we observe a small cavity which is destined to receive the lower end of the ulna; and its lower extremity is formed into a large cavity, by means of which it is articulated with the bones of the wrist, and on this account it is sometimes called mandibulum manus. It supports the two first bones of the wrist on the side of the thumb, whereas the ulna is articulated with that bone of the wrist which corresponds with the little finger.\n\nThrough the whole length both of this bone and the ulna, a ridge is observed which affords attachment to an interosseous ligament. This ligament fills up the space between the two bones.\n\n3. Bones of the Hand.\n\nThe carpus or wrist consists of eight small bones of an irregular shape, and disposed in two unequal rows. Those of the upper row are articulated with the bones of the fore-arm, and those of the lower one with the metacarpus.\n\nThe ancient anatomists described these bones numerically; Lyferus seems to have been the first who gave to each of them a particular name. The names he adopted are found on the figure of the bones, and are now pretty generally received, except the first, which instead of σκαρποειδής (the name given to it by Lyferus, on account of its finus, that admits a part of the os magnum), has by later writers been named Scaphoideus or Navicularis. This, which is the outermost of the upper row (considering the thumb as the outer side of the hand), is articulated with the radius; on its inner side it is connected with the os lunare, and below to the trapezium and trapezoides. Next to this is a smaller bone, called the os lunare; because its outer side, which is connected with the scaphoides, is shaped like a crescent. This is likewise articulated with the radius. On its inner side it joins the os cuneiforme; and anteriorly, the os magnum and os unciforme.\n\nThe os cuneiforme, which is the third bone in the upper row, is compared to a wedge, from its being broader above, at the back of the hand, than it is below. Posteriorly it is articulated with the ulna, and anteriorly with the os unciforme.\n\nThese three bones form an oblong articulating surface, covered by cartilage, by which the hand is connected with the fore-arm.\n\nThe os pisiforme, or pea-like bone, which is smaller than\n\n(1) The motions of pronation and supination may be easily described. If the palm of the hand, for instance, is placed on the surface of a table, the hand may be said to be in a state of pronation; but if the back part of the hand is turned towards the table, the hand will be then in a state of supination.\nANATOMY.\n\nPart I.\n\nOsteology.\n\nthan the three just now described, though generally classified with the bones of the upper row, does not properly belong to either series, being placed on the under surface of the os cuneiforme, so as to project into the palm of the hand. The four bones of the second row correspond with the bones of the thumb and fingers; the first, second, and fourth, are from their shapes named trapezium, trapezoid, and unciform; the third, from its being the largest bone of the carpus, is styled os magnum.\n\nAll these bones are convex towards the back, and slightly concave towards the palm of the hand; their articulating surfaces are covered with cartilages, and secured by many strong ligaments, particularly by two ligamentous expansions, called the external and internal annular ligaments of the wrist. The former extends in an oblique direction from the os pisiforme to the styloid process of the radius, and is an inch and a half in breadth; the latter or internal annular ligament is stretched from the os pisiforme and os unciforme, to the os scaphoideus and trapezium. These annular ligaments likewise serve to bend down the tendons of the wrist and fingers.\n\nThe metacarpus consists of four bones, which support the fingers; externally they are a little convex, and internally somewhat concave, where they form the palm of the hand. They are hollow, and of a cylindrical shape.\n\nAt each extremity they are a little hollowed for their articulation; superiorly with the bones of the carpus, and inferiorly with the first phalanx of the fingers, in the same manner as the several phalanges of the fingers are articulated with each other.\n\nThe five fingers of each hand are composed of fifteen bones, disposed in three ranks called phalanges: The bones of the first phalanx, which are articulated with the metacarpus, are the largest, and those of the last phalanx the smallest. All these bones are larger at their extremities than in their middle part.\n\nWe observe at the extremities of the bones of the carpus, metacarpus, and fingers, several inequalities that serve for their articulation with each other; and these articulations are strengthened by means of the ligaments which surround them.\n\nIt will be easily understood that this multiplicity of bones in the hand (for there are 27 in each hand) is essential to the different motions we wish to perform. If each finger was composed only of one bone instead of three, it would be impossible for us to grasp anything.\n\n§ 2. Of the Lower Extremities.\n\nEach lower extremity is divided into four parts, viz. the os femoris, or thigh-bone; the rotula, or knee-pan; the leg; and the foot.\n\n1. Of the Thigh.\n\nThe thigh is composed only of this bone, which is the largest and strongest we have. It will be necessary to distinguish its body and extremities: Its body, which is of a cylindrical shape, is convex before and concave behind, where it serves to lodge several muscles. Throughout two-thirds of its length we observe a ridge called linea alpina, which originates from the trochanters, and after running for some way downwards, divides into two branches, that terminate in the tubercles at the lower extremity of the bone.\n\nAt its upper extremity we must describe the neck and smooth head of the bone, and likewise two considerable processes: The head, which forms the greater portion of a sphere unequally divided, is turned inwards, and received into the great cotyloid cavity of the os innominatum. At this part of the bone there is a little fossa to be observed, to which the round ligament is attached, and which we have already described as tending to secure the head of this bone in the great acetabulum. The neck is almost horizontal, considered with respect to its situation with the body of the bone. Of the two processes, the external one, which is the largest, is called trochanter major; and the other, which is placed on the inside of the bone, trochanter minor. They both afford attachment to muscles. The articulation of the os femoris with the trunk is strengthened by means of a capsular ligament, which adheres everywhere round the edge of the great cotyloid cavity of the os innominatum, and surrounds the head of the bone.\n\nThe os femoris moves upon the trunk in every direction.\n\nAt the lower extremity of the bone are two processes called the condyles, and an intermediate smooth cavity, by means of which it is articulated with the leg by ginglymus.\n\nAll round the under end of the bone there is an irregular surface where the capsular ligament of the joint has its origin, and where blood vessels go into the substance of the bone.\n\nBetween the condyles there is a cavity posteriorly, in which the blood vessels and nerves are placed, secure from the compression to which they would otherwise be exposed in the action of bending the leg, and which would not fail to be hurtful.\n\nAt the side of each condyle externally, there is a tuberosity, from whence the lateral ligaments originate, which are extended down to the tibia.\n\nA ligament likewise arises from each condyle posteriorly. One of these ligaments passes from the right to the left, and the other from the left to the right, so that they intersect each other, and for that reason are called the cross ligaments.\n\nThe lateral ligaments prevent the motion of the leg upon the thigh to the right or left; and the cross ligaments, which are also attached to the tibia, prevent the latter from being brought forwards.\n\nIn new born children all the processes of this bone are cartilaginous.\n\n2. The Rotula, or Knee-pan.\n\nThe rotula, patella, or knee-pan, as it is differently called, is a flat bone about four or five inches in circumference, and is placed at the fore part of the joint of the knee. In its shape it is somewhat like the common figure of the heart, with its point downwards.\n\nIt is thinner at its edge than in its middle part; at its fore part it is smooth and somewhat convex; its posterior surface, which is more unequal, affords an elevation in the middle which is admitted between the two condyles of the os femoris.\n\nThis bone is retained in its proper situation by a strong ligament which everywhere surrounds it, and adheres\nOsteology adheres both to the tibia and os femoris; it is likewise firmly connected with the tibia by means of a strong tendinous ligament of an inch in breadth, and upwards of two inches in length, which adheres to the lower part of the patella, and to the tuberosity at the upper end of the tibia. On account of this connexion, it is very properly considered as an appendage to the tibia, which it follows in all its motions, so as to be to it what the olecranon is to the ulna. There is this difference, however, that the olecranon is a fixed process; whereas the patella is moveable, being capable of sliding from above downwards and from below upwards. This mobility is essential to the rotatory motion of the leg.\n\nIn very young children this bone is entirely cartilaginous.\n\nThe principal use of the patella seems to be to defend the articulation of the knee from external injury; it likewise tends to increase the power of the extensor muscles of the leg, by removing their direction farther from the centre of motion in the manner of a pulley.\n\n3. Of the Leg.\n\nThe leg is composed of two bones: Of these the inner one, which is the largest, is called tibia; the other is much smaller, and named fibula.\n\nThe tibia, which is so called from its resemblance to the musical pipe of the ancients, has three surfaces, and is not very unlike a triangular prism. Its posterior surface is the broadest; anteriorly it has a considerable ridge called the shin, between which and the skin there are no muscles. At the upper extremity of this bone are two surfaces, a little concave, and separated from each other by an intermediate elevation. The two little cavities receive the condyles of the os femoris, and the eminence between them is admitted into the cavity which we spoke of as being between the two condyles; so that this articulation affords a specimen of the complete ginglumus. Under the external edge of the upper end of this bone is a circular flat surface, which receives the head of the fibula.\n\nAt the lower and inner portion of the tibia, we observe a considerable process called malleolus internus. The basis of the bone terminates in a large transverse cavity, by which it is articulated with the uppermost bone of the foot. It has likewise another cavity at its lower end and outer side, which is somewhat oblong, and receives the lower end of the fibula.\n\nThe tibia is hollow through its whole length.\n\nThe fibula is a small long bone situated on the outside of the tibia. Its superior extremity does not reach quite so high as the upper part of the tibia, but its lower end descends somewhat lower. Both above and below, it is articulated with the tibia by means of the lateral cavities we noticed in our description of that bone.\n\nIts lower extremity is stretched out into a coronoid process, which is flattened at its inside, and is convex externally, forming what is called the malleolus externus, or outer ankle. This is rather lower than the malleolus internus of the tibia.\n\n4. Of the Foot.\n\nThe foot consists of the tarus, metatarsus, and toes.\n\nThe tarus is composed of seven bones, viz., the os astragalus, os calcis, os naviculare, os cuboideus, and three others called cuneiform bones.\n\nThe astragalus is a large bone with which both the os tibia and fibula are articulated. It is the uppermost fragalus bone of the foot; it has several surfaces to be considered; its upper, and somewhat posterior part, which is smooth and convex, is admitted into the cavity of the tibia. Its lateral parts are connected with the malleoli of the two bones of the leg; below, it is articulated with the os calcis, and its anterior surface is received by the os naviculare. All these articulations are secured by means of ligaments.\n\nThe os calcis, or calcaneum, which is of a very irregular figure, is the largest bone of the foot. Behind, it is formed into a considerable tuberosity called the heel; without this tuberosity, which supports us in an erect posture, and when we walk, we should be liable to fall backwards.\n\nOn the internal surface of this bone, we observe a considerable sinuosity, which affords a passage to the tendon of a muscle; and to the posterior part of the os calcis, a strong tendinous cord called tendo achillis (M), is attached, which is formed by the tendons of several muscles united together. The articulation of this with the other bones is secured by means of ligaments.\n\nThe os naviculare, or scaphoides (for these two terms have the same signification), is so called on account of its resemblance to a little bark. At its posterior part, which is concave, it receives the astragalus; anteriorly it is articulated with the cuneiform bones, and laterally it is connected with the os cuboideus.\n\nThe os cuboideus forms an irregular cube. Posteriorly it is articulated with the os calcis; anteriorly it cuboideus supports the two last bones of the metatarsus, and laterally it joins the third cuneiform bone and the os naviculare.\n\nEach of the osa cuneiformia, which are three in number, resembles a wedge, and from this similitude cuneiform their name is derived. They are placed next to the metatarsus by the sides of each other, and are usually distinguished into os cuneiforme externum, medium or minimum, and internum or maximum. The superior surface of these bones, from their wedge-like shape, is broader than that which is below, where they help to form the sole of the foot; posteriorly they are united to the os naviculare, and anteriorly they support the three first metatarsal bones.\n\nWhen these seven bones composing the tarus are viewed together in the skeleton, they appear convex above, where they help to form the upper part of the foot; and concave underneath, where they form the hollow\n\n(m) This tendon is sometimes ruptured by jumping, dancing, or other violent efforts.\nOsteology, hollow of the foot, in which the vessels, tendons, and nerves of the foot, are placed secure from pressure.\n\nThey are united to each other by very strong ligaments, and their articulation with the foot is secured by a capsular and two lateral ligaments; each of the latter is covered by an annular ligament of considerable breadth and thickness, which serves to bind down the tendons of the foot, and at the same time to strengthen the articulation.\n\nThe os cuneiforme externum is joined laterally to the os cuboides.\n\nThese bones complete our account of the tarbus. Though what we have said of this part of the osteology has been very simple and concise, yet many readers may not clearly understand it; but if they will be pleased to view these bones in their proper situation in the skeleton, all that we have said of them will be easily understood.\n\nThe metatarsus is made up of five bones, whereas the metacarpus consists only of four. The cause of this difference is, that in the hand the last bone of the thumb is not included among the metacarpal bones; whereas in the foot the great toe has only two bones. The first of these bones supports the great toe, and is much larger than the rest, which nearly resemble each other in size.\n\nThese bones are articulated by one extremity with the cuneiform bones and the os cuboides, and by their other end with the toes.\n\nEach of the toes, like the fingers, consists of three bones, except the great toe, which is formed of two bones. Those of the other four are distinguished into three phalanges. Although the toes are more confined in their motion than the fingers, yet they appear to be perfectly fitted for the purposes they are designed for. In walking, the toes bring the centre of gravity perpendicular to the advanced foot; and as the soles of the foot are naturally concave, we can at pleasure increase this concavity, and form a kind of vault, which adjusts itself to the different inequalities that occur to us in walking; and which, without this mode of arrangement, would incommode us exceedingly, especially when bare-footed.\n\n§ 4. Of the Os Sesamoidea.\n\nBesides the bones we have already described, there are several small ones that are met with only in the adult skeleton, and in persons who are advanced in life; which, from their supposed general resemblance to the seeds of the sesamum, are called os sesamoidea. They are commonly to be seen at the first joint of the great toe, and sometimes at the joints of the thumb; they are likewise now and then to be found at the lower extremity of the fibula, upon the condyles of the thigh-bone, under the os cuboides of the tarbus, and in other parts of the body. Their size and number seem constantly to be increased by age and hard labour; and as they are generally found in situations where tendons and ligaments are most exposed to the action of muscles, they are now generally considered as ossified portions of ligaments or tendons.\n\nThe upper surface of these bones is usually convex, and adherent to the tendon that covers it; the side which is next to the joint is smooth and flat. Though their formation is accidental, yet they seem to be of some use, by raising the tendons farther from the centre of motion, and consequently increasing the power of the muscles. In the great toe and thumb they are likewise useful, by forming a groove for the flexor tendons.\n\nEXPLANATION OF THE PLATES OF OSTELOGY.\n\nPlate XXI.\n\nFig. I.

All the parts of the body are so intimately connected with each other, that it seems impossible to convey a just idea of any one of them, without being in some measure obliged to say something of others; and on this account we wish to mention in this place the names and situation of the principal viscera of the body, that when mention is hereafter made of any one of them in the course of the work, the reader may at least know where they are placed.\n\nAfter this little digression, the common integuments, and after them the muscles, will be described; we then propose to enter into an examination of the several viscera, and their different functions. In describing the brain, occasion will be taken to speak of the nerves and animal spirits. The circulation of the blood will follow the anatomy of the heart, and the secretions and other matters will be introduced in their proper places.\n\nThe body is divided into three great cavities. Of these the uppermost is formed by the bones of the cranium, and encloses the brain and cerebrum.\n\nThe second is composed of the vertebrae of the back, the sternum, and true ribs, with the additional afflatus of muscles, membranes, and common integuments, and is called the thorax.—It contains the heart and lungs.\n\nThe third, and inferior cavity, is the abdomen. It is separated from the thorax by means of the diaphragm, and is formed by the lumbar vertebrae, the os sacrum, the osa innominata, and the false ribs, to which we may add the peritoneum, and a variety of muscles. This cavity encloses the stomach, intestines, omentum or cawl, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, urinary bladder, and parts of generation.\n\nUnder the division of common integuments are usually included the epidermis, or scarf-skin, the reticulum mucosum of Malpighi, the cutis, or true skin, and the membrana adiposa. The hair and nails, as well as the sebaceous glands, may be considered as appendages to the skin.\n\nSect. I. Of the Skin.\n\n§ 1. Of the Scarf-skin.\n\nThe epidermis, cuticula, or scarf-skin, is a fine, transparent, and inflexible pellicle, destitute of nerves and blood vessels, which invests the body, and everywhere covers the true skin. This scarf-skin, which seems to be very simple, appears, when examined with a microscope, to be composed of several laminae or scales which are increased by pressure, as we may observe in the hands and feet, where it is frequently much thickened, and becomes perfectly callous. It seems to adhere to the cutis by a number of very minute filaments, but may easily be separated from it by heat, or by maceration in water. Some anatomical writers have supposed that it...\nANATOMY.\n\nOf the integuments, &c.\n\nis formed by a moisture exhaled from the whole surface of the body, which gradually hardens when it comes into contact with the air. They were perhaps induced to adopt this opinion, by observing the speedy regeneration of this part of the body when it has been by any means destroyed, it appearing to be renewed on all parts of the surface at the same time; whereas other parts which have been injured, are found to direct their growth from their circumference only towards their centre. But a demonstrative proof that the epidermis is not a fluid hardened by means of the external air, is, that the fetus in utero is found to have this covering. Leeuwenhoek supposed its formation to be owing to the expansion of the extremities of the excretory vessels, which are found everywhere upon the surface of the true skin. Ruysh attributed its origin to the nervous papillae of the skin; and Heister thinks it probable, that it may be owing both to the papillae and the excretory vessels. The celebrated Morgagni, on the other hand, contends*, that it is nothing more than the surface of the cutis, hardened and rendered inflexible by the liquor amnii in utero, and by the pressure of the air. This is a subject, however, on which we can advance nothing with certainty.\n\nThe cuticle is pierced with an infinite number of pores, or little holes, which afford a passage to the hairs, sweat, and inflexible perspiration, and likewise to warm water, mercury, and whatever else is capable of being taken in by the absorptions of the skin. The lines which we observe on the epidermis belong to the true skin. The cuticle adjusts itself to them, but does not form them.\n\n§ 2. Of the Rete Mucosum.\n\nBetween the epidermis and cutis we meet with an appearance to which Malpighi, who first described it, gave the name of rete mucosum, supposing it to be of a membranous structure, and pierced with an infinite number of pores; but the fact is, that it seems to be nothing more than a mucous substance which may be dissolved by macerating it in water, while the cuticle and cutis preserve their texture.\n\nThe colour of the body is found to depend on the colour of this rete mucosum; for in negroes it is observed to be perfectly black, whilst the true skin is of the ordinary colour.\n\nThe blisters which raise the skin when burnt or scalded, have been supposed by some to be owing to a rarefaction of this mucus; but they are more probably occasioned by an increased action of the vessels of the part, together with an afflux and effusion of the thinner parts of the blood.\n\n§ 3. Of the Cutis, or True Skin.\n\nThe cutis is composed of fibres closely compacted together, as we may observe in leather which is the prepared skin of animals. These fibres form a thick network, which everywhere admits the filaments of nerves, and an infinite number of blood vessels and lymphatics.\n\nThe cutis, when the epidermis is taken off, is found to have, throughout its whole surface, innumerable papillae, which appear like very minute granulations, and seem to be calculated to receive the impressions of the touch, being the most easily observed where the sense of feeling is the most delicate, as in the palms of the hands and on the fingers.\n\nThese papillae are supposed by many anatomical writers to be continuations of the pulpy substance of nerves, whose coats have terminated in the cellular texture of the skin. The great sensibility of these papillae evidently proves them to be exceedingly nervous; but surely the nervous fibrils of the skin are of themselves scarcely equal to the formation of these papillae, and it seems to be more probable that they are formed like the rest of the cutis.\n\nThese papillae being described, the uses of the epidermis and the reticulum mucosum will be more easily understood; the latter serving to keep them constantly moist, while the former protects them from the external air, and modifies their too great sensibility.\n\n§ 4. Of the Glands of the Skin.\n\nIn different parts of the body we meet, within the substance of the skin, with certain glands or follicles, which discharge a fat and oily humour that serves to lubricate and soften the skin. When the fluid they secrete has acquired a certain degree of thickness, it approaches to the colour and consistence of feces; and from this appearance they have derived their name of sebaceous glands. They are found in the greatest number in the nose, ear, nipple, axilla, groin, scrotum, vagina, and prepuce.\n\nBesides these sebaceous glands, we read, in anatomical books, of others that are described as small spherical bodies placed in all parts of the skin, in much greater abundance than those just now mentioned, and named miliaire, from their supposed resemblance to milk-seed. Steno, who first described these glands, and Malpighi, Ruysh, Verheyen, Winlow, and others, who have adopted his opinions on this subject, speak of them as having excretory ducts, that open on the surface of the cuticle, and distil the sweat and matter of inflexible perspiration; and yet, notwithstanding the positive manner in which these pretended glands have been spoken of, we are now sufficiently convinced that their existence is altogether imaginary.\n\n§ 5. Of the Insensible Perspiration and Sweat.\n\nThe matter of insensible perspiration, or in other words, the subtle vapour that is continually exhaling from the surface of the body, is not secreted by any particular gland, but seems to be derived wholly from the extremities of the minute arteries that are everywhere dispersed through the skin. These exhaling vessels are easily demonstrated in the dead subject, by throwing water into the arteries; for then small drops exude from all parts of the skin, and raise up the cuticle, the pores of which are closed by death; and in the living subject, a looking-glass placed against the skin, is soon obscured by the vapour. Bidloo fancied he had discovered ducts leading from the cutis to the cuticle, and transmitting this fluid; but in this he was mistaken.\n\nWhen the perspiration is by any means increased, and several drops that were intangible when separate, are united together and condensed by the external air, they form upon the skin small but visible drops called sweat.\nChap. II.\n\nANATOMY.\n\n§ 5. Of the Integuments, &c.\n\nThis particularly happens after much exercise, or whatever occasions an increased determination of fluids to the surface of the body; a greater quantity of perspirable matter being in such cases carried through the passages that are destined to convey it off.\n\nIt has been disputed, indeed, whether the insensible perspiration and sweat are to be considered as one and the same excretion, differing only in degree; or whether they are two distinct excretions derived from different sources. In support of the latter opinion, it has been alleged, that the insensible perspiration is agreeable to nature, and essential to health, whereas sweat may be considered as a species of disease. But this argument proves nothing; and it seems probable, that both the insensible vapour and the sweat are exhaled in a similar manner, though they differ in quantity, and probably in their qualities; the former being more limpid, and seemingly less impregnated with salts than the latter; at any rate we may consider the skin as an emunctory through which the redundant water, and sometimes the other more saline parts of the blood, are carried off. But the insensible perspiration is not confined to the skin only—a great part of what we are constantly throwing off in this way is from the lungs. The quantity of fluid exhaled from the human body by this insensible perspiration is very considerable. Sancutorius (o) an Italian physician, who indefatigably palled a great many years in a series of statical experiments, demonstrated long ago what has been confirmed by later observations, that the quantity of vapour exhaled from the skin and from the surface of the lungs, amounts nearly to 5-8ths of the aliment we take in. So that if in the warm climate of Italy a person eats and drinks the quantity of eight pounds in the course of a day, five pounds of it will pass off by insensible perspiration, while three pounds only will be evacuated by stool, urine, saliva, &c. But in countries where the degree of cold is greater than in Italy, the quantity of perspired matter is less; in some of the more northern climates, it being found not to equal the discharge by urine. It is likewise observed to vary according to the season of the year, and according to the constitution, age, sex, diseases, diet, exercise, passions, &c. of different people.\n\nVol. II. Part I.\n\n(n) Leeuwenhoek affirms, that one drop of sweat is formed by the conflux of 15 drops of perspirable vapour.\n\n(o) The insensible perspiration is sometimes distinguished by the name of this physician, who was born in the territories of Venice, and was afterwards a professor in the university of Padua. After estimating the aliment he took in, and the sensible secretions and discharges, he was enabled to ascertain with great accuracy the weight or quantity of insensible perspiration by means of a statical chair which he contrived for this purpose; and from his experiments, which were conducted with great industry and patience, he was led to determine what kinds of solid or liquid aliment increased or diminished it. From these experiments he formed a system, which he published at Venice in 1643, in the form of aphorisms, under the title of Ars de Medicina Statica.\n\n(p) Minute crystals have been observed to shoot upon the clothes of men who work in glass-houses. Haller.\n\nElem. Phys.\n\n(q.) Malpighi, and after him the celebrated Ruysch, supposed the hairs to be continuations of nerves, being of opinion that they originated from the papillae of the skin, which they considered as nervous; and as a corroborating proof of what they advanced, they argued the pain we feel in plucking them out; but later anatomists seem to have rejected this doctrine, and consider the hairs as particular bodies, not arising from the papillae (for in the parts where the papillae abound most there are no hairs), but from bulbs or capsules, which are peculiar to them.\n\n§ 6. Of the Nails.\n\nThe nails are of a compact texture, hard and transparent like horn. Their origin is still a subject of dispute. Malpighi supposed them to be formed by a continuation of the papillae of the skin; Ludwig, on the other hand, maintained, that they were composed of the extremities of blood vessels and nerves. Both these opinions are now deservedly rejected.\n\nThey seem to possess many properties in common with the cuticle; like it they are neither vascular nor sensible, and when the cuticle is separated from the true skin by maceration or other means, the nails come away with it.\n\nThey appear to be composed of different layers, of unequal size, applied one over the other. Each layer seems to be formed of longitudinal fibres.\n\nIn each nail we may distinguish three parts, viz. the root, the body or middle, and the extremity. The root is a soft, thin, and white substance, terminating in the form of a crescent; the epidermis adheres very strongly to this part; the body of the nail is broader, redder, and thicker, and the extremity is of still greater firmness.\n\nThe nails increase from their roots, and not from their upper extremity.\n\nTheir principal use is to cover and defend the ends of the fingers and toes from external injury.\n\n§ 7. Of the Hair.\n\nThe hairs, which from their being generally known do not seem to require any definition, arise from distinct capsules or bulbs seated in the cellular membrane under the skin (q.). Some of these bulbs enclose several\nveral hairs. They may be observed at the roots of the hairs which form the beard or whiskers of a cat.\n\nThe hairs, like the nails, grow only from below by a regular propulsion from their root, where they receive their nourishment. Their bulbs, when viewed with a microscope, are found to be of various shapes. In the head and scrotum they are roundish; in the eyebrows they are oval; in the other parts of the body they are nearly of a cylindrical shape. Each bulb seems to consist of two membranes, between which there is a certain quantity of moisture. Within the bulb the hair separates into three or four fibrilla; the bodies of the hairs, which are the parts without the skin, vary in softness and colour according to the difference of climate, age, or temperament of body (R).\n\nTheir general use in the body does not seem to be absolutely determined; but hairs in particular parts, as on the eyebrows and eyelids, are destined for particular uses, which will be mentioned when those parts are described.\n\n§ 8. Of the Cellular Membrane and Fat.\n\nThe cellular membrane is found to invest the most minute fibres we are able to trace; so that, by modern physiologists, it is very properly considered as the universal connecting medium of every part of the body.\n\nIt is composed of an infinite number of minute cells united together, and communicating with each other. The two diseases peculiar to this membrane are proofs of such a communication; for in the emphysema all its cells are filled with air, and in the anaemia they are universally diffused with water. Besides these proofs of communication from disease, a familiar instance of it may be observed among butchers, who usually puncture this membrane, and by inflating it with air add to the good appearance of their meat.\n\nThe cells of this membrane serve as reservoirs to the oily part of the blood or Fat, which seems to be deposited in them, either by transudation through the coats of the arteries that ramify through these cells, or by particular vessels, continued from the ends of arteries. These cells are not of a glandular structure, as Malpighi and others after him have supposed. The fat is absorbed and carried back into the system by the lymphatics. The great waste of it in many diseases, particularly in the consumption, is a sufficient proof that such an absorption takes place.\n\nThe fulness and size of the body are in a great measure proportioned to the quantity of fat contained in the cells of this membrane.\n\nIn the living body it seems to be a fluid oil, which concretes after death. In graminivorous animals, it is found to be of a firmer consistence than in man.\n\nThe fat is not confined to the skin alone, being met with everywhere in the interstices of muscles, in the omentum, about the kidneys, at the basis of the heart, in the orbits, &c.\n\n(R) The hairs likewise differ from each other, and may not be improperly divided into two classes; one of which may include the hair of the head, chin, pubes, and axillae; and the other, the softer hairs, which are to be observed almost everywhere on the surface of the body.\n\nThe chief uses of the fat seem to be to afford moisture to all the parts with which it is connected; to facilitate the action of the muscles; and to add to the beauty of the body, by making it everywhere smooth and equal.\n\nSect. II. Of the Muscles.\n\nThe muscles are the organs of motion. The parts that are usually included under this name consist of distinct portions of flesh, susceptible of contraction and relaxation; the motions of which, in a natural and healthy state, are subject to the will, and for this reason they are called voluntary muscles. But besides these, there are other parts of the body that owe their power of contraction to their muscular fibres; thus the heart is of a muscular texture, forming what is called a hollow muscle; and the urinary bladder, stomach, intestines, &c., are enabled to act upon their contents, merely because they are provided with muscular fibres. These are called involuntary muscles, because their motions are not dependent on the will. The muscles of respiration being in some measure influenced by the will, are said to have a mixed motion.\n\nThe names by which the voluntary muscles are distinguished, are founded on their size, figure, situation, use, or the arrangement of their fibres, or their origin and insertion. But besides these particular distinctions, there are certain general ones that require to be noticed. Thus, if the fibres of a muscle are placed parallel to each other in a straight direction, they form what is styled a rectilinear muscle; if the fibres cross and intersect each other, they constitute a compound muscle; a radiated one, if the fibres are disposed in the manner of rays; or a penniform muscle, if, like the plume of a pen, they are placed obliquely with respect to the tendon.\n\nMuscles that act in opposition to each other, are called antagonistic; thus every extensor or muscle has a flexor for its antagonist, and vice versa. Muscles that concur in the same action are styled congeners.\n\nThe muscles being attached to the bones, the latter may be considered as levers that are moved in different directions by the contraction of those organs.\n\nThat end of a muscle which adheres to the most fixed part is usually called the origin, and that which adheres to the more moveable part, the insertion of the muscle.\n\nIn every muscle we may distinguish two kinds of fibres; the one soft, of a red colour, flexible, and irritable, called fleshy fibres; the other of a firmer texture, of a white glistering colour, inflexible, without irritability or the power of contracting, and named tendinous fibres. They are occasionally intermixed, but the fleshy fibres generally prevail in the belly or middle part of a muscle, and the tendinous ones in the extremities. If these tendinous fibres are formed into a round\nround slender cord, they form what is called the tendon of the muscle; on the other hand, if they are spread into a broad flat surface, the extremity of the muscle is styled aponeurosis.\n\nThe tendons of many muscles, especially when they are long and exposed to pressure or friction in the grooves formed for them in the bones, are surrounded by a tendinous sheath or fascia, in which we sometimes find a small mucous sac or bursa mucosa, which obviates any inconvenience from friction. Sometimes we find whole muscles, and even several muscles, covered by a fascia of the same kind, that affords origin to many of their fibres, dipping down between them, adhering to the ridges of bones, and thus preventing them from swelling too much when in action. The most remarkable instance of such a covering is the fascia lata of the thigh.\n\nEach muscle is enclosed by a thin covering of cellular membrane, which has been sometimes improperly considered as peculiar to the muscles, and described under the name of propria membrana myocelos. This cellular covering dips down into the substance of the muscle, connecting and surrounding the most minute fibres we are able to demonstrate, and affording a support to their vessels and nerves.\n\nLeeuwenhoek fancied he had discovered, by means of his microscope, the ultimate division of a muscle, and that he could point out the simple fibre, which appeared to him to be a hundred times less than a hair; but he was afterwards convinced how much he was mistaken on this subject, and candidly acknowledged, that what he had taken for a simple fibre was in fact a bundle of fibres.\n\nIt is easy to observe several of these fasciculi or bundles in a piece of beef, in which, from the coarseness of its texture, they are very evident.\n\nThe red colour which so particularly distinguishes the muscular or fleshy parts of animals, is owing to an infinite number of blood-vessels, that are dispersed through their substance. When we macerate the fibres of a muscle in water, it becomes of a white colour like all other parts of the body deprived of their blood. The blood-vessels are accompanied by nerves, and they are both distributed in such abundance to these parts, that in endeavouring to trace the course of the blood-vessels in a muscle, it would appear to be formed altogether by their ramifications; and in an attempt to follow the branches of its nerves, they would be found to be equal in proportion.\n\nIf a muscle is pricked or irritated, it immediately contracts. This is called its irritable principle; and this irritability is to be considered as the characteristic of muscular fibres; and may serve to prove their existence in parts that are too minute to be examined by the eye. This power, which disposes the muscles to contract when stimulated, independent of the will, is supposed to be inherent in them; and is therefore named vis insita. This property is not to be confounded with elasticity, which the membranes and other parts of the body possess in a greater or less degree in common with the muscles; nor with sensibility, for the heart, though the most irritable, seems to be the least sensible of any of the muscular parts of the body.\n\nAfter a muscular fibre has contracted, it soon returns to a state of relaxation, till it is excited afresh, and then it contracts and relaxes again. We may likewise produce such a contraction, by irritating the nerve leading to a muscle, although the nerve itself is not affected.\n\nThis principle is found to be greater in small than in large, and in young than in old, animals.\n\nIn the voluntary muscles these effects of contraction and relaxation of the fleecy fibres are produced in obedience to the will, by what may be called the vis nervosa, a property that is not to be confounded with the vis insita. As the existence of a vis insita different from a vis nervosa, was the doctrine taught by Dr Haller in his Elem. Phys., but is at present called in question by several, particularly Dr Monro, we think it necessary to give a few objections, as stated in his Observations on the Nervous System.\n\n\"The chief experiment (says the Doctor) which seems to have led Dr Haller to this opinion, is the well-known one, that the heart and other muscles, after being detached from the brain, continue to act spontaneously, or by stimuli may be roused into action for a considerable length of time; and when it cannot be alleged, says Dr Haller, that the nervous fluid is by the mind, or otherwise, impelled into the muscle.\n\n\"That in this instance, we cannot comprehend by what power the nervous fluid or energy can be put in motion, must perhaps be granted: But has Dr Haller given a better explanation of the manner in which his supposed vis insita becomes active?\n\n\"If it be as difficult to point out the cause of the action of the vis insita as that of the action of the vis nervosa, the admission of that new power, instead of relieving, would add to our perplexity.\n\n\"We should then have admitted, that two causes of a different nature were capable of producing exactly the same effect; which is not in general agreeable to the laws of nature.\n\n\"We should find other consequences arise from such a hypothesis, which tend to weaken the credibility of it. For instance, if in a sound animal the vis nervosa alone produces the contraction of the muscles, we will ask what purpose the vis insita serves? If both operate, are we to suppose that the vis nervosa, impelled by the mind or living principle, gives the order, which the vis insita executes, and that the nerves are the intermediaries; and to admit two wise agents employed in every the most simple action? But instead of speculating farther, let us learn the effect of experiments, and endeavour from thence to draw plain conclusions.\n\n\"1. When I poured a solution of opium in water under the skin of the leg of a frog, the muscles, to the surface of which it was applied, were very soon deprived of the power of contraction. In like manner, when I poured this solution into the cavity of the heart, by opening the vena cava, the heart was almost instantly deprived of its power of motion, whether the experiment was performed on it fixed in its place, or cut out of the body.\n\n\"2. I opened the thorax of a living frog; and then tied or cut its aorta, so as to put a stop to the circulation of its blood.\"\n\"I then opened the vena cava, and poured the solution of opium into the heart; and found, not only that this organ was instantly deprived of its powers of action, but that in a few minutes the most distant muscles of the limbs were extremely weakened. Yet this weakness was not owing to the want of circulation, for the frog could jump about for more than an hour after the heart was cut out.\n\n\"In the first of these two experiments, we observe the supposed vis insita destroyed by the opium; in the latter, the vis nervosa: for it is evident that the limbs were affected by the sympathy of the brain, and of the nervous system in general, with the nerves of the heart.\n\n\"3. When the nerve of any muscle is first divided by a transverse section, and then burnt with a hot iron, or punctured with a needle, the muscle in which it terminates contracts violently, exactly in the same manner as when the irritation is applied to the fibres of the muscle. But when the hot iron or needle is confined to the nerve, Dr Haller himself must have admitted, that the vis nervosa, and not the vis insita, was excited. But here I would ask two questions.\n\n\"First, Whether we do not as well understand how the vis nervosa is excited when irritation is applied to the muscle as when it is applied to the trunk of the nerve, the impelling power of the mind seeming to be equally wanting in both cases?\n\n\"Secondly, If it appears that irritation applied to the trunk of a nerve excites the vis nervosa, why should we doubt that it can equally well excite it when applied to the small and very sensible branches and terminations of the nerve in the muscle?\n\n\"As, therefore, it appears that the supposed vis insita is destroyed or excited by the same means as the vis nervosa; may, that when, by the application of opium to the heart of a frog, after the aorta is cut and the circulation interrupted, we have destroyed the vis insita, the vis nervosa is so much extinguished, that the animal cannot act with the distant muscles of the limb; and that these afterwards grow very torpid, or lose much of their supposed vis insita; it seems clearly to follow, that there is no just ground for supposing that any other principle produces the contraction of a muscle.\"\n\nThe vis nervosa, or operation of the mind, if we may so call it, by which a muscle is brought into contraction, is not inherent in the muscle like the vis insita, neither is it perpetual, like this latter property. After long continued or violent exercise, for example, the voluntary muscles become painful, and at length incapable of further action; whereas the heart and other involuntary muscles, the motions of which depend solely on the vis insita, continue through life in a constant state of action, without any inconvenience or waste of this inherent principle.\n\nThe action of the vis nervosa on the voluntary muscles constitutes what is called muscular motion; a subject that has given rise to a variety of hypotheses, many of them ingenious, but none of them satisfactory.\n\nBorelli and some others have undertaken to explain the cause of contraction, by supposing that every muscular fibre forms as it were a chain of very minute bladders, while the nerves which are distributed through the muscle, bring with them a supply of animal spirits, which at our will fill these bladders, and by increasing their diameter in width, shorten them, and of course the whole fibre.\n\nBorelli supposes these bladders to be of a rhomboidal shape; Bernouilli, on the other hand, contends that they are oval. Our countryman, Cowper, fancied he had filled them with mercury; the cause of this mistake was probably owing to the mercury's infusing itself into some of the lymphatic vessels. The late ingenious Mr Elliot undertook to account for the phenomena of muscular motion on principles very different from those just now mentioned. He supposed that a phlogisticated state of the blood is requisite for muscular action, and that a communication of phlogiston to the blood is a necessary effect of such action.\n\nWe know that the muscular fibre is shortened, and that the muscle itself swells when in action; but how these phenomena are produced, we are unable to determine. We likewise know that the nerves are essential to muscular motion; for upon dividing or making a ligature round the nerve leading to a muscle, the latter becomes incapable of motion. A ligature made on the artery of a muscle produces a similar effect: a proof this, that a regular supply of blood is also equally necessary to muscular motion. The cause of palsy is usually not to be sought for in the muscle affected, but in the nerve leading to that muscle, or in that part of the brain or spinal marrow from which the nerve derives its origin.\n\nOf the particular Muscles.\n\nAs the enumeration and description of the particular muscles must be dry and unentertaining to the generality of readers, yet cannot be altogether omitted in a work of this nature, it appeared eligible to throw this part of the subject into the form of a table; in which the name, origin, insertion, and principal use of each muscle will be found described in few words, and occasionally its etymology when it is of Greek derivation or difficult to be understood.\n### A TABLE of the MUSCLES, arranged according to their Situation.\n\n**Muscles situated under the integuments of the cranium,**\n\n1. **Occipito-frontalis.**\n   - *Name.*\n   - *Origin.* From the transverse Into the skin of the ridge of the os occipitis.\n   - *Insertion.* eyebrows.\n   - *Use.* To pull the skin of the head backwards, and to raise the eyebrows and skin of the forehead.\n\n2. **Corrugator supercilii.**\n   - *Name.*\n   - *Origin.* From above the jointing of the os frontis, os naso, and os maxillare.\n   - *Insertion.* Into the inner part of the occipito-frontalis.\n   - *Use.* To draw the eyebrows towards each other, and to wrinkle the forehead.\n\n**Of the eyelids,**\n\n1. **Orbicularis palpebrarum.**\n   - *Name.*\n   - *Origin.* From around the edge of the orbit.\n   - *Insertion.* Into the nasal process of the os maxillare.\n   - *Use.* To shut the eye.\n\n2. **Levator palpebrae superioris.**\n   - *Name.*\n   - *Origin.* From the bottom of the orbit, near the optic foramen.\n   - *Insertion.* Into the cartilage of the upper eyelid.\n   - *Use.* To open the eye.\n\n**Of the external ear,**\n\n1. **Attollens auriculam.**\n   - *Name.*\n   - *Origin.* From the tendon of the occipito-frontalis near the os temporis.\n   - *Insertion.* Into the upper part of the ear.\n   - *Use.* To raise the ear.\n\n2. **Anterior auriculae.**\n   - *Name.*\n   - *Origin.* From near the back part of the zygoma.\n   - *Insertion.* Into an eminence behind the helix.\n   - *Use.* To raise this eminence, and to pull it forwards.\n\n3. **Retrahentes (s) auriculae.**\n   - *Name.*\n   - *Origin.* From the outer and back part of the root of the mastoid process.\n   - *Insertion.* Into the convex part of the concha.\n   - *Use.* To stretch the concha, and pull the ear backwards.\n\n**Of the cartilages of the ear,**\n\n1. **Tragicus.**\n   - *Name.*\n   - *Origin.* From the outer and middle part of the concha, near the tragus.\n   - *Insertion.* Into the upper part of the concha.\n   - *Use.* To depress the concha, and pull the point of the tragus a little outwards.\n\n2. **Anti-tragicus.**\n   - *Name.*\n   - *Origin.* From the root of the inner part of the helix.\n   - *Insertion.* Into the upper part of the anti-tragus.\n   - *Use.* To dilate the mouth of the concha.\n\n3. **Transversus auricule.**\n   - *Name.*\n   - *Origin.* From the upper part of the concha.\n   - *Insertion.* Into the inner part of the helix.\n   - *Use.* To stretch the concha and scapha, and likewise to pull the parts it is connected with towards each other.\n\n4. **Helicis major.**\n   - *Name.*\n   - *Origin.* From the upper, anterior, and acute part of the helix.\n   - *Insertion.* Into the cartilage of the helix, a little above the tragus.\n   - *Use.* To depress the upper part of the helix.\n\n5. **Helicis minor.**\n   - *Name.*\n   - *Origin.* From the lower and fore part of the helix.\n   - *Insertion.* Into the helix, near the fissure in its cartilage.\n   - *Use.* To contract the fissure.\n\n---\n\n(s) These are three small slender muscles.

Obliquus externus. From the lower edges of the eight inferior ribs near their cartilages. Into the linea alba (r), os pubis (q), and spine of the ilium (k). To compress and support the viscera, assist in evacuating the feces and urine, draw down the ribs, and bend the trunk forwards or obliquely to one side.\n\n2. Obliquus internus. From the spinous processes of the three lowest lumbar vertebrae, the back part of the os sacrum, the spine of the ilium, and back part of Fallopian's ligament (r). Into the cartilages of all the false ribs, linea alba (s), and fore part of the pubis. To assist the obliquus externus.\n\n3. Transversalis. From the cartilages of the seven inferior ribs; the transverse processes of the last dorsal, and four upper lumbar vertebrae; the inner part of Fallopian's ligament and the spine of the ilium. Into the linea alba and cartilago ensiformis. To compress the abdominal viscera.\n\n(r) The linea alba is that tendinous expansion which reaches from the cartilago ensiformis to the os pubis. It is formed by the interlacement of the tendinous fibres of the oblique and transverse muscles, and on this account some anatomists have considered these as three digastric muscles.\n\n(q.) A little above the pubis the tendinous fibres of this muscle separate from each other, so as to form an opening called the ring of the obliquus externus, and commonly, though improperly, the ring of the abdominal muscles, there being no such aperture either in the transversalis or obliquus internus. This ring in the male subject affords a passage to the spermatic vessels, and in the female to the round ligament of the uterus.\n\n(r) From the anterior and upper spinous processes of the ilium, this muscle is stretched tendinous to the os pubis, and thus forms what is called by some Fallopian's, and by others Poirier's ligament. The blood vessels pass under it to the thigh.\n\n(s) The tendon formed by the upper part of this muscle in its way to the linea alba is divided into two layers. The posterior layer runs under, and the anterior one over, the rectus muscle.\n\n(t) From this part it detaches some fibres which extend downwards upon the spermatic chord, and form what is described as the cremaster muscle.\n### ANATOMY\n\n#### Muscles at the fore part of the thorax:\n\n1. **Pectoralis major**\n   - Origin: From the cartilaginous ends of the 5th and 6th ribs; the sternum, and anterior part of the clavicle.\n   - Insertion: Into the upper and inner part of the os humeri (w).\n   - Use: To draw the arm forwards, or obliquely forwards.\n\n2. **Subclavius**\n   - Origin: From the cartilage of the first rib.\n   - Insertion: Into the under surface of the clavicle.\n   - Use: To move the clavicle forwards and downwards, and to assist in raising the first rib.\n\n3. **Pectoralis minor (x)**\n   - Origin: From the upper edges of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th ribs.\n   - Insertion: Into the coracoid processes of the scapula.\n   - Use: To move the scapula forwards and downwards, or to elevate the ribs.\n\n4. **Serratus magnus**\n   - Origin: From the eight superior ribs.\n   - Insertion: Into the basis of the scapula.\n   - Use: To bring the scapula forwards.\n\n#### Muscles at the lower part of the thorax:\n\n1. **Diaphragma (y)**\n   - Origin: From the transverse processes of the last cervical, and the eleven upper dorsal vertebrae.\n   - Insertion: Into the upper side of each rib, near its tuberosity.\n   - Use: To move the ribs upwards and outwards.\n\n2. **Levatores costarum**\n   - Origin: From the lower edge of each upper rib.\n   - Insertion: Into the superior edge of each lower rib.\n   - Use: To elevate the ribs.\n\n3. **Intercostales externi**\n   - Origin: From the spine to their cartilages; from thence to the sternum, there being only a thin membrane, which is spread over the intercostales interni; and that the latter, on the contrary, extend only from the sternum to the angles of each rib.\n\n4. **Intercostales interni (A)**\n   - Origin: That concurred in forming the thorax.\n\n#### Muscles at the abdominal region:\n\n5. **Rectus abdominis**\n   - Origin: From the upper edge of the pubis and the symphysis pubis.\n   - Insertion: Into the cartilages of the 5th, 6th, and 7th ribs, and the edge of the cartilago ensiformis (u).\n   - Use: To compress the fore part of the abdomen, and to bend the trunk forwards.\n\n6. **Pyramidalis (v)**\n   - Origin: From the anterior and upper part of the pubis.\n   - Insertion: Into the linea alba and inner edge of the rectus, commonly about two inches above the pubis.\n   - Use: To assist the lower portion of the rectus.\n\n---\n\n(v) The fibres of the rectus are generally divided by three tendinous intersections. The two upper thirds of this muscle passing between the tendinous layers of the obliquus internus, are enclosed as it were in a sheath; but at its lower part we find it immediately contiguous to the peritoneum, the inferior portion of the tendon of the transversalis passing over the rectus, and adhering to the interior layer of the obliquus internus.\n\n(w) This muscle is sometimes wanting.\n\n(x) This and some other muscles derive their name of serratus, from their arising by a number of tendinous or fleshy digitations, resembling the teeth of a saw (terra).\n\n(y) For a description of the diaphragm, see Chap. IV. Sect. IV.\n\n(z) The origin, insertion, and use of the internal intercostals, are similar to those of the external. The reader, however, will be pleased to observe, that the intercostales externi occupy the spaces between the ribs only from the spine to their cartilages; from thence to the sternum, there being only a thin membrane, which is spread over the intercostales interni; and that the latter, on the contrary, extend only from the sternum to the angles of each rib.\n\nThe fibres of the external muscles run obliquely forwards; those of the internal obliquely backwards. This difference in the direction of their fibres induced Galen to suppose that they were intended for different uses; that the external intercostals, for instance, serve to elevate, and the internal ones to depress the ribs. Fallopian seems to have been the first who ventured to dispute the truth of this doctrine, which has since been revived by Boyle.\n### Muscles at the back part of the neck and trunk,\n\n1. **Trapezius (c), or Cucullaris.**\n   - **Origin:** From the middle of the os occipitis, and the spinous processes of the two inferior cervical, and of all the dorsal vertebrae (d).\n   - **Insertion:** Into the posterior half of the clavicle, part of the acromion, and the spine of the scapula.\n   - **Ufe:** To move the scapula.\n\n2. **Rhomboideus (e).**\n   - **Origin:** From the spinous processes of the three lowermost cervical, and of all the dorsal vertebrae.\n   - **Insertion:** Into the basis of the scapula.\n   - **Ufe:** To move the scapula upwards and backwards.\n\n3. **Latissimus dorsi.**\n   - **Origin:** From part of the spine of the os ilium, the spinous processes of the os sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, and of six or eight of the dorsal vertebrae; also from the four inferior false ribs near their cartilages.\n   - **Insertion:** Into the os humeri, at the inner edge of the groove for lodging the long head of the biceps muscle.\n   - **Ufe:** To draw the os humeri downwards and backwards, and axis.\n\n4. **Serratus inferior posterior.**\n   - **Origin:** From the spinous processes of the two lowermost dorsal, and of three of the lumbar vertebrae.\n   - **Insertion:** Into the lower edges of the three or four lowermost ribs near their cartilages.\n   - **Ufe:** To draw the ribs outwards, downwards, and backwards.\n\n5. **Levator scapulae.**\n   - **Origin:** From the transverse processes of the four uppermost vertebrae colli.\n   - **Insertion:** Into the upper angle of the scapula.\n   - **Ufe:** To move the scapula forwards and upwards.\n\n6. **Serratus superior posterior.**\n   - **Origin:** From the lower part of the ligamentum colli, the spinous process of the lowermost cervical vertebra, and of the two superior dorsal vertebrae.\n   - **Insertion:** Into the 2d, 3d, and 4th ribs.\n   - **Ufe:** To expand the thorax.\n\n7. **Spleniuss**\n\n---\n\nBoyle, and more lately still by Hamberger, whose theoretical arguments on this subject have been clearly refuted by the experiments of Haller.\n\n(a) These consist of four, and sometimes five distinct muscles on each side. Vesalius, and after him Douglas and Albinus, consider them as forming a single muscle, which, on account of its shape, they name triangularis. Verheyen, Wintlow, and Haller, more properly describe them as so many separate muscles, which, on account of their origin and insertion, they name sterno-costales.\n\n(c) So named by Riolanus, from τρεμεῖν, on account of its quadrilateral shape. Columbus and others give it the name of cucullaris, from its resemblance to a monk's hood.\n\n(d) The tendinous fibres of this muscle, united with those of its fellow in the nape of the neck, form what is called the ligamentum colli.\n\n(e) This muscle consists of two distinct portions, which are described as separate muscles by Albinus, under the names of rhomboideus minor and rhomboideus major.\n### ANATOMY\n\n| Name                  | Origin                                                                 | Insertion                                                                 | Use                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 7.

Steno names them *musculi ad facro-lumbalem accessorii*. The facro-lumbalis likewise sends off a fleshy slip from its upper part, which by Douglas and Albinus is described as a distinct muscle, under the name of *cervicalis descendens*. Morgagni has very properly considered it as a part of the facro-lumbalis.\n\n(k) At the upper part of this muscle a broad thin layer of fleshy fibres is found crossing, and intimately adhering to it. This portion, which is described by Albinus under the name of *transversalis cervicalis*, may very properly be considered as an appendage to the longissimus dorsi. It arises from the transverse processes of the five or six superior dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the six inferior cervical vertebrae. By means of this appendage the longissimus dorsi may serve to move the neck to one side, or obliquely backwards.\n### Chap.

Albinius has the merit of having introduced greater simplicity into this part of myology. Under the name of *multifidus spine*, he has very properly included those portions of muscular flesh intermixed with tendinous fibres, situated close to the back part of the spine, and which are described by Douglas under the names of *transversales colli*, *dorsi*, et *lumborum*.\n\n(m) The ancients gave it this name from its resemblance to an irregular triangle (*καρπος*). It consists of three fleety portions. The anterior one affords a passage to the axillary artery, and between this and the middle portion we find the nerves going to the upper extremities. The middle is in part covered by the posterior portion, which is the longest and thinnest of the three.\n\n(n) In the generality of anatomical books we find these muscles divided into *inter-spinales cervicis*, *dorsi*, and *lumborum*, but we do not find any such muscles either in the loins or back.\n\n(o) These muscles are to be found only in the neck and loins; what have been described as the *inter-transversales dorsi* being rather small tendons than muscles.\n\n(p) This and the following pair of muscles derive their name of *psoas* from *ψωας*, *lumbus*, on account of their situation at the anterior part of the loins.\n### ANATOMY\n\n| Name                  | Origin                                                                 | Insertion                                                                 | Use                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2.

Coccygeus          | From the posterior and inner edge of the spine of the ilium.         | Into the lower part of the os sacrum, and almost the whole length of the os coccygis laterally. | To draw the os coccygis forwards and inwards (a).                  |\n\n**Muscles on the scapula and upper part of the os humeri:**\n\n1.

The tendon of the obturator internus runs between these two portions.\n\n(f) This muscle is not of the square shape its name would seem to indicate.\n\n(g) The muscles of the leg and thigh are covered by a broad tendinous membrane called *fascia lata*, that surrounds them in the manner of a sheath. It is sent off from the tendons of the glutaei and other muscles, and dipping down between the muscles it covers, adheres to the linea aspera, and spreading over the joint of the knee, gradually disappears on the leg. It is thickest on the inside of the thigh.\n\n(h) The tendon of this muscle forms the *outer hamstring*.\n\n(i) So named on account of its origin, which is by a broad flat tendon three inches long.\n### Chap.

They terminate on each side of the patella, and prevent the capsular ligament from being pinched. When they are wanting, which is very often the case, some of the fibres of the cruræus are found adhering to the capula.\n\n(N) This and the two following muscles have been usually, but improperly, considered as forming a single muscle with three heads, and on that account named *triceps femoris*.\n### ANATOMY\n\n#### Muscles on the leg\n\n| Name                  | Origin                                                                 | Insertion                                                                 | Use                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.

All the interossei assist in extending the toes.\nCHAP. III. OF THE ABDOMEN, OR LOWER BELLY.\n\nThe abdomen, or lower belly, extends from the lower extremity of the sternum, or the hollow usually called the pit of the stomach, and more properly *strobilus cordis*, to the lower part of the trunk.\n\nIt is distinguished into three divisions called regions; of these the upper one, which is called the *epigastric region*, begins immediately under the sternum, and extends to within two fingers breadth of the navel, where the middle or *umbilical region* begins, and reaches to the same distance below the navel. The third, which is called the *hypogastric*, includes the rest of the abdomen, as far as the os pubis.\n\nEach of these regions is subdivided into three others; two of which compose the sides, and the other the middle part of each region.\n\nVol. II. Part I.\nAfter having removed the skin, adipose membrane, and abdominal muscles, we discover the peritoneum or membrane that envelopes all the viscera of the lower belly. This being opened, the first part that presents itself is the omentum or cawl, floating on the surface of the intestines, which are likewise seen everywhere loose and moist, and making a great number of circumvolutions through the whole cavity of the abdomen. The stomach is placed in the epigastrium, and under the stomach is the pancreas. The liver fills the right hypochondrium, and the spleen is situated in the left. The kidneys are seen about the middle of the lumbar region, and the urinary bladder and parts of generation are seated in the lower division of the belly.\n\n**Sect. I. Of the Peritoneum.**\n\nThe peritoneum is a strong simple membrane, by which all the viscera of the abdomen are surrounded, and in some measure supported. Many anatomical writers, particularly Winiford, have described it as being composed of two distinct membranous laminae; but their description seems to be erroneous; what perhaps appeared to be a second lamina, being found to be simply a cellular coat, which sends off productions to the blood vessels passing out of the abdominal cavity. The aorta and vena cava likewise derive a covering from the same membrane, which seems to be a part of the cellular membrane we have already described.\n\nThe peritoneum, by its productions and reduplications, envelopes the greatest part of the abdominal viscera. It is soft, and capable of considerable extension; and is kept smooth and moist by a vapour, which is constantly exhaling from its inner surface, and is returned again into the circulation by the absorbents.\n\nThis moisture not only contributes to the softness of the peritoneum, but prevents the attrition, and other ill effects which would otherwise probably be occasioned, by the motion of the viscera upon each other.\n\nWhen this fluid is supplied in too great a quantity, or the absorbents become incapable of carrying it off, it accumulates, and constitutes an affecit or drop of the belly; and when by any means the exhalation is discontinued, the peritoneum thickens, becomes distended, and the viscera are sometimes found adhering to each other.\n\nThe peritoneum is not a very vascular membrane. In a sound state it seems to be ended with little or no feeling, and the nerves that pass through it appear to belong to the abdominal muscles.\n\n**Sect. II. Of the Omentum.**\n\nThe omentum, epiploon, or cawl, is a double membrane, produced from the peritoneum. It is interlarded with fat, and adheres to the stomach, spleen, duodenum, and colon; from thence hanging down loose and floating on the surface of the intestines. Its size is different in different subjects. In some it descends as low as the pelvis, and it is commonly longer at the left side than the right.\n\nThis part, the situation of which we have just now described, was the only one known to the ancients under the name of epiploon; but at present we distinguish three omenta, viz., omentum magnum colico-gastricum, omentum parvum hepatico-gastricum, and omentum colicum. They all agree in being formed of two very delicate laminae, separated by a thin layer of cellular membrane.\n\nThe omentum magnum colico-gastricum, of which we have already spoken, derives its arteries from the splenic and hepatic. Its veins terminate in the vena porta. Its nerves, which are very few, come from the splenic and hepatic plexus.\n\nThe omentum parvum hepatico-gastricum abounds less with fat than the great epiploon. It begins at the upper part of the duodenum, extends along the lesser curvature of the stomach as far as the oesophagus, and terminates about the neck of the gall-bladder, and behind the left ligament of the liver, so that it covers the lesser lobe; near the beginning of which we may observe a small opening, first described by Winiford, through which the whole pouch may easily be distended with air (x). The vessels of the omentum parvum are derived chiefly from the coronary stomachic arteries and veins.\n\nThe omentum colicum begins at the fore part of the caecum and right side of the colon. It appears as a hollow conical appendage to these intestines, and usually terminates at the back of the omentum magnum. It seems to be nothing more than a membranous coat of the caecum and colon, assuming a conical shape when distended with air.\n\nThe uses of the omentum are not yet satisfactorily determined. Perhaps by its softness and looseness it may serve to prevent those adhesions of the abdominal viscera, which have been found to take place when the fat of the omentum has been much wasted. Some authors have supposed, that it assists in the preparation of bile; but this idea is founded merely on conjecture.\n\n**Sect. III. Of the Stomach.**\n\nThe stomach is a membranous and muscular bag, in shape not unlike a bagpipe, lying across the upper part of the abdomen, and inclining rather more to the left than the right side.\n\nIt has two orifices, one of which receives the end of the oesophagus, and is called the cardia, and sometimes the left and upper orifice of the stomach; though its situation is not much higher than the other, which is styled the right and inferior orifice, and more commonly the pylorus; both these openings are more elevated than the body of the stomach.\n\nThe aliment passes down the oesophagus into the stomach through the cardia, and after having undergone\n\n---\n\n(x) This membranous bag, though exceedingly thin and transparent, is found capable of supporting mercury, thrown into it by the same channel.\ngone the necessary digestion, passes out at the pylorus where the intestinal canal commences.\n\nThe stomach is composed of four tunics or coats, which are so intimately connected together that it requires no little dexterity in the anatomist to demonstrate them. The exterior one is membranous, being derived from the peritoneum. The second is a muscular tunic, composed of fleshy fibres which are in the greatest number about the two orifices. The third is called the nervous coat, and within this is the villous or velvet-like coat which composes the inside of the stomach.\n\nThe two last coats being more extensive than the two first, form the folds, which are observed everywhere in the cavity of this viscus, and more particularly about the pylorus; where they seem to impede the too hasty exclusion of the aliment, making a considerable plait, called valvula pylori.\n\nThe inner coat is constantly moistened by a mucus, which approaches to the nature of the saliva, and is called the gastric juice; this liquor has been supposed to be secreted by certain minute glands (v) seated in the nervous tunic, whose excretory ducts open on the surface of the villous coat.\n\nThe arteries of the stomach called the gastric arteries are principally derived from the celiac; some of its veins pass to the splenic, and others to the vena portae; and its nerves are chiefly from the eighth pair or par vagum.\n\nThe account given of the tunics of the stomach may be applied to the whole alimentary canal; for both the esophagus and intestines are, like this viscus, composed of four coats.\n\nBefore we describe the course of the aliment, and the uses of the stomach, it will be necessary to speak of other parts which assist in the process of digestion.\n\nSect. IV. Of the Esophagus.\n\nThe esophagus or gullet is a membranous and muscular canal, extending from the bottom of the mouth to the upper orifice of the stomach. Its upper part where the aliment is received is shaped somewhat like a funnel, and is called the pharynx.\n\nFrom hence it runs down close to the bodies of the vertebrae as far as the diaphragm, in which there is an opening through which it passes, and then terminates in the stomach about the eleventh or twelfth vertebra of the back.\n\nThe esophagus is plentifully supplied with arteries from the external carotid, bronchial, and superior intercostal arteries; its veins empty themselves into the vena azygos, internal jugular, and mammary veins, &c.\n\nIts nerves are derived chiefly from the eighth pair.\n\nWe likewise meet with a mucus in the esophagus, which everywhere lubricates its inner surface, and tends to assist in deglutition. This mucus seems to be secreted by very minute glands, like the mucus in other parts of the alimentary canal.\n\nSect. V. Of the Intestines.\n\nThe intestines form a canal, which is usually six times longer than the body to which it belongs. This canal extends from the pylorus, or inferior orifice of the stomach, to the anus.\n\nIt will be easily understood, that a part of such great length must necessarily make many circumvolutions, to be confined with so many other viscera within the cavity of the lower belly.\n\nAlthough the intestines are in fact, as we have observed, only one long and extensive canal, yet different parts have been distinguished by different names.\n\nThe intestines are first distinguished into two parts, one of which begins at the stomach, and is called the thin or small intestine, from the small size of the canal, when compared with the other part, which is called the large intestine, and includes the lower portion of the canal down to the anus.\n\nEach of these parts has its subdivisions. The small intestines being distinguished into duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, and the larger portion into caecum, colon, and rectum.\n\nThe small intestines fill the middle and fore parts of the belly, while the large intestines fill the sides and both the upper and lower parts of the cavity.\n\nThe duodenum, which is the first of the small intestines, is so called, because it is about 12 inches long. It begins at the pylorus, and terminates in the jejunum, which is a part of the canal observed to be usually more empty than the other intestines. This appearance gives it its name, and likewise serves to point out where it begins.\n\nThe next division is the ileum, which of itself exceeds the united length of the duodenum and jejunum, and has received its name from its numerous circumvolutions. The large circumvolution of the ileum covers the first of the large intestines called the caecum (x), which seems properly to belong to the colon, being a kind of pouch of about four fingers in width, and nearly of the same length, having exteriorly a little appendix, called appendix caeci.\n\nThe caecum is placed in the cavity of the os ilium on the right side, and terminates in the colon, which is the largest of all the intestines.\n\nThis intestine ascends by the right kidney to which it is attached, passes under the hollow part of the liver, and the bottom of the stomach, to the spleen, to which it is likewise secured, as it is also to the left kidney; and from thence passes down towards the os sacrum, where\n\n(v) Heister, speaking of these glands, very properly says, \"in porcis facile, in homine raro observantur;\" for although many anatomical writers have described their appearance and figure, yet they do not seem to have been hitherto satisfactorily demonstrated in the human stomach; and the gastric juice is now more generally believed to be derived from the exhalant arteries of the stomach.\n\n(x) Anatomists have differed with respect to this division of the intestines.—The method here followed is now generally adopted; but there are authors who allow the name of caecum only to the little appendix, which has likewise been called the vermiform appendix, from its resemblance to a worm in size and length.\nwhere, from its straight course, the canal begins to take the name of rectum.\n\nThere are three ligamentous bands extending through the whole length of the colon, which by being shorter than its two inner coats, serve to increase the plait on the inner surface of this gut.\n\nThe anus, which terminates the intestinum rectum, is furnished with three muscles; one of these is composed of circular fibres, and from its use in shutting the passage of the anus is called sphincter ani.\n\nThe other two are the levatores ani, so called, because they elevate the anus after defecation. When these by palsy, or any other disease, lose the power of contracting, the anus prolapses; and when the sphincter is affected by similar causes, the faeces are voided involuntarily.\n\nIt has been already observed, that the intestinal canal is composed of four tunics; but it remains to be remarked, that here, as in the stomach, the two inner tunics being more extensive than the other two, form the plait which are to be seen in the inner surface of the intestines, and are called valvulae conniventes.\n\nSome authors have considered these plait as tending to retard the motion of the faeces, in order to afford more time for the separation of the chyle; but there are others who attribute to them a different use: they contend, that these valves, by being naturally inclined downwards, cannot impede the descent of the faeces, but that they are intended to prevent their return upwards.\n\nThey are probably destined for both these uses; for although these folds incline to their lower side, yet the inequalities they occasion in the canal are sufficient to retard in some measure the progressive motion of the faeces, and to afford a greater surface for the absorption of chyle; and their natural position seems to oppose itself to the return of the aliment.\n\nBesides these valvulae conniventes, there is one more considerable than the rest, called the valve of the colon; which is found at that part of the canal where the intestinum ileum is joined to the colon. This valve permits the alimentary pulp to pass downwards, but serves to prevent its return upwards; and it is by this valve that clysters are prevented from passing into the small intestines (y).\n\nOf the little vermiform appendix of the caecum, it will be sufficient to say, that its uses have never yet been ascertained. In birds we meet with two of these appendages.\n\nThe intestines are lubricated by a constant supply of mucus, which is probably secreted by very minute follicles (z). This mucus promotes the descent of the alimentary pulp, and in some measure defends the inner surface of the intestines from the irritation to which it would, perhaps, otherwise be continually exposed from the aliment; and which, when in a certain degree, excites a painful disorder called colic, a name given to the disease, because its most usual seat is in the intestinum colon.\n\nThe intestines are likewise frequently distended with air, and this distention sometimes occasions pain, and constitutes the violent colic.\n\nThe arteries of the intestines are continuations of the mesenteric arteries which are derived in two considerable branches from the aorta.—The redundant blood is carried back into the vena portarum.\n\nIn the rectum the veins are called hemorrhoidal, and are there distinguished into internal and external: the first are branches of the inferior mesenteric vein, but the latter pass into other veins. Sometimes these veins are distended with blood from obstructions, from weakness of their coats, or from other causes, and what we call the hemorrhoids takes place. In this disease they are sometimes ruptured; and the discharge of blood which consequently follows, has probably occasioned them to be called hemorrhoidal veins.\n\nThe nerves of the intestines are derived from the eighth pair.\n\nSect. VI. Of the Mesentery.\n\nThe name of the mesentery implies its situation amidst the intestines. It is in fact a part of the peritoneum, being a reduplication (a) of that membrane from each side of the lumbar vertebrae, to which it is firmly attached, so that it is formed of two lamina connected to each other by cellular membrane.\n\nThe intestines, in their different convolutions, form a great number of arches, and the mesentery accompanies them through all these turns; but by being attached\n\n(y) This is not invariably the case; for the contents of a clyster have been found not only to reach the small intestines, but to be voided at the mouth. Such instances, however, are not common.\n\n(z) Some writers have distinguished these glands into milky, lenticular, &c.—Brunner and Peyer were the first anatomists who described the glands of the intestines, and their descriptions were chiefly taken from animals, these glandular appearances not seeming to have been hitherto satisfactorily pointed out in the human subject. It is now pretty generally believed, that the mucus which everywhere lubricates the alimentary canal, is exhaled from the minute ends of arteries; and that these extremities first open into a hollow vesicle, from whence the deposited juice of several branches flows out through one common orifice.\n\n(a) He who only reads of the reduplication of membranes, will perhaps not easily understand how the peritoneum and pleura are reflected over the viscera in their several cavities; for one of these serves the same purpose in the thorax that the other does in the abdomen. This disposition, for the discovery of which we are indebted to modern anatomists, constitutes a curious part of anatomical knowledge: but the student, unaided by experience, and afflicted only by what the limits of this work would permit us to say on the occasion, would probably imbibe only confused ideas of the matter; and it will perfectly answer the present purpose, if he considers the mesentery as a membrane attached by one of its sides to the lumbar vertebrae, and by the other to the intestines.\nThat part of this membrane which accompanies the small intestine is the mesentery, properly so called; but those parts of it which are attached to the colon and rectum are distinguished by the names of meso-colon and meso-rectum.\n\nThere are many conglomerate glands dispersed through this double membrane, through which the lacteals and lymphatics pass in their way to the thoracic duct. The blood vessels of the mesentery were described in speaking of the intestines.\n\nThis membrane, by its attachment to the vertebrae, serves to keep the intestines in their natural situation. The idea usually formed of the colic called mufere, is perfectly erroneous; it being impossible that the intestines can be twisted, as many suppose they are, in that disease, their attachment to the mesentery effectually preventing such an accident—but a disarrangement sometimes takes place in the intestinal canal itself, which is productive of disagreeable and sometimes fatal consequences.—This is by an introspection of the intestine, an idea of which may be easily formed, by taking the finger of a glove, and involving one part of it within the other.\n\nIf inflammation takes place, the stricture in this case is increased, and the peristaltic motion of the intestines (by which is meant the progressive motion of the feces downwards) is inverted, and what is called the iliac plication takes place. The same effects may be occasioned by a descent of the intestine, or of the omentum either with it or by itself, and thus constituting what is called a hernia or rupture; a term by which in general is meant the falling down or protrusion of any part of the intestine or omentum, which ought naturally to be contained within the cavity of the belly.\n\nTo convey an idea of the manner in which such a descent takes place, it will be necessary to observe, that the lower edge of the tendon of the musculus obliquus externus, is stretched from the fore part of the os ilium or haunch bone of the os pubis, and constitutes what is called Poupart's or Fallopian's ligament, forming an opening, through which pass the great crural artery and vein. Near the os pubis the same tendinous fibres are separated from each other, and form an opening on each side, called the abdominal ring, through which the spermatic vessels pass in men, and the ligamenta uteri in women. In consequence of violent efforts, or perhaps of natural causes, the intestines are found sometimes to pass through these openings; but the peritoneum which encloses them when in their natural cavity, still continues to surround them even in their descent. This membrane does not become torn or lacerated by the violence, as might be easily imagined; but its dilatability enables it to pass out with the viscus, which it encloses as it were in a bag, and thus forms what is called the hernial sac.\n\nIf the hernia be under Poupart's ligament, it is called femoral; if in the groin inguinal (n); and iferal, if in the scrotum. Different names are likewise given to the hernia as the contents of the sac differ, whether of omentum only, or intestine, or both—but these definitions more properly belong to the province of surgery.\n\nSect. VII. Of the Pancreas.\n\nThe pancreas is a conglomerate gland, placed behind the bottom of the stomach, towards the first vertebra of the loins; shaped like a dog's tongue, with its point stretched out towards the spleen, and its other end extending towards the duodenum. It is about eight fingers breadth in length, two or three in width, and one in thickness.\n\nThis viscus, which is of a yellowish colour, somewhat inclining to red, is covered with a membrane which it derives from the peritoneum. Its arteries, which are rather numerous than large, are derived chiefly from the splenic and hepatic, and its veins pass into the veins of the same name.—Its nerves are derived from the intercostal.\n\nThe many little glands of which it has been observed the pancreas is composed, all serve to secrete a liquor called the pancreatic juice, which, in its colour, consistence, and other properties, does not seem to differ from the saliva. Each of these glands sends out a little excretory duct, which uniting with others, help to form larger ducts; and all these at last terminate in one common excretory duct (first discovered by Virgilius in 1642), which runs through the middle of the gland, and is now usually called ductus pancreatis Virgili. This canal opens into the intestine duodenum, sometimes by the same orifice with the biliary duct, and sometimes by a distinct opening. The liquor it discharges being of a mild and insipid nature, serves to dilute the alimentary pulp, and to incorporate it more easily with the bile.\n\nSect. VIII. Of the Liver.\n\nThe liver is a viscus of considerable size, and of a reddish colour; convex superiorly and anteriorly where it is placed under the ribs and diaphragm, and of an unequal surface posteriorly. It is chiefly situated in the right hypochondrium, and under the false ribs; but it likewise extends into the epigastric region, where it borders upon the stomach. It is covered by a production of the peritoneum, which serves to attach it by three of its reduplications to the false ribs. These reduplications are called ligaments, though very different in their texture from what are called by the same name in other parts of the body. The umbilical cord, too, which in the fetus is pervious, gradually becomes a simple ligament after birth; and by passing to the liver, serves likewise to secure it in its situation.\n\nAt the posterior part of this organ where the umbilical vessels enter, it is found divided into two lobes. Of these, the largest is placed in the right hypochondrium; the other, which covers part of the stomach, is called the little lobe. All the vessels which go to the liver pass in at the fissure we have mentioned; and the production of the peritoneum, which invests the liver, was described by Glisson, an English anatomist, as accompanying them in their passage, and surrounding\n\n(n) The hernia congenita will be considered with the male organs of generation, with which it is intimately connected.\nsurrounding them like a glove; hence this production has been commonly known by the name of capsula of Glisson: but it appears to be chiefly a continuation of the cellular membrane which covers the vena portae ventralis.\n\nThe liver was considered by the ancients as an organ destined to prepare and perfect the blood; but later discoveries have proved, that this opinion was wrong, and that the liver is a glandular substance formed for the secretion of the bile.\n\nThe blood is conveyed to the liver by the hepatic artery and the vena portae. This is contrary to the mode of circulation in other parts, where veins only serve to carry off the redundant blood; but in this viscus the hepatic artery, which is derived from the celiac, is principally destined for its nourishment; and the vena portae, which is formed by the union of the veins from most of the abdominal viscera, furnishes the blood from which the bile is chiefly to be separated; so that these two series of vessels serve very distinct purposes. The vena portae, as it is ramified through the liver, performs the office both of a vein and an artery; for like the former it returns the blood from the extremities of arteries, while as the latter it prepares it for secretion.\n\nThe nerves of the liver are branches of the intercostal and par vagum. The bile, after being separated from the mass of blood, in a manner of which mention will be made in another place, is conveyed out of this organ by very minute excretory ducts, called porti biliares; these uniting together like the excretory ducts in the pancreas, gradually form larger ones, which at length terminate in a considerable channel called ductus hepaticus.\n\nSect. IX. Of the Gall-Bladder.\n\nThe gall-bladder is a little membranous bag, shaped like a pear, and attached to the posterior and almost inferior part of the great lobe of the liver.\n\nIt has two tunics; of which the exterior one is a production of the peritoneum. The interior, or villous coat, is supplied with a mucus that defends it from the acrimony of the bile. These two coverings are intimately connected by means of cellular membrane, which from its firm glistering appearance has generally been spoken of as a muscular tunic.\n\nThe gall-bladder is supplied with blood vessels from the hepatic arteries. These branches are called the cylic arteries, and the cylic veins carry back the blood.\n\nIts nerves are derived from the same origin as those of the liver.\n\nThe neck of the gall-bladder is continued in the form of a canal called ductus cylicus, which soon unites with the ductus hepaticus we described as the excretory duct of the liver; forming one common canal, takes the name of ductus choledochus communis, through which both the cylic and hepatic bile are discharged into the duodenum. This canal opens into the intestine in an oblique direction, first passing through the exterior tunic, and then piercing the other coats after running between each of them a very little way. This economy serves two useful purposes—to promote the discharge of bile and to prevent its return.\n\nThe bile may be defined to be a natural liquid soap, somewhat unctuous and bitter, and of a yellowish colour, which easily mixes with water, oil, and vinous spirits, and is capable of dissolving resinous substances. From some late experiments made by M. Cadet*, it appears to be formed of an animal oil, combined with the alkaline base of tea salt, a salt of the nature of milk, and a calcareous earth which is slightly ferruginous.\n\nIts definition seems sufficiently to point out the uses for which it is intended (c). It blends the alimentary mass, by dividing and attenuating it; corrects the too great disposition to acrimony, which the aliment acquires in the stomach; and, finally, by its acrimony, tends to excite the peristaltic motion of the intestines.\n\nAfter what has been said, it will be conceived that there are two sorts of bile; one of which is derived immediately from the liver through the hepatic duct, and the other from the gall-bladder. These two biles, however, do not essentially differ from each other. The hepatic bile indeed is milder, and more liquid than the cylic, which is constantly thicker and yellower; and by being bitterer, seems to possess greater activity than the other.\n\nEvery body knows the source of the hepatic bile, that it is secreted from the mass of blood by the liver; but the origin of the cylic bile has occasioned no little controversy among anatomical writers. There are some who contend, that it is separated in the substance of the liver, from whence it passes into the gall-bladder through particular vessels. In deer, and in some other quadrupeds, as well as in several birds and fishes, there is an evident communication, by means of particular vessels, between the liver and the gall-bladder. Bianchi, Winlow, and others, have asserted the existence of such vessels in the human subject, and named them hepatico-cylic ducts; but it is certain that no such ducts exist.—In obstructions of the cylic duct, the gall-bladder has been found shrivelled and empty; so that we may consider the gall-bladder as a reservoir of hepatic bile; and that it is an established fact, that the whole of the bile contained in the gall-bladder is derived from the liver; that it passes into the hepatic or the cylic duct, and from that to the gall-bladder. The difference in the colour, consistence, and taste of the bile, is merely the consequence of stagnation and absorption. When the stomach is distended with aliment, this reservoir undergoes a certain degree of compression, and the bile passes out into the intestinal canal; and in the efforts to vomit, the gall-bladder seems to be constantly affected, and at such times discharges itself of its contents.\n\nSometimes\n\n(c) The ancients, who were not acquainted with the real use of the liver, considered the bile as an excrementitious and useless fluid.\nChap. III.\n\nANATOMY.\n\nOf the Abdomen.\n\nSometimes the bile concretes in the gall-bladder, so as to form what are called gall stones (p). When these concretions pass into the cystic duct, they sometimes occasion exquisite pain, by distending the canal in their way to the duodenum; and by lodging in the ductus choledochus communis, and obstructing the course of the bile, this fluid will be absorbed, and by being carried back into the circulation occasion a temporary jaundice.\n\nSect. X. Of the Spleen.\n\nThe spleen is a soft and spongy viscus, of a bluish colour, and about five or six fingers breadth in length, and three in width, situated in the left hypochondrium, between the stomach and the false ribs. That side of it which is placed on the side of the ribs is convex; and the other, which is turned towards the stomach, is concave.\n\nThe splenic artery, which is a branch from the celiac, supplies this viscus with blood, and a vein of the same name carries it back into the vena portae.\n\nIts nerves are derived from a particular plexus called the splenic, which is formed by branches of the intercostal nerve, and by the eighth pair, or par vagum.\n\nThe ancients, who supposed two sorts of bile, considered the spleen as the receptacle of what they called atra bilis. Havers, who wrote professedly on the bones, determined its use to be that of secreting the synovia; and the late Mr Hewson imagined, that it concurred with the thymus and lymphatic glands of the body in forming the red globules of the blood. All these opinions seem to be equally fanciful. The want of an excretory duct has occasioned the real use of this viscus to be still doubtful. Perhaps the blood undergoes some change in it, which may affect in the preparation of the bile. This is the opinion of the generality of modern physiologists; and the great quantity of blood with which it is supplied, together with the course of its veins into the vena portae, seem to render this notion probable.\n\nSect. XI. Of the Glandulae Renales, Kidneys, and Ureters.\n\nThe glandulae renales, which were by the ancients supposed to secrete the atra bilis, and by them named capsulae atrabiliare, are two flat bodies of an irregular figure, one on each side between the kidney and the aorta.\n\nIn the fetus they are as large as the kidneys; but they do not increase afterwards in proportion to those parts; and in adults and old people they are generally found shrivelled, and much wasted. They have their arteries and veins. Their arteries usually arise from the splenic or the emulgent, and sometimes from the aorta; and their veins go to the neighbouring veins, or to the vena cava. Their nerves are branches of the intercostal.\n\nThe use of these parts is not yet perfectly known. In the fetus the secretion of urine must be in a very small quantity, and a part of the blood may perhaps then pass through these channels, which in the adult is carried to the kidneys to supply the matter of urine.\n\nThe kidneys are two in number, situated one on the right and the other on the left side in the lumbar region, between the last false rib and the os ilium, by the sides of the vertebrae. Each kidney in its figure resembles a sort of bean, which from its shape is called kidney bean. The concave part of each kidney is turned towards the aorta and vena cava ascendens. They are surrounded by a good deal of fat, and receive a coat from the peritoneum; and when this is removed, a very fine membrane is found investing their substance and the vessels which ramify through them.\n\nEach kidney has a considerable artery and vein, which are called the emulgent. The artery is a branch from the aorta, and the vein passes into the vena cava. Their nerves, which everywhere accompany the blood vessels, arise from a considerable plexus, which is derived from the intercostal.\n\nIn each kidney, which in the adult is of a pretty firm texture, there are three substances to be distinguished (e). The outer part is glandular or cortical, beyond this is the valcular or tubular substance, and the inner part is papillary or membranous.\n\nIt is in the cortical part of the kidney that the secretion is carried on; the urine being here received from the minute extremities of the capillary arteries, is conveyed out of this cortical substance by an infinite number of very small cylindrical canals or excretory vessels, which constitute the tubular part. These tubes, as they approach the inner substance of the kidney, gradually unite together; and thus forming larger canals, at length terminate in ten or twelve little protuberances called papillae, the orifices of which may be seen without the affluence of glasses. These papillae open into a small cavity or reservoir called the pelvis of the kidney, and formed by a distinct membranous bag which embraces the papillae. From this pelvis the urine is conveyed through a membranous canal which passes out from the hollow side of the kidney, a little below the blood vessels, and is called ureter.\n\nThe ureters are each about as large as a common writing pen. They are somewhat curved in their course from the kidneys, like the letter J, and at length terminate in the posterior and almost inferior part of the bladder, at some distance from each other. They pass into the bladder in the same manner as the ductus choledochus communis passes into the intellimum duodenum, not by a direct passage, but by an oblique course.\n\n(p) These concretions sometimes remain in the gall-bladder without causing any uneasiness. Dr Heberden relates, that a gall stone weighing two drachms was found in the gall-bladder of the late Lord Bath, though he had never complained of the jaundice, nor of any disorder which he could attribute to that cause.

Nor does this mode of structure prevent the passage of fluids only from the bladder into the ureters, but likewise air—for air thrown into the bladder inflates it, and it continues to be distended if a ligature is passed round its neck; which seems to prove sufficiently that it cannot pass into the ureters.\n\nSect. XII. Of the Urinary Bladder.\n\nThe urinary bladder is a membranous and muscular bag of an oblong roundish shape, situated in the pelvis, between the os pubis and intestinum rectum in men, and between the os pubis and uterus in women. Its upper and widest part is usually called the bottom, its narrower part the neck of the bladder; the former only is covered by the peritoneum.\n\nThe bladder is formed of three coats, connected together by means of cellular membrane. The external or peritoneal, is only a partial one, covering the upper and back part of the bladder. The middle, or muscular coat, is composed of irritable, and of course muscular fibres, which are most collected around the neck of the bladder, but not so as to form a distinct muscle, or sphincter, as the generality of anatomists have hitherto supposed.\n\nThe inner coat, though much smoother, has been said to resemble the villous tunic of the intestines, and like that is provided with a mucus, which defends it against the acrimony of the urine.\n\nIt will be easily conceived from what has been said, that the kidneys are two glandular bodies, through which a saline and excrementitious fluid called urine is constantly filtering from the mass of blood.\n\nWhile only a small quantity of urine is collected in the bladder, it excites no kind of uneasiness; but when a greater quantity is accumulated, so that the bladder is distended in a certain degree, it excites in us a certain sensation, which brings on as it were a voluntary contraction of the bladder to promote its discharge.—But this contraction is not effected by the muscular fibres of the bladder alone: for all the abdominal muscles contract in obedience to our will, and press downwards all the viscera of the lower belly; and these powers being united, at length overcome the resistance of the fibres surrounding the neck of the bladder, which dilates and affords a passage to the urine through the urethra.\n\nThe frequency of this evacuation depends on the quantity of urine secreted; on the degree of acrimony it possesses; on the size of the bladder, and on its degree of sensibility.\n\nThe urine varies much in its colour and contents. These varieties depend on age, sex, climate, diet, and other circumstances. In infants it is generally a clear watery fluid, without smell or taste. As we advance in life, it acquires more colour and smell, and becomes more impregnated with salts. In old people it becomes still more acid and fetid.\n\nIn a healthy state it is nearly of a straw colour.—After being kept for some time, it deposits a tartarous matter, which is found to be composed chiefly of earth and salt, and soon incrusts the sides of the vessel in which it is contained. While this separation is taking place, appearances like minute fibres or threads of a whitish colour, may be seen in the middle of the urine, and an oily scum observed floating on its surface. So that the most common appearances of the urine are sufficient to ascertain that it is a watery substance, impregnated with earthy, saline, and oily particles.\n\nThe urine is not always voided of the same colour and consistence; for these are found to depend on the proportion of its watery part to that of its other constituent principles.—Its colour and degree of fluidity seem to depend on the quantity of saline and inflammable particles contained in it; so that an increased proportion of those parts will constantly give the urine a higher colour, and add to the quantity of sediment.\n\nThe variety in the appearances of the urine, depends on the nature and quantity of solid and fluid aliment we take in; and it is likewise occasioned by the different state of the urinary vessels, by which we mean the channels through which it is separated from the blood, and conveyed through the pelvis into the ureters. The causes of calculous concretions in the urinary passages, are to be looked for in the natural constitution of the body, mode of life, &c.\n\nIt having been observed, that after drinking any light wine or Spa water, it very soon passes off by urine, it has been supposed by some, that the urine is not altogether conveyed to the bladder by the ordinary course of circulation, but that there must certainly exist some other shorter means of communication, perhaps by certain vessels between the stomach and the bladder, or by a retrograde motion in the lymphatics. But it is certain, that if we open the belly of a dog, press out the urine from the bladder, pass a ligature round the eminence arteries, and then sew up the abdomen, and give him even the most diuretic liquor to drink, the stomach and other channels will be distended with it, but not a drop of urine will be found to have passed into the bladder; or the same thing happens when a ligature is thrown round the two ureters. This experiment then seems to be a sufficient proof, that all the urine we evacuate is conveyed to the kidneys through the eminence arteries, in the manner we have described.—It is true, that wine and other liquors promote a speedy evacuation of urine; but the discharge seems to be merely the effect of the stimulus they occasion; by which the bladder and urinary parts are solicited to a more copious discharge of the urine, which was before in the body, and not immediately of that which was last drank; and this increased discharge, if the supply is kept up, will continue; nor will this appear wonderful, if we consider the great capacity of the vessels that go to the kidneys; the constant supply of fresh blood that is essential to health; and the rapidity with which it is incessantly circulated through the heart to all parts of the body.\n\nSect. XIII. Of Digestion.\n\nWe are now proceeding to speak of digestion, which seems to be introduced in this place with propriety, after a description of the abdominal viscera, the greater part of which contribute to this function. By digestion is to be understood, the changes the aliment undergoes\nThe mouth, of which every body has a general knowledge, is the cavity between the two jaws, formed anteriorly and laterally by the lips, teeth, and cheeks, and terminating posteriorly in the throat.\n\nThe lips and cheeks are made up of fat and muscles, covered by the cuticle, which is continued over the whole inner surface of the mouth, like a fine and delicate membrane.—Besides this membrane, the inside of the mouth is furnished with a spongy and very vascular substance called the gums, by means of which the teeth are secured in their sockets. A similar substance covers the roof of the mouth, and forms what is called the velum pendulum palati, which is fixed to the extremity of the arch formed by the os maxillaria and os palati, and terminates in a soft, small, and conical body, named uvula; which appears, as it were, suspended from the middle of the arch over the basis of the tongue.\n\nThe velum pendulum palati performs the office of a valve between the cavity of the mouth and the pharynx, being moved by several muscles (r).\n\nThe tongue is composed of several muscles (c) which enable it to perform a variety of motions for the articulation of the voice; for the purposes of mastication; and for conveying the aliment into the pharynx. Its upper part is covered with papillae, which constitute the organ of taste, and are easily to be distinguished; it is covered by the same membrane that lines the inside of the mouth, and which makes at its inferior part towards its basis a reduplication called frenum.\n\nPosteriorly, under the velum palati, and at the basis of the tongue, is the pharynx; which is the beginning of the oesophagus, stretched out every way, so as to resemble the top of a funnel, through which the aliment passes into the stomach.\n\nThe mouth has a communication with the nostrils at its posterior and upper part; with the ears, by the Eustachian tubes; with the lungs, by means of the larynx; and with the stomach, by means of the oesophagus.\n\nThe pharynx is constantly moistened by a fluid, secreted by two considerable glands called the tonsils, one on each side of the velum palati. These glands, from their supposed resemblance to almonds, have likewise been called amygdalas.\n\nThe mouth is moistened by a considerable quantity of saliva. This fluid is derived from the parotid glands; a name which by its etymology points out their situation to be near the ears. They are two in number, one on each side under the os maxilla; and they are of the conglomerate kind; being formed of many smaller glands, each of which sends out a very small excretory duct, which unites with the rest, to form one common channel, that runs over the cheek, and piercing the buccinator muscle, opens into the mouth on each side, by an orifice into which a bristle may be easily introduced.\n\nVol. II. Part I.\n\n(r) These are the circumflexus palati, levator palati mollis, palato-pharyngeus constrictor isthmi faucium, and azygos uvulae.\n\n(c) These are, the genio-gloffiis, hyo-gloffiis, lingualis, and stylo-gloffiis.\nOf the Abdomen.\n\nSome preparation in the mouth before it passes into the stomach; and this preparation is the effect of mastication. In treating of the upper and lower jaws, mention was made of the number and arrangement of the teeth. The upper jaw was described as being immovable; but the lower jaw was spoken of as being capable of elevation and depression, and of a grinding motion. The aliment, when first carried into the mouth, is pressed between the teeth of the two jaws, by a very strong and frequent motion of the lower jaw; and the tongue and the cheeks afflicting in this process, continue to replace the food between the teeth till it is perfectly divided, and reduced to the consistence of pulp. The incisors and canines divide it first into smaller pieces, but it is between the surfaces of the dentes molares by the grinding motion of the jaw that the mastication is completed.\n\nDuring this process, the salivary glands being gently compelled by the contraction of the muscles that move the lower jaw, pour out their saliva; this helps to divide and break down the food, which at length becomes a kind of pulp, and is then carried over the basis of the tongue into the fauces. But to effect this passage into the oesophagus, it is necessary that the other openings which were mentioned as having a communication with the mouth as well as the pharynx, should be closed; that none of the aliment, whether solid or liquid, may pass into them, whilst the pharynx alone is dilated to receive it.—And such a disposition actually takes place in a manner we will endeavour to describe.\n\nThe trachea arteria, or windpipe, through which the air is conveyed to the lungs, is placed before the oesophagus—in the act of swallowing; therefore, if the larynx (for so the upper part of the trachea is called) is not closed, the aliment will pass into it in its way to the oesophagus. But this is prevented by a small and very elastic cartilage, called epiglottis, which is attached only to the fore part of the larynx; so that the food in its passage to the oesophagus presses down this cartilage, which then covers the glottis or opening of the larynx; and at the same time the velum palati being capable of some degree of motion, is drawn backwards by its muscles, and closes the openings into the nose and the Eustachian tubes.—This, however, is not all. The larynx, which being composed of cartilaginous rings cannot fail in its ordinary state to compress the membranous canal of the oesophagus, is in the act of deglutition carried forwards and upwards by muscles destined for that purpose; and consequently drawing the fore part of the pharynx with it, that opening is fully dilated. When the aliment has reached the pharynx, its descent is promoted by its own proper weight, and by the muscular fibres of the oesophagus, which continue to contract from above downwards, until the aliment has reached the stomach. That these fibres have no inconsiderable share in deglutition, any person may experience, by swallowing with his head downwards, when the descent of the aliment cannot possibly be effected by its weight.\n\nIt is necessary that the nostrils and the lungs should communicate with the mouth, for the purposes of speech and respiration; but if the most minute part of our food happens to be introduced into the trachea, it never fails to produce a violent cough, and sometimes the most alarming symptoms. This is liable to happen when we laugh or speak in the act of deglutition; the food is then said to have passed the wrong way. And indeed this is not improperly expressed: for death would soon follow, if the quantity of aliment introduced into the trachea should be sufficient to obstruct the respiration only during a very short time; or if the irritating particles of food should not soon be thrown up again by means of the cough, which in these cases very feasibly increases in proportion to the degree of irritation.\n\nIf the velum palati did not close the passage to the nostrils, deglutition would be performed with difficulty, and perhaps not at all; for the aliment would return through the nose, as is sometimes the case in drinking. Children, from a deficiency in this velum palati, have been seen to die a few hours after birth; and they who from disease or any other cause have not this part perfect, swallow with difficulty.\n\nThe aliment, after having been sufficiently divided by the action of the teeth, and attenuated by the saliva, is received into the stomach, where it is destined to undergo a more considerable change.\n\nThe properties of the aliment not being much altered at its first entrance into the stomach, and before it is thoroughly blended with the gastric juice, it is capable of irritating the inner coat of the stomach to a certain degree, and occasions a contraction of its two orifices.—In this membranous bag, surrounded by the abdominal viscera, and with a certain degree of natural heat, the aliment undergoes a constant agitation by means of the abdominal muscles and of the diaphragm, and likewise by a certain contraction or expansion of the muscular fibres of the stomach itself. By this motion, every part of the food is exposed to the action of the gastric juice, which gradually divides and attenuates it, and prepares it for its passage into the intestines.\n\nSome observations lately published by Mr Hunter in the Philosophical Transactions tend to throw considerable light on the principles of digestion. There are few dead bodies in which the stomach, at its great end, is not found to be in some degree digested (n). Animals, or parts of animals, possessed of the living principle,\n\n(n) The Abbé Spallanzani, who has written upon digestion, found, from a variety of experiments made upon quadrupeds, birds, and fishes, that digestion goes on for some time after death, though far less considerable than in living animals: but heat is necessary in many animals, or at least promotes it in a much greater degree. He found also, that when the stomach was cut out of the body, it had somewhat of the power of digestion, though this was trifling when compared with that which took place when the stomach was left in the body. In not one of the animals was the great curvature of the stomach diffused, or much eroded after death. There was often a little erosion, especially in different fishes; in which, when he had cleared the stomach of its contents, the internal coat was wanting. In other animals there was only a slight excoriation; and the injury\nprinciple, when taken into the stomach, are not in the least affected by the action of that viscus; but the moment they lose the living principle, they become subject to its digestive powers. This seems to be the case with the stomach, which is enabled to resist the action of its juices in the living body; but when deprived of the living principle, it is then no longer able to resist the powers of that menstruum, which it had itself formed for the digestion of its contents; the process of digestion appearing to be continued after death. This is confirmed by what happens in the stomachs of fishes: They frequently swallow, without mastication, fish which are larger than the digesting parts of their stomach can contain; and in such cases, that part which is taken into the stomach, is more or less dissolved, while that part which remains in the oesophagus is perfectly found; and here, as well as in the human body, the digesting part of the stomach is often reduced to the same state as the digested part of the food. These appearances tend to prove, that digestion is not effected by a mechanical power, by contractions of the stomach, or by heat; but by a fluid secreted in the coats of the stomach, which is poured into its cavity, and there animalizes the food, or affinates it to the nature of blood.\n\nFrom some late experiments by M. Sage*, it appears, that inflammable air has the property of destroying and dissolving the animal texture: And as we swallow with the substances which serve us for food a great quantity of atmospherical air, M. Sage thinks it possible, that deplogiticated, which is its principle, may be converted in the stomach into inflammable air, or may modify into inflammable air a portion of the oily substance which is the principle of aliments. In this case, would not the inflammable air (he asks), by dissolving our food, facilitate its conversion into chyle?\n\nBe this as it may, the food, after having remained one, two, or three hours in the stomach, is converted into a gravy pulp, which is usually called chymus, a word of Greek etymology, signifying juice, and some few milky or chylous particles begin to appear.—But the term of its residence in this bag is proportioned to the nature of the aliment, and to the state of the stomach and its juices. The thinner and more perfectly digested parts of the food pass by a little at a time into the duodenum, through the pylorus, the fibres of which relax to afford it a passage; and the groser and less digested particles remain in the stomach, till they acquire a sufficient fluidity to pass into the intestines, where the nature of the chymus is perfectly changed. The bile and pancreatic juice which flow into the duodenum, and the mucus, which is everywhere distilled from the surface of the intestines, mix themselves with the alimentary pulp, which they still farther attenuate and dissolve, and into which they seem to infuse new properties.\n\nTwo matters very different from each other in their nature and destination, are the result of this combination.—One of these, which is composed of the liquid parts of the aliment, and of some of its more solid particles, extremely divided and mixed with the juices we have described, constitutes a very mild, sweet, and whitish fluid resembling milk, and distinguished by the name of chyle. This fluid is absorbed by the lacteal veins, which convey it into the circulation, where, by being assimilated into the nature of blood, it affords the supply of nutrition, which the continual waste of that body is found to require.—The other is the remains of the alimentary mass deprived of all its nutritious particles, and containing only such parts as were rejected by the absorbing mouths of the lacteals. This groser part, called the faeces, passes on through the course of the intestines, to be voided at the anus, as will be explained hereafter; for this process in the economy cannot be well understood till the motion of respiration has been explained. But the structure of the intestines is a subject which may be properly described in this place, and deserves to be attended to.\n\nIt has been already observed, that the intestinal canal is five or six times as long as the body, and that it forms many circumvolutions in the cavity of the abdomen, which it traverses from the right to the left, and again from the left to the right; in one place descending, and in another extending itself upwards. It was noticed likewise, that the inner coat of the intestines, by being more capacious than their exterior tunics, formed a multitude of piastrs placed at a certain distance from each other, and called valvulae conniventes. Now this disposition will be found to afford a farther proof of that divine wisdom, which the anatomist and physiologist cannot fail to discover in all their pursuits.\n\n—For if the intestinal canal was much shorter than it naturally is; if instead of the present circumvolution, it passed in a direct course from the stomach; and if its inner surface was smooth and destitute of valves; the aliment would consequently pass with great rapidity to the anus, and sufficient time would be wanting to assimilate the chyle, and for the necessary absorption of it into the lacteals: so that the body would be deprived of the supply of nutrition, which is so essential to life and health; but the length and circumvolutions of the intestines, the inequality of their internal surface, and the course of the aliment through them, all concur to perfect the separation of the chyle from the faeces, and to afford the necessary nourishment to the body.\n\n**Sect. XIV. Of the Course of the Chyle, and of the Lymphatic System.**\n\nAn infinite number of very minute vessels, called the lacteal veins, arise like net-work from the inner surface of the intestines (but principally from the jejunum and ileum), which are destined to imbibe the nutritious fluid or chyle. These vessels, which were discovered by Asellius in 1622 (1), pass obliquely through the coats of the abdomen.\n\n---\n\n* Hifi de l'Academie Royale des Sciences, &c., pour 1784, mem. 15.\n\n(1) We are informed by Galen, that the lacteals had been seen in kids by Erasistratus, who considered them as jury in all of them was at the inferior part, or great curvature. The coats of the stomach suffer less after death than flesh, or part of the stomach of familiar animals put into it: The author assigns as a reason for this, that the bodies are invested on all sides by the gastric fluid, whereas it only acts on the internal surface of the stomach.\nOf the intestine, and running along the mesentery, unite as they advance, and form larger branches, all of which pass through the mesenteric or conglomerate glands, which are very numerous in the human subject. As they run between the intestines and these glands, they are styled *venae lacteae primi generis*; but after leaving these glands they are found to be less numerous, and being increased in size, are then called *venae lacteae secundi generis*, which go to deposit their contents in the thoracic duct, through which the chyle is conveyed into the blood.\n\nThe thoracic duct begins about the lower part of the first vertebra lumborum, from whence it passes up by the side of the aorta, between that and the vena azygos, close to the vertebrae, being covered by the pleura. Sometimes it is found divided into two branches; but they usually unite again into one canal, which opens into the left subclavian vein, after having run a little way in an oblique course between its coats. The subclavian vein communicates with the vena cava, which passes to the right auricle of the heart.\n\nThe lower part of this duct being usually larger than any other part of it, has been named *receptaculum chyli*, or Pecquet's receptacle, in honour of the anatomist who first discovered it in 1651. In some quadrupeds, *Hewson's* in turtle and in fish, this enlargement is more considerable in proportion to the size of the duct, than it usually is in the human subject, where it is not commonly found large enough to merit the name of receptaculum.\n\nOpportunities of observing the lacteals in the human subject do not often occur; but they may be easily demonstrated in a dog or any other quadruped that is killed two or three hours after feeding upon milk, for then they appear filled with white chyle.\n\nBut these lacteals which we have described, as passing from the intestines through the mesentery to the thoracic duct, compose only a part of a system of vessels which perform the office of absorption, and which constitute, with their common trunk, the thoracic duct, and the conglomerate glands that are dispersed throughout the body, what may be styled the lymphatic system. So that what is said of the structure of one of these series of vessels may very properly be applied to that of the other.\n\nThe lymphatic veins (*k*) are minute pellucid tubes, lymphatic which, like the lacteals, direct their course towards the vessels centre of the body, where they pour a colourless fluid into the thoracic duct. The lymphatics from all the lower parts of the body gradually unite as they approach this duct, into which they enter by three or four very large trunks, that seem to form the lower extremity of this canal, or *receptaculum chyli*, which may be considered as the great trunk of the lymphatic system. The lacteals open into it near the same place; and the lymphatics, from a large share of the upper parts of the body, pour their lymph into different parts of this duct as it runs upwards, to terminate in the left subclavian vein. The lymphatics from the right side of the neck, thorax, and right arm, &c., terminate in the right subclavian vein.\n\nAs the lymphatics commonly lie close to the large blood vessels, a ligature passed round the crural artery in a living animal, by enclosing the lymphatics, will occasion a diffusion of these vessels below the ligature, so as to demonstrate them with ease; and a ligature passed round the thoracic duct, instantly after killing an animal, will, by stopping the course of its contents into the subclavian vein, dilate not only the lacteals, but also the lymphatics in the abdomen and lower extremities, with their natural fluids (*l*).\n\nThe coats of these vessels are too thin to be separated from each other; but the mercury they are capable of sustaining, proves them to be very strong; and their great power of contraction, after undergoing considerable diffusion, together with the irritability with which Baron Haller found them to be endowed *, seems * Sur le to render it probable, that, like the blood vessels, they movement du sang, Ex. have a muscular coat.\n\nThe lymphatics are nourished after the same manner *295, 298.*\n\n(*k*) The arteries in their course through the body becoming gradually too minute to admit the red globules of the blood, have then been styled capillary or lymphatic arteries. The vessels which are here described as constituting the lymphatic system, were at first supposed to be continued from those arteries, and to convey back the lymph, either into the red veins or the thoracic duct; the office of absorption having been attributed to the red veins. But we know that the lymphatic veins are not continuations of the lymphatic arteries, but that they constitute the absorbent system. There are still, however, some very respectable names among the anatomists of the present age, who contend, that the red veins act likewise as absorbents; but it seems to have been clearly proved, that the red veins do absorb nowhere but in the cavernous cells of the penis, the erection of which is occasioned by a diffusion of those cells with arterial blood.\n\n(*l*) In the dead body they may be easily demonstrated by opening the artery ramifying through any viscus, as in the spleen, for instance, and then throwing in air; by which the lymphatics will be distended. One of them may then be punctured, and mercury introduced into it through a blowpipe.\nChap. III.\n\nANATOMY.\n\nOf all the other parts of the body. For even the most minute of these vessels are probably supplied with still more minute arteries and veins. This seems to be proved by the inflammation of which they are susceptible; and the painful swellings which sometimes take place in lymphatic vessels, prove that they have nerves as well as blood vessels.\n\nBoth the lacteals, lymphatics, and thoracic duct, are furnished with valves, which are much more common in these vessels than in the red veins. These valves are usually in pairs, and serve to promote the course of the chyle and lymph towards the thoracic duct, and to prevent its return. Mention has been made of the glands, through which the lacteals pass in their course through the mesentery; and it is to be observed, that the lymphatics pass through similar glands in their way to the thoracic duct. These glands are all of the conglomerate kind, but the changes which the chyle and lymph undergo in their passage through them, have not yet been ascertained.\n\nThe lymphatic vessels begin from surfaces and cavities in all parts of the body as abfertents. This is a fact now universally allowed; but how the fluids they absorb are poured into those cavities, is a subject of controversy. The contents of the abdomen, for instance, were described as being constantly moistened by a very thin watery fluid. The same thing takes place in the pericardium, pleura, and all the other cavities of the body, and this watery fluid is the lymph. But whether it is exhaled into those cavities through the minute ends of arteries, or transuded through their coats, are the points in dispute. We cannot here be permitted to relate the many ingenious arguments that have been advanced in favour of each of these opinions; nor is it perhaps of consequence to our present purpose to enter into the dispute. It will be sufficient if the reader can form an idea of what the lymph is, and of the manner in which it is absorbed.\n\nThe lymph, from its transparency and want of colour, would seem to be nothing but water; and hence the first discoverers of these vessels styled them ductus aquosus: but experiments prove, that the lymph of a healthy animal coagulates by being exposed to the air, or a certain degree of heat, and likewise by being suffered to rest; seeming to agree in this property with that part of the blood called the coagulable lymph.—This property of the lymph leads to determine its use, in moistening and lubricating the several cavities of the body in which it is found; and for which, by its gelatinous principle, it seems to be much better calculated than a pure and watery fluid would be, for such it has been supposed to be by some anatomists.\n\nThe mouths of the lymphatics and lacteals, by acting as capillary tubes, seem to absorb the lymph and chyle somewhat in the same manner as a capillary tube of glass, when put into a basin of water, is enabled to attract the water into it to a certain height: but it is probable that they likewise possess a living power, which assists in performing this office. In the human body the lymph, or the chyle, is probably conveyed upon this principle as far as the first pair of valves, which seem to be placed not far from the orifice of the absorbing vessel, whether lymphatic or lacteal; and the fluid will then be propelled forwards, by a continuation of the absorption at the orifice. But this does not seem to be the only inducement to its progress towards the thoracic duct; these vessels have probably a muscular coat, which may serve to press the fluid forwards from one pair of valves to another; and as the large lymphatic vessels and the thoracic duct are placed close to the large arteries, which have a considerable pulsation, it is reasonable to suppose, that they derive some advantages from this situation.\n\nSect. XV. Of the Generative Organs; of Conception, &c.\n\n§ I. The Male Organs.\n\nThe male organs of generation have been usually divided into the parts which serve to prepare the semen from the blood, and those which are destined to convey it into the womb. But it seems to be more proper to distinguish them into the preparing, the containing, and the expelling parts, which are the different offices of the testes, the vesiculae seminales, and the penis; and this is the order in which we propose to describe them.\n\nThe testes are two glandular bodies, serving to secrete the semen from the blood. They are originally formed and lodged within the cavity of the abdomen; and it is not till after the child is born, or very near that time, that they begin to pass into the groin, and from thence into the scrotum (m). By this disposition they are very wisely protected from the injuries to which they would be liable to be exposed, from the different positions of the child at the time of parturition.\n\nThe testicles in this state are loosely attached to the pectoral muscles, by means of the peritoneum by which they are covered; and they are at this time of life connected in a very particular manner to the parietes of the abdomen, and likewise to the scrotum, by means of a substance which Mr Hunter calls the ligament or gubernaculum testis, because it connects the testis with the scrotum,\n\n(m) It sometimes happens in dissecting ruptures, that the intestine is found in the same sac, and in contact with the testis. This appearance was at first attributed to a supposed laceration of the peritoneum; but later observations, by pointing out the situation of the testicles in the fetus, have led to prove, that the testis, as it descends into the scrotum, carries with it a portion or elongation of the peritoneum, which becomes its tunica vaginalis, or a kind of sac, in which the testicle is lodged, as will be explained in the course of this section. The communication between this sac and the cavity of the abdomen is usually soon cut off; but in some subjects it continues open during life; and when a hernia or descent of the intestine takes place in such a subject, it does not pull down a portion of the peritoneum before it, as it must otherwise necessarily do, but passes at once through this opening, and comes in contact with the naked testicle, constituting that particular species of rupture called hernia congenita.\nOf the scrotum, and directs its course in its descent. This gubernaculum is of a pyramidal form, with its bulbous head fixed to the lower end of the testis and epididymis, and loses its lower and slender extremity in the cellular membrane of the scrotum. It is difficult to ascertain what the structure and composition of this gubernaculum is, but it is certainly vascular and fibrous; and from certain circumstances, it would seem to be in part composed of the cremaster muscle, running upwards to join the lower end of the testis.\n\nWe are not to suppose that the testicle, when descended into the scrotum, is to be seen loose as a piece of gut or omentum would be in a common hernial sac. We have already observed, that during its residence in the cavity of the abdomen it is attached to the peritoneum, which descends with it; so that when the sac is completed in the scrotum, the testicle is at first attached only to the posterior part of it, while the fore part of it lies loose, and for some time affords a communication with the abdomen. The spermatic chord, which is made up of the spermatic artery and vein, and of the vas deferens or excretory duct of the testis, is closely attached behind to the posterior part of this elongation of the peritoneum. But the fore part of the peritoneal sac, which is at first loose and not attached to the testicle, closes after a certain time, and becomes united to the posterior part, and thus perfectly surrounds the testicle as it were in a purse.\n\nThe testicles of the fetus differ only in their size and situation from those of the adult. In their passage from the abdomen they descend through the abdominal rings into the scrotum, where they are supported and defended by various integuments.\n\nWhat the immediate cause of this descent is, has not yet been satisfactorily determined. It has been ascribed to the effects of respiration, but the testicles have sometimes been found in the scrotum before the child has breathed; and it does not seem to be occasioned by the action of the cremaster muscle, because the same effect would be liable to happen in the hedgehog and some other quadrupeds, whose testicles remain in the abdomen during life.\n\nThe scrotum, which is the external or common covering of both testicles, is a kind of sac formed by the common integuments, and externally divided into two equal parts by a prominent line called raphe.\n\nIn the inner part of the scrotum we meet with a cellular coat called dartos (n), which by its duplicature divides the scrotum into two equal parts, and forms what is called septum foro, which corresponds with the raphe. The collapse which is so often observed to take place in the scrotum of the healthy subject, when excited by cold or by the stimulus of venery, seems to be very properly attributed to the contractile motion of the skin, and not to any muscular fibres, as is the case in dogs and some other quadrupeds.\n\nThe scrotum, then, by means of its septum, is found to make two distinct bags, in which the testicles, invested by their proper tunics, are securely lodged and separated from each other. These coats are the cremaster, the tunica vaginalis, and the tunica albuginea. The first of these is composed of muscular fibres, and is to be considered only as a partial covering of the testis; for it surrounds only the spermatic chord, and terminates upon the upper and external parts of the tunica vaginalis testis, serving to draw up and suspend the testicle (o). The tunica vaginalis testis has already been described as being a thin production of the peritoneum loosely adhering everywhere to the testicle, which it includes as it were in a bag. The tunica albuginea is a firm, white, and very compact membrane of a glistering appearance, which immediately invests the body of the testis and the epididymis; serving in some measure to connect them to each other, but without extending itself at all to the spermatic chord. This tunica albuginea serves to confine the growth of the testis and epididymis within certain limits, and by giving them a due degree of firmness, enables them to perform their proper functions.\n\nHaving removed this last tunic, we discover the substance of the testicle itself, which appears to be made up of an infinite number of very elastic filaments, which may be best distinguished after macerating the testicle in water. Each testicle is made up of the spermatic artery and vein, and the excretory vessels or tubuli feminiferi. There are likewise a great number of absorbent vessels, and some branches of nerves to be met with in the testicles.\n\nThe spermatic arteries arise one on each side from the aorta, generally about an inch below the eminence. The right spermatic vein commonly passes into the vena cava; but the left spermatic vein usually empties itself into the eminence on that side; and it is supposed to take this course into the eminence, that it may avoid passing over the aorta, which it would be obliged to do in its way to the vena cava.\n\nThe blood is circulated very slowly through the spermatic artery, which makes an infinite number of circumvolutions in the substance of the testicle, where it deposits the semen, which passes through the tubuli feminiferi. These tubuli feminiferi are seen running in short waves from the tunica albuginea to the axis of the testicle; and are divided into distinct portions by certain thin membranous productions, which originate from the tunica albuginea. They at length unite, and by an infinite number of convolutions form a sort of appendix to the testicle called epididymis (p), which is\n\n(n) The dartos has usually been considered as a muscle, and is described as such both by Douglas and Winiford. But there being no part of the scrotum of the human subject which can be said to consist of muscular fibres, Albinus and Haller have very properly omitted to describe the dartos as a muscle, and consider it merely as a cellular coat.\n\n(o) The cremaster muscle is composed of a few fibres from the obliquus internus abdominis, which uniting with a few from the transversalis, descend upon the spermatic chord, and are inseparably lost upon the tunica vaginalis of the testicle. It serves to suspend and draw up the testicle.\n\n(p) The testicles were named didymi by the ancients; and the name of this part was given to it on account of its situation upon the testicle.\nA VALENTAR BODY OF AN OBLONG SHAPE, SITUATED UPON THE SUPERIOR PART OF EACH TEPLICLE. THESE TUBULI OF THE EPIDYDDYMS AT LENGTH FORM AN EXCRETORY DUCT CALLED VAS DEFERENS, WHICH ASCENDS TOWARDS THE ABDOMINAL RINGS, WITH THE OTHER PARTS THAT MAKE UP THE SPERMATIC CHORD, AND THEN A SEPARATION TAKES PLACE; THE NERVES AND BLOOD VEILLES PASSING ON TO THEIR SEVERAL TERMINATIONS, AND THE VAS DEFERENS GOING TO DEPOSIT ITS SEMEN IN THE VESICULA SEMINALE, WHICH ARE TWO SOFT BODIES OF A WHITE AND CONVOLUTED APPEARANCE EXTERNALLY, SITUATED OBLIQUELY BETWEEN THE RECTUM AND THE LOWER PART OF THE BLADDER, AND UNITING TOGETHER AT THE LOWER EXTREMITY. FROM THESE RESERVOIRS (Q), WHICH ARE PLENTIFULLY SUPPLIED WITH BLOOD VEILLES AND NERVES, THE SEMEN IS OCCASIONALLY DISCHARGED THROUGH TWO SHORT PASSAGES, WHICH OPEN INTO THE URETHRA CLOSE TO A LITTLE EMINENCE CALLED VERUMONTANUM.\n\nNEAR THIS EMINENCE WE MEET WITH THE PROSTATE, WHICH IS SITUATED AT THE NECK OF THE BLADDER, AND IS DESCRIBED AS BEING OF A GLANDULAR STRUCTURE. IT IS SHAPED SOMEWHAT LIKE A HEART WITH ITS SMALL END FOREMOST, AND INVESTS THE ORIGIN OF THE URETHRA. INTERNALLY IT APPEARS TO BE OF A FIRM SUBSTANCE, AND COMPOSED OF SEVERAL FOLLICLES, SECRETING A WHITE VIScid FLUID, THAT IS DISCHARGED BY TEN OR TWELVE EXCRETORY DUCTS INTO THE URETHRA, ON EACH SIDE OF THE OPENINGS OF THE VESICULA SEMINALE AT THE SAME TIME, AND FROM THE SAME CAUSES THAT THE SEMEN IS EXPULLED. AS THIS LATTER FLUID IS FOUND TO BE EXCEEDINGLY LIMPID IN THE VESICULA SEMINALE OF THE DEAD SUBJECT, IT PROBABLY OWES ITS WHITENESS AND VISCIDITY TO THIS LIQUOR OF THE PROSTATE.\n\nTHE PENIS, WHICH IS TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE VEHICLE OR ACTIVE ORGAN OF PROCREATION, IS COMPOSED OF TWO COLUMNS, THE CORPORA CAVERNOSA AND CORPUS SPONGIOSUM. THE CORPORA CAVERNOSA, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE GREATEST PART OF THE PENIS, MAY BE DESCRIBED AS TWO CYLINDRICAL LIGAMENTOUS TUBES, EACH OF WHICH IS COMPOSED OF AN INFINITE NUMBER OF MINUTE CELLS OF A SPONGY TEXTURE, WHICH COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. THESE TWO BODIES ARE OF A VERY PLIANT TEXTURE, AND CAPABLE OF CONSIDERABLE DISTENSION; AND BEING UNITED LATERALLY TO EACH OTHER, OCCASION BY THIS UNION A SPACE ABOVE AND ANOTHER BELOW. THE UPPERMOST OF THESE SPACES IS FILLED BY THE BLOOD VEILLES, AND THE LOWER ONE, WHICH IS LARGE THAN THE OTHER, BY THE URETHRA AND ITS CORPUS SPONGIOSUM. THESE TWO CAVERNOSUS BODIES ARE AT FIRST ONLY SEPARATED.\n\n(Q) THAT THE BAGS CALLED VESICULA SEMINALE ARE RESERVOIRS OF SEMEN, IS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAS BEEN BY ANATOMISTS UNIVERSALLY BELIEVED. MR J. HUNTER, HOWEVER, FROM SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES, HAS BEEN INDUCED TO THINK THIS OPINION ERRONEOUS.\n\nHE HAS EXAMINED THESE VESICULA IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED SUDDENLY, AND HE FOUND THEIR CONTENTS TO BE DIFFERENT IN THEIR PROPERTIES FROM THE SEMEN. IN THOSE WHO HAD LOST ONE OF THE TEPLICLES, OR THE USE OF ONE OF THEM, BY DISEASE, BOTH THE VESICULA WERE FULL, AND THEIR CONTENTS SIMILAR. AND IN A LUSUS NATURAE, WHERE THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE VASA DEFERENTIA AND VESICULA, NOR BETWEEN THE VESICULAR AND PENIS, THE SAME THING TOOK PLACE.\n\nFROM THESE OBSERVATIONS, HE THINKS WE HAVE A PRELIMINARY PROOF, THAT THE SEMEN CAN BE ABSORBED IN THE BODY OF THE TEPLICLE AND IN THE EPIDYDDYMS, AND THAT THE VESICULA SECRETE A MUCUS WHICH THEY ARE CAPABLE OF ABSORBING WHEN IT CANNOT BE MADE USE OF: THAT THE SEMEN IS NOT RETAINED IN RESERVOIRS AFTER IT IS SECRETED, AND KEPT THERE TILL IT IS USED; BUT THAT IT IS SECRETED AT THE TIME IN CONSEQUENCE OF CERTAIN AFFECTIONS OF THE MIND STIMULATING THE TEPLICLES TO THIS ACTION.\n\nHE CORROBORATES HIS OBSERVATIONS BY THE APPEARANCE ON DEFECATION IN OTHER ANIMALS; AND HERE HE FINDS, THAT THE SHAPE AND CONTENTS OF THE VESICULA VARY MUCH IN DIFFERENT ANIMALS, WHILE THE SEMEN IN MOST OF THEM HE HAS EXAMINED IS NEARLY THE SAME: THAT THE VASA DEFERENTIA IN MANY ANIMALS DO NOT COMMUNICATE WITH THE VESICULA; THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE VESICULA OF CASTRATED AND PERFECT ANIMALS ARE SIMILAR, AND NEARLY EQUAL IN QUANTITY, IN NO WAY RESEMBLING THE SEMEN AS EMITTED FROM THE ANIMAL IN COITUS, OR WHAT IS FOUND IN THE VAS DEFERENS AFTER DEATH. HE OBSERVES LIKEWISE, THAT THE BULB OF THE URETHRA OF PERFECT MALES IS CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN IN CASTRATED ANIMALS.\n\nFROM THE WHOLE, HE THINKS THE FOLLOWING INFERENCES MAY BE FAIRLY DRAWN: THAT THE BAGS CALLED VESICULA SEMINALE ARE NOT SEMINAL RESERVOIRS, BUT GLANDS SECRETING Apecular MUCUS; AND THAT THE BULB OF THE URETHRA IS PROPERLY SPEAKING THE RECEPTACLE OF THE SEMEN, IN WHICH IT IS ACCUMULATED PREVIOUS TO EJECTION.\n\nBUT ALTHOUGH HE HAS ENDEAVOURED TO PROVE THAT THE VESICULA DO NOT CONTAIN THE SEMEN, HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THEIR PARTICULAR USE. HE THINKS, HOWEVER, WE MAY BE ALLOWED UPON THE WHOLE TO CONCLUDE, THAT THEY ARE, TOGETHER WITH OTHER PARTS, SUBSERVIENT TO THE PURPOSES OF GENERATION.\n\nALTHOUGH THE AUTHOR HAS TREATED THIS SUBJECT VERY ABLY, AND MADE MANY INGENIOUS OBSERVATIONS, SOME THINGS MAY BE OBJECTION TO WHAT HE HAS ADVANCED; OF WHICH THE FOLLOWING ARE A FEW: THAT THOSE ANIMALS WHO HAVE BAGS CALLED VESICULA SEMINALE PERFORM COITATION QUICKLY; WHEREAS OTHERS THAT WANT THEM, AS THE DOG KIND, ARE TEDIOUS IN COITATION: THAT IN THE HUMAN BODY, AT LEAST, THERE IS A FREE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE VASA DEFERENTIA AND VESICULA; AND IN ANIMALS WHERE THE AUTHOR HAS OBSERVED NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE VASA DEFERENTIA AND VESICULA, THERE MAY BE A COMMUNICATION BY VEILLES NOT YET DISCOVERED, AND WHICH MAY BE COMPARED TO THE HEPATO-CYLIC DUCTS IN FOWLS AND FISHES: THAT THE FLUID IN THE END OF THE VASA DEFERENTIA AND THE VESICULA SEMINALE ARE SIMILAR, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR'S OWN OBSERVATION: THAT THE VESICULA IN SOME ANIMALS INCREASE AND DECREASE WITH THE TEPLICLE AT PARTICULAR SEASONS: THAT IN BIRDS AND CERTAIN FISHES, THERE IS A DILATATION OF THE ENDS OF THE VASA DEFERENTIA, WHICH THE AUTHOR HIMSELF ALLOWS TO BE A RESERVOIR FOR THE SEMEN.\n\nWITH RESPECT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE BULB OF THE URETHRA ANSWERING THE PURPOSE OF A RESERVOIR, THE AUTHOR HAS MENTIONED NO FACTS WHICH TEND TO ESTABLISH THIS OPINION. SEE OBSERVATIONS ON CERTAIN PARTS OF THE ANIMAL ECONOMY.\nANATOMY.\n\nThe arteries of the penis are chiefly derived from the internal iliacs. Some of them are supposed to terminate by pabulous orifices within the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum; and others terminate in veins, which at last make up the vena magna dorsi penis, and other smaller veins, which are in general distributed in like order with the arteries.\n\nIts nerves are large and numerous. They arise from the great sciatic nerve, and accompany the arteries in their course through the penis.\n\nWe have now described the anatomy of this organ; and there only remains to be explained, how it is enabled to attain that degree of firmness and distention which is essential to the great work of generation.\n\nThe greatest part of the penis has been spoken of as being of a spongy and cellular texture, plentifully supplied with blood vessels and nerves, and as having muscles to move it in different directions. Now, the blood is constantly passing into its cells through the small branches of the arteries which open into them, and is from thence as constantly returned by the veins, so long as the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum continue to be in a relaxed and pliant state. But when, from any nervous influence, or other means which it is not necessary here to define or explain, the erectores penis, ejaculatores feminis, levatores ani, &c., are induced to contract, the veins undergo a certain degree of compression, and the passage of the blood through them is so much impeded, that it collects in them in a greater proportion than they are enabled to carry off, so that the penis gradually enlarges, and being more and more forcibly drawn up against the os pubis, the vena magna itself is at length compressed, and the penis becomes fully distended. But as the causes which first occasioned this distention subside, the penis gradually returns to its state of relaxation.\n\n§ 2. Female Organs of Generation.\n\nAnatomical writers usually divide the female organs of generation into external and internal. In the first division they include the mons veneris, labia pudendi, perineum, clitoris, nymphæ, and caruncula myrtiformis; and in the latter, the vagina, with the uterus and its appendages.\n\nThe mons veneris, which is placed on the upper part of the symphysis pubis, is internally composed of adipose membranes, which makes it soft and prominent; it divides into two parts called labia pudendi, which descending towards the rectum, from which they are divided by the perineum, form what is called the fourchette. The perineum is that fleshy space which extends about an inch and a half from the fourchette to the anus, and from thence about two inches to the coccyx.\n\nThe labia pudendi being separated, we observe a fulcus called fossa magna; in the upper part of which is placed the clitoris, a small round spongy body, in some measure resembling the male penis, but impervious, composed of two corpora cavernosa, arising from the tubercles of the osseous; furnished with two pair of\n\n(r) Both Heister and Morgagni observe, that they have sometimes not been able to find these glands; so that they do not seem to exist in all subjects.\nOf muscles, the erectores clitoridis, and the sphincter or contrictor osii vaginae; and terminating in a glans, which is covered with its prepuce. From the lower part, on each side of the fossa, pass the nymphae, two membranous and fleshy folds which seem destined for useful purposes in parturition, by tending to enlarge the volume of the vagina as the child's head passes through it. Between these, about the middle of the fossa magna, we perceive the orifice of the vagina or os externum, closed by folds and wrinkles; and about half an inch above this, and about an inch below the clitoris, appears the meatus urinarius or orifice of the urethra, much shorter, though somewhat larger, than in men, with a little prominence at its lower edge, which facilitates the introduction of the catheter.\n\nThe os externum is surrounded internally by several membranous folds called carunculae myrtiformes, which are partly the remains of a thin membrane called hymen, that covers the vagina in children. In general the hymen is sufficiently open to admit the passage of the menes, if it exists at the time of their appearance; sometimes, however, it has been found perfectly closed.\n\nThe vagina, situated between the urethra and the rectum, is a membranous cavity, surrounded, especially at its external extremity, with a fleshy and vascular substance, which is covered by the sphincter osii vaginae. It terminates in the uterus, about half an inch above the os tineae, and is wider and shorter in women who have had children than in virgins.\n\nAll these parts are plentifully supplied with blood vessels and nerves. Around the nymphae there are sebaceous follicles, which pour out a fluid to lubricate the inner surface of the vagina; and the meatus urinarius, like the urethra in the male subject, is constantly moistened by a mucus, which defends it against the acrimony of the urine.\n\nThe uterus is a hollow viscus, situated in the hypogastric region, between the rectum and bladder. It is destined to receive the first rudiments of the fetus, and to assist in the development of all its parts, till it arrives at a state of perfection, and is fitted to enter into the world, at the time appointed by the wise Author of nature.\n\nThe uterus, in its unimpregnated state, resembles a pear in shape, somewhat flattened, with its fundus or bottom part turned towards the abdomen, and its cervix or neck surrounded by the vagina. The entrance into its cavity forms a little protuberance, which has been compared to the mouth of a tent, and is therefore called os tineae.\n\nThe substance of the uterus, which is of considerable thickness, appears to be composed of muscular and small ligamentous fibres, small branches of nerves, some lymphatics, and with arteries and veins innumerable. Its nerves are chiefly derived from the intercostal, and its arteries and veins from the hypogastric and peritoneal. The membrane which lines its cervix is a continuation of the inner membrane of the vagina; but the outer surface of the body of the uterus is covered with the peritoneum, which is reflected over it, and descends from thence to the intestine rectum. This duplicature of the peritoneum, by passing off from the sides of the uterus to the sides of the pelvis, is there firmly connected, and forms what are called ligamenta uteri latae; which not only serve to support the uterus, but to convey nerves and blood vessels to it.\n\nThe ligamenta uteri rotunda arise from the sides of the fundus uteri, and passing along within the fore part of the ligamenta latae, descend through the abdominal rings, and terminate in the substance of the mons veneris. The substance of these ligaments is vascular; and although both they and the ligamenta latae admit the uterus, in the virgin state, to move only about an inch up and down, yet in the course of pregnancy they admit of considerable dilatation, and after parturition return nearly to their original state with surprising quickness.\n\nOn each side of the inner surface of the uterus, in the angle near the fundus, a small orifice is to be discovered, which is the beginning of one of the tubes Fallopianae. Each of these tubes, which are two in number, passing through the substance of the uterus, is extended along the broad ligaments, till it reaches the edge of the pelvis, from whence it reflects back; and turning over behind the ligaments, about an inch of its extremity is seen hanging loose in the pelvis, near the ovarium. These extremities, having a jagged appearance, are called fimbriae, or morbus diaboli. Each tube Fallopiana is usually about three or four inches long. Their cavities are at first very small, but become gradually larger, like a trumpet, as they approach the fimbriae.\n\nNear the fimbriae of each tube Fallopiana, about an inch from the uterus, is situated an oval body called ovarium, of about half the size of the male testicle. Each of these ovaria is covered by a production of the peritoneum, and hangs loose in the pelvis. They are of a flat and angular form, and appear to be composed of a white and cellular substance, in which we are able to discover several minute vesicles filled with a coagulable lymph, of an uncertain number, commonly exceeding 12 in each ovary. In the female of riper years, these vesicles become exceedingly turgid, and a kind of yellow coagulum is gradually formed within one of them, which increases for a certain time. In conception, one of these mature ova is supposed to be impregnated with the male semen, and to be squeezed out of its nidus into the Fallopian tube; after which the ruptured part forms a substance which in some animals is of a yellow colour, and is therefore called corpus luteum; and it is observable, that the number of these scars or fissures in the ovarium, constantly corresponds with the number of fetuses excluded by the mother.\n\n§ 3. Of Conception.\n\nMan, being ever curious and inquisitive, has naturally been led to inquire after the origin of his existence; and the subject of generation has employed the philosophical world in all ages; but in following nature up to her minute recesses, the philosopher soon finds himself bewildered, and his imagination often supplies that which he so eagerly wishes to discover, but which is destined perhaps never to be revealed to him. Of the many theories which have been formed on this subject, that of the ancient philosophers seems to have been the most simple: they considered the male semen as alone capable of forming the fetus, and believed\nbelieved that the female only afforded it a lodging in the womb, and supplied it with nourishment after it was perfectly formed. This opinion, however, soon gave place to another, in which the female was allowed a more considerable share in conception.\n\nThis second system considered the fetus as being formed by the mixture of the seminal liquor of both sexes, by a certain arrangement of its several particles in the uterus. But in the 16th century, vehicles or eggs were discovered in the ovaria or female follicles; the fetus had been found sometimes in the abdomen, and sometimes in the Fallopian tubes; and the two former opinions were exploded in favour of a new doctrine. The ovaria were compared to a bunch of grapes, being supposed to consist of vehicles, each of which had a stalk; so that it might be disengaged without hurting the rest, or spilling the liquor it contained. Each vehicle was said to include a little animal, almost complete in all its parts; and the vapour of the male semen being conveyed to the ovarium, was supposed to produce a fermentation in the vehicle, which approached the nearest to maturity; and thus inducing it to disengage itself from the ovarium, it passed into the tuba Fallopiana, through which it was conveyed to the uterus. Here it was supposed to take root like a vegetable seed, and to form with the vessels originating from the uterus, what is called the placenta; by means of which the circulation is carried on between the mother and the fetus.\n\nThis opinion, with all its absurdities, continued to be almost universally adopted till the close of the same century, when Leeuwenhoek, by means of his glasses, discovered certain opaque particles, which he described as so many animalcula, floating in the seminal fluid of the male.\n\nThis discovery introduced a new scheme among the philosophers of that time, and gave rise to a system which is not yet entirely exploded. According to this theory, the male semen passing into the tubae Fallopiae, one of the animalcula penetrates into the substance of the ovarium, and enters into one of its vehicles or ova. This impregnated ovum is then squeezed from its husk, through the coats of the ovarium, and being seized by the fimbriae, is conducted through the tube to the uterus, where it is nourished till it arrives at a state of perfection. In this system there is much ingenuity; but there are certain circumstances supposed to take place, which have been hitherto inexplicable. A celebrated modern writer, M. Buffon, endeavours to restore, in some measure, the most ancient opinion, by allowing the female semen a share in this office; asserting, that animalcula or organic particles are to be discovered in the seminal liquor of both sexes: he derives the female semen from the ovaria, and he contends that no ovum exists in those parts. But in this idea he is evidently mistaken; and the opinion now most generally adopted is, that an impregnation of the ovum, by the influence of the male semen, is essential to conception. That the ovum is to be impregnated, there can be no doubt; but as the manner in which such an impregnation is supposed to take place, and the means by which the ovum afterwards gets into the Fallopian tube, and from thence into the uterus, are still founded chiefly on hypotheses, we will not attempt to extend farther the investigation of a subject concerning which so little can be advanced with certainty.\n\n§ 4. Of the Fetus in Utero.\n\nOpportunities of effecting the human gravid uterus occurring but seldom, the state of the embryo immediately after conception cannot be perfectly known.\n\nWhen the ovum descends into the uterus, it is supposed to be very minute; and it is not till a considerable time after conception that the rudiments of the embryo begin to be ascertained.\n\nAbout the third or fourth week the eye may discover the first lineaments of the fetus; but these lineaments are as yet very imperfect, it being only about the size of a house fly. Two little vehicles appear in an almost transparent jelly; the largest of which is destined to become the head of the fetus, and the other smaller one is reserved for the trunk. But at this period no extremities are to be seen; the umbilical cord appears only as a very minute thread, and the placenta does not as yet absorb the red particles of the blood. At six weeks, not only the head, but the features of the face, begin to be developed. The nose appears like a small prominent line, and we are able to discover another line under it, which is defined for the separation of the lips. Two black points appear in the place of eyes, and two minute holes mark the ears. At the sides of the trunk, both above and below, we see four minute protuberances, which are the rudiments of the arms and legs. At the end of eight weeks the body of the fetus is upwards of an inch in length, and both the hands and feet are to be distinguished. The upper extremities are found to increase faster than the lower ones, and the separation of the fingers is accomplished sooner than that of the toes.\n\nAt this period the human form may be decisively ascertained; all the parts of the face may be distinguished, the shape of the body is clearly marked out, the haunches and the abdomen are elevated, the fingers and toes are separated from each other, and the intellects appear like minute threads.\n\nAt the end of the third month, the fetus measures about three inches; at the end of the fourth month, five inches; in the fifth month, six or seven inches; in the sixth month, eight or nine inches; in the seventh month, eleven or twelve inches; in the eighth month, fourteen or fifteen inches; and at the end of the ninth month, or full time, from eighteen to twenty-two inches. But as we have not an opportunity of examining the same fetus at different periods of pregnancy, and as their size and length may be influenced by the constitution and mode of life of the mother, calculations of this kind must be very uncertain.\n\nThe fetus during all this time assumes an oval figure,\n\n(s) The rudiments of the child are usually distinguished by this name till the human figure can be distinctly ascertained, and then it has the appellation of fetus.\ngure, which corresponds with the shape of the uterus. Its chin is found reclining on its breast with its knees drawn up towards its chin, and its arms folded over them. But it seems likely, that the posture of some of these parts is varied in the latter months of pregnancy, so as to cause those painful twitches which its mother usually feels from time to time. In natural cases, its head is probably placed towards the os uteri from the time of conception to that of its birth; though formerly it was considered as being placed towards the fundus uteri till about the eighth or ninth month, when the head, by becoming specifically heavier than the other parts of the body, was supposed to be turned downwards.\n\nThe capacity of the uterus increases in proportion to the growth of the fetus, but without becoming thinner in its substance, as might naturally be expected. The nourishment of the fetus, during all this time, seems to be derived from the placenta, which appears to be originally formed by that part of the ovum which is next the fundus uteri. The remaining part of the ovum is covered by a membrane called spongy chorion (τ); within which is another called true chorion, which includes a third termed amnios (υ): this contains a watery fluid, which is the liquor amnii (ν), in which the fetus floats till the time of its birth. On the side next the fetus, the placenta is covered by the amnios and true chorion; on the side next the mother it has a production continued from the spongy chorion. The amnios and chorion are remarkably thin and transparent, having no blood vessels entering into their composition. The spongy chorion is opaque and vascular.\n\nIn the first months of pregnancy, the involucra bear a large proportion to their contents; but this proportion is afterwards reversed, as the fetus increases in bulk.\n\nThe placenta, which is the medium through which the blood is conveyed from the mother to the fetus, and the manner in which this conveyance takes place, deserves next to be considered.\n\nThe placenta is a broad, flat, and spongy substance, like a cake, closely adhering to the inner surface of the womb, usually near the fundus, and appearing to be chiefly made up of the ramifications of the umbilical arteries and vein, and partly of the extremities of the uterine vessels. The arteries of the uterus discharge their contents into the substance of this cake; and the veins of the placenta, receiving the blood either by a direct communication of vessels, or by absorption, at length form the umbilical vein, which passes on to the sinus of the vena portae, and from thence to the vena cava, by means of the canalis venosus, a communication that is closed in the adult. But the circulation of the blood through the heart is not conducted in the fetus as in the adult; in the latter, the blood is carried from the right auricle of the heart through the pulmonary artery, and is returned to the left auricle by the pulmonary vein; but a dilatation of the lungs is essential to the passage of the blood through the pulmonary vessels, and this dilatation cannot take place till after the child is born and has respired. This deficiency, however, is supplied in the fetus by an immediate communication between the right and left auricle, through an oval opening, in the septum which divides the two auricles, called foramen ovale. The blood is likewise transmitted from the pulmonary artery to the aorta, by means of a duct called canalis arteriosus, which, like the canalis venosus, and foramen ovale, gradually closes after birth.\n\nThe blood is returned again from the fetus through two arteries called the umbilical arteries, which arise from the iliacs. These two vessels taking a winding course with the vein, form with that, and the membranes by which they are surrounded, what is called the umbilical chord. These arteries, after ramifying through the substance of the placenta, discharge their blood into the veins of the uterus; in the same manner as the uterine arteries discharged their blood into the branches of the umbilical vein. So that the blood is constantly passing in at one side of the placenta and out at the other; but in what particular manner it gets through the placenta is a point not yet determined.\n\n(τ) Dr Hunter has described this as a lamella from the inner surface of the uterus. In the latter months of pregnancy it becomes gradually thinner and more connected with the chorion: he has named it membrana caduca, or decidua, as it is cast off with the placenta. Signior Scarpa, with more probability, considers it as being composed of an inspissated coagulable lymph.\n\n(υ) In some quadrupeds, the urine appears to be conveyed from the bladder through a canal called urachus to the allantois, which is a reservoir, resembling a long and blind gut, situated between the chorion and amnios. The human fetus seems to have no such reservoir, though some writers have supposed that it does exist. From the top of the bladder a few longitudinal fibres are extended to the umbilical chord; and these fibres have been considered as the urachus, though without having been ever found pervious.\n\n(ν) The liquor amnii coagulates like the lymph. It has been supposed to pass into the oesophagus, and to afford nourishment to the fetus; but this does not seem probable. Children have come into the world without an oesophagus, or any communication between the stomach and the mouth; but there has been no well attested instance of a child's having been born without a placenta; and it does not seem likely, that any of the fluid can be absorbed through the pores of the skin, the skin in the fetus being everywhere covered with a great quantity of mucus.\nEXPLANATION OF PLATES XXVII, XXVIII, AND XXIX.\n\nPLATE XXVII.\n\nFig. 1.

OF THE THORAX.\n\nTHE thorax, or chest, is that cavity of the trunk which extends from the clavicles, or the lower part of the neck, to the diaphragm; and includes the vital organs, which are the heart and lungs, and likewise the trachea and oesophagus.—This cavity is formed by the ribs and vertebrae of the back, covered by a great number of muscles, and by the common integuments, and anteriorly by two glandular bodies called the breasts. The spaces between the ribs are filled up by muscular fibres, which from their situation are called intercostal muscles.\n\nSect. I. Of the Breasts.\n\nThe breasts may be defined to be two large conglomerate glands, mixed with a good deal of adipose membrane. The glandular part is composed of an infinite number of minute arteries, veins, and nerves.\n\nThe arteries are derived from two different trunks; one of which is called the internal, and the other the external, mammary artery. The first of these arises from the subclavian, and the latter from the axillary.\n\nThe veins everywhere accompany the arteries, and are distinguished by the same name. The nerves are chiefly from the vertebral pairs. Like all other conglomerate glands, the breasts are made up of a great many small distinct glands, in which the milk is secreted from the ultimate branches of arteries. The excretory ducts of these several glands, gradually uniting as they approach the nipple, form the tubuli lactiferi, which are usually more than a dozen in number, and open at its apex, but have little or no communication, as has been supposed, at the root of the nipple. These ducts, in their course from the glands, are surrounded by a ligamentary elastic substance, which terminates with them in the nipple. Both this substance, and the ducts which it contains, are capable of considerable extension and contraction; but in their natural state are moderately corrugated, so as to prevent an involuntary flow of milk, unless the diffusing force be very great from the accumulation of too great a quantity.\n\nThe whole substance of the nipple is very spongy and elastic: its external surface is uneven, and full of small tubercles. The nipple is surrounded with a disk or circle of a different colour, called the areola; and on the inside of the skin, under the areola, are many sebaceous glands, which pour out a mucus to defend the areola and nipple; for the skin upon these parts is very thin; and the nervous papillae lying very bare, are much exposed to irritation.\n\nThe breasts are formed for the secretion of milk, which is destined for the nourishment of the child for some time after its birth. This secretion begins to take place soon after delivery, and continues to flow for many months in very large quantities, if the woman suckles her child.\n\nThe operation of suction depends on the principles of the air pump, and the flow of milk through the lactiferous tubes is facilitated by their being stretched out.\n\nThe milk, examined chemically, appears to be composed of oil, mucilage, and water, and of a considerable quantity of sugar. The generality of physiologists have supposed that, like the chyle, it frequently retains the properties of the aliment and medicines taken into the stomach; but from some late experiments*, this supposition appears to be ill founded.\n\nSect. II. Of the Pleura.\n\nThe cavity of the thorax is everywhere lined by a membrane of a firm texture called pleura. It is composed of two distinct portions or bags, which, by being applied to each other laterally, form a septum called mediastinum; which divides the cavity into two parts, and is attached posteriorly to the vertebrae of the back, and anteriorly to the sternum. But the two laminae of which this septum is formed, do not everywhere adhere to each other; for at the lower part of the thorax they are separated to afford a lodgment to the heart; and at the upper part of the cavity, they receive between them the thymus.\n\nThe pleura is plentifully supplied with arteries and veins from the internal mammary and the intercostals. Its nerves, which are very inconsiderable, are derived chiefly from the dorsal and intercostal nerves.\n\nThe surface of the pleura, like that of the peritoneum and other membranes lining cavities, is constantly bedewed with a feros moiture (w), which prevents adhesions of the viscera.\n\nThe mediastinum, by dividing the breast into two cavities, obviates many inconveniences, to which we should otherwise be liable. It prevents the two lobes of the lungs from compressing each other when we lie on one side; and consequently contributes to the freedom of respiration, which is disturbed by the least prelure on the lungs. If the point of a sword penetrates between the ribs into the cavity of the thorax, the lungs on that side cease to perform their office; because the air being admitted through the wound, prevents the dilatation of that lobe; while the other lobe, which is separated from it by the mediastinum, remains unhurt, and continues to perform its function as usual.\n\nSect. III. Of the Thymus.\n\nThe thymus is a glandular substance, the use of which is not perfectly ascertained, its excretory duct not\n\n(w) When this fluid is exhaled in too great a quantity, or is not properly carried off, it accumulates and constitutes the hydrops pectoris.\nnot having yet been discovered. It is of an oblong figure, and is larger in the fetus and in young children than in adults, being sometimes nearly effaced in very old subjects. It is placed in the upper part of the thorax, between the two laminae of the mediastinum; but at first is not altogether contained within the cavity of the chest, being found to border upon the upper extremity of the sternum.\n\n**Sect. IV. Of the Diaphragm.**\n\nThe cavity of the thorax is separated from that of the abdomen by a fleety and membranous septum called the diaphragm or mudriff. The greatest part of it is composed of muscular fibres; and on this account systematic writers usually place it very properly among the muscles. Its middle part is tendinous, and it is covered by the pleura above, and by the peritoneum below. It seems to have been improperly named septum transversum, as it does not make a plane transverse division of the two cavities, but forms a kind of vault, the fore part of which is attached to the sternum. Laterally it is fixed to the last of the true ribs, and to all the false ribs: and its lower and posterior part is attached to the vertebrae lumborum, where it may be said to be divided into two portions or crura (x).\n\nThe principal arteries of the diaphragm are derived from the aorta, and its veins pass into the vena cava. Its nerves are chiefly derived from the cervical pairs. It affords a passage to the vena cava through its tendinous part, and to the oesophagus through its fleety portion. The aorta passes down behind it between its crura.\n\nThe diaphragm not only serves to divide the thorax from the abdomen, but by its muscular structure is rendered one of the chief agents in respiration. When its fibres contract, its convex side, which is turned towards the thorax, becomes gradually flat, and by increasing the cavity of the breast, affords room for a complete dilatation of the lungs, by means of the air which is then drawn into them by the act of inspiration. The fibres of the diaphragm then relax; and as it resumes its former state, the cavity of the thorax becomes gradually diminished, and the air is driven out again from the lungs by a motion contrary to the former one, called expiration.\n\nIt is, in some measure by means of the diaphragm, that we void the faeces at the anus, and empty the urinary bladder. Besides these offices, the acts of coughing, sneezing, speaking, laughing, gaping, and sighing, could not take place without its assistance; and the gentle pressure which all the abdominal viscera receive from its constant and regular motion, cannot fail to assist in the performance of the several functions which were ascribed to those viscera.\n\n**Sect. V. Of the Trachea.**\n\nThe trachea, or windpipe, is a cartilaginous and membranous canal, through which the air passes into the lungs. Its upper part, which is called the larynx, is composed of five cartilages. The uppermost of these cartilages is placed over the glottis or mouth of the larynx, and is called epiglottis, which has been before spoken of, as closing the passage to the lungs in the act of swallowing. At the sides of the glottis are placed the two arytenoid cartilages, which are of a very complex figure, not easy to be described. The anterior and larger part of the larynx is made up of two cartilages; one of which is called thyroideus or scutiformis, from its being shaped like a buckler; and the other cricoides or annularis, from its resembling a ring. Both these cartilages may be felt immediately under the skin; at the fore part of the throat, and the thyroids, by its convexity, forms an eminence called pommum adami, which is usually more considerable in the male than in the female subject.\n\nAll these cartilages are united to each other by means of very elastic ligamentous fibres; and are enabled, by the affluence of their several muscles, to dilate or contract the passage of the larynx, and to perform that variety of motion which seems to point out the larynx as the principal organ of the voice; for when the air passes out through a wound in the trachea, it produces no sound.\n\nThese cartilages are moistened by a mucous, which seems to be secreted by minute glands situated near them. The upper part of the trachea is covered anteriorly and laterally by a considerable body, which is supposed to be of a glandular structure, and from its situation near the thyroid cartilage is called the thyroid gland; though its excretory duct has not yet been discovered, or its real use ascertained.\n\nThe glottis is interiorly covered by a very fine membrane, which is moistened by a constant supply of a watery fluid. From the larynx, the canal begins to take the name of trachea or aleria arteria, and extends from thence as far down as the third or fourth vertebra of the back, where it divides into two branches, which are the right and left bronchial tube. Each of these bronchi (v) ramifies through the substance of that lobe of the lungs, to which it is distributed, by an infinite number of branches, which are formed of cartilages separated from each other like those of the trachea, by an intervening membranous and ligamentary substance. Each of these cartilages is of an angular figure; and as they become gradually less and less in\n\n---\n\n(x) Anatomical writers have usually described the diaphragm as being made up of two muscles united by a middle tendon; and these two portions or crura form what they speak of as the inferior muscle, arising from the sides and fore part of the vertebrae.\n\n(v) The right bronchial tube is usually found to be somewhat shorter and thicker than the left; and M. Portal, who has published a memoir on the action of the lungs on the aorta in respiration, observes, that the left bronchial tube is closely contracted by the aorta; and from some experiments he is induced to conclude, that in the first respirations, the air only enters into the right lobe of the lungs. *Memoires de l'Academie Royale des Sciences*, 1769.\nin their diameter, the lower ones are in some measure received into those above them, when the lungs, after being inflated, gradually collapse by the air being pushed out from them in expiration. As the branches of the bronchi become more minute, their cartilages become more and more angular and membranous, till at length they are found to be perfectly membranous, and last become invisible.\n\nThe trachea is furnished with fleshy or muscular fibres; some of which pass through its whole extent longitudinally, while the others are carried round it in a circular direction; so that by the contraction or relaxation of these fibres, it is enabled to shorten or lengthen itself, and likewise to dilate or contract the diameter of its passage.\n\nThe trachea and its branches, in all their ramifications, are furnished with a great number of small glands which are lodged in their cellular substance, and discharge a mucous fluid on the inner surface of these tubes.\n\nThe cartilages of the trachea, by keeping it constantly open, afford a free passage to the air, which we are obliged to be incessantly respiring; and its membranous part, by being capable of contraction and dilatation, enables us to receive and expel the air in a greater or less quantity, and with more or less velocity, as may be required in singing or in declamation. This membranous structure of the trachea posteriorly seems likewise to assist in the descent of the food, by preventing that impediment to its passage down the oesophagus, which might be expected if the cartilages were complete rings.\n\nThe trachea receives its arteries from the carotid and subclavian arteries, and its veins pass into the jugulars. Its nerves arise from the recurrent branch of the eighth pair, and from the cervical plexus.\n\n**Sect. VI. Of the Lungs.**\n\nThe lungs fill the greater part of the cavity of the breast. They are of a soft and spongy texture, and are divided into two lobes, which are separated from each other by the mediastinum, and are externally covered by a production of the pleura. Each of these is divided into two or three lesser lobes; and we commonly find three in the right side of the cavity, and two in the left.\n\nTo discover the structure of the lungs, it is required to follow the ramifications of the bronchi, which were described in the last section. These becoming gradually more and more minute, at length terminate in the cellular spaces or vesicles, which make up the greatest part of the substance of the lungs, and readily communicate with each other.\n\nThe lungs seem to possess but little sensibility. Their nerves, which are small, and few in number, are derived from the intercostal and eighth pair. This last pair having reached the thorax, sends off a branch on each side of the trachea, called the recurrent, which extends at the back of the trachea, to which it furnishes branches in its ascent, as well as to the oesophagus, but it is chiefly distributed to the larynx and its muscles. By dividing the recurrent and superior laryngeal nerves at their origin, an animal is deprived of its voice.\n\nThere are two series of arteries which carry blood to the lungs: these are the arteriae bronchiales, and the pulmonary artery.\n\nThe arteriae bronchiales begin usually by two branches; one of which commonly arises from the right intercostal, and the other from the trunk of the aorta; but sometimes there are three of these arteries, and in some subjects only one. The use of these arteries is to serve for the nourishment of the lungs, and their ramifications are seen creeping everywhere on the branches of the bronchi. The blood is brought back from them by the bronchial vein into the vena cava.\n\nThe pulmonary artery and vein are not intended for the nourishment of the lungs; but the blood in its passage through them is destined to undergo some changes, or to acquire certain essential properties (from the action of the air), which it has lost in its circulation through the other parts of the body. The pulmonary artery receives the blood from the right ventricle of the heart; and dividing into two branches, accompanies the bronchi everywhere, by its ramifications through the lungs; and the blood is afterwards conveyed back by the pulmonary vein, which gradually forming a considerable trunk, goes to empty itself into the left ventricle of the heart; so that the quantity of blood which enters into the lungs, is perhaps greater than that which is sent in the same proportion of time through all the other parts of the body.\n\n**Sect. VII. Of Respiration.**\n\nRespiration constitutes one of those functions which are properly termed vital, as being essential to life; for to live and to breathe are in fact synonymous terms. It consists in an alternate contraction and dilatation of the thorax, by first inhaling air into the lungs, and then expelling it from them in expiration.\n\nIt will perhaps be easy to distinguish and point out the several phenomena of respiration; but to explain their physical cause will be attended with difficulty: for it will naturally be inquired, how the lungs, when emptied of the air, and contracted by expiration, become again inflated, they themselves being perfectly passive? How the ribs are elevated in opposition to their own natural situation? and why the diaphragm is contracted downwards towards the abdomen? Were we to assert that the air, by forcing its way into the cavity of the lungs, dilated them, and consequently elevated the ribs and pressed down the diaphragm, we should speak erroneously. What induces the first inspiration, it is not easy to ascertain; but after an animal has once expired, it would seem likely that the blood, after expiration, finding its passage through the lungs obstructed, becomes a stimulus, which induces the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm to contract, and enlarge the cavity of the thorax, in consequence perhaps of a certain nervous influence, which we will not here attempt to explain. The air then rushes into the lungs; every branch of the bronchial tubes, and all the cellular spaces into which they open, become fully dilated; and the pulmonary vessels being equally distended, the blood flows through them with ease. But as the stimulus which first occasioned this dilatation ceases to operate, the muscles gradually contract, the diaphragm rises upwards again, and diminishes the cavity of the chest; the ribs\nribs return to their former state; and as the air passes out in expiration, the lungs gradually collapse, and a resiliency to the passage of the blood again takes place. But the heart continuing to receive and expel the blood, the pulmonary artery begins again to be distended, the stimulus is renewed, and the same process is repeated, and continues to be repeated, in a regular succession during life: for though the muscles of respiration, having a mixed motion, are (unlike the heart) in some measure dependent on the will, yet no human being, after having once respired, can live many moments without it. In an attempt to hold one's breath, the blood soon begins to distend the veins, which are unable to empty their contents into the hearts, and we are able only, during a very little time, to feel the stimulus to inspiration. In drowning, the circulation seems to be stopped upon this principle; and in hanging, the pressure made on the jugular veins, may cooperate with the stoppage of respiration in bringing on death.\n\nTill within these few years physiologists were entirely ignorant of the use of respiration. It was at length discovered in part by the illustrious Dr Priestly. He found that the air expired by animals was phlogisticated; and that the air was fitter for respiration, or for supporting animal life, in proportion as it was freer from the phlogistic principle. It had long been observed that the blood in passing through the lungs acquired a more florid colour. He therefore suspected, that it was owing to its having imparted phlogiston to the air: and he satisfied himself of the truth of this idea by experiments, which showed, that the craftsmanship of extravasated blood phlogisticated air in proportion as it lost its dark colour. He farther found, that blood thus reddened had a strong attraction for phlogiston; insomuch that it was capable of taking it from phlogisticated air, thereby becoming of a darker colour. From hence it appeared that the blood, in its circulation through the arterial system, imbibes a considerable quantity of phlogiston, which is discharged from it to the air in the lungs.\n\nThis discovery has since been prosecuted by two very ingenious physiologists, Dr Crawford and Mr Elliot. It had been shown by Professors Black and Irvine, that different bodies have different capacities for containing fire. For example, that oil and water, when equally hot to the sense and the thermometer, contain different proportions of that principle; and that unequal quantities of it are required, in order to raise those substances to like temperatures. The inquiries of Dr Crawford and Mr Elliot tend to prove, that the capacities of bodies for containing fire are diminished by the addition of phlogiston, and increased by its separation: the capacity of calx of antimony, for example, being greater than that of the antimony itself. Common air contains a great quantity of fire; combustible bodies, very little. In combustion, a double elective attraction takes place; the phlogiston of the body being transferred to the air, the fire contained in the air to the combustible body. But as the capacity of the latter is not increased so much as that of the former is diminished, only part of the extricated fire will be absorbed by the body. The remainder therefore will raise the temperature of the compound; and hence we may account for the heat attending combustion. As the use of respiration is to dephlogisticate the blood, it seems probable, that a like double elective attraction takes place in this process; the phlogiston of the blood being transferred to the air, and the fire contained in the air to the blood; but with this difference, that the capacities being equal, the whole of the extricated fire is absorbed by the latter. The blood in this state circulating through the body, imbibes phlogiston, and of course gives out its fire; part only of which is absorbed by the parts furnishing the phlogiston, the remainder, as in combustion, becoming sensible; and is therefore the cause of the heat of the body, or what is called animal heat.\n\nIn confirmation of this doctrine it may be observed, that the venous blood contains less fire than the arterial; combustible bodies less than incombustible ones; and that air contains less of this principle, according as it is rendered, by combination with phlogiston, less fit for respiration (z).\n\nIn ascending very high mountains, respiration is found to become short and frequent, and sometimes to be attended with a spitting of blood. These symptoms seem to be occasioned by the air being too rare and thin to dilate the lungs sufficiently; and the blood gradually accumulating in the pulmonary vessels, sometimes bursts through their coats and is brought up by coughing. This has likewise been accounted for in a different way, by supposing that the air contained in the blood, not receiving an equal pressure from that of the atmosphere, expands, and at length ruptures the very minute branches of the pulmonary vessels; upon the same principle that fruits and animals put under the receiver of an air pump, are seen to swell as the outer air becomes exhausted. But Dr Darwin of Litchfield has lately published some experiments, which seem to prove, that no air or elastic vapour does exist in the blood vessels, as has been generally supposed; and he is induced to impute the spitting of blood which has sometimes taken place in ascending high mountains, to accident, or to violent exertions; as it never happens to animals that are put into the exhausted receiver of an air pump, where the diminution of pressure is many times greater than on the summit of the highest mountains.\n\nSect. VIII. Of the Voice.\n\nRespiration has already been described as affording us many advantages; and next to that of life, its most important use seems to be that of forming the voice and speech. The ancients, and almost all the moderns, have considered the organ of speech as a kind of musical instrument, which may be compared to a flute, to an hautboy, to an organ, &c. and they argue after the following manner:\n\nThe trachea, which begins at the root of the tongue, and goes to terminate in the lungs, may be compared to\n\n(z) See Crawford's Experiments and Observations on Animal Heat, and Elliot's Philosophical Observations.\nto the pipe of an organ; the lungs dilating like bellows during the time of inspiration; and as the air is driven out from them in expiration, it finds its passage straitened by the cartilages of the larynx, against which it strikes. As these cartilages are more or less elastic, they occasion in their turn more or less vibration in the air, and thus produce the sound of the voice; the variation in the sound and tone of which depends on the state of the glottis, which, when straitened, produces an acute tone, and a grave one when dilated.\n\nThe late M. Ferein communicated to the French Academy of Sciences a very ingenious theory on the formation of the voice. He considered the organ of the voice as a string, as well as a wind instrument; so that what art has hitherto been unable to construct, and what both the fathers Merlenne and Kircher so much wished to see, M. Ferein imagined he had at length discovered in the human body. He observes, that there are at the edges of the glottis certain tendinous chords, placed horizontally across it, which are capable of considerable vibration, so as to produce sound, in the same manner as it is produced by the strings of a violin or a harpsichord: and he supposes that the air, as it passes out from the lungs, acts as a bow on these strings, while the efforts of the breath and lungs regulate its motion, and produce the variety of tones. So that according to this system the variation in the voice is not occasioned by the dilatation or contraction of the glottis, but by the dilatation or relaxation of these strings, the sound being more or less acute in proportion as they are more or less stretched out. Another writer on this subject supposes, that the organ of voice is a double instrument, which produces in unison two sounds of a different nature; one by means of the air, and the other by means of the chords of the glottis. Neither of these systems, however, are universally adopted. They are both liable to insuperable difficulties; so that the manner in which the voice is formed has never yet been satisfactorily ascertained: we may observe, however, that the sound produced by the glottis is not articulated. To effect this, it is required to pass through the mouth, where it is differently modified by the action of the tongue, which is either pushed against the teeth, or upwards towards the palate; detaining it in its passage, or permitting it to flow freely, by contracting or dilating the mouth.\n\nSect. IX. Of Dejection.\n\nBy dejection we mean the act of voiding the faeces at the anus; and an account of the manner in which this is conducted was reserved for this part of the work, because it seemed to require a knowledge of respiration to be perfectly understood.\n\nThe intestines were described as having a peristaltic motion, by which the faeces were gradually advancing towards the anus. Now, whenever the faeces are accumulated in the intestine rectum in a sufficient quantity to become troublesome, either by their weight or acrimony, they excite a certain uneasiness which induces us to go to stool.—To effect this, we begin by making a considerable inspiration; in consequence of which the diaphragm is carried downwards towards the lower belly; the abdominal muscles are at the same time contracted in obedience to the will: and the intestine being comprimised on all sides, the resistance of the sphincter is overcome, and the faeces pass out at the anus; which is afterwards drawn up by its longitudinal fibres, which are called levatores ani, and then by means of its sphincter is again contracted: but it sometimes happens, as in dysenteries for instance, that the faeces are very liquid, and have considerable acrimony; and then the irritation they occasion is more frequent, so as to promote their discharge without any pressure from the diaphragm or abdominal muscles; and sometimes involuntarily, as is the case when the sphincter becomes paralytic.\n\nSect. X. Of the Pericardium, and of the Heart and its Auricles.\n\nThe two membranous bags of the pleura, which pericardium were described as forming the mediastinum, recede one from the other, so as to afford a lodgment to a firm membranous sac, in which the heart is securely lodged; this sac, which is the pericardium, appears to be composed of two tunics, united to each other by cellular membrane.—The outer coat, which is thick, and in some places of a tendinous complexion, is a production of the mediastinum; the inner coat, which is extremely thin, is reflected over the auricles and ventricles of the heart, in the same manner as the tunic conjunctiva, after lining the eyelids, is reflected over the eye.\n\nThis bag adheres to the tendinous part of the diaphragm, and contains a coagulable lymph, the liquor pericardii, which serves to lubricate the heart and facilitate its motions; and seems to be secreted and absorbed in the same manner as it is in the other cavities of the body.\n\nThe arteries of the pericardium are derived from the phrenic, and its veins pass into veins of the same name; its nerves are likewise branches of the phrenic.\n\nThe size of the pericardium is adapted to that of the heart, being usually large enough to contain it loosely. As its cavity does not extend to the sternum, the lungs cover it in inspiration; and as it everywhere invests the heart, it effectually secures it from being injured by lymph, pus, or any other fluid, extravasated into the cavities of the thorax.\n\nThe heart is a hollow muscle of a conical shape, situated transversely between the two laminae of the mediastinum, at the lower part of the thorax; having its basis turned towards the right side, and its point or apex towards the left.—Its lower surface is somewhat flattened towards the diaphragm. Its basis, from which the great vessels originate, is covered with fat; and it has two hollow and fleshy appendages, called auricles.—Round these several openings, the heart seems to be of a firm ligamentous texture, from which all its fibres seem to originate; and as they advance from thence towards the apex, the substance of the heart seems to become thinner.\n\nThe heart includes two cavities or ventricles, which are separated from each other by a fleshy septum; one of these is called the right, and the other the left, ventricle; though perhaps, with respect to their situation, it would be more proper to distinguish them into the anterior and posterior ventricles.\nThe heart is exteriorly covered by a very fine membrane; and its structure is perfectly muscular or fleshy, being composed of fibres which are described as passing in different directions; some being extended longitudinally from the basis to the apex; others, as taking an oblique or spiral course; and a third sort as being placed in a transverse direction (a).—Within the two ventricles we observe several furrows; and there are likewise tendinous strings, which arise from fleshy columns in the two cavities, and are attached to the valves of the auricles: That the use of these and the other valves of the heart may be understood, it must be observed, that four large vessels pass out from the basis of the heart, viz., two arteries and two veins; and that each of these vessels is furnished with a thin membranous production, which is attached all round to the borders of their several orifices, from whence hanging loosely down they appear to be divided into two or three distinct portions. But as their uses in the arteries and veins are different, so are they differently disposed. Those of the arteries are intended to give way to the passage of the blood into them from the ventricles, but to oppose its return: and, on the contrary, the valves of the veins are constructed so as to allow the blood only to pass into the heart. In consequence of these different uses, we find the valves of the pulmonary artery and of the aorta attached to the orifices of those vessels, so as to have their concave surfaces turned towards the artery; and their convex surfaces, which mutually meet together, being placed towards the ventricle, only permit the blood to pass one way, which is into the arteries. There are usually three of these valves belonging to the pulmonary artery, and as many to the aorta; and from their figure they are called valvulae semilunares. The communication between the two great veins and the ventricles is by means of the two appendages or auricles into which the blood is discharged; so that the other valves which may be said to belong to the veins, are placed in each ventricle, where the auricle opens into it. The valves in the right ventricle are usually three in number, and are named valvulae tricuspidae; but in the left ventricle we commonly observe only two, and these are the valvulae mitrales. The membranes which form these valves in each cavity are attached so as to project somewhat forward; and both the tricuspidae and the mitrales are connected with the tendinous strings, which were described as arising from the fleshy columns. By the contraction of either ventricle the blood is driven into the artery which communicates with that ventricle; and these tendinous strings being gradually relaxed as the sides of the cavity are brought nearer to each other, the valves naturally close the opening into the auricle, and the blood necessarily directs its course into the then only open passage, which is into the artery; but after this contraction the heart becomes relaxed, the tendinous strings are again stretched out, and, drawing the valves of the auricle downwards, the blood is poured by the veins into the ventricle, from whence, by another contraction, it is again thrown into the artery, as will be described hereafter. The right ventricle is not quite so long, though somewhat larger, than the left; but the latter has more substance than the other; and this seems to be, because it is intended to transmit the blood to the most distant parts of the body, whereas the right ventricle distributes it only to the lungs.\n\nThe heart receives its nerves from the par vagum and the intercostals. The arteries which serve for its nourishment are two in number, and arise from the aorta. They surround in some measure the basis of the heart, and from this course are called the coronary arteries. From these arteries the blood is returned by veins of the same name into the auricles, and even into the ventricles.\n\nThe muscular bags called the auricles are situated at the basis of the heart, at the sides of each other; and, corresponding with the two ventricles, are like those two cavities distinguished into right and left. These faces, which are anteriorly unequal, have externally a jagged appendix; which, from its having been compared to the extremity of an ear, has given them their name of auricles.\n\nSect. XI. Angiology, or a Description of the Blood Vessels.\n\nThe heart has been described as contracting itself, and throwing the blood from its two ventricles into the pulmonary artery and the aorta, and then as relaxing itself and receiving a fresh supply from two large veins, which are the pulmonary vein and the vena cava. We will now point out the principal distributions of these vessels.\n\nThe pulmonary artery arises from the right ventricle by a large trunk, which soon divides into two considerable branches, which pass to the right and left lobes of the lungs: each of these branches is afterwards divided and subdivided into an infinite number of branches and ramifications, which extend through the whole substance of the lungs; and from these branches the blood is returned by the veins, which, contrary to the course of the arteries, begin by very minute canals, and gradually become larger, forming at length four large trunks called pulmonary veins, which terminate in the left auricle by one common opening, from whence the blood passes into the left ventricle. From this same ventricle arises the aorta or great artery, which at its beginning is nearly an inch in diameter: it soon sends off two branches, the coronaries, which go to be distributed to the heart and its auricles. After this, at or about the third or fourth vertebra of the back, it makes a considerable curvature; from this curvature (b) arise three arteries; one\n\n(a) Authors differ about the course and distinctions of these fibres; and it seems right to observe, that the structure of the heart being more compact than that of other muscles, its fibres are not easily separated.\n\n(b) Anatomists usually call the upper part of this curvature aorta ascendens; and the other part of the artery to its division at the iliacs, aorta descendens; but they differ about the place where this distinction is to be introduced; and it seems sufficiently to answer every purpose, to speak only of the aorta and its curvature.\nof which soon divides into two branches. The first two are the left subclavian and the left carotid, and the third is a common trunk to the right subclavian and right carotid; though sometimes both the carotids arise distinctly from the aorta.\n\nThe two carotids ascend within the subclavians, along the sides of the trachea; and when they have reached the larynx, divide into two principal branches, the internal and external carotid. The first of these runs a little way backwards in a bending direction; and having reached the under part of the ear, passes through the canal in the os petrosum, and entering into the cavity of the cranium, is distributed to the brain and the membranes which envelop it, and likewise to the eye. The external carotid divides into several branches, which are distributed to the larynx, pharynx, and other parts of the neck; and to the jaws, lips, tongue, eyes, temples, and all the external parts of the head.\n\nEach subclavian is likewise divided into a great number of branches. It sends off the vertebral artery, which passes through the openings we see at the bottom of the transverse processes of the vertebrae of the neck, and in its course sends off many ramifications to the neighbouring parts. Some of its branches are distributed to the spinal marrow, and after a considerable inflection it enters into the cranium, and is distributed to the brain. The subclavian likewise sends off branches to the muscles of the neck and scapula; and the mediastinum, thymus, pericardium, diaphragm, the breast, and the muscles of the thorax, and even of the abdomen, derive branches from the subclavian, which are distinguished by different names, alluding to the parts to which they are distributed; as the mammary, the phrenic, the intercostal, &c. But notwithstanding the great number of branches which have been described as arising from the subclavian, it is still a considerable artery when it reaches the axilla, where it drops its former name, which alludes to its passage under the clavicle, and is called the axillary artery; from which a variety of branches are distributed to the muscles of the breast, scapula, and arm.—But its main trunk taking the name of brachialis, runs along on the inside of the arm near the os humeri, till it reaches the joint of the fore arm, and then it divides into two branches. This division, however, is different in different subjects; for in some it takes place higher up, and in others lower down. When it happens to divide above the joint, it may be considered as a happy disposition in case of an accident by bleeding; for supposing the artery to be unfortunately punctured by the lancet, and that the hemorrhage could only be stopped by making a ligature on the vessel, one branch would remain unhurt, through which the blood would pass uninterruptedly to the fore arm and hand. One of the two branches of the brachialis plunges down under the flexor muscles, and runs along the edge of the ulna; while the other is carried along the outer surface of the radius, and is easily felt at the wrist, where it is only covered by the common integuments. Both these branches commonly unite in the palm of the hand, and form an arterial arch, from whence branches are detached to the fingers.\n\nThe aorta, after having given off at its curvature the carotids and subclavians which convey blood to all the upper parts of the body, descends upon the bodies of the vertebrae a little to the left, as far as the os sacrum, where it drops the name of aorta, and divides into two considerable branches. In this course, from its curvature to its bifurcation, it sends off several arteries in the following order: 1. One or two little arteries, first demonstrated by Ruyesh as going to the bronchi, and called arteriae bronchiales Ruyeshi. 2. The arteriae oesophageae. These are commonly three or four in number. They arise from the fore part of the aorta, and are distributed chiefly to the oesophagus. 3. The inferior intercostal arteries, which are distributed between the ribs in the same manner as the arteries of the three or four superior ribs are, which are derived from the subclavian. These arteries send off branches to the medulla spinalis. 4. The diaphragmatic or inferior phrenic arteries, which go to the diaphragm, stomach, omentum, duodenum, pancreas, spleen, liver, and gall-bladder. 5. The celiac, which sends off the coronary stomachic, the splenic, and the hepatic artery. 6. The superior mesenteric artery, which is distributed to the mesentery and small intestine. 7. The eminence, which go to the kidneys. 8. The arteries which are distributed to the glandulae renales. 9. The spermatic. 10. The inferior mesenteric artery, which ramifies through the lower portion of the mesentery and the large intestine. A branch of this artery which goes to the rectum is called the internal hemorrhoidal. 11. The lumbar arteries, and a very small branch called the sacra, which are distributed to the muscles of the loins and abdomen, and to the os sacrum and medulla spinalis.\n\nThe trunk of the aorta, when it has reached the last vertebra lumborum, or the os sacrum, drops the name of aorta, and separates into two forked branches called the iliacs. Each of these soon divides into two branches; one of which is called the internal iliac, or hypogastric artery, and is distributed upon the contents of the pelvis and upon the muscles on its outer side. One branch, called pudenda communis, sends small ramifications to the end of the rectum under the name of hemorrhoidales externae, and is afterwards distributed upon the penis. The other branch, the external iliac, after having given off the circumflex artery of the os ilium and the epigastric, which is distributed to the recto-muscles, passes out of the abdomen under Poupart's ligament, and takes the name of external artery. It descends on the inner part of the thigh close to the os femoris, sending off branches to the muscles, and then sinking deeper in the hind part of the thigh, reaches the ham, where it takes the name of popliteal; after this it separates into two considerable branches; one of which is called the anterior tibial artery; the other divides into two branches, and these arteries all go to be distributed to the leg and foot.\n\nThe blood, which is thus distributed by the aorta to all parts of the body, is brought back by the veins, which are supposed to be continued from the ultimate branches of arteries; and uniting together as they approach the heart, at length form the large trunks, the vena cava ascendens, and vena cava descendens.\n\nAll the veins which bring back the blood from the upper extremities, and from the head and breast, pass into the vena cava descendens; and those which return it from the lower parts of the body terminate in the\nvena cava ascendens; and these two cavas uniting together as they approach the heart, open by one common orifice into the left auricle.\n\nIt does not here seem to be necessary to follow the different divisions of the veins as we did those of the arteries; and it will be sufficient to remark, that in general every artery is accompanied by its vein, and that both are distinguished by the same name. But, like many other general rules, this too has its exceptions (c). The veins, for instance, which accompany the external and internal carotid, are not called the carotid veins, but the external and internal jugular.—In the thorax there is a vein distinguished by a proper name, and this is the azygos, or vena sine pari. This vein, which is a pretty considerable one, runs along by the right side of the vertebrae of the back, and is chiefly destined to receive the blood from the intercostals on that side, and from the lower half of those on the left side, and to convey it into the vena cava descendens. In the abdomen we meet with a vein, which is still more remarkable one, and this is the vena porta, which performs the office both of an artery and a vein. It is formed by a reunion of all the veins which come from the stomach, intestines, omentum, pancreas, and spleen, so as to compose one great trunk, which goes to ramify through the liver; and after having deposited the bile, its ramifications unite, and bring back into the vena cava, not only the blood which the vena porta had carried into the liver, but likewise the blood from the hepatic artery. Every artery has a vein which corresponds with it; but the trunks and branches of the veins are more numerous than those of the arteries. The reasons for this disposition are perhaps not difficult to be explained; the blood in its course through the veins is much farther removed from the source and cause of its motion, which are in the heart, than it was when in the arteries; so that its course is consequently less rapid, and enough of it could not possibly be brought back to the heart in the moment of its dilatation, to equal the quantity which is driven into the arteries from the two ventricles, at the time they contract; and the equilibrium, which is so essential to the continuance of life and health, would consequently be destroyed, if the capacity of the veins did not exceed that of the arteries, in the same proportion that the rapidity of the blood's motion through the arteries exceeds that of its return through the veins.\n\nA large artery ramifying through the body, and continued to the minute branches of veins, which gradually unite together to form a large trunk, may be compared to two trees united to each other at their tops; or rather as having their ramifications so disposed that the two trunks terminate in one common point; and if we farther suppose, that both these trunks and their branches are hollow, and that a fluid is incessantly circulated through them, by entering into one of the trunks and returning through the other, we shall be enabled to conceive how the blood is circulated through the vessels of the human body.\n\nEvery trunk of an artery, before it divides, is nearly cylindrical, or of equal diameter through its whole length, and so are all its branches when examined separately. But every trunk seems to contain less blood than the many branches do into which that trunk separates; and each of these branches probably contains less blood than the ramifications do into which it is subdivided: and it is the same with the veins; the volume of their several ramifications, when considered together, being found to exceed that of the great trunk which they form by their union.\n\nThe return of the blood through the veins to the heart, is promoted by the action of the muscles, and the pulsation of the arteries. And this return is likewise greatly assisted by the valves which are to be met with in the veins, and which constitute one of the greatest distinctions between them and the arteries. These valves, which are supposed to be formed by the inner coat of the veins, permit the blood to flow from the extremities towards the heart, but oppose its return. They are most frequent in the smaller veins. As the column of blood increases, they seem to become less necessary; and therefore in the vena cava ascendens, we meet with only one valve, which is near its origin.\n\nThe arteries are composed of several tunics. Some writers enumerate five of these tunics; but perhaps we may more properly reckon only three, viz. the nervous, muscular, and cuticular coats. The veins are by some anatomists described as having the same number of coats as the arteries; but as they do not seem to be irritable, we cannot with propriety suppose them to have a muscular tunic. We are aware of Dr Verchier's experiments to prove that the jugular and some inferior veins possess a certain degree of irritability; but it is certain, that his experiments, repeated by others, irritability, have produced a different result; and even he himself allows, that sometimes he was unable to distinguish any such property in the veins. Both these series of vessels are nourished by still more minute arteries and veins, which are seen creeping over their coats and ramifying through their whole substance, and are called vasa vasorum; they have likewise many minute branches of nerves.\n\nThe arteries are much stronger than the veins; and they seem to require this force, to be enabled to resist the impetus with which the blood circulates through them, and to impel it on towards the veins.\n\nWhen the heart contracts, it impels the blood into the arteries, and sensibly dilates them; and these vessels again contract, as the heart becomes relaxed to receive more blood from the auricles; so that the cause of the contraction and dilatation of the arteries seems to be easy to be understood, being owing in part to their own contractile power, and in part to the action of the heart; but in the veins, the effects of this impulse not being sensibly felt, and the vessels themselves having little or no contractile power, the blood seems to flow in a constant and equal stream: and this, together with its passing gradually from a small channel into a larger one, seems to be the reason why the\n\n(c) In the extremities, some of the deep-seated veins, and all the superficial ones, take a course different from that of the arteries.\nveins have no pulsatory motion, except the large ones near the heart; and in these it seems to be occasioned by the motion of the diaphragm, and by the regurgitation of the blood in the cavas.\n\n**Sect. XII. Of the Action of the Heart, Auricles, and Arteries.**\n\nThe heart, at the time it contracts, drives the blood from its ventricles into the arteries; and the arteries being thus filled and distended, are naturally inclined to contract the moment the heart begins to dilate, and ceases to supply them with blood. These alternate motions of contraction and dilatation of the heart and arteries, are distinguished by the names of systole and dia-\n\nstole. When the heart is in a state of contraction or systole, the arteries are at that instant distended with blood, and in their dia-\n\nstole; and it is in this state we feel their pulsatory motion, which we call the pulse. When the heart dilates, and the arteries contract, the blood is impelled onwards into the veins, through which it is returned back to the heart. While the heart, however, is in its systole, the blood cannot pass from the veins into the ventricles, but is detained in the auricles, which are two reservoirs formed for this use, till the dia-\n\nstole, or dilatation of the heart, takes place; and then the distended auricles contract, and drive the blood into the ventricles; so that the auricles have an alternate systole and dia-\n\nstole as well as the heart.\n\nAlthough both the ventricles of the heart contract at the same time, yet the blood passes from one to the other. In the same moment, for instance, that the left ventricle drives the blood into the aorta, the right ventricle impels it into the pulmonary artery, which is distributed through all the substance of the lungs. The blood is afterwards brought back into the left ventricle by the pulmonary vein, at the same time that the blood is returned by the cavas, into the right ventricle, from all the other parts of the body.\n\nThis seems to be the mode of action of the heart and its vessels; but the cause of this action has, like all other intricate and interesting subjects, been differently explained. It seems to depend on the stimulus made on the different parts of the heart by the blood itself, which, by its quantity and heat, or other properties (D), is perhaps capable of first exciting that motion, which is afterwards continued through life, independent of the will, by a regular return of blood to the auricles, in a quantity proportioned to that which is thrown into the arteries.\n\nThe heart possesses the vis inflam, or principle of irritability, in a much greater degree than any other muscle of the body. The pulse is quicker in young than in old subjects, because the former are cat. par, more irritable than the latter. Upon the same principle we may explain, why the pulse is constantly quicker in weak than in robust persons.\n\n---\n\n(b) Dr Harvey long ago suggested, that the blood is possessed of a living principle; and Mr J. Hunter has lately endeavoured to revive this doctrine; in support of which he has adduced many ingenious arguments. The subject is a curious one, and deserves to be prosecuted as an inquiry which cannot but be interesting to physiologists.\n\n(e) The blood, as it flows through the arteries, is observed to be more florid than it is in the veins; and this redness is acquired in its passage through the lungs. Vid. Sect. VII.\n\n**Sect. XIII. Of the Circulation.**\n\nAfter what has been observed of the structure and action of the heart and its auricles, and likewise of the arteries and veins, there seem to be but very few arguments required to demonstrate the circulation of the blood, which has long since been established as a medical truth. This circulation may be defined to be a perpetual motion of the blood, in consequence of the action of the heart and arteries, which impel it through all the parts of the body, from whence it is brought back by the veins to the heart.\n\nA very satisfactory proof of this circulation, and a proof easy to be understood, may be deduced from the different effects of pressure on an artery and a vein. If a ligature, for instance, is passed round an artery, the vessel swells considerably between the ligature and the heart; whereas if we tie up a vein, it only becomes filled between the extremity and the ligature, and this is what we every day observe in bleeding. The ligature we pass round the arm on these occasions, compresses the superficial veins; and the return of the blood through them being impeded, they become distended. When the ligature is too loose, the veins are not sufficiently compressed, and the blood continues its progress towards the heart; and, on the contrary, when it is made too tight, the arteries themselves become compressed; and the flow of the blood through them being impeded, the veins cannot be distended.\n\nAnother phenomenon, which effectually proves the circulation, is the loss of blood that every living animal suffers by opening only a single artery of moderate size; for it continues to flow from the wounded vessel till the equilibrium is destroyed which is essential to life. This truth was not unknown to the ancients; and it seems strange that it did not lead them to a knowledge of the circulation, as it sufficiently proves, that all the other vessels must communicate with that which is opened. Galen, who lived more than 1500 years ago, drew this conclusion from it; and if we farther observe, that he describes (after Erasistratus, who flourished about 450 years before him) the several valves of the heart, and determines their disposition and uses, it will appear wonderful, that a period of near 2000 years should afterwards elapse before the true course of the blood was ascertained. This discovery, for which we are indebted to the immortal Harvey, has thrown new lights on physiology and the doctrine of diseases, and constitutes one of the most important periods of anatomical history.\n\n**Sect. XIV. Of the Nature of the Blood.**\n\nBlood, recently drawn from a vein into a basin, would seem to be an homogeneous fluid of a red colour (e); but when suffered to rest, it soon coagulates, and divides into two parts, which are distinguished by the\nthe names of *craffamentum* and *serum*. The *craffamentum* is the red coagulum, and the *serum* is the water in which it floats. Each of these may be again separated into two others; for the *craffamentum*, by being repeatedly washed in warm water, gives out all its red globules, and what remains appears to be composed of the coagulable lymph (*p*), which is a gelatinous substance, capable of being hardened by fire till it becomes perfectly horny: and if we expose the serum to a certain degree of heat, part of it will be found to coagulate like the white of an egg, and there will remain a clear and limpid water, resembling urine both in its appearance and smell.\n\nThe serum and *craffamentum* differ in their proportion in different constitutions; in a strong person, the *craffamentum* is in a greater proportion to the serum than in a weak one*; and the same difference is found to take place in diseases (*g*).\n\n**Sect. XV. Of Nutrition.**\n\nThe variety of functions which we have described as being incessantly performed by the living body, and the continual circulation of the blood through it, must necessarily occasion a constant dissipation of the several parts which enter into its composition. In speaking of the insensible perspiration, we observed how much was incessantly falling off from the lungs and the surface of the skin. The discharge by urine is likewise every day considerable; and great part of the bile, saliva, &c. are excluded by stool. But the solids, as well as the fluid parts of the body, require a constant renewal of nutritious particles. They are exposed to the attrition of the fluids which are circulated through them; and the contraction and relaxation they repeat so many thousand times in every day, would necessarily occasion a dissolution of the machine, if the renewal was not proportioned to the waste.\n\nIt is easy to conceive how the chyle formed from the aliment is assimilated into the nature of blood, and repairs the loss of the fluid parts of our body; but how the solids are renewed, has never yet been satisfactorily explained. The nutritious parts of the blood are probably deposited by the arteries by exudation through their pores into the tela cellulosa; and as the solid parts of the body are in the embryo only a kind of jelly, which gradually acquires the degree of consistence they are found to have when the body arrives at a more advanced age; and these same parts which consist of bones, cartilages, ligaments, muscles, &c. are sometimes reduced again by disease to a gelatinous state; we may, with some degree of probability, consider the coagulable lymph as the source of nutrition.\n\nIf the supply of nourishment exceeds the degree of waste, the body increases; and this happens in infancy and in youth: for at those periods, but more particularly the former one, the fluids bear a large proportion to the solids; and the fibres being soft and yielding, are proportionably more capable of extension and increase. But when the supply of nutrition only equals the waste, we neither increase nor decrease; and we find this to be the case when the body has attained its full growth or *acme*: for the solids having then acquired a certain degree of firmness and rigidity, do not permit a farther increase of the body. But as we approach to old age, rigidity begins to be in excess, and the fluids (*u*) bear a much less proportion to the solids than before. The dissipation of the body is greater than the supply of nourishment; many of the smaller vessels become gradually impervious (*i*); and the fibres losing their moisture and their elasticity, appear flaccid and wrinkled. The fibres and the roles disappear, because the fluids by which they were produced can no longer reach the extremities of the capillary vessels of the skin. As these changes take place, the nervous power being proportionably weakened, the irritability and sensibility of the body, which were formerly so remarkable, are greatly diminished; and in advanced life, the hearing, the eye-sight, and all the other senses, become gradually impaired.\n\n**Sect. XVI. Of the Glands and Secretions.**\n\nThe glands are commonly understood to be small, roundish, or oval bodies, formed by the convolution of a great number of vessels, and destined to separate particular humours from the mass of blood.\n\nThey are usually divided into two classes; but it seems more\n\n---\n\n(*p*) It may not be improper to observe, that till of late the *coagulable lymph* has been confounded with the *serum* of the blood, which contains a substance that is likewise coagulable, though only when exposed to heat, or combined with certain chemical substances; whereas the other coagulates spontaneously when exposed to the air or to light.\n\n(*g*) When the blood separates into *serum* and *craffamentum*, if the latter be covered with a crust of a whitish or buff colour, it has been usually considered as a certain proof of the blood's being in a state of too great viscidity. This appearance commonly taking place in inflammatory diseases, has long served to confirm the theory which attributes the cause of inflammation to lentor and obstructions. But from the late Mr Hewson's experiments it appears, that when the action of the arteries is increased, the blood, instead of being more viscid, is, on the contrary, more fluid than in the ordinary state previous to inflammation; and that in consequence of this, the coagulable lymph suffers the red globules, which are the heaviest part of the blood, to fall down to the bottom before it coagulates: so that the *craffamentum* is divided into two parts; one of which is found to consist of the coagulable lymph alone (in this case termed the *buff*); and the other, partly of this and partly of the red globules.\n\n(*u*) As the fluids become less in proportion to the solids, their acrimony is found to increase; and this may perhaps compensate for the want of fluidity in the blood, by diminishing its cohesion.\n\n(*i*) In infancy, the arteries are numerous and large in respect to the veins, and the lymphatic glands are larger than at any other time of life; whereas, in old age, the capacity of the venous system exceeds that of the arteries, and the lymphatic system almost disappears.\nmore proper to distinguish three kinds of glands, viz. the mucous, conglomerate, and conglomerate.\n\nThe mucous glands, or follicles as they are most commonly called, are small cylindrical tubes continued from the ends of arteries. In some parts of the body, as in the tonsils, for example, several of these follicles may be seen folded together in one common covering, and opening into one common sinus. These follicles are the vessels that secrete and pour out mucus in the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, intestines, and other parts of the body.\n\nThe conglomerate glands are peculiar to the lymphatic system. Every lymphatic vein passes through a gland of this kind in its way to the thoracic duct. They are met with in different parts of the body, particularly in the axilla, groin, and mesenteric, and are either solitary or in distinct clusters.\n\nThe conglomerate glands are of much greater bulk than the conglomerate, and seem to be an assemblage of many smaller glands. Of this kind are the liver, kidneys, &c. Some of them, as the pancreas, parotids, &c., have a granulated appearance. All these conglomerate glands are plentifully supplied with blood vessels; but their nerves are in general very minute, and few in number. Each little granulated portion furnishes a small tube, which unites with other similar ducts, to form the common excretory duct of the gland.\n\nThe principal glands, and the humours they secrete, have been already described in different parts of this work; and there only remains for us to examine the general structure of the glands, and to explain the mechanism of secretion. On the first of these subjects two different systems have been formed; each of which has had, and still continues to have, its adherents. One of these systems was advanced by Malpighi, who supposed that an artery entering into a gland ramifies very minutely through its whole substance; and that its branches ultimately terminate in a vesicular cavity or follicle, from whence the secreted fluid passes out through the excretory duct. This doctrine at first met with few opponents; but the celebrated Ruysch, who first attempted minute injections with wax, afterwards disputed the existence of these follicles, and asserted, that every gland appears to be a continued series of vessels, which after being repeatedly convoluted in their course through its substance, at length terminate in the excretory duct. Anatomists are still divided between these two systems: that of Malpighi, however, seems to be the best founded.\n\nThe mode of secretion has been explained in a variety of ways, and they are all perfectly hypothetical. In such an inquiry, it is natural to ask, how one gland constantly separates a particular humour, while another gland secretes one of a very different nature from the blood? The bile, for instance, is separated by the liver, and the urine by the kidneys. Are these secretions to be imputed to any particular disposition in the fluids, or is their cause to be looked for in the solids?\n\nIt has been supposed, that every gland contains within itself a fermenting principle, by which it is enabled to change the nature of the blood it receives, and to endue it with a particular property. Thus, according to this system, the blood, as it circulates through the kidneys, becomes mixed with the fermenting principle of those glands, and a part of it is converted into urine; and again in the liver, in the falciform and other glands, the bile, the saliva, and other juices, are generated from a similar cause. But it seems to be impossible for any liquor to be confined in a place exposed to the circulation, without being carried away by the torrent of blood, every part of which would be equally affected; and this system of fermentation has long been rejected as vague and chimerical. But as the cause of secretion continued to be looked for in the fluids, the former system was succeeded by another, in which recourse was had to the analogy of the humours. It was observed, that if paper be moistened with water, and oil and water be afterwards poured upon it, that the water only will be permitted to pass through it; but that, on the other hand, if the paper has been previously soaked in oil instead of water, the oil only, and not the water, will be filtered through it. These observations led to a supposition, that every secretory organ is originally furnished with a humour analogous to that which it is afterwards destined to separate from the blood; and that in consequence of this disposition, the secretory vessels of the liver, for instance, will only admit the bilious particles of the blood, while all the other humours will be excluded. This system is an ingenious one, but the difficulties with which it abounds are unanswerable: for oil and water are immiscible; whereas the blood, as it is circulated through the body, appears to be a homogeneous fluid. Every oil will pass through a paper moistened only with one kind of oil; and wine, or spirits mixed with water, will easily be filtered through a paper previously soaked in water. Upon the same principle, all our humours, though differing in their other properties, yet agreeing in that of being perfectly miscible with each other, will all easily pass through the same filter.—But these are not all the objections to this system. The humours which are supposed to be placed in the secretory vessels for the determination of similar particles from the blood, must be originally separated without any analogous fluid; and that which happens once, may as easily happen always. Again, it sometimes happens, from a vicious disposition, that humours are filtered through glands which are naturally not intended to afford them a passage; and when this once has happened, it ought, according to this system, to be expected always to do so: whereas this is not the case; and we are, after all, naturally led to seek for the cause of secretion in the solids. It does not seem right to ascribe it to any particular figure of the secretory vessels; because the soft texture of those parts does not permit them to preserve any constant shape, and our fluids seem to be capable of accommodating themselves to every kind of figure. Some have imputed it to the difference of diameter in the orifices of the different secretory vessels. To this doctrine objections have likewise been raised; and it has been argued, that the vessels of the liver, for instance, would upon this principle, afford a passage not only to the bile, but to all the other humours of less confidence with it. In reply to this objection, it has been supposed, that secondary vessels exist, which originate from the first, and permit all the humours thinner than the bile to pass through them.\n\nEach of these hypotheses is probably very remote from the truth.\nThis Plate represents the Heart in situ, all the large Arteries and Veins, with some of the Muscles, &c.\n\nMuscles, &c.—Superior Extremity.—a, Masticator. b, Complexus. c, Digastricus. d, Oshyoides. e, Thyroid gland. f, Levator scapulae. g, Cucullaris. h, The clavicles cut. i, The deltoid muscle. k, Biceps flexor cubiti cut. l, Coraco-brachialis. m, Triceps extensor cubiti. n, The heads of the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor digitorum sublimis, cut. o, The flexor carpi ulnaris cut at its extremity. p, Flexor digitorum profundus. q, Supinator radii longus, cut at its extremity. r, Ligamentum carpi transversale. s, Extensor carpi radiales. t, Latissimus dorfi. u, Anterior edge of the serratus anterior major. v, The inferior part of the diaphragm. w, Its interior edge cut. x, The kidneys. y, Transversus abdominis. z, Os ilium.\n\nInferior Extremity.—a, Psoas magnus. b, Iliacus internus. c, The fleshy origin of the tensor vaginae femoris. dd, The osa pubis cut from each other. e, Muculus pectineus cut from its origin. f, Short head of the triceps adductor femoris cut. g, The great head of the triceps. h, The long head cut. i, Vastus internus. k, Vastus externus. l, Crureus. m, Gemellus. n, Soleus. o, Tibia. p, Peroneus longus. q, Peroneus brevis. r, Fibula.\n\nHeart and Blood Vessels.—A, The heart, with the coronary arteries and veins.

V. OF THE BRAIN AND NERVES.\n\nSect. I. Of the Brain and its Integuments.\n\nThe bones of the cranium were described in the osteological part of this work, as enclosing the brain and defending it from external injury; but they are not its only protection; for when we make a horizontal incision through these bones, we find this mass everywhere surrounded by two membranes (k), the dura and pia mater.—The first of these lines the interior surface of the cranium, to which it everywhere adheres strongly (l), but more particularly at the sutures, and at the many foramina through which vessels pass between it and the pericranium. The dura mater (m) is perfectly smooth and inelastic, and its inner surface is constantly bedewed with a fine pellucid fluid, which everywhere separates it from the pia mater. The dura mater tends off\n\n(k) The Greeks called these membranes meninges; but the Arabians, supposing them to be the source of all the other membranes of the body, afterwards gave them the name of dura and pia mater; by which they are now usually distinguished.\n\n(l) In young subjects this adhesion is greater than in adults; but even then, in the healthy subject, it is nowhere easily separable, without breaking through some of the minute vessels by means of which it is attached to the bone.\n\n(m) This membrane is commonly described as consisting of two laminae; of which the external one is supposed to perform the office of periosteum internum to the cranium, while the internal one forms the folds and processes of the dura mater. In the natural state, however, no such separation is apparent; like other membranes, we may indeed divide it, not into two only, but many laminae; but this division is artificial, and depends on the dexterity of the anatomist.\noff several considerable processes, which divide the brain into separate portions, and prevent them from compressing each other. Of these processes there is one superior and longitudinal, called the falx or falciform process, from its resemblance to a scythe. It arises from the spine of the os frontis, near the crista galli, and extending along in the direction of the sagittal sutures, to beyond the lambdoidal suture, divides the brain into two hemispheres. A little below the lambdoidal suture, it divides into two broad wings or expansions called the transverse or lateral processes, which prevent the lobes of the cerebrum from pressing on the cerebellum. Besides these there is a fourth, which is situated under the transverse processes, and being continued to the spine of the occiput, divides the cerebellum into two lobes.\n\nThe blood, after being distributed through the cavity of the cranium by means of the arteries, is returned, as in the other parts of the body, by veins which all pass on to certain channels situated behind these several processes.\n\nThese canals or sinuses communicate with each other, and empty themselves into the internal jugular veins, which convey the blood into the vena cava. They are in fact triangular veins, running through the substance of the dura mater, and, like the processes, are distinguished into longitudinal and lateral; and where these three meet, and where the fourth process passes off, we observe a fourth sinus, which is called circular; Herophilus, who first described it, having supposed that the blood at the union of these two veins, is, as it were, in a press.\n\nBesides these four canals, which were known to the ancients, modern anatomists enumerate many others, by giving the appellation of sinuses to other veins of the dura mater, which for the most part empty themselves into some of those we have just now described. There are the inferior longitudinal sinus, the superior and inferior petrous sinuses, the cavernous sinuses, the circular sinus, and the anterior and posterior occipital sinuses.\n\nThese sinuses or veins, by being conveyed through a thick dense membrane, firmly suspended, as the dura mater is, within the cranium, are less liable to rupture; at the same time they are well supported, and by running everywhere along the inner surface of the bones, they are prevented from pressing on the substance of the brain. To prevent too great a dilatation of them, we find filaments (called choroides Willisi) from their having been first noticed by Willis) stretched across their cavities; and the oblique manner in which the veins from the brain run through the substance of the brain into these channels, serves the purpose of a valve, which prevents the blood from turning back into the smaller and weaker vessels of the brain.\n\nThe pia mater is a much softer and finer membrane than the dura mater; being exceedingly delicate, transparent, and vascular. It invests every part of the brain, and sends off an infinite number of elongations, which infuse themselves between the convolutions, and even into the substance of the brain. This membrane is composed of two laminae; of which the exterior one is named tunica arachnoidea from its thinness, which is equal to that of a spider's web. These two laminae are intimately adherent to each other, at the upper part of the brain, but are easily separable at the basis of the brain, and through the whole length of the medulla spinalis. The external layer, or tunica arachnoidea, appears to be spread uniformly over the surface of the brain, but without entering into its furrows as the inner layer does; the latter being found to infuse itself between the convolutions, and even into the interior cavities of the brain. The blood vessels of the brain are distributed through it in their way to that organ, and are therefore divided into very minute ramifications, before they penetrate the substance of the brain.\n\nThere are several parts included under the general denomination of brain. One of these, which is of the softest consistence, and fills the greatest part of the cavity of the cranium, is the cerebrum, or brain properly so called. Another portion, which is seated in the inferior and posterior part of the head, is the cerebellum; and a third, which derives its origin from both these, is the medulla oblongata.\n\nThe cerebrum is a medullary mass of moderate consistence, filling up exactly all the upper part of the cavity of the cranium, and divided into two hemispheres by the falx of the dura mater. Each of these hemispheres is usually distinguished into an interior, a middle, and a posterior lobe. The first of these is lodged on the orbital processes of the os frontis; the middle lobes lie in the middle fossa of the basis of the cranium, and the posterior lobes are placed on the transverse septum of the os occipitis, immediately over the cerebellum, from which they are separated by the lateral processes of the dura mater. These two portions afford no distinguishing mark of separation; and on this account Haller, and many other modern anatomists, omit the distinction of the middle lobe, and speak only of the anterior and posterior lobes of the brain.\n\nThe cerebrum appears to be composed of two distinct substances. Of these, the exterior one, which is of a grayish or ash colour, is called the cortex, and is somewhat softer than the other, which is very white, and is called medulla, or sublantia alba.\n\nAfter having removed the falx, and separated the two hemispheres from each other, we perceive a white convex body, the corpus callosum, which is a portion of the medullary substance, uniting the two hemispheres to each other, and not invested by the cortex. By making a horizontal incision into the brain, on a level with this corpus callosum, we discover two oblong cavities, named the anterior or lateral ventricles, one in each hemisphere. These two ventricles, which communicate with each other by a hole immediately under the plexus choroides, are separated laterally by a very fine medullary partition, called septum lucidum, from its thinness and transparency. The lower edge of this septum is fixed to the fornix, which is a kind of medullary arch (as its name implies) situated under the corpus callosum, and nearly of a triangular shape. Anteriorly the fornix sends off two medullary chords, called its anterior crura; which seem to be united to each other by a portion of medullary substance, named commissura anterior cerebri. These crura diverging from one another, are lost at the outer side of the lower and fore part of the third ventricle. Posteriorly the fornix is formed into two other crura, which unite with\nwith two medullary protuberances called pedes hippocampi, and sometimes cornua ammonis, that extend along the back part of the lateral ventricles. The concave edge of the pedes hippocampi is covered by a medullary lamina, called corpus fimbriatum.\n\nNeither the edges of the fornix, nor its posterior crura, can be well distinguished, till we have removed the plexus choroides. This is a production of the pia mater, which is spread over the lateral ventricles. Its loofe edges are collected, so as to appear like a vacuolar band on each side.\n\nWhen we have removed this plexus, we discover several other protuberances included in the lateral ventricles. These are the corpora striata, the thalami nervorum opticorum, the tubercula quadrugemina, and the pineal gland.\n\nThe corpora striata are two curved oblong eminences, that extend along the anterior part of the lateral ventricles. They derive their name from their striated appearance, which is owing to an intermixture of the cortical and medullary substances of the brain. The thalami nervorum opticorum, are so called, because the optic nerves arise chiefly from them, and they are likewise composed both of the cortex and medulla. They are separated from the corpora striata only by a kind of medullary chord, the gemininum centrum semicirculare. The thalami are nearly of an oval shape, and are situated at the bottom of the upper cavity of the lateral ventricles. They are closely united, and at their convex part seem to become one body.\n\nAnteriorly, in the space between the thalami, we observe an orifice by which the lateral ventricles communicate, and another leads down from this, under the different appellations of foramen commune anterius, vulva, iter ad infundibulum, but more properly iter ad tertium ventriculum; and the separation of the thalami from each other posteriorly, forms another opening or interstice called anus. This has been supposed to communicate with the third ventricle; but it does not, the bottom of it being shut up by the pia mater. The back part of the anus is formed by a kind of medullary band, which connects the thalami to each other, and is called commissura posterior cerebri.\n\nBehind the thalami and commissura posterior, we observe a small, soft, grayish, and oval body, about the size of a pea. This is the glandula pinealis; it is described by Galen under the name of conarium, and has been rendered famous by Descartes, who supposed it to be the seat of the soul. Galen seems formerly to have entertained the same opinion. Some modern writers have, with as little reason, imagined that the soul is placed in the corpus callosum.\n\nThe pineal gland rests upon four remarkable eminences, disposed in pairs, and seated immediately below it. These tubercles, which by the ancients were called testes and nates, have, since the time of Winiford, been more commonly named tubercula quadrugemina.\n\nUnder the thalami we observe another cavity, the third ventricle, which terminates anteriorly in a small medullary canal, the infundibulum, that leads to the glandula pituitaria. It has been doubted, whether the infundibulum is really hollow; but some late experiments on this part of the brain by Professor Murray of Upsal, clearly prove it to be a medullary canal, surrounded by both laminae of the pia mater. After freezing the brain, this channel was found filled with ice; Cerebr. De Haen tells us, he found it dilated, and filled with a calcareous matter (n).\n\nThe soft spongy body in which the infundibulum terminates, was by the ancients supposed to be of a glandular structure, and destined to filter the serosity of the brain. Spigelius pretended to have discovered its excretory duct, but it seems certain that no such duct exists. It is of an oblong shape, composed, as it were of two lobes. In ruminant animals it is much larger than in man.\n\nFrom the posterior part of the third ventricle, we see a small groove or channel, descending obliquely backwards. This channel, which is called the aqueduct of Sylvius, though it was known to the ancients, opens into another cavity of the brain, placed between the cerebellum and medulla oblongata, and called the fourth ventricle.\n\nThe cerebellum, which is divided into two lobes, is commonly supposed to be of a firmer texture than the cerebrum; but the truth is, that in the greater number of subjects, there appears to be no sensible difference in the consistence of these two parts. It has more of the cortical than of the medullary substance in its composition.\n\nThe furrow that divides the two lobes of the cerebellum leads anteriorly to a process, composed of medullary and cortical substances, covered by the pia mater; and which, from its being divided into numerous furrows, resembling the rings of the earth worm, is named processus vermiformis. This process forms a kind of ring in its course between the lobes.\n\nThe surface of the cerebellum does not afford those circumvolutions which appear in the cerebrum; but instead of these, we observe a great number of minute furrows, running parallel to each other, and nearly in a transverse direction. The pia mater infinuates itself into these furrows.\n\nWhen we cut into the substance of the cerebellum, from above downwards, we find the medullary part running in a kind of ramifying course, and exhibiting an appearance that has gotten the name of arbor vitae. These ramifications unite to form a medullary trunk; the middle, anterior, and most considerable part of which forms two processes, the crura cerebri, which unite with the crura cerebri, to form the medulla oblongata. The rest furnishes two other processes, which lofe themselves under the nates, and thus unite the lobes of the cerebellum to the posterior part of the cerebrum. Under the nates we observe a transverse medullary line, or linea alba, running from one of these processes to the other; and between them we find a very thin medullary lamina, covered with the pia mater, which the generality of anatomists have (though seemingly without reason) considered as a valve formed for closing the communication between the fourth ventricle.\n\n(n) The under part of it, however, appears to be impervious; at least no injection that can be depended on has been made to pass from it into the glandula pituitaria without laceration of parts.\ntricle and the aqueductus Sylvii. Vieussens named it valvula major cerebri.\n\nThe medulla oblongata is situated in the middle, lower, and posterior part of the cranium, and may be considered as a production or continuation of the whole medullary substance of the cerebrum and cerebellum, being formed by the union of two considerable medullary processes of the cerebrum, called crura cerebri, with two other smaller ones from the cerebellum, which were just now spoken of under the name of crura cerebelli.\n\nThe crura cerebri arise from the middle and lower part of each hemisphere. They are separated from each other at their origin, but are united below, where they terminate in a middle protuberance, the pons Varolii, so called, because Varolius compared it to a bridge. This name, however, can convey no idea of its real appearance. It is, in fact, nothing more than a medullary protuberance, nearly of a semispherical shape, which unites the crura cerebri to those of the cerebellum.\n\nBetween the crura cerebri, and near the anterior edge of the pons Varolii, are two tubercles, composed externally of medullary, and internally of cineritious substance, to which Eustachius first gave the name of eminentiae mamillares.\n\nAlong the middle of the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata, where it forms the anterior part of the fourth ventricle, we observe a kind of furrow which runs downwards and terminates in a point. About an inch above the lower extremity of this fissure, several medullary filaments are to be seen running towards it on each side in an oblique direction, so as to give it the appearance of a writing pen; hence it is called calamus scriptriorum.\n\nFrom the posterior part of the pons Varolii, the medulla oblongata descends obliquely backwards; at its fore part, immediately behind the pons Varolii, we observe two pair of eminences, which were described by Eustachius, but received no particular appellation till the time of Vieussens, who gave them the names of corpora olivaria and corpora pyramidalia. The former are the outermost, being placed one on each side. They are nearly of an oval shape, and are composed of medulla, with streaks of cortical substance. Between these are the corpora pyramidalia, each of which terminates in a point. In the human subject these four eminences are sometimes not easily distinguished.\n\nThe medulla spinalis, or spinal marrow, which is the name given to the medullary chord that is extended down the vertebral canal, from the great foramen of the occipital bone to the bottom of the last lumbar vertebra, is a continuation of the medulla oblongata. Like the other parts of the brain, it is invested by the dura and pia mater. The first of these, in its passage out of the cranium, adheres to the foramen of the os occipitis. Its connexion with the ligamentary substance that lines the cavity of the spine, is only by means of cellular membrane; but between the several vertebrae, where the nerves pass out of the spine, it sends off prolongations, which adhere strongly to the brain and vertebral ligaments. Here, as in the cranium, the dura mater has its finules or large veins. These are two in number, and are seen running on each side of the medullary column, from the foramen magnum of the os occipitis to the lowest part of the os sacrum. They communicate together by ramifying branches at each vertebra, and terminate in the vertebral, intercostal, and facial veins.\n\nThe pia mater is connected with the dura mater by means of a thin transparent substance, which from its indentations between the spinal nerves has obtained the name of ligamentum denticulatum. It is somewhat firmer than the tunica arachnoidea, but in other respects resembles that membrane. Its use is to support the spinal marrow, that it may not affect the medulla oblongata by its weight.\n\nThe spinal marrow itself is externally of a white colour; but upon cutting into it we find its middle part composed of a darker coloured mass, resembling the cortex of the brain. When the marrow has reached the fifth lumbar vertebra, it becomes extremely narrow, and at length terminates in an oblong protuberance; from the extremity of which the pia mater sends off a prolongation or ligament, resembling a nerve, that perforates the dura mater, and is fixed to the os coccygis.\n\nThe medulla spinalis gives rise to 30 or 31 pair of nerves, but they are not all of the same size, nor do they all run in the same direction. The upper ones are thinner than the rest, and are placed almost transversely: as we descend we find them running more and more obliquely downwards, till at length their course is almost perpendicular, so that the lowermost nerves exhibit an appearance that is called cauda equina, from its resemblance to a horse's tail.\n\nThe arteries that ramify through the different parts of the brain are derived from the internal carotid and from the vertebral arteries. The medulla spinalis is supplied by the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, and likewise receives branches from the cervical, the inferior and superior intercostal, the lumbar, and the facial arteries.\n\nSect. II. Of the Nerves.\n\nThe nerves are medullary chords, differing from each other in size, colour, and consistence, and deriving their origin from the medulla oblongata and medulla spinalis. There are 39, and sometimes 40, pair of these nerves; nine (o) of which originate from the medulla oblongata, and 30 or 31 from the medulla spinalis. They appear to be perfectly inelastic, and likewise to possess no irritability. If we irritate muscular fibres, they immediately contract; but nothing of this sort happens if we irritate a nerve. They carry with them a covering from the pia mater; but derive no tunic from the dura mater, as hath been generally, though erroneously, supposed, ever since the time of Galen.\n\n(o) It has been usual to describe ten pair of nerves as arising from the medulla oblongata; but as the tenth pair arise in the same manner as the other spinal nerves, Santorini, Heister, Haller, and others, seem very properly to have classed them among the nerves of the spine.\nGalen (p), the outer covering of the nerves being in fact nothing more than cellular membrane. This covering is very thick where the nerve is exposed to the action of muscles; but where it runs through a bony canal, or is secure from pressure, the cellular tunic is extremely thin, or altogether wanting. We have instances of this in the portio mollis of the auditory nerve, and in the nerves of the heart.\n\nBy elevating, carefully and gently, the brain from the basis of the cranium, we find the first nine pair arising in the following order: 1. The nervi olfactorii, distributed through the pituitary membrane, which constitutes the organ of smell. 2. The optici, which go to the eyes, where they receive the impressions of visible objects. 3. The oculorum motores, so called because they are distributed to the muscles of the eye. 4. The pathetici, distributed to the superior oblique muscles of the eyes, the motion of which is expressive of certain passions of the soul. 5. The nerves of this pair soon divide into three principal branches, and each of these has a different name. Its upper division is the ophthalmicus, which is distributed to various parts of the eyes, eyelids, forehead, nose, and integuments of the face. The second is called the maxillaris superior, and the third maxillaris inferior; both which names allude to their distribution. 6. The abducens, each of these nerves is distributed to the abductor muscle of the eye, so called, because it helps to draw the globe of the eye from the nose. 7. The auditorii (q.), which are distributed through the organs of hearing. 8. The par vagum, which derives its name from the great number of parts, to which it gives branches both in the thorax and abdomen. 9. The linguales, or hypoglossi, which are distributed to the tongue, and appear to contribute both to the organ of taste and to the motions of the tongue (r).\n\nIt has already been observed, that the spinal marrow sends off 30 or 31 pair of nerves; these are chiefly distributed to the exterior parts of the trunk and to the extremities. They are commonly distinguished into the cervical, dorsal, lumbar, and sacral nerves. The cervical, which pass out from between the several vertebrae of the neck, are eight (s) in number; the dorsal, twelve; the lumbar, five; and the sacral, five or six, the number of the latter depending on the number of holes in the os sacrum. Each spinal nerve at its origin is composed of two fasciculi of medullary fibres. One of these fasciculi arises from the anterior, and the other from the posterior, surface of the medulla. These fasciculi are separated by the ligamentum denticulatum; after which we find them contiguous to one another. They then perforate the dura mater, and unite to form a considerable knot or ganglion. Each of these ganglia sends off two branches; one anterior, and the other posterior. The anterior branches communicate with each other at their coming out of the spine, and likewise send off one, and sometimes more branches, to assist in the formation of the intercostal nerve.\n\nThe knots or ganglia of the nerves just now spoken of, are not only to be met with at their exit from the spine, but likewise in various parts of the body. They occur in the nerves of the medulla oblongata, as well as in those of the spine. They are not the effects of disease, but are to be met with in the same parts of the same nerves, both in the fetus and adult. They are commonly of an oblong shape, and of a greyish colour, somewhat inclined to red, which is perhaps owing to their being extremely vacuolar. Internally we are able to distinguish something like an intermixture of the nervous filaments.\n\nSome writers have considered them as so many little brains; Lancisi fancied he had discovered muscular fibres in them, but they are certainly not of an irritable nature. A late writer, Dr Johnstone*, imagines* Effay on the Life of the Ganglia of the Nervous System. they are intended to deprive us of the power of the will over certain parts, as the heart, for instance; but if this hypothesis were well founded, we should meet with them only in nerves leading to involuntary muscles; whereas it is certain, that the voluntary muscles receive their nerves through ganglia. Dr Monro, from observing the accurate intermixture of the minute nerves which compose them, considers them as new sources of nervous energy †.\n\n(p) Baron Haller and Professor Zinn seem to have been the first who demonstrated, that the dura mater is reflected upon and adheres to the periosteum at the edges of the foramina that afford a passage to the nerves out of the cranium and vertebral canal, or is soon lost in the cellular substance.\n\n(q) This pair, soon after its entrance into the meatus auditorius internus, separates into two branches. One of these is of a very soft and pulpy consistence, is called the portio mollis of the seventh pair, and is spread over the inner part of the ear. The other passes out through the aqueduct of Fallopian in a firm chord, which is distinguished as the portio dura, and is distributed to the external ear and other parts of the neck and face.\n\n(r) Heister has summed up the uses of these nine pair of nerves in the two following Latin verses:\n\n\"Olfacient, cernens, oculique movens, patiensque,\n\"Gustans, abducens, audiensque, vagansque, loquensque.\"\n\n(s) Besides these, there is another pair called accessorii, which arises from the medulla spinalis at its beginning; and ascending through the great foramen of the os occipitis into the cranium, passes out again close to the eighth pair, with which, however, it does not unite; and it is afterwards distributed chiefly to the muscles of the neck, back, and scapula. In this course it sends off filaments to different parts, and likewise communicates with several other nerves. Physiologists are at a loss how to account for the singular origin and course of these nerves accessorii. The ancients considered them as branches of the eighth pair, distributed to muscles of the scapula; Willis likewise considered them as appendages to that pair, and on that account named them accessorii. They are sometimes called the spinal pair; but as this latter name is applicable to all the nerves of the spine indiscriminately, it seems better to adopt that given by Willis.\nThe nerves, like the blood vessels, in their course through the body, communicate with each other; and each of these communications constitutes what is called a plexus, from whence branches are again detached to different parts of the body. Some of these are constant and considerable enough to be distinguished by particular names, as the femoral plexus, the pulmonary plexus, the hepatic, the cardiac, &c.\n\nIt would be foreign to the purpose of this work to follow the nerves through all their distributions; but it may be remembered, that in describing the different viscera, mention was made of the nerves distributed to them. There is one pair, however, called the intercostal, or great sympathetic nerve, which seems to require particular notice, because it has an almost universal connexion and correspondence with all the other nerves of the body. Authors are not perfectly agreed about the origin of the intercostal; but it may perhaps not improperly be described, as beginning from filaments of the fifth and sixth pair; it then passes out of the cranium, through the bony canal of the carotid, from whence it descends laterally close to the bodies of the vertebrae, and receives branches from almost all the vertebral nerves; forming almost as many ganglions in its course through the thorax and abdomen. It sends off an infinite number of branches to the viscera in those cavities, and forms several plexus with the branches of the eighth pair or par vagum.\n\nThat the nerves are destined to convey the principles of motion and sensibility to the brain from all parts of the system, there can be no doubt; but how these effects are produced, no one has ever yet been able to determine. The inquiry has been a constant source of hypothesis in all ages, and has produced some ingenious ideas, and many erroneous positions, but without having hitherto afforded much satisfactory information.\n\nSome physiologists have considered a trunk of nerves as a solid chord, capable of being divided into an infinite number of filaments, by means of which the impressions of feeling are conveyed to the fenorium commune. Others have supposed it to be a canal, which afterwards separates into more minute channels; or, perhaps, as being an assemblage of many very small and distinct tubes, connected to each other, and thus forming a cylindrical chord. They who contend for their being solid bodies, are of opinion, that feeling is occasioned by vibration; so that, for instance, according to this system, by pricking the finger, a vibration would be occasioned in the nerve, distributed through its substance; and the effects of this vibration, when extended to the fenorium, would be an excitant of pain. But the inefficacy, the softness, the connexion, and the situation of the nerves, are so many proofs that vibration has no share in the cause of feeling.\n\nOthers have supposed, that in the brain and spinal marrow a very subtle fluid is secreted, and from thence conveyed through the imperceptible tubes, which they consider as existing in the nerves. They have further supposed, that this very subtle fluid, to which they have given the name of animal spirits, is secreted in the cortical substance of the brain and spinal marrow, from whence it passes through the medullary substance. This, like the other system, is founded altogether on hypothesis; but it seems to be a hypothesis derived from much more probable principles, and there are many ingenious arguments to be brought in its support.\n\nEXPLANATION OF PLATE XXXI.\n\nFig. 1.

VI. OF THE SENSES, AND THEIR ORGANS.\n\nIN treating of the senses, we mean to confine ourselves to the external ones of touch, taste, smelling, hearing, and vision. The word sense, when applied to these five, seems to imply not only the sensation excited in the mind by certain impressions made on the body, but likewise the organ destined to receive and transmit these impressions to the sensorium. Each of these organs being of a peculiar structure, is susceptible only of particular impressions, which will be pointed out as we proceed to describe each of them separately.\n\nSECT. I. Of Touch.\n\nThe sense of touch may be defined to be the faculty of distinguishing certain properties of bodies by the feel. In a general acceptation, this definition might perhaps not improperly be extended to every part of the body possessed of sensibility (†), but it is commonly confined to the nervous papillae of the cutis, or true skin, which, with its appendages, and their several uses, have been already described.\n\nThe exterior properties of bodies, such as their solidity, moisture, inequality, smoothness, dryness, or fluidity, and likewise their degree of heat, seem all to be capable of making different impressions on the papilla; and consequently of exciting different ideas in the sensorium commune. But the organ of touch, like all the other senses, is not equally delicate in every part of the body, or in every subject; being in some much more exquisite than it is in others.\n\nSECT. II. Of Taste.\n\nThe sense of taste is seated chiefly in the tongue; the situation and figure of which are sufficiently known.\n\nOn the upper surface of this organ we may observe a great number of papillae, which, on account of their difference in size and shape, are commonly divided into three classes. The largest are situated towards the basis of the tongue. Their number commonly varies from seven to nine, and they seem to be mucous follicles, and of a cylindrical shape. They are most numerous about the middle of the tongue. Those of the third class are very minute, and of a conical shape. They are\n\n(†) In the course of this article, mention has often been made of the sensibility or insensibility of different parts of the body; it will therefore, perhaps, not be amiss to observe in this place, that many parts which were formerly supposed to possess the most exquisite sense, are now known to have but little or no feeling, at least in a sound state; for in an inflamed state, even the bones, the most inflexible parts of any, become susceptible of the most painful sensations. This curious discovery is due to the late Baron Haller. His experiments prove, that the bones, cartilages, ligaments, tendons, epidermis, and membranes (as the pleura, pericardium, dura, and pia mater, periosteum, &c.), may in a healthy state be considered as insensible. As sensibility depends on the brain and nerves, of course different parts will possess a greater or less degree of feeling, in proportion as they are supplied with a greater or smaller number of nerves. Upon this principle it is, that the skin, muscles, stomach, intestines, urinary bladder, ureters, uterus, vagina, penis, tongue, and retina, are extremely sensible, while the lungs and glands have only an obscure degree of feeling.\nare very numerous on the apex and edges of the tongue, and have been supposed to be formed by the extremities of its nerves.\n\nWe observe a line, the linea linguae mediana, running along the middle of the tongue, and dividing it as it were into two portions. Towards the basis of the tongue, we meet with a little cavity, named by Morgagni foramen cæcum, which seems to be nothing more than a common termination of some of the excretory ducts of mucous glands situated within the substance of the tongue.\n\nWe have already observed, that this organ is everywhere covered by the cuticle, which, by forming a duplication, called the frenum, at its under part, serves to prevent the too great motion of the tongue, and to fix it in its situation. But, besides this attachment, the tongue is connected, by means of its muscles and membranous ligaments, to the lower jaw, the os hyoides, and the styloid processes.\n\nThe principal arteries of the tongue are the linguals, which arise from the external carotid. Its veins empty themselves into the external jugulars. Its nerves arise from the fifth, eighth, and ninth pair.\n\nThe variety of tastes seems to be occasioned by the different impressions made on the papillae by the food. The different state of the papillae with respect to their moisture, their figure, or their covering, seems to produce a considerable difference in the taste, not only in different people, but in the same subject, in sickness and in health. The great use of the taste seems to be to enable us to distinguish wholesome and salutary food from that which is unhealthy; and we observe that many quadrupeds, by having their papillæ (u) very large and long, have the faculty of distinguishing flavours with infinite accuracy.\n\nSect. III. Of Smelling.\n\nThe sense of smelling, like the sense of taste, seems intended to direct us to a proper choice of aliment, and is chiefly seated in the nose, which is distinguished into its external and internal parts. The situation and figure of the former of these do not seem to require a definition. It is composed of bones and cartilages, covered by muscular fibres and by the common integuments. The bones make up the upper portion, and the cartilages the lower one. The septum narium, like the nose, is likewise in part bony, and in part cartilaginous. These bones and their connexions were described in the osteology.\n\nThe internal part of the nose, besides the osa spongiosa, has six cavities or sinuses, the maxillary, the frontal, and the sphenoid, which were all described with the bones of the head. They all open into the nostrils; and the nose likewise communicates with the mouth, larynx, and pharynx, posteriorly behind the velum palati.\n\nAll these several parts, which are included in the internal division of the nose, viz. the inner surface of the nostrils, the lamellæ of the osa spongiosa and the sinus—\n\n(u) Malpighi's description of the papillæ, which has been copied by many anatomical writers, seems to have been taken chiefly from the tongues of sheep.\n\nSect. IV. Of Hearing.\n\nBefore we undertake to explain the manner in which we are enabled to receive the impressions of sound, it will be necessary to describe the ear, which is the organ of hearing. It is commonly distinguished into external and internal. The former of these divisions includes all that we are able to discover without dissection, and the meatus auditorius, as far as the tympanum; and the latter, all the other parts of the ear.\n\nThe external ear is a cartilaginous funnel, covered by the common integuments, and attached, by means of its ligaments and muscles, to the temporal bone. Although...\nAlthough capable only of a very obscure motion, it is found to have several muscles. Different parts of it are distinguished by different names; all its cartilaginous part is called ala or wing, to distinguish it from the soft and pendent part below, called the lobe. Its outer circle or border is called helix, and the semicircle within this, antihelix. The moveable cartilage placed immediately before the meatus auditorius, which it may be made to close exactly, is named tragus; and an eminence opposite to this at the extremity of the antihelix, is called antitragus. The concha is a considerable cavity formed by the extremities of the helix and antihelix. The meatus auditorius, which at its opening is cartilaginous, is lined with a very thin membrane, which is a continuation of the cuticle from the surface of the ear.\n\nIn this canal we find a yellow wax, which is secreted by a number of minute glands or follicles, each of which has an excretory duct. This secretion, which is at first of an oily consistence, defends the membrane of the tympanum from the injuries of the air; and, by its bitterness, prevents minute insects from entering into the ear. But when from neglect or disease it accumulates in too great a quantity, it sometimes occasions deafness. The inner extremity of the meatus is closed by a very thin transparent membrane, the membrana tympani, which is set in a bony circle like the head of a drum. In the last century Riviinus, professor at Leipzig, fancied he had discovered a hole in this membrane, surrounded by a sphincter, and affording a passage to the air, between the external and internal ear. Cuvier, Heister, and some other anatomists, have admitted this supposed foramen, which certainly does not exist. Whenever there is any opening in the membrana tympani, it may be considered as accidental. Under the membrana tympani runs a branch of the fifth pair of nerves, called chorda tympani; and beyond this membrane is the cavity of the tympanum, which is about seven or eight lines wide, and half so many in depth; it is semispherical, and everywhere lined by a very fine membrane. There are four openings to be observed in this cavity. It communicates with the mouth by means of the Eustachian tube. This canal, which is in part bony and in part cartilaginous, begins by a very narrow opening at the anterior and almost superior part of the tympanum, increasing in size as it advances towards the palate of the mouth, where it terminates by an oval opening. This tube is everywhere lined by the same membrane that covers the inside of the mouth. The real use of this canal does not seem to have been hitherto satisfactorily ascertained; but found would seem to be conveyed through it to the membrana tympani, deaf persons being often observed to listen attentively with their mouths open. Opposite to this is a minute passage, which leads to the sinuosity of the mastoid process; and the two other openings, which are in the internal process of the os petrosum, are the fenestra ovalis, and fenestra rotunda, both of which are covered by a very fine membrane.\n\nThere are three distinct bones in the cavity of the tympanum; and these are the malleus, incus, and stapes. Besides these there is a fourth, which is the os orbiculare considered by some anatomists as a process of the flaps, which is necessarily broken off by the violence we are obliged to use in getting at these bones; but when accurately considered, it seems to be a distinct bone.\n\nThe malleus is supposed to resemble a hammer, being larger at one extremity, which is its head, than it is at the other, which is its handle. The latter is attached to the membrana tympani, and the head of the bone is articulated with the incus.\n\nThe incus, as it is called from its shape, though it seems to have less resemblance to an anvil than to one of the dentes molares with its roots widely separated from each other, is distinguished into its body and its legs. One of its legs is placed at the entry of the canal which leads to the mastoid process; and the other, which is somewhat longer, is articulated with the flaps, or rather with the os orbiculare, which is placed between them.\n\nThe third bone is very properly named flaps, being perfectly shaped like a flirrup. Its basis is fixed into the fenestra ovalis, and its upper part is articulated with the os orbiculare. What is called the fenestra rotunda, though perhaps improperly, as it is more oval than round, is observed a little above the other, in an eminence formed by the os petrosum, and is closed by a continuation of the membrane that lines the inner surface of the tympanum. The flaps and malleus are each of them furnished with a little muscle the flapeus and tensor tympani. The first of these, which is the smallest in the body, arises from a little cavern in the posterior and upper part of the cavity of the tympanum; and its tendon, after passing through a hole in the same cavern, is inserted at the back part of the head of the flaps. This muscle, by drawing the flaps obliquely upwards, assists in stretching the membrana tympani.\n\nThe tensor tympani (x), or internus mallei as it is called by some writers, arises from the cartilaginous extremity of the Eustachian tube, and is inserted into the back part of the handle of the malleus, which it serves to pull inwards, and of course helps to stretch the membrana tympani.\n\nThe labyrinth is the only part of the ear which remains to be described. It is situated in the os petrosum, and is separated from the tympanum by a partition which is everywhere bony, except at the two fenestrae. It is composed of three parts; and these are the vestibulum, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea.\n\nThe vestibulum is an irregular cavity, much smaller than the tympanum, situated nearly in the centre of the os petrosum, between the tympanum, the cochlea, and the semicircular canals. It is open on the side of the tympanum by means of the fenestra ovalis, and communicates with the upper portion of the cochlea by an oblong\n\n(x) Some anatomists describe three muscles of the malleus; but only this one seems to deserve the name of muscle; what are called the externus and obliquus mallei seeming to be ligaments rather than muscles.\noblong foramen, which is under the fenestra ovalis, from which it is separated only by a very thin partition.\n\nEach of the three semicircular canals forms about half a circle of nearly a line in diameter, and running each in a different direction, they are distinguished into vertical, oblique, and horizontal. These three canals open by both their extremities into the vestibulum; but the vertical and the oblique being united together at one of their extremities, there are only five orifices to be seen in the vestibulum.\n\nThe cochlea is a canal which takes a spiral course, not unlike the shell of a snail. From its basis to its apex it makes two turns and a half; and is divided into two canals by a very thin lamina or septum, which is in part bony and in part membranous, in such a manner that these two canals only communicate with each other at the point. One of them opens into the vestibulum, and the other is covered by the membrane that closes the fenestra rotunda. The bony lamella which separates the two canals is exceedingly thin, and fills about two-thirds of the diameter of the canal. The rest of the septum is composed of a soft delicate membrane, which lines the whole inner surface of the cochlea, and seems to form this division in the same manner as the two membranous bags of the pleura, by being applied to each other, form the mediastinum.\n\nEvery part of the labyrinth is furnished with a very delicate peritoneum, and filled with a watery fluid, secreted as in other cavities. This fluid transmits to the nerves the vibrations it receives from the membrane closing the fenestra rotunda, and from the basis of the stapes, where it rests on the fenestra ovalis. When this fluid is collected in too great a quantity, or is compressed by the stapes, it is supposed to escape through two minute canals or aqueducts, lately described by Dr. Coturni*, an ingenious physician at Naples.\n\nOne of these aqueducts opens into the bottom of the vestibulum, and the other into the cochlea, near the fenestra rotunda. They both pass through the os petrosum, and communicate with the cavity of the cranium where the fluid that passes through them is absorbed; and they are lined by a membrane which is supposed to be a production of the dura mater.\n\nThe arteries of the external ear come from the temporal and other branches of the external carotid, and its veins pass into the jugular. The internal ear receives branches of arteries from the basilar and carotids, and its veins empty themselves into the sinuses of the dura mater, and into the internal jugular.\n\nThe portio mollis of the seventh pair is distributed through the cochlea, the vestibulum, and the semicircular canals; and the portio dura sends off a branch to the tympanum, and other branches to the external ear and parts near it.\n\nThe sense of hearing, in producing which all the parts we have described assist, is occasioned by a certain modulation of the air collected by the funnel-like shape of the external ear, and conveyed through the meatus auditorius to the membrana tympani. That sound is propagated by means of the air, is very easily proved by ringing a bell under the receiver of an air pump; the sound it affords being found to diminish gradually as the air becomes exhausted, till at length it ceases to be heard at all. Sound moves through the air with infinite velocity; but the degree of its motion seems to depend on the state of the air, as it constantly moves faster in a dense and dry, than it does in a moist and rarefied air.\n\nThat the air vibrating on the membrana tympani communicates its vibration to the different parts of the labyrinth, and by means of the fluid contained in this cavity affects the auditory nerve so as to produce sound, seems to be very probable; but the situation, the minutest, and the variety of the parts which compose the ear, do not permit much to be advanced with certainty concerning their mode of action.\n\nSome of these parts seem to constitute the immediate organ of hearing, and these are all the parts of the vestibulum: but there are others which seem intended for the perfection of this sense, without being absolutely essential to it. It has happened, for instance, that the membrana tympani, and the little bones of the ear, have been destroyed by disease, without depriving the patient of the sense of hearing (y).\n\nSound is more or less loud in proportion to the strength of the vibration; and the variety of sounds seems to depend on the difference of this vibration; for the more quick and frequent it is, the more acute will be the sound, and vice versa.\n\nBefore we conclude this article, it will be right to explain certain phenomena, which will be found to have a relation to the organ of hearing.\n\nEvery body has, in consequence of particular sounds, occasionally felt that disagreeable sensation which is usually called setting the teeth on edge; and the cause of this sensation may be traced to the communication which the portio dura of the auditory nerve has with the branches of the fifth pair that are distributed to the teeth, being probably occasioned by the violent tremor produced in the membrana tympani by these very acute sounds. Upon the same principle we may explain the strong idea of sound which a person has who holds a vibrating string between his teeth.\n\nThe humming which is sometimes perceived in the ear, without any exterior cause, may be occasioned either by an increased action of the arteries in the ears, or by convulsive contractions of the muscles of the malleus and stapes, affecting the auditory nerve in such a manner as to produce the idea of sound. An ingenious philosophical writer* has lately discovered, that there are sounds liable to be excited in the ear by irritation, and without any assistance from the vibrations of the air.\n\n(y) This observation has led to a supposition, that a perforation of this membrane may in some cases of deafness be useful; and Mr. Chefelden relates, that some years ago, a malefactor was pardoned, on condition, that he should submit to this operation; but the public clamour raised against it was so great, that it was thought right not to perform it.\nThe eyes, which constitute the organ of vision, are situated in two bony cavities named orbitae, where they are surrounded by several parts, which are either intended to protect them from external injury, or to assist in their motion.\n\nThe globe of the eye is immediately covered by two eyelids or palpebrae, which are composed of muscular fibres, covered by the common integuments, and lined by a very fine and smooth membrane, which is from thence extended over part of the globe of the eye, and is called tunica conjunctiva. Each eyelid is cartilaginous at its edge; and this border, which is called tarsus, is furnished with a row of hairs named cilia or eyelashes.\n\nThe cilia serve to protect the eye from insects and minute bodies floating in the air, and likewise to moderate the action of the rays of light in their passage to the retina. At the roots of these hairs there are sebaceous follicles, first noticed by Meibomius, which discharge a glutinous liniment. Sometimes the fluid they secrete has too much viscosity, and the eyelids become glued to each other.\n\nThe upper border of the orbit is covered by the eyebrows or supercilia, which by means of their two muscles are capable of being brought towards each other, or of being carried upwards. They have been considered as serving to protect the eyes, but they are probably intended more for ornament than utility (z).\n\nThe orbits, in which the eyes are placed, are furnished with a good deal of fat, which affords a soft bed on which the eye performs its several motions. The inner angle of each orbit, or that part of it which is near the nose, is called canthus major, or the great angle; and the outer angle, which is on the opposite side of the eye, is the canthus minor, or little angle.\n\nThe little reddish body which we observe in the great angle of the eyelids, and which is called caruncula lacrymalis, is supposed to be of a glandular structure, and, like the follicles of the eyelids, to secrete an oily humour. But its structure and use do not seem to have been hitherto accurately determined. The surface of the eye is constantly moistened by a very fine limpid fluid called the tears, which is chiefly, and perhaps wholly, derived from a large gland of the conglomerate kind, situated in a small depression of the os frontis near the outer angle of the eye. Its excretory ducts pierce the tunica conjunctiva just above the cartilaginous borders of the upper eyelids. When the tears were supposed to be secreted by the caruncle, this gland was called glandula innominata; but now that its structure and uses are ascertained, it very properly has the name of glandula lacrymalis. The tears pour out by the ducts of this gland are, in a natural and healthy state, incessantly spread over the surface of the eye, to keep it clear and transparent by means of the eyelids, and as constantly pass out at the opposite corner of the eye or inner angle, through two minute orifices, the puncta lachrymalia (a); being determined into these little openings by a reduplication of the tunica conjunctiva, shaped like a crescent, the two points of which answer to the puncta. This reduplication is named membrana, or valvula semilunaris. Each of these puncta is the beginning of a small excretory tube, through which the tears pass into a little pouch or reservoir, the sacculus lacrymalis, which lies in an excavation formed partly by the nasal process of the os maxillare superius, and partly by the os unguis. The lower part of this sac forms a duct called the ductus ad nares, which is continued through a bony channel, and opens into the nose, through which the tears are occasionally discharged (b).\n\nThe motions of the eye are performed by six muscles; four of which are straight and two oblique. The straight muscles are distinguished by the names of elevator, depressor, adductor, and abductor, from their several uses in elevating and depressing the eye, drawing it towards the nose, or carrying it from the nose towards the temple. All these four muscles arise from the bottom of the orbit, and are inserted by flat tendons into the globe of the eye. The oblique muscles are intended for the more compound motions of the eye. The first of these muscles, the obliquus superior, does not, like the other four muscles we have described, arise from the bottom of the orbit, but from the edge of the foramen that transmits the optic nerve, which separates the origin of this muscle from that of the others. From this beginning it passes in a straight line towards a very small cartilaginous ring, the situation of which is marked in the skeleton by a little hollow in the internal orbital processes of the os frontis. The tendon of the muscle, after passing through this ring, is inserted into the upper part of the globe of the eye, which it serves to draw forwards, at the same time turning the pupil downwards.\n\nThe obliquus inferior arises from the edge of the orbit, under the opening of the ductus lacrymalis; and is inserted somewhat posteriorly into the outer side of the globe, serving to draw the eye forwards and turn the pupil upwards. When either of these two muscles act separately, the eye is moved on its axis; but when they act together, it is compressed both above and below. The eye itself, which is now to be described, with its tunics, humours, and component parts, is nearly of a spherical figure. Of its tunics, the conjunctiva has been already described as a partial covering, reflected from the inner surface of the eyelids over the anterior portion of the eye. What has been\n\n(z) It is observable, that the eyebrows are peculiar to the human species.\n\n(a) It sometimes happens, that this very pellucid fluid, which moistens the eye, being poured out through the excretory ducts of the lacrymal gland faster than it can be carried off through the puncta, trickles down the cheek, and is then strictly and properly called tears.\n\n(b) When the ductus ad nares becomes obstructed in consequence of disease, the tears are no longer able to pass into the nostrils; the sacculus lacrymalis becomes distended; and inflammation, and sometimes ulceration, taking place, constitute the disease called fistula lacrymalis.\nnamed alluginea cannot properly be considered as a coat of the eye, being in fact nothing more than the tendons of the straight muscles spread over some parts of the sclerotica.\n\nThe immediate tunics of the eye, which are to be demonstrated when its partial coverings, and all the other parts with which it is surrounded, are removed, are the sclerotica, cornea, choroides, and retina.\n\nThe sclerotica, which is the exterior coat, is everywhere white and opaque, and is joined at its anterior edge to another, which has more convexity than any other part of the globe, and being exceedingly transparent is called cornea (c). These two parts are perfectly different in their structure; so that some anatomists suppose them to be distinct from each other as the glass of a watch is from the case into which it is fixed. The sclerotica is of a compact fibrous structure; the cornea, on the other hand, is composed of a great number of laminae united by cellular membrane. By macerating them in boiling water, they do not separate from each other, as some writers have asserted; but the cornea soon softens, and becomes of a glutinous consistence.\n\nThe ancients supposed the sclerotica to be a continuation of the dura mater. Morgagni and some other modern writers are of the same opinion; but this point is disputed by Winiford, Haller, Zinn, and others. The truth seems to be, that the sclerotica, though not a production of the dura mater, adheres intimately to that membrane.\n\nThe choroides is so called because it is furnished with a great number of vessels. It has likewise been named uvea, on account of its resemblance to a grape. Many modern anatomical writers have considered it as a production of the pia mater. This was likewise the opinion of the ancients; but the strength and thickness of the choroides, when compared with the delicate structure of the pia mater, are sufficient proofs of their being two distinct membranes.\n\nThe choroides has of late generally been described as consisting of two laminae; the innermost of which has been named after Ruych, who first described it. It is certain, however, that Ruych's distinction is ill founded, at least with respect to the human eye, in which we are unable to demonstrate any such structure, although the choroides of sheep and some other quadrupeds may easily be separated into two layers.\n\nThe choroides adheres intimately to the sclerotica round the edge of the cornea; and at the place of this union we may observe a little whitish area, named ligamentum ciliare, though it is not of a ligamentous nature.\n\nThey who suppose the choroides to be composed of two laminae, describe the external one as terminating in the ligamentum ciliare, and the internal one as extending farther to form the iris, which is the circle we are able to distinguish through the cornea; but this part is of a very different structure from the choroides; so that some late writers have perhaps not improperly considered the iris as a distinct membrane. It derives its name from the variety of its colours, and is perforated in its middle. This perforation, which is called the pupil or sight of the eye, is closed in the fetus by a very thin vascular membrane. This membrana pupillaris commonly disappears about the seventh month.\n\nOn the under side of the iris we observe many minute fibres, called ciliary processes, which pass in radii or parallel lines from the circumference to the centre. The contraction and dilatation of the pupil are supposed to depend on the action of these processes. Some have considered them as muscular, but they are not of an irritable nature; others have supposed them to be filaments of nerves; but their real structure has never yet been clearly ascertained.\n\nBesides these ciliary processes, anatomists usually speak of the circular fibres of the iris, but no such seem to exist.\n\nThe posterior surface of the iris, the ciliary processes, and part of the tunica choroides, are covered with a black mucus for the purpose of accurate and distinct vision; but the manner in which it is secreted, has not been determined.\n\nImmediately under the tunica choroides we find the third and inner coat, called the retina, which seems to be merely an expansion of the pulpy substance of the optic nerve, extending to the borders of the crystalline humour.\n\nThe greatest part of the globe of the eye, within these several tunics, is filled by a very transparent and gelatinous humour of considerable consistence, which from its supposed resemblance to fluid glass, is called the vitreous humour. It is invested by a very fine and delicate membrane, called tunica vitrea, and sometimes arachnoides.—It is supposed to be composed of two laminae; one of which dips into its substance, and by dividing the humour into cells adds to its firmness. The fore part of the vitreous humour is a little hollowed, to receive a very white and transparent substance of a firm texture, and of a lenticular and somewhat convex shape, named the crystalline humour. It is included in a capsule, which seems to be formed by a separation of the two laminae of the tunica vitrea.\n\nThe fore part of the eye is filled by a very thin and transparent fluid, named the aqueous humour, which occupies all the space between the crystalline and the prominent cornea.—That part of the choroides which is called the iris, and which comes forward to form the pupil, appears to be suspended as it were in this humour, and has occasioned this portion of the eye to be distinguished into two parts. One of these, which is the little space between the anterior surface of the crystalline and the iris, is called the posterior chamber; and the other, which is the space between the iris and the cornea, is called the anterior chamber of the eye (d).\n\n(c) Some writers, who have given the name of cornea to all this outer coat, have named what is here and most commonly called sclerotica, cornea opaca; and its anterior and transparent portion, cornea lucida.\n\n(d) We are aware that some anatomists, particularly Lieutaud, are of opinion, that the iris is everywhere in close contact with the crystalline, and that it is of course right to speak only of one chamber of the eye; but as this\nBoth these spaces are completely filled with the aqueous humour (e).\n\nThe eye receives its arteries from the internal carotid, through the foramina optica; and its veins pass through the foramina lacera, and empty themselves into the lateral sinuses. Some of the ramifications of these vessels appear on the inner surface of the iris, where they are seen to make very minute convolutions, which are sufficiently remarkable to be distinguished by the name of circulus arteriosus, though perhaps improperly, as they are chiefly branches of veins.\n\nThe optic nerve passes in at the posterior part of the eye, in a considerable trunk, to be expanded for the purposes of vision, of which it is now universally supposed to be the immediate seat. But Messrs Mariotte and Mery contended, that the choroides is the seat of this sense; and the ancients supposed the crystalline to be so. Besides the optic, the eye receives branches from the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth pair of nerves.\n\nThe humours of the eye, together with the cornea, are calculated to refract and converge the rays of light in such a manner as to form at the bottom of the eye a distinct image of the object we look at; and the point where the rays meet is called the focus of the eye. On the retina, as in a camera obscura, the object is painted in an inverted position; and it is only by habit that we are enabled to judge of its true situation, and likewise of its distance and magnitude.\n\nTo a young gentleman who was born blind, and who was couched by Mr Chefelden, every object (as he expressed himself) seemed to touch his eyes as what he felt did his skin; and he thought no objects so agreeable as those which were smooth and regular, although for some time he could form no judgment of their shape, or guess what it was in any of them that was pleasing to him.\n\nIn order to paint objects distinctly on the retina, the cornea is required to have such a degree of convexity, that the rays of light may be collected at a certain point, so as to terminate exactly on the retina.—If the cornea is too prominent, the rays, by diverging too soon, will be united before they reach the retina, as is the case with near-sighted people or myopes; and on the contrary, if it is not sufficiently convex, the rays will not be perfectly united when they reach the back part of the eye; and this happens to long-sighted people or presbyi, being found constantly to take place as we approach to old age, when the eye gradually flattens (r). These defects are to be supplied by means of glasses. He who has too prominent an eye, will find his vision improved by means of a concave glass; and upon the same principles, a convex glass will be found useful to a person whose eye is naturally too flat.\n\nEXPLANATION OF PLATE XXXII.\n\nFig. 1.

In this operation the cornea is perforated, and the aqueous humour escapes out of the eye, but it is constantly renewed again in a very short time. The manner, however, in which it is secreted has not yet been determined.\n\n(r) Upon this principle, they, who in their youth are near-sighted, may expect to see better as they advance in life, as their eyes gradually become more flat.\nHAVING fully examined and described the structure of man, we are now to take a view of that of the inferior animals, and to consider in what the rest of animated nature differs from man.\n\nComparative anatomy, was formerly, as we have shewn in the history, much more cultivated than that of the human body; but when the prejudices of bigotry and ignorance subsided, and allowed human dissection to be more freely exercised, the study of this species of anatomy was almost entirely neglected. Of late, however, it has attracted the attention of several of the most eminent naturalists and anatomists, particularly of Monro, Hunter, Vieq d'Azur, and Cuvier, from whose labours it has received considerable improvement, and has attained a degree of accuracy and an extent of application, which render it an object of inquiry highly interesting to the philosopher and the physician.\n\nMany advantages are derived from the study of comparative anatomy. First, it furnishes us with a sufficient knowledge of the several parts of animals, to prevent our being imposed on by those authors who have described and delineated many organs from brutes as belonging to the human body. That this is of importance, is evinced by examining the works of some of the earliest and greatest masters of anatomy, who, for want of human subjects, have often taken their descriptions from other animals; Galen is notoriously faulty in this respect, and the great Vesalius, though he justly reproves Galen, has fallen into the same error, as is plain from his delineations of the kidneys, the uterus, the muscles of the eye, and other parts. Nor is antiquity only chargeable with this, since in Willis's *Anatomia Cerebri* (the plates of which were revised by that accurate anatomist Dr Lower) there are several of the figures taken from different brutes, especially from the dog, besides what he acknowledges for such.\n\nSecondly, it helps us to understand several passages in the ancient writers on medicine, especially Hippocrates and Galen, who have taken many of their descriptions from brutes and reasoned from them.\n\nThirdly, it affords one of the best assistants and most certain guides in the study of natural history; and the best\nChap. I.\n\nANATOMY.\n\nGeneral variations, &c.\n\nThe best and most scientific methods of arranging the several classes of organized beings, are founded on their anatomical structure.\n\nFourthly, From comparing the organization of man with that of other animals, we derive considerable aid in our physiological researches, as many functions of the animal economy can be but imperfectly understood, without comparing in various classes the organs which are subservient to them. From a want of this comparative view, there have arisen among anatomists many disputes, which a more enlarged acquaintance with this subject has decided.\n\nTo these advantages of comparative anatomy, we may add, that it may be practised at all times and in all places; and this enables those, who from prejudice or delicacy, are withheld from the study of anatomy on the human subject, to acquire at an early rate a knowledge of this useful science, sufficient for the usual purposes of a liberal education.\n\nCHAP. I. GENERAL VARIATIONS IN THE ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONS.\n\nThe most obvious and simple function of an animal is motion, and we therefore begin with the organs by which this is produced. All animals are furnished with muscles, or muscular fibres, but a great proportion of them have nothing analogous to bone. In those which have bones, there are two striking differences; in one division they are situated within the muscles, forming an internal articulated skeleton; in the other they form an external fleshy or shelly covering, within which the muscles are included.\n\nThose animals which are furnished with articulated skeletons, constituting what is called a vertebral column, are denominated vertebral animals. Of these there are four orders, the mammalia, birds, fishes, and reptiles. All other animals, comprehending the mollusca, insects, worms, and zoophytes, may be called invertebrate animals.\n\nThe general differences in the organs of sensation are much less simple; they may be considered as reflecting the internal nervous system, and the organs of the external senses. With respect to the former, some animals appear to have no nervous system, as the zoophytes; another class has all of this internal system except the brain, situated in the same cavity with the viscera, as the mollusca, insects, and some of the articulated worms; the third and most complete class, have the common origin of the nerves situated in a cavity, distinct from that of the viscera, within the vertebral column; this comprehends all the vertebral animals.\n\nThe two first classes have the ganglia or nervous knots, (Vid. Ganglia, Anatomy) forming protuberances in the general nervous cord, as is the case with insects and some articulated worms; or have them only within the larger cavities, as the mollusca: the last division have them either on the sides of the cord, or within the cavities, or both.\n\nThe external senses differ in number and energy; all the vertebral animals agree with man in having five senses. Of the invertebrate animals, all appear to possess smell, taste, and feeling; most of the mollusca and insects, as far as is yet known, are without hearing; and the mollusca who want heads, the larvae of some insects, many of the articulated worms, and all the zoophytes, are not possessed of sight. The energy of the senses varies very considerably in different classes, and in different individuals; some, as most of the dogs, the vulture, and most of the sarcophaga, or animals which prey on carrion, have the sense of smelling extremely acute, and in these the membrane lining the nasal cavities appears to be proportionally more extended than in others. Some excel in the sense of feeling, particularly man and the monkey tribe, in whom the extremities are most divided, most delicate, and furnished with the most minute ramifications of the superficial nerves. Man, and those animals who, like man, have the power of moving the head in all directions, possess a great extent of vision, both as to circuit and distance; and these have two eyes fixed and fixed within the head: others, as most insects, which are to see minute objects near at hand, have either several eyes, or at least eyes containing several lenses. But the differences which appear in these organs will be fully noticed in comparing the several classes.\n\nThe organs of digestion furnish us with two great distinctions. Some animals, as most of the zoophytes, have only one opening to the alimentary canal, which serves both for the taking in of aliment, and the rejection of the excrement; in all others this canal has two distinct openings, at a greater or less distance from each other, according as the convolutions of this canal are more or less numerous. Another difference which has considerable influence on the nature of the aliment, adapted to the several species is, that some animals have the mouth furnished with teeth or other hard bodies, for the purpose of breaking down solids, and that others want these organs. In the latter case, the animal if its mouth be large, can swallow its food entire, or if its mouth be in the form of a tube, can only suck in fluid substances. The nature of the bodies which the animal is to masticate, is also influenced by the form of the teeth: thus some animals have only teeth formed for cutting and tearing, and therefore can only subsist on flesh, or are carnivorous; others have chiefly grinding teeth, calculated only for bruising herbs and grain, and...\nand these are herbivorous; a third class have both, and are omnivorous. This difference of aliment is attended with a correspondent difference in the structure of the alimentary canal, as to its greater or smaller length, the number of stomachs, &c.\n\nThe chyle formed from the aliment by the action of these organs, is carried to its place of destination in one of two ways; it either exudes through the sides of the alimentary canal, or it is absorbed by particular vessels, by which it is conveyed into the general circulation. The former takes place in the zoophytes, and according to Cuvier in most insects, which appear to possess no proper circulating vessels. The latter is the case in the mollusca, and in all the vertebral animals; but these have the blood red and the chyle white, while those have all the fluids of the same whitish colour. Of the vertebral animals too, the chyle is opaque in some, as the mammalia, and transparent like the lymph in others, as in birds, fishes, and reptiles.\n\nIn the organs of circulation several very important distinctions take place.\n\nSome appear to have no circulating system, as insects and zoophytes. In those which possess circulating organs, some have a double circulation, or in them all the venous blood passes through the lungs, before it again enters the arterial system, as man, mammalia, birds, fishes, and many of the mollusca; others have only a single circulation, or in these a great part of the venous blood re-enters the arterial system, without passing through the lungs, as in reptiles. The structure and position of the heart is different in various classes. In some it is double, one part serving for circulating the blood through the lungs, and the other for distributing it through the rest of the body; and in this case the parts may be united, as in man, the mammalia, and birds, or they may be distinct, as in the cuttle-fish. In others the heart is single, or consists of one ventricle, which may be situated either at the base of the general artery, as in snails and some other mollusca, or at the base of the pulmonary artery, as in fishes.\n\nThe organs of respiration display striking varieties, first according to the element which is to serve as the medium: if this be air, it is received into the interior of the respiratory organs; if it be water, it merely glides over the surface of lamellae, which have been named branchiae, as in fishes, and many of the mollusca, or of fringes, as in some worms. The air may be admitted into the body by one opening or by many. The former is the case with all animals who have proper lungs: the tube which receives the air is subdivided into numerous branches, terminating in cells, which are reunited, usually, into two masses, which the animal can at pleasure compress or dilate. In insects, which respire through many openings, the air-vesicles are most minutely ramified, so as to admit the air to every part of the body, and these animals are said to respire by tracheae. Lastly, the zoophytes, with the exception of the echinodermata, appear to have no respiratory organs.\n\nThere are only two general differences in the organs of voice, and these respect the position of the glottis, where the sound is formed. In birds, this is situated at the base of the windpipe, where this divides into two branches going to the lungs; in quadrupeds and reptiles, it is placed at the commencement of the windpipe, at the root of the tongue. Only these three classes have a glottis; in others sounds are produced by various mechanical means, by which the external air, or that contained within some part of their bodies, is set in rapid motion.\n\nThe differences which take place in the organs of generation are of two kinds, as they relate to the action itself, and to the consequences of this action. In a few animals, which mostly belong to the zoophytes, there is no copulation, but the young grows upon the body of the parent, like a float upon a tree: others propagate only by copulation, and are of course of two sexes; these, however, may be distinct in different animals, or united in the same; this last only takes place in the mollusca and in the zoophytes; all the vertebral animals and insects have the sexes distinct.\n\nIn hermaphrodite animals each individual can generate alone, as the bivalve shell fish: others copulate reciprocally, or each individual performs the double office of male and female; this is the case with snails, and such other of the mollusca as crawl on the belly.\n\nAs to the produce of generation, there are three modes in which the offspring is brought forth. Some animals, as some of the zoophytes and of articulated worms produce floats which remain for some time on the body of the animals, and these are gemmiparous. Others, as man and the mammalia, contain the fetus within a uterus, to which it is connected by a net-work of blood vessels, and from which it is sent forth alive; these, therefore, are viviparous. A third class, comprehending all the other animals, have the young contained within a shell, and enveloped by a substance which it absorbs before it is hatched; the viper may seem an exception to this division, as it brings forth its young alive; but then these have been hatched in the receptacle which contained the eggs; these animals are called oviparous.\n\nLastly, the organs of secretion show some diversity. All the vertebral animals and some mollusca secrete by means of glands situated in various parts of the body, or at least by means of expansions of vessels. The only secretory organs in insects seem to be tubes of various lengths, which attract with the spongy tissue of their sides, those fluids which they are to separate from the general nutritious mass. The secretory organs in the zoophytes are very imperfectly understood.\n\nThese are the principal general differences which we had to notice as taking place in animals. The following Table exhibits a comprehensive view of these, arranged in the order in which we have enumerated them.\n\nI. Ossification.\n\nA. Animals with an internal bony skeleton.\n   a.

II. GENERAL RELATIONS WHICH TAKE PLACE AMONG THE VARIATIONS\nOF ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONS.\n\nWe shall best observe these relations by comparing\ntogether the several functions, two by two.\n\nTo begin with one of the most obvious, respiration,\nwe perceive that this is always regulated by the mo-\ntion of the nutritious fluid. In animals which are\nfurnished with a heart and vessels, there is a central\nreceptacle, in which this fluid is collected, and from\nwhich it is distributed to every part of the body; the\nheart is its great goal, from which it sets out, and to\nwhich it must return before performing a new cir-\ncuit.\n\nIt must, therefore, at its source undergo the action\n\nVol. II. Part I.\nof the air, and accordingly, before it is sent through the general artery, to the various organs, it is circulated through the lungs or branchiae for this purpose. But in animals, as insects, which have neither heart nor vessels, this correspondence is unnecessary. In them the nutritious fluid has no regular motion, no general source; it could not have been prepared in a separate organ, before its distribution to the rest of the body, as exuding through the pores of the intestinal canal, it continually bathes the several parts, and introduces fresh particles between those which compose them. The air, therefore, could exert its action only at the very points of this introduction, and the very instant when it happens. This is extremely well provided for by the disposition of the tracheae, as there is no one solid point in the bodies of insects to which the fine ramifications of the air vessels do not extend, and at which the chemical action of the air does not take place. As we clearly see the causes of these relations between the organs belonging to these two functions of respiration and circulation, we are authorized to conclude that other relations, which are found to hold between them, depend upon causes of the same kind, though perhaps not equally evident.\n\nFor instance, of those animals who have blood vessels and a double circulation, some respire by admitting the air immediately into the spongy substance of the lungs, and in these the two trunks of the large arteries approach each other, and are furnished with muscular ventricles united into one fleety mass; others respire through the medium of water passing between the folds of their branchiae, and in these the two trunks are always separated, whether each be furnished with a separate ventricle as in the cuttle-fish, or both have a common ventricle as in fishes and the mollusca.\n\nThe relation which subsists between respiration and motion is more easily explained. We find, that those animals which move quickest, and are constantly resident in the air, stand most in need of pure air, and can obtain it with the greatest facility. The constant demand for fresh air, is found by modern chemistry to be owing to the loss of irritability, in the muscular fibre, which is supplied by something from the air. Birds, therefore, who from the swiftness of their motion, and consequent loss of irritability, have the greatest demand for fresh air, have also the most complete and extensive respiratory organs. In reptiles, again, whose motion is generally very slow, and whose irritability is retained with great obstinacy, their organs are incomplete, and their vessels confounded with those of the general circulation, and they can exist long without air. The mammalia seem to hold the middle rank between these two extremes.\n\nThe relations which take place between the differences of the organs of sensation with those of respiration likewise deserve attention.\n\nIn animals with cold blood, the external senses are much less acute than in the warm-blooded animals; and in the former the brain is less, and does not completely fill the skull. This is doubtless owing to the slower motion of the cold-blooded animals requiring less nervous energy.\n\nThe digestive organs are found to possess more power in proportion as those of respiration are more active, as the great waste occasioned by these must be compensated by a proportional supply of aliment received. Hence in birds, the stomach is extremely powerful, the digestion very vigorous, and the demand for food frequent and importunate; while reptiles require very little nourishment, and can remain very long without a fresh supply.\n\nWe have seen the relations which subsist between the organs of respiration and those of digestion. These last are also immediately related to the organs of motion and of sensation; for the nature of the aliment by which the animal is to be nourished is completely determined by the disposition of the alimentary canal; but if the animal had not its organs of sensation and of motion calculated for distinguishing and procuring its proper food, it is evident that it could not exist: thus an animal who can digest only flesh, must of necessity be enabled to perceive, to pursue, to seize, to overcome, and tear in pieces its proper prey. It must therefore possess a piercing sight, an acute smell, a rapid motion, agility, and considerable strength in its jaws and talons. Accordingly, we never see existing in the same animal a tooth formed for cutting flesh together with a horny foot; this explains why every animal with hoofs is herbivorous, and why hoofs indicate grinding teeth with flattened crowns; a very long alimentary canal, a large stomach, or several stomachs, and many other similar relations. Among all these relations there are many which have something in common, and there are always some in which the differences are few, so that by bringing together those which have the nearest resemblance, we are enabled to form a kind of series, which will appear gradually to proceed from a primitive standard. Hence the idea of a scale of beings, which some naturalists have formed, exhibiting a regular gradation, beginning at the most perfect, and descending to the most simple state of organization, or vice versa. As the links which constitute this chain are by no means entirely known, a perfect scale of beings is at present not to be expected.\n\nThe following table displays a series of animals, beginning with the most simple state of organization, and ascending to the most perfect.\nSCALE of Animals according to the greater or less simplicity of their Structure.\n\n1.

ARRANGEMENT OF ANIMALS FOUNDED ON THE GENERAL DIFFERENCE OF THEIR ORGANIZATION.\n\nHAVING taken a survey of the general differences which take place in the organization and functions of animals, and of the relations which subsist among these differences; we are now to proceed to a summary view of the whole animal kingdom, and consider what is common in the organization of the various classes of which it is composed.\n\nThe whole animal kingdom is generally divided into two great families, that of the vertebral animals, who have red blood; and that of the invertebral animals, almost all of which have white blood.\n\nIn the first division we always find an interior articulated skeleton, of which the principal support is the vertebral column, having the head at its atlantal extremity, and containing within its cavity the general origin of the nerves; its sacral extremity is commonly prolonged to form a tail. The ribs, which are seldom wanting, are situated on both sides of this column (g).\n\n(g) As the terms generally employed in the human anatomy are by no means calculated for describing the structure\nThese animals have never more than four limbs; but in some of them two of these are wanting, in others all.\n\nTheir brain is always contained within a peculiar cavity of the head called the cranium; all the spinal nerves send off filaments to assist in forming a nervous chord, which is derived from one of the nerves of the cranium, and is distributed to most of the viscera.\n\nThey have always five fenuses: two eyes which they can move at pleasure; the ear has always at least three semicircular canals; the organ of smell is always confined to cavities in the fore part of the head; there is always at least one fleely ventricle, by which the circulation of the blood is carried on; sometimes there are two ventricles, which are always united.\n\nThe lymphatic vessels are always distinct from the blood vessels.\n\nThe jaws are always situated horizontally, and separate from above downwards.\n\nThe alimentary canal is continued from the mouth to the anus, which is always situated behind the bones with which the facial extremities are articulated.\n\nThe intestines are enveloped in a membranous bag, called peritoneum.\n\nThere are always a liver, and a pancreas or sweet-bread, by which liquors are secreted for the purposes of digestion, and a spleen, in which one part of the blood which goes afterwards to the liver, undergoes some previous change.\n\nThe urine is always separated by two kidneys, which are situated on the sides of the vertebral column without the peritoneum, and above which are always two bodies called atrabiliary capsules, the use of which is unknown. The vertebral animals are subdivided into two sections; the hot-blooded, and the cold-blooded.\n\nIn the hot-blooded vertebral animals there is always a heart and a double circulation. Respiration is carried on by means of lungs, and without the exercise of this function they cannot exist.\n\nThe brain in these animals completely fills the cavity of the skull, and their eyes close by means of lids. The tympanum of their ear is sunk in the solid bone of the skull, as the parts of the labyrinth are entirely surrounded by bone; besides the semicircular canal, there is always an organ with two spiral cavities, like the shell of a snail; the nostrils serve for the passage of the air in breathing, and form a communication with the mouth. The trunk is always surrounded by the ribs, and there are for the most part four limbs.\n\nThe cold-blooded vertebral animals are deficient in several of these particulars; many of them want ribs, and some of them have no limbs. In them the brain never entirely fills the cavity of the skull, and their eyelids are seldom moveable; the tympanum of their ear, as also the small bones, is often wanting, the spiral cavity always; when the tympanum is present, it is never sunk within the skull.\n\nEach of these two divisions is again subdivided into two classes; the former into the mammalia and the birds; the latter into the fishes and the reptiles: the structure of these classes will be considered in their proper place.\n\nThe invertebrate animals have fewer common circumstances, and constitute a less regular series than those of which we have been speaking; their hard parts, when they are present, are generally, at least when articulated, placed externally. No part of their nervous system is contained within a bony sheath, but floats in a common cavity with the viscera.\n\nThe brain only is placed above the alimentary canal; from it proceed two branches which embrace the gullet like a collar, and from which the general bundle of the nerves is formed. In these animals respiration is never carried on by means of cellular lungs, and they are all destitute of voice; their jaws have no particular direction, and their mouths are often merely suckers; they have no kidneys, and consequently secrete no urine; if they have limbs, these are always at least six in number.\n\nConsidered in an anatomical point of view, they may be divided into five classes, namely, the mollusca, the crustacea, insects, worms, and zoophytes. We shall treat of these several classes in the order in which we have enumerated them.\n\nCHAP. IV. MAMMALIA, OR QUADRUPEDS.\n\nSECT. I. General Observations.\n\nA question has been started by some fanciful philosophers, \"Whether man is naturally a biped or a quadruped?\" and much ingenuity has been employed to establish the latter opinion. But it is presumed that few of their readers have been made converts to such an opinion, and that not many of ours will require much argument to persuade them of their erect destination. It may therefore suffice to observe, that this erect position is best adapted to the conformation of the human head, and the ponderous quantity of human brains—that the articulation of the os occipitis with the first vertebra of the neck, is differently constructed from that of quadrupeds, with the obvious design that man should be able to move his head in every direction with the greatest facility—that the human species (and also monkeys) are destitute of that strong ligament and tendinous aponeurosis, vulgarly called pax-war, which quadrupeds possess (as a kind of clay-tape), to prevent the head from sinking to the earth; to which, from its natural position, it must be very prone—and that our eyes and ears are, fortunately, not\n\nstructure of the inferior animals, we shall in this article make use of others, with which we have been favoured by Dr Barclay, the ingenious lecturer on anatomy, to whose publication on anatomical nomenclature we refer the reader for their explanation.\nnot placed as those of the quadrupeds. The axis of the human eye is nearly perpendicular with a vertical section of the head; whereas, in the brute creation (the larger eyes excepted), the portion of the eyes forms an acute angle.—nature has also furnished other animals with a fulpenformium oculti, a muscle which the erect attitude renders needless, though highly necessary in the prone; consequently, whoever tries the experiment will find that, in the inclined direction, both his eyes and his ears are in the most unfavourable situation possible for quick hearing or extensive vision. In fine, the shape, breadth, strength of the vertebrae of the back and loins, are all coincident with the erect attitude of the trunk.\n\nAll quadrupeds have a covering of hair, wool, &c., to defend them from the injuries of the weather, which varies in thickness according to the season of the year, and difference of the climate: thus in Russia and the northern countries, the furs are very thick and warm, while the little Spanish lap-dogs, and Barbary cows, have little or no hair at all.\n\nThe cutis and cuticula in quadrupeds are disposed much in the same way as the human, only more elastic; immediately under this, there is a very thin cutaneous muscular substance called panniculus carnosus, which is common to all quadrupeds, the porcine kind excepted; this principally covers the trunk, serving to shrivel the skin, in order to drive off insects, their tails and heads not being sufficient for this purpose, while their extremities are employed in their support and progression.\n\nIt has probably been from observing some muscles whence of the human body, such as the platyfina myoides, cre, the motion master, and frontales, and the collapsed tunica cellulosa, of emaciated subjects, to resemble this thin muscle, that some of the older anatomists reckoned such a panniculus among the common teguments of the human body. This Carolus Stephanus has well observed.\n\nMost part of quadrupeds want clavicles, whereby why most their atlantal extremities fall upon their chest, so as want clavicles to make their thorax proportionally narrower than the human. This small distance of their atlantal extremities is very necessary for their uniform progression: apes indeed and squirrels have clavicles to allow them a more full use of their extremities in climbing; but when they walk on all-fours, they move but indifferently.\n\nTheir head is connected to the first vertebra of the neck by two eminences as in man. The vertebrae of the neck are never less than six, or more than nine. The number of the dorsal and other vertebrae differ considerably in the various individuals. The following table exhibits these differences in each species. The brain of these animals is more complicated than that of the other classes.\n\n### TABLE of the Proportional Number of Spinal Vertebrae in various species of Mammalia.\n\n| Species                  | Dorso Vertebrae | Lumbar Vertebrae | Sacral Vertebrae | Coccygian Vertebrae |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Man                      |                 |                  |                  |                     |\n| Simia satyrus, Lin.      |                 |                  |                  |                     |\n| Orang-outang             |                 |                  |                  |                     |\n| troglodytes              |                 |                  |                  |                     |\n| Jocko                    |                 |                  |                  |                     |\n| lar.

Their heart, lungs, and diaphragm resemble those of man in their general structure; and differ only in a few circumstances, which will be best seen in the exemplification of their structure, which is presently to be given.\n\nIn treating of quadrupeds we shall divide them into the carnivorous, or rather those which feed indifferently on flesh and vegetables, and the granivorous. The structure of the former we shall exemplify in the dog, that of the latter in the cow.\n\n**Sect. II. The Anatomy of a Dog.**\n\nWe may first observe of this animal, as of most quadrupeds, that its legs are much shorter in proportion to its trunk than in man, the length of whose steps depends entirely on the length of his sacral extremities; however, to balance this, the trunk of the animal is proportionally longer and smaller, his spine more flexible, by which he is able at each step to bring his sacral nearer to his atlantal extremities. His common teguments are much akin to those of other quadrupeds, only they allow little or no passage for sweat; but when he is over-heated, the superfluous matter finds an exit by the salivary glands, for he lolls out his tongue and flavors plentifully. We are not, however, to suppose, that because a dog does not sweat, he has no infensible perspiration. That a dog perspires is evident, because one of these animals can trace another by the scent of his footsteps; which could not happen if a large quantity of perspirable matter was not constantly going off.\n\nThe pyramidal muscles are wanting, to supply which the rectus is inserted fleety into the os pubis.\n\nThe brain is proportionally much smaller than the human; but, as in man, it is divided into cerebrum and cerebellum, and these two parts bear nearly the same proportion to one another as in us. There was no such occasion for so great a quantity of brain in these animals as in man; seeing that in them all its energy is employed in their progression, while man has a great waste of spirits in the exercise of his reason and intellectual faculties. And besides all this, a bulky brain would be inconvenient to these creatures, in so far as it would add considerably to the weight of the head; which having the advantage of a long lever to act with, would require a much greater force to support it than it does now; for the heads of the greatest part of quadrupeds are not near so heavy as they would at first sight seem to be, from the frontal sinuses being produced a great way upwards to enlarge the organs of smelling.\n\nThe pits in the anterior part of their skulls are much more conspicuous than in the human; which may be occasioned by the depending posture of these creatures heads while they gather their food: the brain at this time gravitating much on the bones while they are as yet soft, will gradually make impressions upon them at those places where it rises into eminences. This is prevented in man mostly by his erect posture.\n\nThe falx is not near so large in quadrupeds as in Falx man, as they have little occasion to lie on either side, and the two hemispheres of the brain are in a great measure hindered from jostling against one another in violent motions, by the brain's intimating itself into the above-mentioned pits.\n\nThe second proceeds of the dura mater, or tentorium cerebello super-expansum, is considerably thicker and stronger.\nstronger than in man. This membrane is generally of-\nfused, or we find the place of it supplied by a bone,\nthat it may the more effectually keep off the superin-\ncumbent brain from the cerebellum in rapid motions,\nwhich otherwise would be of bad consequence.\n\nThe olfactory nerves are very large, and justly de-\nserve the name of processus mamillaris. They are hol-\nlow, and consist of a medullary and cineritious sub-\nstance, and at first sight appear to be the frontal ven-\ntricles of the brain produced; but in man they are\nsmall, and without any discernible cavity. The reason\nof this is pretty evident, if we consider how this ani-\nmal's head is situated; for the lymph continually gra-\nvitating upon the inferior part of the ventricles, may\nthus elongate and produce them; but from this very\ninferior part the olfactory nerves rise, and are sent im-\nmediately through the ethmoid bone into the nose.\nHence the ancients, thinking they were continued hol-\nlow into the nose, believed they were the emunctories\nof the brain; in the brain of sheep, which by its firm\ntexture is the best subject of any for searching into the\nstructure of this part, we evidently see, that the name\nof the sigmoid cavity was very properly applied by the\nancients to the lateral ventricles of the brain; which\nare really of a greater extent than they are ordinarily\npainted by anatomists, reaching farther backwards, and\nforwards again under the substance of the brain. The\ncortical and medullary parts, as well as the corpus cal-\nlosum, are similar to those parts in man.\n\nThe noses and teeth deserve this name much better\nhere than in the human body, with respect to each\nother. They are larger in the quadrupeds; and hence\nwe perceive that there is no great reason for attributing\nthe different operations to any particular size or shape\nof these parts. They are here also of different colours;\nthe noses being of the colour of the cortical, and the\nteeth of the medullary substance of the brain; whereas\nin man they are both of one colour. The reason\nof these differences, and others of the like nature to be\nmet with, we shall not pretend to determine; for we\nhave hitherto such an imperfect knowledge of the\nbrain itself, that we are entirely ignorant of the va-\nrious uses of its different parts. We may in general\nconclude, that the varying in one animal from what it\nis in another, is fitted to the creature's particular way\nof living.\n\nThe rete mirabile Galeni, situated on each side of the\nsella turcica, about which there has been so much dis-\npute, is very remarkable in these animals. This net-\nwork of vessels is nothing else than a continuation of\nthe internal carotid arteries, which, entering the skull,\ndivide into a vast number of minute branches running\nalong the side of the sella turcica; and, uniting after-\nwards, are spent on the brain in the common way.\nGalen seems with justice to suppose, that this plexus\nof vessels serves for checking the impetuosity of the\nblood destined for the brain.\n\nThe tongue, in consequence of the length of the\njaws, is much longer than ours; and as this creature\nfeeds with his head in a depending posture, the bolus\nwould always be in danger of falling out of the mouth,\nwere it not for several prominences or papillae placed\nmostly at the root of the tongue, and crooked back-\nwards in such a manner as to allow any thing to pass\neasily down to the jaws, but to hinder its return. By\nthe papillae also the surface of the tongue is increased,\nand a stronger impression is made on the sensation of\ntaste. In some animals who feed on living creatures,\nthese tentacle-hooks are still more conspicuous; as in sev-\neral large fishes, where they are almost as large as\ntheir teeth in the fore part of their mouth, and near as\nfirm and strong.\n\nThe nose is generally longer than in man, and its ex-\nternal passage much narrower. The internal structure\nis also better adapted for an acute smelling, having a\nlarger convoluted surface on which the membrana febe-\nridiana is spread; and this is to be observed in most\nquadrupeds, who have the os spongiosum commonly\nlarge, and these too divided into a great number of\nexcessively fine thin lamellae. The sensibility seems to\nbe increased in proportion to the surface; and this will\nalso be found to take place in all the other senses. The\nelephant, which has a head pretty large in proportion\nto its body, has the greatest part of it taken up with\nthe cavity of the nose and frontal sinuses; which last\nextend almost over their whole head, and leave but a\nsmall cavity for their brains. A very nice sense of\nsmelling was not so absolutely necessary for man, who\nhas judgment and experience to direct him in the choice\nof his food; whereas brutes, who have only their senses,\nmust of necessity have these acute, some having one\nsense in greater perfection than others, according to\ntheir different way of life. We not only conclude a\npriori from the large expanded membrana febrideriana,\nthat their sense of smelling is very acute, but we find\nit so by cows and horses distinguishing so readily be-\ntwixt noxious and wholesome herbs, which they do\nprincipally by this sense.\n\nThe external ear in different quadrupeds is differ-\nently formed, but always calculated for the creature's\nmanner of life. In shape it commonly resembles the\noblique section of a cone from near the apex to the\nbasis. Hares, and such other animals as are daily ex-\nposed to insults from beasts of prey, have large ears di-\nrected backwards, their eyes warning them of any dan-\nger before; rapacious animals, on the other hand, have\ntheir ears placed directly forwards, as we see in the\nlion, cat, &c. The slow hounds, and other animals\nthat are designed to hear most distinctly the sounds\ncoming from below, have their ears hanging downwards;\nor their ears are flexible, because they move their\nhead for the most part with greater difficulty than\nman. Man, again, who must equally hear sounds com-\ning from all quarters, but especially such as are sent\nfrom about his own height, has his external ear placed\nin a vertical manner, somewhat turned forward. In\nshort, wherever we see a specialty in the make of this\norgan in any creature, we shall, with very little reflec-\ntion, discover this form to be more convenient for that\ncreature than another. The animal also has the power\nof directing the cone of the ear to the sonorous body\nwithout moving the head. There are some differences\nto be observed in the structure of the internal ear in\ndifferent animals; but we know so very little of the\nuse of the particular parts of that organ in the human\nsubject, that it is altogether impossible to assign reasons\nfor these variations in other creatures.\n\nAll quadrupeds have at the internal canthus of the Membrana,\neye a strong firm membrane with a cartilaginous edge,\nwhich may be made to cover some part of their eye;\nand this is greater or less in different animals as their eyes are more or less exposed to dangers in searching after their food. This membrana nictitans, as it is called, is not very large in this animal. Cows and horses have it so large as to cover one half of the eye like a curtain, and at the same time it is sufficiently transparent to allow abundance of the rays of light to pass through it. Fishes have a cuticle always over their eyes, as they are ever in danger in that inconstant element. In this then we may also observe a sort of gradation.\n\nAll quadrupeds have a seventh muscle belonging to the eye, called suspensorius. It surrounds almost the whole optic nerve, and is fixed into the sclerotic coat as the others are. Its use is, to sustain the weight of the globe of the eye, and prevent the optic nerve from being too much stretched, without obliging the four straight muscles to be in a continual contraction, which would be inconvenient; at the same time this muscle may be brought to assist any of the other four, by causing one particular portion of it to act at a time.\n\nThe next thing to be remarked is the figure of the pupil, which is different in different animals, but always exactly accommodated to the creature's way of life, as well as to the different species of objects that are viewed. Man has it circular, for obvious reasons: an ox has its oval, with the longest diameter placed transversely, to take in a larger view of his food: cats, again, have theirs likewise oval, but the longest diameter placed perpendicularly; they can either exclude a bright light altogether, or admit only as much as is necessary. The pupil of different animals varies in wideness, according as the internal organs of vision are more or less acute: thus cats and owls, who seek their prey in the night, or in dark places (and consequently must have their eyes so formed as that a few rays of light may make a lively impression on the retina), have their pupils in the daytime contracted into a very narrow space, as a great number of rays would oppress their nice organs; while in the night, or where the light is faint, they open the pupil, and very fully admit the rays. In the same way, when the retina is inflamed, a great number of rays of light would occasion a painful sensation; therefore the pupil is contracted: on the contrary, in dying people, or in a beginning amaurosis, it is generally dilated, as the eyes on such occasions are very difficultly affected, and as it were insensible.\n\nThe posterior part of the choroid coat, which is called tapetum, is of different colours in different creatures. For oxen, feeding mostly on grass, have this membrane of a green colour, that it may reflect upon the retina all the rays of light which come from objects of that colour, while other rays are absorbed: thus the animal sees its food better than it does other objects. Cats and owls have their tapetum of a whitish colour; and for the same reasons have the pupil very dilatable, and their organs of vision acute: And we shall find, that all animals see more or less distinctly in the dark, according as their tapetum approaches nearer to a white or black colour. Thus dogs, who have it of a grayish colour, distinguish objects better in the night than man, whose tapetum is dark brown; and who, it is believed, sees worst in the dark of any creature: it being originally designed that he should rest from all kinds of employment in the night-time. The difference then of the colour of the tapetum, as indeed the fabric of any other part in different creatures, always depends on some particular advantage accruing to the animal in its peculiar manner of life from this singularity.\n\nWe look on it as a general rule, that all quadrupeds, Neck, as having occasion to gather their food from the ground, are provided with longer necks than man: but as a long neck not only gives the advantage of too long a lever to the weight of the head, but also, when the animal is gathering his food, makes the brain in danger of being oppressed with too great a quantity of blood, by the liquor in the arteries having the advantage of a descent, while that in the veins must remount a considerable way contrary to its own gravity; it was therefore necessary that a part of the length of the neck should be supplied by the length of the jaws. Thus we see horses, cows, &c., who have no occasion for opening their mouths very wide, yet have long jaws. Bulldogs, indeed, and such animals as have occasion for very strong jaws, must of necessity, have them short; because the longer they are, the resistance to be overcome acts with a longer lever. Another exception to this general rule, is such animals as are furnished with something analogous to hands to convey their food to their mouths, as cats, apes, &c. The teeth of these creatures plainly show it to be of the carnivorous kind; for there are none of them made for grinding its food, but only for tearing and dividing it. It has six remarkably sharp teeth before, and two very long tusks behind; both of which the ruminating animals want. These are evidently calculated for laying very firm hold of substances, and tearing them to pieces; and the vast strength of the muscles inserted into the lower jaw, assists greatly in this action; while the grinders have sharp cutting edges, calculated for cutting flesh, and breaking the hardest bones. Even its posterior teeth are not formed with rough broad surfaces as ours are; but are made considerably sharper, and press over one another when the mouth is shut, that so they may take the firmer hold of whatever comes betwixt them.\n\nWhen we open the mouth, we see the amygdala Amygdalae, very prominent in the posterior part of it; so that it would appear at first view, that these were inconveniently placed, as being continually exposed to injuries from the hard substances this creature swallows; but upon a more narrow scrutiny, we find this provided for by two membranous capsules, into which the amygdala, when pressed, can escape, and remove themselves from such injuries.\n\nThe velum pendulum palati is in this creature considerably longer than in man, to prevent the food from getting into his nose; which would happen more frequently in this animal than in man, because of its situation while feeding.\n\nIn this subject, as well as in other quadrupeds, there Glottis is no uvula; but then the epiglottis, when pressed down, covers the whole rim entirely, and naturally continues Epiglottis. fo: there is therefore a ligament, or rather muscle, that comes from the os hyoideum and root of the tongue, that is inserted into that part of the epiglottis where it is articulated with the cricoid cartilage, which serves\nANATOMY.\n\nPart II.\n\nOf Quadrupeds.\n\nThe use of the uvula in man.\n\nIt may be asked, however, Why the uvula is wanting here, and not in man? This seems to be, that quadrupeds, who swallow their food in a horizontal situation, have no occasion for an uvula, though it is necessary in man on account of his erect situation.\n\nIn the upper part of the pharynx, behind the cricoid cartilage, there is a pretty large gland to be found, which serves not only for the separation of a mucous liquor to lubricate the bolus as it passes this way, but also supplies the place of a valve, to hinder the food from regurgitating into the mouth, which it would be apt to do by reason of the defending situation of the creature's head. In man, the muscle of the epiglottis is wanting, its place being supplied by the elasticity of the cartilage.\n\nThe gullet is formed pretty much in the same way as the human. Authors indeed generally allege, that quadrupeds have their gullet composed of a double row of spiral fibres decussating one another; but this is peculiar to ruminating animals, who have occasion for such a decussation of fibres. The action of these you may easily observe in a cow chewing her cud.\n\nThe omentum reaches down to the os pubis, which considering the posture of the animal we shall find to be a wise provision, since its use is to separate an oily liquor for lubricating the guts and facilitating their peristaltic motion; so in our erect posture the natural gravity of the oil will determine it downward, but in the horizontal position of these creatures, if all the intestines were not covered, there would be no favourable derivation of the fluid to the guts lying in the facral part of the abdomen, which is the highest; and besides, had the omentum reached much farther down in us, it would not only have supplied too great a quantity of oil to the lower part of the abdomen, but we should have been in continual danger of hernia; and even at present the omentum frequently passes down with some of the other viscera, and forms part of these tumours. To these, however, the dog is not subject, as his viscera do not press so much on the rings of the abdominal muscles, and besides are prevented from passing through by a pendulous flap of fat mentioned No. 35. The facral and sternal lamella of the omentum is fixed to the spleen, fundus of the stomach, pylorus, liver, &c. in the same way as the human; but the superior having no colon to pass over, goes directly to the back-bone. This serves to explain the formation of the small omentum in the human body; which is nothing but the large omentum, having lost its fat, passing over the stomach and colon, where it reaustimes its fat, so proceeds, and is firmly attached to the liver, spine, &c. The striae of fat are pretty regularly disposed through it, accompanying the distribution of the blood vessels to guard them from the pressure of the superincumbent viscera.\n\nThis animal's stomach, though pretty much resembling the human in its shape, is somewhat differently situated. It lies more longitudinal, as indeed all the other viscera do, to accommodate themselves to the shape of the cavity in which they are contained; that is, its facral orifice is much farther down with respect to the atlantal than the human; by this means the gross food has an easier passage into the duodenum. Again, the fundus of the human stomach, when distended, stands almost directly sternal, which is occasioned by the little omentum tying it close down to the back bone, &c. at its two orifices; but it not being fixed in that manner in the dog, the fundus remains always dorsal: this also answers very well the shape of the different cavities, the distance between the cardia and fundus being greater than that between the two sides. It seems to be much larger in proportion to the bulk of the animal than the human, that it might contain a greater quantity of food at once; which was very necessary, since this animal cannot at any time get its sustenance as men do. The turbillion is not so large, nor is there any coaction forming the antrum Willetti, as in the stomach of man. It is considerably thicker and more muscular than ours, for breaking the cohesion of their food, which they swallow without sufficient chewing. Hence it is evident the force of the stomach is not so great as some would have it, nor its contraction so violent; otherwise that of dogs would be undoubtedly wounded by the sharp bones, &c. they always take down; for the contraction here is still greater than in the human stomach, which is much thinner. The rugae of the tunica villosa are neither so large, nor situated transversely, as in the human, but go from one orifice to the other: the reason of which difference is, perhaps, that they might be in less danger of being hurt by the hard substances this creature frequently feeds upon; and for the same reason there is not the like fracture at their pylorus.\n\nThe intestines of this animal are proportionally much shorter than ours; for the food which these creatures mostly use, soon dissolves, and then putrefies; on which account there was no occasion for a long tract of intestines, but on the contrary that it should be quickly thrown out of the body. The same is to be observed of all the carnivorous animals. The muscular coat of the intestines is also thicker and stronger than the human, to protrude the contents quickly and accurately.\n\nThe valvula conniventes are less numerous, and in a longitudinal direction; and the whole tract of the alimentary canal is covered with a slime, which lubricates the intestines, saves them from the acrimony of the excrementitious part, and facilitates its passage.\n\nThe duodenum differs considerably in its situation from the human. For in man it first mounts from the pylorus upwards, backwards, and to the right side; then passes down by the gall-bladder; and, marching over the right kidney and superior part of the psoas muscles, makes a curvature upwards; and passes over the back bone and vena cava inferior, to the left hypochondrium, where it gets through the omentum, mesentery, and mesocolon, to commence the jejunum, being firmly tied down all the way, the biliary and pancreatic ducts entering at its most depending part: Whereas, in the dog, the duodenum is fixed at the pylorus to the concave surface of the liver, and hangs loose and pendulous with the mecentery backwards into the cavity of the abdomen; then turning up again, is fixed to the back bone, where it ends in the jejunum; the bile and pancreatic juice are poured into it at the most depending part. Therefore the same intention seems\nseems to have been had in view in the formation of this part in both, viz. the giving the chyle, after the liquors of the liver and pancreas are poured into it, a difadvantageous course, that to it might be the more intimately blended with the humours before its entry into the jejunum, where the lacteals are very numerous: And thus, by reason of their different posture, the same design (though by a very different order of the parts) is brought about in both.\n\nThe other small guts are much the same with ours, only shorter. The great guts are also shorter and less capacious than in the human body; and we take it for a general rule, that all animals that live on vegetable food, have not only their small guts considerably longer, but also their great guts more capacious, than such creatures as feed on other animals. Hence man, from this form of his intestines, and that of the teeth, seems to have been originally designed for feeding on vegetables chiefly; and still the most of his food, and all his drink, is of that class.\n\nThe reason of this difference seems to be, that as animal food is not only much more easily reduced into chyle, but also more prone to putrefaction, too long a delay of the juices might occasion the worst consequences. So it was necessary that their receptacles should not be too capacious; but, on the contrary, being short and narrow, might conduce to the reasonable discharge of their contents. Whereas vegetable food being more difficulty dissolved and converted into an animal nature, there was a necessity for such creatures as fed on it to be provided with a long intestinal canal, that this food in its passage might be considerably retarded, and have time to change its quality into one more agreeable to our nature. Besides which there is another advantage with accrues to man in particular, from having his great guts very capacious: for as he is a rational being, and mostly employed in the functions of social life, it would have been very inconvenient as well as unbecoming for him to be too frequently employed in such ignoble exercises; so that, having this large reservoir for his faeces alvine, he can retain them for a considerable time without any trouble.\n\nThe appendix vermiformis justly enough deserves the name of an intestine cæcum in this subject, though in the human body it does not; and it has probably been from the largeness of this part in this and some other animals, that the oldest anatomists came to reckon that small appendicle in man as one of the great guts. On its internal surface we observe a great number of mucous glands. As all these throw out slime, their principal office would seem to be the procuring a sufficient quantity of that matter for the purposes above mentioned. Still, however, there seems to be some unknown use for this organ in other animals; for the appendicula vermiformis in them is either of great size or of great length. In a rat, it is rather larger than the stomach; in others, as swine, and some of the animals which live on vegetables, it has long convolutions, so that the food must be lodged in it for a long time. Thus, probably, some change takes place in the food, which requires a considerable time to effectuate, and, though unknown to us, may answer very useful purposes to the animal.\n\nThe colon has no longitudinal ligaments; and consequently this gut is not purged up into different bags or cells as the human: nor does this intestine make any circular turn round the abdomen; but passes directly across it to the top of the os sacrum, where it gets the Colon name of rectum.\n\nAt the extremity of the intestine rectum, or verge rectum, of the anus, there are found two bags or pouches, which contain a most abominable fetid mucus of a yellow colour, for which we know no use, unless it serves to lubricate the irritated extremity of the rectum, and defend it against the asperity of the faeces, or to separate some liquor that might otherwise prove hurtful to their bodies. There is nothing analogous to those sacs in the human subject, unless we reckon the mucilaginous glands that are found most frequent and largest about the lower part of the rectum.\n\nThe mesentery is considerably longer than in the human body; that, in his horizontal situation, the intestines may rest securely on the soft cushion of the abdominal muscles. The fat is here disposed in the same way, and for the same reason, as in the omentum. The interfaces between the fat are filled with a fine membrane. Instead of a great number of glandulae vagae to be found in the human mesentery, we find Pancreas the glands few in number, and those are closely connected together; or there is only one large gland to be observed in the middle of the mesentery of a dog, which, from its imagined resemblance to the pancreas and the name of its discoverer, is called pancreas Afellii; but the resemblance, if there is any, depends chiefly on the connexion, the structure being entirely different. The reason why this in man is as it were subdivided into many smaller ones, may possibly be, that as the guts of a human body are proportionally much longer than those of this creature, it would have been inconvenient to have gathered all the lactea primigenia into one place; whereas, by collecting a few of these vessels into a neighbouring gland, the same effect is procured much more easily. Whether the food in this animal needs less preparation in its passage through these glands, is a matter very much unknown to us; though it is certain that some changes really do take place.\n\nThe pancreas in man lies across the abdomen, tied Pancreas down by the peritoneum; but the capacity of this creature's abdomen not allowing of that situation, it is disposed more longitudinally, being tied to the duodenum, which it accompanies for some way. Its duct enters the duodenum about an inch and a half below the ductus communis.\n\nThe spleen of this animal differs from the human spleen very much, both in figure and situation. It is much more oblong and thin, and lies more according to the length of the abdomen, like the pancreas. Though the spleen of this creature is not firmly tied to the diaphragm (which was necessary in our erect posture to hinder it from falling downwards), yet by the animal's prone position, its dorsal parts being rather higher than the sternum, it comes to be always contiguous to this muscle, and is as effectually subjected to an alternate pressure from its action as the human spleen is.\n\nThe human liver has no fissures or divisions, unless Liver we may reckon that small one between the two pylorus, where the large vessels enter: Whereas in a dog, and all\nall other creatures that have a large flexion in their spine, as lions, leopards, cats, &c., the liver and lungs are divided into a great many lobes by deep sections, reaching the large blood vessels, which in great motions of the back bone may easily slide over one another; and so be in much less danger of being torn or bruised, than if they were formed of one entire piece, as we really see it is in horses, cows, and such creatures as have their back bone stiff and immovable. There is here no ligamentum latum connecting the liver to the diaphragm, which, in our situation, was necessary to keep the viscera in its place: Whereas in this creature, it naturally gravitates forwards, and by the horizontal position of the animal is in no danger of pressing against the vena cava; the preventing of which is one use generally assigned to this ligament in man. Had the liver of the dog been thus connected to the diaphragm, the respiration must necessarily have suffered; for, as we shall see afterwards, this muscle is here moveable at the centre as well as at the sides: But in man the liver is fixed to the diaphragm, mostly at its tendinous part; that is, where the pericardium is fixed to it on the other side; so that it is in no danger of impeding the respiration, being suspended by the mediastinum and bones of the thorax. In consequence of this viscus being divided into so many lobes, it follows, that the hepatic ducts cannot possibly join into one common trunk till they are quite out of the substance of the liver; because a branch comes out from every lobe of the liver; all of which, by their union, form the hepatic duct: whence we are led to conclude, that the hepato-cystic ducts, mentioned by former authors, do not exist. The gall-bladder itself is wanting in several animals, such as the deer, the horse, the ass, &c.; but, in place of it, in such animals, the hepatic duct, at its beginning, is widened into a reservoir of considerable size, which may answer the same purpose in them that the gall-bladder does in others.\n\nThe mediastinum in this creature is pretty broad. The pericardium is not here contiguous to the diaphragm, but there is an inch of distance betwixt them, in which place the small lobe of the lungs lodges; and by this means the liver, &c., of this animal, though continually pressing upon the diaphragm, yet cannot disturb the heart's motion.\n\nThe heart is situated with its point almost directly sternally, according to the creature's posture, and is but very little inclined to the left side. Its point is much sharper, and its shape more conoidal, than the human. The animal has the vena cava of a considerable length within the thorax, having near the whole length of the heart to run over ere it gets at the sinus Lowerianus dexter. In man, as soon as it pierces the diaphragm, it enters the pericardium, which is firmly attached to it, and immediately gets into the sinus Lowerianus; which sinus, in the human subject, by the oblique situation of the heart is almost contiguous to the diaphragm; and by this we discover, that several authors have taken their delineations of the human heart from brutes; which is easily detected by the shape and situation of the heart, and long vena cava, within the thorax. This was one of the faults of the curious wax-work that was shown at London and Paris, which was plainly taken from a cow.\n\nThis situation of the heart of the creature agrees best with the shape of its thorax, which is lower than the drupes' abdomen.\n\nThe egress of the large blood vessels from the heart amongst them is somewhat different from the human: For here the external right subclavian comes off first; and as a large trunk improperly runs some way upwards before it gives off the left carotid, and splits into the carotid and subclavian of the right side, then the left subclavian is sent off. So that neither here, properly speaking, is there an aorta ascendens, more than in the human; but this name has probably been imposed upon it from observing this in a cow, where indeed there is an ascending and descending aorta.\n\nFrom this specialty of the distribution of the vessels of the right side, which happens, though not in so great a degree, in the human subject, we may perhaps in some measure account for the general greater strength, readiness, or facility of motion, which is observable in the right arm. Upon measuring the sides of the vertebral column, the surface of the united trunk of the right subclavian and carotid is less than that of the left subclavian and carotid, as they are separated. If so, the resistance to the blood must be less in that common trunk than in the left subclavian and carotid: But if the right arm, leg, fitness be smaller, the absolute force with which the blood is sent from the heart being equal, there must necessarily be a greater quantity of blood sent through them in a given time; and as the strength of the muscles is, ceteris paribus, as the quantity of blood sent into them in a given time, those of the right arm will be stronger than those of the left. Now children, being conscious of this superior strength, use the right upon all occasions; and thus from use comes that great difference which is so observable. That this is a sufficient cause, seems evident from fact; for what a difference is there betwixt the right and the left arm of one who has played much at tennis? View but the arms of a blacksmith and legs of a footman, and you will soon be convinced of this effect arising from using them. But if by any accident the right arm is kept from action for some time, the other from being used gets the better; and those people are left-handed: For it is not to be imagined, that the final odds in the original formation of the vessels should be sufficient to resist the effect of use and habit (instances of the contrary occur every day); it is enough for our present argument, that where no means are used to oppose it, the odds are sufficient to determine the choice in favour of the right. Now because it is natural to begin with the leg corresponding to the hand we have most power of, this is what gives also a superiority to the right leg.\n\nThis difference is not peculiar to man, but is still more observable in those creatures in whom the same mechanism does obtain in a greater degree. Do but observe a dog at a trot, how he bears forward with his right side; or look at him when he scrapes up anything, and you will presently see that he uses his right much oftener than he does his left foot. Something analogous to this may be observed in horses. It has been the opinion of some anatomists, that left-handed people, as well as those distinguished by the name of ambidextrous (who use both hands alike), have the two carotid and subclavian arteries coming off in four distinct\nChap. IV.\n\nANATOMY.\n\nOf Quadrupeds.\n\nDiaphragm\n\nThe diaphragm, in its natural situation, is in general more loose and free than the human; which is owing to its connexion with the neighbouring parts in a different manner from ours. The human diaphragm is connected to the pericardium; which again, by the intervention of the mediastinum, is tied to the sternum, spine, &c. but here there is some distance between the diaphragm and pericardium. We observe further, that its middle part is much more moveable, and the tendinous parts not so large. And indeed it was necessary their diaphragm should be somewhat loose, they making more use of it in difficult respiration than man. This we may observe by the strong heaving of the flanks of a horse or dog when out of breath; which corresponds to the rising of the ribs in us.\n\nThe sternum is very narrow, and consists of a great number of small bones, moveable every way; which always happens in creatures that have a great mobility in their spine. The ribs are straighter, and by no means so convex as the human; whereby in respiration the motion forward will very little enlarge their thorax, which is compensated by the greater mobility of their diaphragm: so our thorax is principally enlarged according to its breadth and depth, and theirs according to its length. The want of clavicles, and the consequent falling in of the atlantal extremities upon the chest, may contribute somewhat to the straightness of the ribs.\n\nWe come next to discourse of those organs that serve for the secretion and excretion of urine. And first of the kidneys: Which in this animal are situated much in the same way as in the human subject; but have no fat on their inferior surface, where they face the abdomen, and are of a more globular form than the human. The reason of these differences will easily appear, if we compare their situation and posture in this animal with those in a man who walks erect. They are placed in them in the sacral part of the body, so are not subject to the pressure of the viscera, which seems to be the principal cause of the fatness of those organs in us, and perhaps may likewise be the cause of our being more subject to the stone than other animals. Hence there is no need of any cellular substance to ward off this pressure where there would necessarily be fat collected; but the atlantal part of their kidneys is pretty well covered with fat, lest they should suffer any compression from the action of the ribs and spine.\n\nIn the internal structure there is still more considerable difference: For the papillae do not here send out fleshy the several tubuli uriniferi; but being all united, they hang down in form of a loose pendulous flap in the middle of the pelvis, and form a kind of partition; so that a dog has a pelvis formed within the substance of the kidney. The only thing that is properly analogous to a pelvis in man is that lac or dilatation of the ureters formed at the union of the ductus uriniferi. The external part of the kidney of a dog somewhat resembles one of the lobes of the kidney of a human fetus; but in a human adult the appearance is very different; because, in man, from the continual pressure of the surrounding viscera, the lobes, which in the fetus are quite distinct and separated, concrete, but the original cortical substance is still preserved in the internal parts of the kidney. The reason of these particularities may probably be, that the liquors of this animal, as of all those of the carnivorous kind, being much more acid than those that live on vegetable food, its urine must incline much to an alkaline tendency, as indeed the smell and taste of that liquor in dogs, cats, leopards, &c. evidently show, being fetid and pungent, and therefore not convenient to be long retained in the body. For this end it was proper that the secreting organs should have as little impediment as possible by pressure, &c. in the performing their functions; and for that design, the mechanism of their kidneys seems to be excellently adapted: We have most elegant pictures in Buffon's of the kidneys of brutes, delineated as such, with a view to show Vesalius's error in painting and describing them for the human.\n\nThe glandulae or capsulae atrabiliariae are thicker and rounder than the human, for the same reason as the atrabiliariae kidneys.\n\nThe ureters are more muscular than the human, because of the unfavourable passage the urine has through them; they enter the bladder near its large extremity.\n\nThe bladder of urine differs considerably from the bladder of the human; and first in its form, which is pretty much pyramidal or pyriform. This shape of the dog's bladder is likewise common to all quadrupeds, except the ape and those of an erect posture. In man it is by no means pyriform, but has a large face at its dorsal and sacral part: this form depends entirely on the urine gravitating in our erect posture to its bottom, which it will endeavour to protrude; but as it cannot yield before, being contiguous to the os pubis, it will naturally stretch out where there is the least resistance, that is, at the posterior and lateral parts; and were it not for this face, we could not so readily come at the bladder to extract the stone either by the lesser or lateral operation of lithotomy. Most anatomists have delineated this wrong: so much, that we know of none who have justly painted it, excepting Mr Cowper in his Myotomia, and Mr Butty. It has certainly been from observing it in brutes and young children, that they have been led into this mistake. The same cause, viz. the gravity of the urine, makes the bladder of a different form in brutes: In their horizontal position the neck, from which the urethra is continued, is higher than its fundus; the urine must therefore defend and dilate the most depending part by its weight.\n\nAs to its connexion, it is fastened to the abdominal muscles by a process of the peritoneum, and that membrane is extended quite over it; whereas in us its inferior and posterior parts are only covered by it: hence in man alone the high operation of lithotomy can be performed without hazard of opening the cavity of the abdomen. Had the peritoneum been spread over the bladder in its whole extent, the weight of the viscera in our erect posture would have been upon it, that in part they would not have allowed any considerable quantity of urine to be collected there; but we must have been obliged to perform the operation.\nobliged to discharge its contents too frequently to be consistent with the functions of a social life: Whereas by means of the peritoneum, the urine is now collected in sufficient quantity, the viscera not gravitating this way.\n\nIt may be taken for a general rule, that those creatures that feed upon animal food have their bladder more muscular and considerably stronger and less capacious, than those that live on vegetables, such as horses, cows, swine, &c., whose bladder of urine is perfectly membranous, and very large. This is wisely adapted to the nature of their food: For in these first, as all their juices are more acid, so in a particular manner their urine becomes exalted; which, as its delay might be of very ill consequence, must necessarily be quickly expelled. This is chiefly effected by its stimulating this viscus more strongly to contract, and so to discharge its contents, though the irritation does not altogether depend upon the stretching, but likewise arises from the quality of the liquor. That a stimulus is one of the principal causes of the excretion of urine, we learn from the common saline diuretic medicines that are given, which are dissolved into the serum of the blood, and carried down by the kidneys to the bladder: The same appears likewise from the application of cantharides; or without any of these, when the parts are made more sensible, as in an excoriation of the bladder, there is a frequent desire to make water. Accordingly we find these animals evacuate their urine much more frequently than man, or any other creature that lives on vegetable food. And if these creatures, whose fluids have already a tendency to putrefaction, are exposed to heat or hunger, the liquids must for a considerable time undergo the actions of the containing vessels, and frequently perform the course of the circulation, without any new supplies of food; by which the fluids becoming more and more acid, the creature is apt to fall into feverish and putrid diseases.\n\nTheir spermatic vessels are within the peritoneum, which is spread over them, and from which they have a membrane like a meniscus, to hang loose and pendulous in the abdomen; whereas in us, they are contained in the cellular part of the peritoneum, which is tensely stretched over them. At their passage out of the lower belly, there appears a plain perforation, or holes; hence the adult quadruped, in this respect, resembles the human fetus. And from observing this in quadrupeds, has arisen the false notion of hernia or rupture among authors. This opening, which leads down to the testicle, is of no disadvantage to them, but evidently would have been to us; for from the weight of our viscera, and our continually gravitating upon these holes, we must have perpetually laboured under enteroceles. This they are in no hazard of, since in them this passage is at the highest part of their belly, and, in their horizontal posture, the viscera cannot bear upon it: And, to prevent even the smallest hazard, there is a loose pendulous seminalur flap of fat, which serves two uses, as it both hinders the intestines from getting into the passage, and also the course of the fluids from being stopped in the vessels, which is secured in us by the cellular substance and tense peritoneum: And it may be worth while to observe, that this process remains almost unaltered, even after the animal has been almost exhausted of fat.\n\nThere is next a passage quite down into the cavity where the testicles lie. Had the same structure obtained in man, by the constant drilling down of the liquor which is secreted for the lubricating of the guts, we should always have laboured under an hydrocele; but their posture secures them from any hazard of this kind: indeed very fat lap-dogs, who consequently have an overgrown omentum, are sometimes troubled with an epiplocele.\n\nThe scrotum is shorter and not so pendulous as the Scrotum human in all the dog kind that want the vesiculae seminales, that the seed at each copulation might the sooner be brought from the testes, thus in some measure supplying the place of the vesiculae seminales; for the Vesicoure of the seed through the vasa deferentia is thus cut shortened, by placing the fecermining vessels nearer the nates, how excretory organs. Perhaps its passage is likewise quickened by the muscular power of the vasa deferentia, which is stronger in this creature than in man. The want of vesiculae seminales at the same time explains the reason why this creature is so tedious in copulation. But why these bodies are absent in the dog kind more than in other animals, is a circumstance we know nothing of.\n\nThe structure of the testicles is much the same with Testes, the human; as are likewise the corpora pyramidalis, variciformis, or pampiniformis, and the epididymis or excretory vessel of the testicle. The vasa deferentia enter the abdomen where the blood vessels come out; and, passing along the upper part of the bladder, are inserted a little below the bulbous part of the urethra.\n\nThe prepuce has two muscles fixed to it: one that arises from the sphincter ani, and is inserted all along the penis; and this is called retractor preputii: Penis. But the other, whose office is directly contrary to this, is cutaneous; and seems to take its origin from the muscles of the abdomen, or rather to be a production of their tunica carnea. The corpora cavernosa rise much in the same way as the human; but their root terminate; and the rest is supplied by a triangular bone, in the inferior part of which there is a groove excavated for lodging the urethra. There are upon the penis two protuberant bulbous fleshy fibulences, resembling the glans penis in man, at the back of which are two veins, which by the erectores penis and other parts are comprised in the time of coition; and the circulation being flopped, the blood diffuses the large cavernous bodies. After the penis is thus swollen, the vagina Coitua, by its contraction and swelling of its corpus cavernosum, which is considerably greater than in other animals, gripes it closely; and so the male is kept in action some time contrary to his will, till time be given for bringing a quantity of seed sufficient to impregnate the female: and thus, by that organum veneris of the female organs, the want of the vesiculae seminales is in some measure supplied. But as it would be a very uneasy posture for the dog to support himself solely upon his hinder feet, and for the bitch to support the weight of the dog for so long a time; therefore, as soon as the bulbous bodies are sufficiently filled, he gets off and turns averse to her. Had, then, the penis been pliable as in other animals, the urethra must of necessity\nnecesity have been comprised by this twisting, and consequently the course of the feed intercepted; but this is wisely provided against by the urethra's being formed in the hollow of the bone. After the emission of the feed, the parts turn flaccid, the circulation is restored, and the bulbous parts can be easily extracted.\n\nThe profunda seeras here divided into two, which are proportionally larger than the human, and afford a greater quantity of that liquid.\n\nThe uterus of multiparous animals is little else but a continuation of their vagina, only separated from it by a small ring or valve. From the uterus two long canals mount upon the loins, in which the foetus are lodged: these are divided into different sacs, which are strongly constricted betwixt each foetus; yet these coactions give way in the time of birth. From these go out the tubae Fallopianae, so that the ovaria come to lodge pretty near the kidneys.\n\nThe disposition and situation of the mammae vary as they bear one or more young. Those of the uniparous kind have them placed between the sacral extremities, which in them is the highest part of their bodies, whereby their young get at them without the inconvenience of kneeling; Nevertheless, when the creatures are of no great size, and their breast large, as in sheep, the young ones are obliged to take this posture. In multiparous animals, they must have a great number of nipples, that their several young ones may have room at the same time, and these dilposed over both thorax and abdomen; and the creatures generally lie down when the young are to be suckled, that they may give them the most favourable situation. From this it does not appear to be from any particular fitness of the vessels at certain places for giving a proper nourishment to the child, that the breasts are so placed in women as we find in them, but really from that situation being the most convenient both for mother and infant.\n\nSect. III. Anatomy of ruminating Animals, and particularly of the Cow.\n\nThe animal whose structure we have been examining, being one of those which live chiefly on other animals, had a foot formed for running and seizing its prey. But the tribe of ruminating animals have their feet enveloped in a horny covering, fitting them for walking much, as is required of many of them, but totally disqualifying them for seizing living prey.\n\nIn these animals, the spinous processes of the vertebre of the neck diminish in size according to the length of the neck; the atlas or first vertebra, has its lateral processes flattened and bending forwards, and the mamillary processes of the back of the head are lengthened out; hence, they can move the head with difficulty sideways or forwards, but the motion of the neck is very extensive. The ribs are broad and thick. The scapula is narrow next the back, and lengthened out towards the neck, and it has neither acromion nor coracoid processes. The great tuberosity near the head of the thigh bone, in the atlantal extremity is very large, and the rough line on the bone very prominent, to give greater room for the insertion of strong muscles. The two bones of the fore leg, grow together almost their whole length, being only distinguished from it at the top by a furrow. Hence, the side motion of the foot in these animals, is almost entirely prevented. The haunch bone is shaped something like a hammer, with the anterior part of the spine extremely large, and the muscles situated about these bones, exceeding strong and bulky, as one would suppose they ought to be, in order to enable these animals to kick with greater power.\n\nThere are no parietal bones in the skull of these animals, but their place is occupied by one very strong bone in the top of the head; the frontal bone is very large, and forms a large arch overhanging each orbit. The brain in these animals, is much smaller in proportion to the rest of their body, than in man; in the ox it constitutes $\\frac{1}{7}$ of the weight of the body, whereas in man it amounts to about $\\frac{1}{5}$; its general form does not differ much from that of man.\n\nIn the eye of the cow the pupil is oblong, rounded at the ends, and the tapetum is of a beautiful green colour, changing to an azure blue; the fibres at the back of the uvea are very large and conspicuous. The eye of this animal is usually the subject of dissection in examining the structure of this organ, which it exhibits to great advantage. It is in the organs of digestion, that these animals differ most essentially from the other mammalia; these therefore deserve a particular examination.\n\nThere are no cutting teeth in the upper jaw, but the gums are pretty hard, and the tongue rough, of the cow. This roughness is occasioned by long sharp-pointed papillae, with which the whole substance of it is covered. These papillae are turned towards the throat; so that by their means the food, having once got into the mouth, is not easily pulled back. The animals therefore supply the defect of teeth by wrapping their tongue round a tuft of grass; and, pressing it against the upper jaw, keep it stretched, and cut it with the teeth of the under jaw; then, without chewing, throw it down into the gullet, which in these creatures consists of a double row of spiral fibres crossing one another. All animals which ruminate must have more stomachs than one; some have two, some three; our present subject has no less than four. The food is carried directly down into the first, which lies upon the stomachs. Left side, and is the largest of all; it is called gorga, ventriculus, and caeca, by way of eminence. It is what Their is called by the general name of paunch by the vulgar names and There are no rings upon its internal surface; but in description instead of these there are a vast number of small blunt-pointed processes, by which the whole has a general roughness, and the surface is extended to several times the size of the paunch itself. The food, by the force of its muscular coat, and the liquors poured in here, is sufficiently macerated; after which it is forced up hence by the gullet into the mouth, and there it is made very small by mastication; this is what is properly called chewing the cud, or rumination; for which purpose the grinders are exceedingly well fitted: for instead of being covered with a thin crust, the enamel on them consists of perpendicular plates, between which the bone is bare, and constantly wearing faster than the enamel, so that the tooth remains good to extreme old age; and by means of these teeth the rumination is carried on for a long time without any danger of spoiling.\nspoil them. After rumination, the food is sent down by the gullet into the second stomach; for the gullet opens indifferently into both. It ends exactly where the two stomachs meet: and there is a smooth gutter with rising edges which leads into the second stomach, from thence to the third, and also to the fourth; however, the creature has the power of directing it into which it will. Some tell us, that the drink goes into the second; but that might be easily determined by making them drink before slaughter.\n\nThe second stomach, which is the anterior and smaller, is called ἀναγκάλης, reticulum, honeycomb, the bonnet or kings hood. It consists of a great number of cells on its internal surface, of a regular pentagonal figure, like a honeycomb. Here the food is farther macerated; from which it is protruded into the third, called ἐπιστομία or omastum, vulgo the marsupium, because the internal surface rises up into a great many plicae or folds, and stratum super stratum, according to the length of this stomach. Some of these plicae are farther produced into the stomach than others; i.e., first two long ones on each side, and within these two shorter in the middle, &c. There are numberless glandular grains like millet seeds dispersed on its plicae, from which some authors call this stomach the millet. From this it passes into the fourth, whose names are ἀναγκάλης, abomasum, caillé, or the red, which is the name it commonly has because of its colour. This much resembles the human stomach, or that of a dog; only the inner folds or plicae are longer and looser; and it may also be observed, that in all animals there is only one digestive stomach, and that has the same coagulating power in the fetus as the fourth stomach in this animal; whence this might not improperly be called the only true stomach. Caillé signifies curdled; and hence the French have given that as a name to this fourth stomach, because any milk that is taken down by young calves is there curdled. It is this fourth stomach, with the milk curdled in it, that is commonly taken for making runnet: but after the bile and pancreatic juice enter, this coagulation is not to be found, which shows the use of these liquors. There are other creatures which use the same food, that have not such a mechanism in their digestive organs. Horses, asses, &c., have but one stomach, where grass is macerated, and a liquor for their nourishment extracted, and the remainder sent out by the anus very little altered. From this different structure of the stomach in these creatures, a ruminant animal will be served with one-third less food than another of equal bulk: graziers are sufficiently acquainted with this. The reason is, that ruminating animals have many and strong digestive organs; all their food is fully prepared, and almost wholly converted into chyle: But a horse's stomach is not fitted for this; so that he requires a much greater quantity of food to extract the same nourishment.\n\nThe guts of these creatures are of a considerable length in proportion to the bulk of the body; and this confirms what we said formerly on the subject of the intestines of a dog, viz., that the length and capacity of the guts were different in different animals, according to the nature of their food.\n\nThe duodenum is formed here much the same way as in a dog, and the general intention kept in view with regard to the mixture of the bile and pancreatic lymph. The great guts here hardly deserve that name, their diameter differing very little from that of the small; but to compensate this, they are much longer proportionally than a dog's, being convoluted as the small guts are. The cæcum is very large and long. The digestion of the cow, as well as some other animals, is accompanied with rumination; the intention of which seems to be, that the food may be sufficiently comminuted, and thus more fully acted upon by the stomach; for it is not observed that a calf ruminates as long as it is fed only upon milk, though the action takes place as soon as it begins to eat solid food. But it is to be observed, that as long as a calf feeds only upon milk, the food descends immediately into the fourth stomach (which, as has been already mentioned, feeds only capable of performing the operation of digestion) without stopping in any of the first three. The rumination does not take place till after the animal has eaten a pretty large quantity: after which he lies down, if he can do it conveniently, and begins to chew; though the operation will take place in a standing posture, if he cannot lie down. In this action a ball is observed to rise from the stomach with great velocity, almost as if shot from a musket. This ball the animal chews very accurately, and then swallows it again, and so on alternately, till all the food he has eaten has undergone this operation. This is easily explained from the structure of the gullet, which has one set of fibres calculated for bringing up the grass, and another for taking it down.\n\nBy means of rumination, the cow extracts a much larger proportion of nourishment from her food than those animals which do not ruminate; and hence she is contented with much worse fare, and smaller quantities of it, than a horse; hence also the dung of cows, being much more exhausted of its fine parts than horse-dung, proves much inferior to it as a manure.\n\nThe spleen differs not much either in figure or situation from that of a dog; but it is a little more firmly fixed to the diaphragm, there not being here so much danger of this viscus's being hurt in the flexions of the spine.\n\nThe liver is not split into so many lobes in this creature as either in a man or dog; which depends on the small motion this creature enjoys in its spine, which made such a division needless. This also confirms what we formerly advanced on this head.\n\nThe situation of the heart is pretty much the same here with that of a dog, only its point is rather sharper: In us, the heart beating continually against the ribs, and both ventricles going equally far down to the constitution of the apex, it is very obtuse: but here the apex is made up only of the left ventricle, so is more acute.\n\nThe aorta in this creature is justly divided into an ascending and descending, though this division is ill founded, condensed either in a dog or man; and it has certainly been derived from this subject that the older anatomists took their descriptions when they made this division; for here the aorta divides into two, the ascending and descending.\n\nTheir urinary bladder is of a pyramidal shape. It is Bladder. Very large, and more membranaceous; for the urine of\nof these creatures not being so acid as that of carnivorous animals, there was no such occasion for expelling it so soon.\n\nThe male is provided with a loose pendulous scrotum, and consequently with vesiculae seminales. The female organs differ from those of a bitch, mostly as to the form of the cornua uteri, which are here contorted in form of a snail. In this, and all uniparous animals, they contain only part of the fecundines; but in bitches, and other multiparous animals, they run straight up in the abdomen, and contain the fetus themselves.\n\nThe form of a cow's uterus differs from the human in having two pretty large cornua. This is common to it with other brutes; for a bitch has two long cornua uteri. But these again differ (as being multiparous and uniparous) in this, that in the bitch's cornua the fetus are contained; whereas here there is only part of the fecundines, being mostly the allantois with the included liquor. The mucular fibres of the uterus are more easily discovered; its internal surface has a great number of spongy, oblong, protuberant, glandular bodies fixed to it. These are composed of vessels of the uterus terminating here. In an impregnated uterus, we can easily press out of them a chylous mucilaginous liquor; they are composed of a great many processes or digituli, and deep caverns, answering to as many caverns and processes of the placenta. Their resemblance has occasioned the name of papillae to be given them; and hence it was that Hippocrates was induced to believe that the fetus sucked in utero. The papillae are found in all the different stages of life, in the various stages of pregnancy, and likewise in the unimpregnated state. It is not easy to determine whether the uterus grows thicker or thinner in the time of gestation. The membranes, it is plain (by the stretching of the parts), must be made thinner; but then it is evident, that the vessels are at that time enlarged, upon which principally the thickness of any part depends; so there seems to be as much gained the one way as lost the other.\n\nThe os uteri is entirely shut up by a glutinous mucilaginous substance, that is common to the females of all creatures when with young; by this the external air is excluded, which would soon make the liquors corrupt: it also prevents the inflammation of the membranes, and the hazard of abortion. By this means also the lips of the womb are kept from growing together, which otherwise they would certainly at this time do. There are mucous glands placed here to secrete this glutin, which on the breaking of the membranes with the contained waters make a soap that lubricates and washes the parts, and makes them easily yield. The first of the proper involucra of the fetus is the chorion.\n\nThe chorion is a pretty strong firm membrane, on whose external surface are dispersed a great many red fleshy bodies of the same number, size, and structure, with the papillae, with which they are mutually indented. They have been called cotyledones, from Kotyle, \"cavity.\" This is greatly disputed by some as a name very improper; but we think without reason, since the surface that is connected to the papillae is concave, though when separated it appears rather convex. To shun all dispute, they may be called properly enough\n\nVol. II. Part I.\n\nplacentule, since they serve the same use as the placentae in women. The separation of these from the papillae without any lactation, and our not being able to inject coloured liquors from the vessels of the glands of the uterus into the placentule, seem to prove beyond a reply, that there can be here no anastomoses between the vessels. On their coats run a great number of vessels that are sent to the several placentules, on the external side next to the uterus; whereas in creatures that have but one placenta, as in the human subject, cats, dogs, &c., the adhesion is somewhat firmer; the placentae are likewise joined to the papillae in the cornua uteri. We shall next give the history of the allantois.\n\nThis is a fine transparent membrane contiguous to Allantois, the former. It is not a general involucrum of the fetus in the mother, for it covers only a small part of the amnios. It is mostly lodged in the cornua uteri. In mares, bitches, and cats, it surrounds the amnios, being everywhere interposed between it and the chorion. In sheep and goats it is the same as in this animal; and in swine and rabbits it covers still less of the amnios. This sac is probably formed by the dilatation of the urachus, which is connected at its other end to the fundus of the bladder, through which it receives its contents; and a great quantity of urine is commonly found in it. The membrane is doubled at the extremity of the canal, to hinder the return of the urine back into the bladder. Its vessels are so excessively fine and few, that we cannot force an injected liquor farther than the beginning of this coat. This membrane is so far analogous to the cuticula, as not to be liable to corruption, or easily irritated by acid liquors. The existence of this membrane in women has been very warmly disputed on both sides. Those who are against its existence deny they could ever find it; and, for allowing it were so, allege, that since the urachus is the human impervious, as appears by our not being able to throw allantois, liquors from the bladder into it, or vice versa, it cannot serve the use that is agreed by all it does serve in beasts; and therefore in the human body there is no such thing. But if we consider, on the other hand, first, that there seems to be the same necessity for such a reservoir in man as in other animals; secondly, that we actually find urine contained in the bladder of the human fetus; thirdly, that urine has been evacuated at the navel when the urethra was flopped, which urine without this conduit would have fallen into the cavity of the abdomen; fourthly, that midwives have pretended to remark two different sorts of waters come away at the time of birth; and, lastly, that Dr Littre and Dr Hale have given in this membrane of a human subject, with all the other fecundines curiously prepared, the one to the Royal Academy at Paris, the other to the Royal Society at London; by which societies their respective accounts are attested; not to mention Verheyen, Heister, Keill, &c., who affirm their having seen it; and Albinus is said to have shown to his college every year a preparation of it: On all these accounts it seems most probable, that there is such a membrane in the human body.\n\nThe third proper integument of the fetus is the amnios. It is thinner and firmer than the chorion; it has numerous ramifications of the umbilical vessels spread upon it, the lateral branches of which separate a liquor into its cavity. This is the proper liquor of the am-\nOf Birds.\n\nnios; which at first is in a small quantity, afterwards increases for some months, then again decreases; and in a cow near her time, the quantity of this liquor is not above a pound. This membrane does not enter the cornua uteri in this creature, being confined to the body of the uterus; whereas the allantois occupies chiefly its cornua. But for what further relates to the structure of the involucra, with the nature of the liquors contained in them, we must refer to the second volume of Medical Essays, from page 121, where you have the sum of all we know of this matter.\n\nThere are here two vene umbilicales, and but one in the human subject; because the extreme branches coming from the several placenta could not unite so soon as they would have done had they come all from one cake, as in the human.\n\nThere is a small round fleshy body that swims in the urine of this creature, snakes, &c., which is the hippomanes of the ancients. Several idle opinions and whims have been entertained as to its use; but that seems to be still unknown, or how it is generated or nourished, for it has no connexion with the fetus or placenta.\n\nCHAP. V. THE ANATOMY OF BIRDS.\n\nSect. I. Of Birds in general.\n\nThe structure of the greater part of these animals is obviously calculated for the most rapid of all motions. That part of the vertebral column which constitutes the back is immovable, but the neck is exceedingly flexible, the vertebrae being articulated together, not by flat surfaces, but by portions of cylinders, but in such a manner as that the more atlantal vertebrae can move only forward, the more sacral only backward. The neck is generally long, but its length differs in various species, being determined by their manner of life and other circumstances. The head is small in proportion to the body, and generally ends in a sharp bill, that the animal may the more easily make its way through the air. The breast bone is shaped like a shield, and has in the middle a large and broad spine, like the keel of a ship, thus forming a considerable extent of surface for the insertion of muscles. This ridge is most conspicuous in birds that fly. On each side of the breast bone, next the wings, are two bones, which correspond to the clavicle or collar bone in man, by which the wings are connected to the breast bone, and between these is a very elastic bone with two horns, shaped like a V, and commonly known by the name of merry-thought. The wings are composed in a manner very similar to the atlantal extremity in the mammalia, and are generally divided into two portions; the wing, to which the principal muscles are attached, and the pinion.\n\nFowls have the strongest muscles of their whole bodies inserted into their wings; whence by the way we may observe, that it is altogether impossible for man to buoy himself up into the air like birds, even though he had proper machines in place of wings, unless he were likewise provided with muscles strong enough for moving them, which he has not. In the next place, their wings are not placed in the middle of their bodies, but a good deal farther forwards; whence it would at first view appear, that their heads would be erect, and their posterior parts most depending when raised in the air; but by stretching out their heads which act upon the lever of a long neck, they alter their centre of gravity pretty much; and also by filling the faces or bladders in the inside of their abdomen with air, and expanding their tail, they come to make the posterior part of their bodies considerably higher; and thus they fly with their bodies nearly in a horizontal situation. Hence we find, that if their necks are kept from being stretched out, or if you cut away their tails, they become incapable of flying any considerable way.\n\nThe largeness of the wings in different fowls varies according to the wants of the creature. Thus birds of prey, who must fly a considerable way to provide their food, have large strong wings; whereas domestic birds, who find their nourishment almost everywhere, have very short and but small wings. Their tail is of use in afflicting to raise them in the air; though the chief purpose of it is to serve as a rudder in guiding their flight, whilst they use their wings as we do oars in putting forward a boat. The best account of this manner of progression of fowls is given by Alfonius Borellus, in his treatise De Motu Animalium; and in the Religious Philosopher we have Borelli's doctrine stripped pretty much of its mathematical form. The sacral extremities are situated so far back, as to make us at first think they would be in continual hazard of falling down forwards when they walk; but this is prevented by their holding up their head and neck, so as to make the centre of gravity fall upon the feet; and when they have occasion for climbing up a steep place they stretch out their heads and necks forward, especially if they are short legged, the better to preserve properly the balance of the body. Thus we may observe a goose entering a barn-door, where generally there is an ascending step, to stretch out its neck, which before was raised, and incline its body forwards. This is laughed at by the common people, who ascribe it to a piece of folly in the goose, as if afraid of knocking its head against the top of the door.\n\nCarnivorous birds are provided with strong crook-ended claws for catching their prey; water fowls use mechanism in the toes for swimming; and, principally for this purpose, fowls have a strong firm membrane interposed between the toes. There is a beautiful mechanism to be observed in the toes of fowls, which is of considerable use to them. For their toes are naturally drawn together, or bend, when the foot is bended; this is owing to the shortness of the tendons of the toes, which pass over them, which is analogous to our heel; and that the toes are set in the circumference of a circle, as our fingers are: Hence, when the foot is bended, the tendons must consequently be much stretched; and, since they are inserted into the toes, must necessarily bend them when the foot is bended; and when the foot is extended, the flexors of the toes are again relaxed, and they are therefore expanded. This is also of great use to different kinds of fowls; thus the hawk descending...\nscending with his legs and feet extended, spreads his talons over his prey; and the weight of his body bending his feet, the toes are contracted, and the prey is seized by the talons. This is also of great use to water fowls: for had there been no such contrivance as this, they must have lost as much time when they pulled their legs in as they had gained by the former stroke: but, as the parts are now framed, whenever the creature draws in its foot, the toes are at the same time bended and contracted into less space, so that the resistance made against the water is not near so great as before: on the contrary, when they stretch their feet, their toes are extended, the membrane betwixt them expanded, and consequently a greater resistance made to the water. Again, such fowls as live mostly in the air, or have occasion to sustain themselves on branches of trees in windy weather, and even in the night-time when asleep, while all their muscles are supposed to be in a state of relaxation, have only to lean down the weight of their bodies, and their toes continue bended without any muscles being in action; and whenever they would disentangle themselves, they raise up their bodies, by which their feet, and consequently their toes, are extended.\n\nFowls have a particular covering of feathers different from all other creatures, but exactly well suited to their manner of life: for it not only protects them from the injuries of the weather, but serves them in their progression through that thin aerial element they are, for the most part, employed in; and as fowls live much in the water, their feathers being continually besmeared with an oily liquor, keeps the water from soaking into their skins, and so prevents the bad effects which it would infallibly otherwise produce.\n\nThe brain in birds is large in proportion to their heads; it has neither corpus callosum, fornix, nor corpora quadrigemina. Hence we may conclude, that these parts are not essential to life, nor probably to reason.\n\nThe organ of smelling is placed at the base of the beak; the nostrils are sometimes naked, sometimes concealed by feathers, and by a small scale, or even by a fleshy substance.\n\nTheir organ of smelling is very large, and well provided with nerves; hence they have this sensation very acute. Ravens and other birds of prey give a sure proof of this, by their being able to find out their prey, though concealed from their sight and at a considerable distance.\n\nThose birds that grope for their food in the waters, mud, &c., have large nerves, which run quite to the end of their bills, by which they find out and distinguish their food.\n\nThe anterior part of their eyes (instead of having the sclerotic coat continued, so as to make near a sphere as in us) turns all of a sudden flat; so that here the sclerotic makes but half a sphere; and the cornea rises up afterwards, being a portion of a very small and distinct sphere: so that in these creatures there is a much greater difference betwixt the sclerotic and cornea than in us. Hence their eyes do not jut out of their heads, as in man and quadrupeds. As most of these creatures are continually employed in hedges and thickets, therefore, that their eyes might be secured from these injuries, as well as from too much light when flying in the face of the sun, there is a very elegant mechanism in their eyes. A membrane rises from the internal canthus, which, at pleasure, like a curtain, can be made to cover the whole eye; and this by means of a proper muscle that rises from the sclerotic coat, and passing round the optic nerves, runs through the musculus oculi attollens (by which however the optic nerves are not compressed) and palpebra, to be inserted into the edge of this membrane. Whenever this muscle ceases to act, the membrane by its own elasticity again discovers the eye. This covering is neither pellucid nor opaque, both which would have been equally inconvenient; but, being somewhat transparent, allows as many rays to enter as to make any object just visible, and is sufficient to direct them in their progression. By means of this membrane it is that the eagle is said to look at the sun.\n\nBesides, all birds have another particularity, the use Bourde of which is not so well understood; and that is, a sort. Its pretty long black triangular purle, rising from the description bottom of their eye just at the entry of the optic nerve, and stretched out into their vitreous humour, and one would imagine it gave some threads to the crystalline. To this the French (who probably were the first who took notice of it in their dissections before the Royal Academy) gave the name of bourde noire. This may possibly serve to suffocate some of the rays of light, that they may see objects more distinctly without hurting their eyes. It has a connexion with the vitreous, and seems to be joined also to the crystalline humour. If we suppose it to have a power of contraction (which may be as well allowed as that of the iris), it may so alter the position of the vitreous and crystalline humours, that the rays from any body may not fall perpendicularly upon the crystalline: and this seems to be necessary in them, since they cannot change the figure of the anterior part of their eye so much as we can do: and as this animal is exposed often to too great a number of rays of light, so they have no tapetum, but have the bottom of their eye wholly black on the retina; and in consequence of this, fowls see very ill in the dark.\n\nThey have no external ear; but in place of it a Organ of tuft of very fine feathers covering the meatus audito, hearing, rius, which easily allows the rays of sound to pass them, and likewise prevents dust or any insect from getting in. An external ear would have been inconvenient in their passing through thickets, and in flying, &c. A liquor is separated in the external part of the ear, or meatus auditorius, to lubricate the passage, and further prevent the entrance of any insects, &c. The membrana tympani is convex externally; and no muscles are fixed to the bones of their ear, which are rather of a cartilaginous confidence: any tremulous motions impressed on the air are communicated in these creatures merely by the spring and elasticity of these bones; so probably, the membrane is not so stretched as in the human ear by muscles. The semicircular canals are very distinct, and easily prepared.\n\nThe rostrum, bill, or beak of fowls, is composed of two mandibles; and, as in quadrupeds, the upper one in the beaks has no motion but what it possesses in common with fowls. But parrots are an exception to this rule; for they can move the upper mandible at pleasure; this is exceedingly convenient, as it enables them to lay hold of whatever comes in their way. Carnivorous fowls\nANATOMY.\n\nOf Birds.\n\nFowls have their beaks long, sharp, and crooked; the domestic fowls, such as the hen-kind, &c., have strong short beaks, commodiously fitted to dig up and break their food; the water fowls, again, have long or very broad scoop-like beaks, which is most convenient for them.\n\nThe other circumstances in which the structure of birds differs from that of other animals, particularly as to the organs of digestion, respiration, and generation, will be best explained by describing them in an individual instance; and we shall select for this purpose the domestic cock, taking an opportunity of contrasting the viscera of a carnivorous bird with those of this species as a granivorous bird.\n\nSect. II. Anatomy of a Cock.\n\nThough this kind of birds live upon food somewhat similar to that of man, yet as they have no teeth to separate or break down this food, we should expect to find something to compensate for the want of teeth, something remarkable in the organs of digestion: we shall therefore begin with these parts.\n\nThe gullet of this creature runs down its neck, somewhat inclined to the right side; and terminates in a pretty large membranous sac, which is the ingluvies or crop, where the food is macerated and dissolved by a liquor separated by the glands, which are easily observed everywhere on the internal surface of this bag. The effect of this maceration may be very well observed in pigeons, who are sometimes in danger of being suffocated by the peafe, &c. they feed upon, swelling to such an immense bulk in their ingluvies, that they can neither get upwards nor downwards. If it be a favourite fowl, it might be preserved by opening the sac, taking out the peafe, and sewing up the wound.\n\nThe food getting out of this sac goes down by the remaining part of the gullet into the ventriculus fuc- centuriatus, or infundibulum Peyeri, which is a continuation of the gullet with more numerous glands, which separate a liquor to dilute the food still more, which at length gets into the true stomach or gizzard, ventriculus callosus, which consists of two very strong muscles covered externally by a tendinous aponeurosis, and lined on the inside by a very thick firm membrane, which we evidently discover to be a production of the cuticle. This might have been proved in some measure a priori, from taking notice, that this membrane, which in chicks is only a thin slight pellicle, by degrees turns thicker and stronger the more attrition it suffers: but there is no other animal substance, so far as we know, which grows more hard and thick by being subjected to attrition, excepting the cuticle.—Hence may be drawn some kind of proof of what has been affirmed concerning the tunicia villosa of the stomach and intestines in the human body, viz. that it was in part a continuation of the epidermis; nay, all the hollow parts of the body, even arteries, veins, &c. seem to be lined with a production of this membrane, or one analogous to it. The use of the internal coat of the stomach of fowls is to defend the more tender parts of that viscus from the hard grains and little stones those creatures take down. The use of the gizzard is to compensate for the want of teeth; and it is well fitted for this purpose, from the great strength of which it possesses.\n\nThe digestion of these animals is performed merely by attrition, as is evinced by many experiments; and it is further assisted by the hard bodies they swallow. We see them daily take down considerable numbers of the most solid rugged little stones they find; and these can serve for no other purpose than to help the trituration of their aliment. After these pebbles, by becoming smooth, are unfit for this office, they are thrown up by the mouth. Hence fowls that are long confined, though ever so well fed, turn lean for want of these stones to help their digestion. This was put beyond all dispute by Mr. Tavry, who gave a piece of metal to an ostrich, convex on one side and concave on the other, but carved on both; and opening the creature's body some time after, it was found, that the carving on the convex side was all obliterated, while the engraved character remained the same as before on the concave side, which was not subjected to the stomach's pressure: which could not have happened had digestion been performed by a menstrum, or any other way whatsoever; but may be easily solved by allowing a simple mechanical pressure to take place. We are, however, by no means to conclude from this, as some have too rashly done, that in the human body digestion is performed by simple attrition; otherwise we may, with equal strength of reason, by as good arguments drawn from what is observed in fishes, prove that the aliment is dissolved in our stomachs by the action of a menstrum. But this method of reasoning is very faulty; nor can it ever bring us to the true solution of any philosophical or medical problem. It is very plain, since the structure of the parts of the human stomach are so very different from that of this creature, that it is foolish and unreasonable to imagine both of them capable of producing the same effects. At each end of the stomach, there are as it were two particular sacs of a different texture from the rest of the stomach, not consisting of strong muscular fibres; they seem to be receptacles for the stones (especially at the end which is farthest from the orifice), while the digested aliment is protruded into the intestines.\n\nSpallanzani, however, has lately found, that pebbles are not at all necessary to the trituration of the food of these animals. At the same time, he does not deny, that when put in motion by the gastric muscles, they are capable of producing some effect on the contents of the stomach; but is inclined to believe, that they are not sought for and selected by design, as many suppose, but because they frequently happen to be mixed with the food.\n\nThe duodenum begins pretty near the same place at Duodenum, which the gullet enters; yet notwithstanding the vicinity of these two tubes, the aliment are in no danger of getting out before they are perfectly digested, by reason of a protuberance between the orifices; and in those creatures who have such a strong muscular stomach, it is a matter of great indifference whether the entry of the gullet or pylorus be highest, provided that the entry from the gullet does not allow the food to regurgitate, since the force of the stomach can easily protrude it towards the duodenum. This gut is mostly in the right side, and hangs pendulous in their abdomen, having...\nChap. V.\n\nANATOMY.\n\nOf Birds.\n\nDuctus choledochus enters near its termination, where it mounts up again to be fixed to the liver; and left, by the contraction of the intestine, the bile should pass over without being intimately blended with the chyle, that duct enters downwards, contrary to the course of the food, and contrary to what is observed in any of the animals we have yet mentioned. But still the general intention is kept in view, in allowing these juices the fairest chance of being intimately blended with the food.\n\nThe small guts are proportionally longer than those of carnivorous birds, for the general cause already assigned. At the end of the ilium they have two large intestina caca, one on each side, four or five inches long, coming off from the side of the rectum, and ascending; and we find them containing part of the food: They serve as reservoirs to the feces; which, after some delay there, regurgitate into what soon becomes the rectum; which, together with the excretories of urine and organs of generation, empties itself into the common cloaca. The small intestines are connected by a long loose mesentery, which has little or no fat accompanying the blood vessels, there being no hazard of the blood's being flopped.\n\nThe principal difference to be observed in carnivorous birds is in their chylotrophic vessels, which may be accounted for from their different way of life.\n\nImmediately under their clavicles, you will observe the oesophagus expanded into their inguivories, which is proportionally less than in the granivorous kind, since their food does not swell so much by maceration; and for the same reason, there is a less quantity of a menstruum to be found here.\n\nThey have also a ventriculus succenturiatus, plentifully stored with glands, situated immediately above their stomach, which we see here is thin and mucilaginous, otherwise than in the granivorous kind; and this difference, which is almost the only one we shall find betwixt the two different species of fowls, is easily accounted for from the nature of their food, which requires less attention, being easier of digestion than that of the other kind; nevertheless, it seems requisite it should be stronger than the human, to compensate the want of abdominal muscles, which are here very thin.\n\nThe same mechanism obtains in this creature's duodenum that we have hitherto observed. As being a carnivorous animal, its guts are proportionally shorter than those of the granivorous kind: for the reason first given, viz. its food being more liable to corrupt, therefore not proper to be long detained in the body; and for that reason it has no intestina caca, of which the other species of fowls have a pair. The difference in their wings, backs, and claws, is obvious; and has been already in some measure observed.\n\nThe pancreas in this creature lies betwixt the two folds of the duodenum, and sends two or three ducts into this gut pretty near the biliary.\n\nThe spleen is here of a round globular figure, situated between the liver and stomach; and betwixt these and the back bone it enjoys the same properties as in other animals, viz. large blood vessels, &c. All its blood is sent into the vena portarum, and has a perpetual congealation. It has no excretory, as far as we know. Their liver is divided into two equal lobes by a pellucid membrane, running according to the length of their body; and hence we may observe, that it is not peculiar to that bowel to lie on the right side; which is still more confirmed by what we observe in fishes, where the greatest part of it lies in the left side.\n\nThe shape of their gall bladder is not much different from that of quadrupeds; but is thought to be longer in proportion to the size of the animal, and is farther removed from the liver.\n\nThe principal difference to be remarked in their heart, is the want of the valvula tricuspidis, and their place being supplied by one fleety flap.\n\nThe lungs are not looed within the cavity of the thorax, but fixed to the bone all the way; neither are they divided into lobes, as in those animals that have a large motion in their spine. They are two red, spongy bodies, covered with a membrane that is pervious, and which communicates with the large vesicles or air-bags that are dispersed over their whole abdomen; which vesicles, according to Dr. Monro, serve two very considerable uses. The one is to render their bodies specifically light, when they have a mind to ascend and buoy themselves up when flying, by diffusing their dome-like lungs with air, and also straighten their windpipe, and so return the air. Secondly, They supply the place of a muscular diaphragm and strong abdominal muscles, producing the same effects on the several contained viscera, as these muscles would have done, without the inconvenience of their additional weight; and conducing as much to the exclusion of the egg and feces.\n\nDr. Hunter has made some curious discoveries relative to these internal receptacles of air in the bodies of birds. Some of them are lodged in the fleety parts, and some in the hollow bones; but all of them communicate with the lungs. He informs us, that the air cells which are found in the soft parts have no communication with the cellular membrane which is common to birds as well as other animals. Some of them communicate immediately with each other; but all of them by the intervention of the lungs as a common centre. Some of them are placed in cavities, as the abdomen; others in the interstices of parts, as about the breast. The bones which receive air are of two kinds; some of them divided into innumerable cells; others hollowed out into one large canal. They may be distinguished from such as do not receive air, by having less specific gravity; by being less vascular; by containing little oil; by having no marrow nor blood in their cells; by having less hardness and firmness than others; and by the passage for the air being perceptible.\n\nThe mechanism by which the lungs are fitted for conveying air to these cavities is, their being attached to the diaphragm, and connected also to the ribs and sides of the vertebrae. The diaphragm is perforated in several places by pretty large holes, allowing a free passage of air into the abdomen. To each of these holes is attached a distinct membranous bag, thin and transparent. The lungs open at their interior part into membranous cells, which lie upon the sides of the pericardium, and communicate with the cells of the sternum. The superior parts of the lungs open into cells of a loose net-work, through which the windpipe and gullet pass. When these cells are distended with\nOf Birds. with air, it indicates passion, as in the case of the turkey-cock, pouting-pigeon, &c.\n\nThese cells communicate with others in the axilla, and under the large pectoral muscle; and those with the cavity of the os humeri, by means of small openings in the hollow surface near the head of that bone. Lastly, the posterior edges of the lungs have openings into the cells of the vertebrae, ribs, os sacrum, and other bones of the pelvis, from which the air finds a passage to the cavity of the thigh bone.\n\nConcerning the use of these cavities the doctor conjectures, that they are a kind of appendage to the lungs; and that, like the bags continued through the bellies of amphibious animals, they serve as a kind of reservoirs of air. They assist birds during their flight, which must be apt to render frequent respiration difficult. He farther infirmates, that this construction of the organs of respiration may assist birds in fingering; which, he thinks, may be inferred from the long continuance of song between the breathings of a canary bird. On tying the windpipe of a cock, the animal breathed through a canula introduced into his belly; another through the os humeri, when cut across; and a hawk through the os femoris. In all these cases the animal soon died. In the first, the Doctor ascribes the death to an inflammation of the bowels; but in the last, he owns it was owing to difficult breathing. What took place, however, was sufficient to show that the animals did really breathe through the bone.\n\nWhen we examine the upper end of the trachea, we observe a ring glottidis with muscular sides, which may act in preventing the food or drink from passing into the lungs: for there is no epiglottis as in man and quadrupeds.\n\nThe windpipe, near where it divides, is very much contracted; and their voice is principally owing to this contraction. If you listen attentively to a cock crowing, you will be sensible that the noise does not proceed from the throat, but deeper; nay, this very pipe, when taken out of the body, and cut off a little after its division, and blown into, will make a squeaking noise, something like the voice of these creatures. On each side, a little higher than this contraction, there is a muscle arising from their sternum, which dilates the trachea. The cartilages, of which the pipe is composed in this animal, go quite round it; whereas in man and quadrupeds they are discontinued for about one-fourth on the back part, and the intermediate space is filled up by a membrane. Neither is the trachea so firmly attached to their vertebrae as in the other creatures we have examined. This structure we shall find of great service to them, if we consider, that had the same structure obtained in them as in us, their breath would have been in hazard of being flopped at every flexion or twisting of their neck, which they are frequently obliged to. This we may be sensible of by bending our necks considerably on one side, upon which we shall find a great straitness and difficulty of breathing; whereas their trachea is better fitted for following the flexions of the neck by its loose connexion to the vertebrae.\n\nIn place of a muscular diaphragm, this creature has nothing but a thin membrane connected to the pericardium, which separates the thorax and abdomen. But besides this, the whole abdomen and thorax are divided by a longitudinal membrane or mediastinum connected to the lungs, pericardium, liver, stomach, and to the fat lying over their stomach and guts, which is analogous to an omentum, and supplies its place.\n\nThe lymphatic system in birds consists, as in man, of lymphatic lacteals and lymphatic vessels, with the thoracic duct.\n\nThe lacteals, indeed, in the strictest sense, are the lymphatics of the intestines; and, like the other lymphatics, carry only a transparent lymph; and instead of one thoracic duct, there are two, which go to the jugular veins. In these circumstances, it would seem that birds differ from the human subject, so far at least as we may judge from the direction of a goose, the common subject of this inquiry, and from which the following description is taken.\n\nThe lacteals run from the intestines upon the mesenteric vessels: those of the duodenum pass by the side of the pancreas; afterward they get upon the celiac artery, of which the superior mesenteric is a branch. Here they are joined by the lymphatics of the liver, and then they form a plexus which surrounds the celiac artery. Here also they receive a lymphatic from the gizzard, and soon after another from the lower part of the gullet. At the root of the celiac artery they are joined by the lymphatics from the glandula renalis, and near the same part by the lacteals from the other small intestines, which vessels accompany the lower mesenteric artery; but, before they join those from the duodenum, receive from the rectum a lymphatic, which runs from the blood vessels of that gut. Into this lymphatic some small vessels from the kidneys seem to enter at the root of the celiac artery. The lymphatics of the facial extremities probably join those from the intestines. At the root of the celiac artery and contiguous part of the aorta, a net-work is formed by the vessels above described. From this net-work arise two thoracic ducts, of which one lies on each side of the spine, and runs obliquely over the lungs to the jugular vein, into the inside of which it terminates, nearly opposite to the angle formed by the vein and this subclavian one. The thoracic duct of the left side is joined by a large lymphatic, which runs upon the gullet. The thoracic ducts are joined by the lymphatics of the neck, and probably by those of the wings, where they open into the jugular veins. The lymphatics of the neck generally consist of two large branches, on each side of the neck, accompanying the blood vessels; and these two branches join near the lower part of the neck, and form a trunk which runs close to the jugular vein, and opens into a lymphatic gland; from the opposite side of this gland a lymphatic comes out, which ends in the jugular vein.\n\nOn the left side, the whole of this lymphatic joins the thoracic duct of the same side; but, on the right one, part of it goes into the inside of the jugular vein a little above the angle; whilst another joins the thoracic duct, and with that duct forms a common trunk, which opens into the inside of the jugular vein, a little below the angle which that vein makes with the subclavian. This system in birds differs most from that of quadrupeds, in the chyle being transparent and colourless, and in there being no visible lymphatic glands, neither in the course of the lacteals, nor in that of the lymphatics of the abdomen, nor near the thoracic ducts.\nThe kidneys lie in the hollow excavated in the side of the back-bone, from which there is sent out a bluish-coloured canal running along by the side of the vas deferens, and terminating directly in the common cloaca. This is the ureter, which opens by a peculiar aperture of its own, and not at the penis. Fowls having no urinary bladder, it was thought by some they never passed any urine, but that it went to the nourishment of the feathers; but this is false; for that whitish substance that we see their greenish faeces covered with, and which turns afterwards chalky, is their urine. Let us next consider the organs of generation of both sexes, and first those of the male.\n\nThe testicles are situated one on each side of the back-bone; and are proportionally very large to the creature's bulk. From these run out the vasa feminina; at first straight; but after they recede farther from the body of the testicle, they acquire an undulated or convoluted form, as the epididymis in man. These convolutions partly supply the want of vesiculae seminales, their coition being at the same time very short: They terminate in the penis, of which the cock has two, one on each side of the common cloaca, pointing directly outwards. They open at a distance from each other, and are very small and short; whence they have escaped the notice of anatomists, who have often denied their existence. In birds there is no prostate gland. This is what is chiefly remarkable in the organs of the male.\n\nThe racemus vitellorum, being analogous to the ovaria in the human subject, is attached by a proper membrane to the back-bone. This is very fine and thin, and continued down to the uterus. Its orifice is averse with respect to the ovaria; yet notwithstanding, by the force of the organum venerum, it turns round and grasps the vitellus, which in its passage through this duct, called the infundibulum, receives a thick gelatinous liquor, secreted by certain glands. This, with what it receives in the uterus, compoises the white of the egg. By this tube then it is carried into the uterus. The shell is lined with a membrane; and in the large end there is a bag full of air, from which there is no outlet.\n\nThe uterus is a large bag, placed at the end of the infundibulum, full of wrinkles on its inside; here the egg is completed, receiving its last involucrum, and is at last pulled out at an opening on the side of the common cloaca. From the testes in the male being so very large in proportion to the body of the creature, there must necessarily be a great quantity of semen secreted; hence the animal is fallacious, and becomes capable of impregnating many females. The want of the vesiculae seminales is in some measure supplied by the convolutions of the vasa deferentia, and by the small distance betwixt the fecerning and excretory organs. The two supplied, penes contribute also very much to their short coition; at which time the opening of the uterus into the cloaca is very much dilated, that the effect of the semen on the vitelli may be the greater.\n\nA hen will of herself indeed lay eggs; but these are not impregnated, and yet appear entirely complete, except that the small black spot, which comes afterwards to be the rudiments of the chick, is not here to be observed.\n\n---\n\n**TABLE of the Proportional Number of Ribs and Vertebrae in various species of Birds.**\n\n| Species          | Verteb. of Neck | Verteb. of Back | Anter. false Ribs | True Ribs | Poster. false Ribs | No of Ribs | Sacral Verteb. | Coccyg.

VI. ANATOMY OF REPTILES.\n\n#### Sect. I. Of Reptiles in general.\n\nThese animals, like the fishes, have their blood nearly of the same temperature with the element in which they live. They have indeed a lung, and respire air, but their pulmonary vessels are only branches of the large general artery and vein, and do not, as in the hot-blooded animals, form a peculiar system equal to the vascular system of the rest of the body.\n\nWith respect to their organs of motion, reptiles may be divided into two orders. In the one, the serpents, the body is cylindrical and entirely without limbs, their motion is a kind of writhing or creeping.\n\nThe others have four feet very similar in structure to those of the mammalia, whence these animals have been called oviparous quadrupeds. Such of them as live in the water have frequently membranes between their toes, which they employ like the fins of fishes for swimming. One species has a kind of membranaceous\nOf Reptiles. branaceous wings. We know two species which are called bipedal reptiles, which are only distinguished from serpents in having two very small feet. In the whole class the feet are so short, and so close to the body, that they are not unaptly termed reptiles or creeping animals.\n\nTheir eyes are large and fiery, and are furnished with three lids. Their ear has neither concha nor external passage, and its tympanum lies flat to the head, and is often covered with scales or flesh; internally it has only one little bone composed of a plate furnished with a sort of handle. In some species the tympanum and its little bone are entirely wanting, as also the cochlea, but they have all semicircular canals, and a vestibule. Their nostrils are generally small. In the serpents, whose tongue is almost horny, the sense of taste cannot be very exquisite, but in the other species where the tongue is softer it may be pretty acute.\n\nTheir skin is naked or covered with scales. The tortoises are remarkable for being covered with a kind of buckler.\n\nSome species of oviparous quadrupeds have six toes. Serpents exercise the sense of touch by wrapping their body round the object which they desire to feel.\n\nThe brain of reptiles is very small, and divided into very distinct tubercles. Their sensation seems less to depend on a common centre than in the other animals which we have been considering, as they can live for a long time without the head, and after being deprived of the heart, and all the viscera; their limbs when separated from the body preserve their irritability for a considerable time; the heart of a frog will beat for many hours after it has been cut out. Reptiles have also a considerable power of reproduction. The tail of a lizard and several parts of water falanders will grow again after being cut off. The jaws in these animals are for the most part armed with teeth which are conical and pointed, but some of them have only fleshy or horny gums. Their alimentary canal is but small and has no caecum, but it receives fluids similar to those of the hot-blooded animals. The urine, which is secreted by the kidneys, is received into a bladder, but is evacuated by the anus.\n\nTheir heart has only one ventricle, from which proceeds a single artery divided into two large branches, which furnish each a twig to the lung of that side, and are then united to be distributed to the other parts of the body. Hence these animals can at pleasure suspend respiration without stopping the circulation of the blood, so that they can remain a long time under water, or in a close vessel. The cells of the lungs are much larger than in the hot-blooded animals; and these organs resemble oblong bags, which float in the same cavity with the other viscera, without the interposition of a diaphragm. Some of these animals have the power of inflating their lungs to a great extent. They have a windpipe and a larynx, by which they can produce sounds as in other animals which are provided with nerves.\n\nThe females of reptiles have a double receptacle for eggs furnished with two tubes, which open at the anus. In some species copulation takes place, and the eggs are covered with a shell more or less hard. In others the male merely sprinkles with semen the eggs already laid, and these are merely covered with a membrane. Reptiles, no more than other animals with cold blood, have the power of hatching their eggs.\n\nSect. II. Tortoise.\n\nThis covering of this animal is composed of a shell so remarkably hard and firm in its texture, that a covered wagon may go over it without hurting the shell or the animal within it. In the young animal, this shell grows harder in proportion as its contents expand; and this creature never changes its shell as some others do; hence it was necessary for it to be made up of different pieces; and there are more or less distinct in different animals. Their feet are small and weak; and they are exceedingly slow in motion.\n\nIt has neither tongue nor teeth; to make up for which, their lips are so hard as to be able to break almost the hardest bodies.\n\nThe alimentary canal very much resembles that of the former class.\n\nThe principal difference is in the circulation of the blood. The heart has two distinct auricles, without any communication; and under these, there is the appearance of two ventricles similar in shape to those of the former class; but they may be considered as one cavity; for the ventricle sends out not only the pulmonary artery, but likewise the aorta; for there is a passage in the septum, by which the ventricles communicate freely, and the blood passes from the left into the right one. From the aorta, the blood returns into the right auricle, while that from the pulmonary artery returns to the left auricle, from which it is sent to the left ventricle, &c., so that only a part of the blood is sent to the lungs, the rest going immediately into the aorta; hence the animal is not under the necessity of breathing so often as otherwise it would be.\n\nFrom the base of the right ventricle goes out the pulmonary artery, and aorta. The pulmonary artery fills is sent upon the lungs. The aorta may be said to be three in number; for the aorta sinistra ascends through the pericardium in company with the pulmonary artery; and afterwards turns down, and sends off a considerable branch, which splits into two; one of which joins the right aorta, while the other is distributed upon the liver, stomach, intestines, &c. What remains of this aorta runs to the kidneys or posterior extremities of that side. An aorta descendens, &c., after piercing the pericardium, runs down and communicates with the branch already mentioned, is distributed upon the right kidney and inferior extremity, and also upon the bladder and parts of generation. An aorta ascendens, after getting out of the pericardium, supplies the fore-legs, neck, and head. The blood in the superior part of the body returns to the right auricle by two jugular veins, which unite after perforating the pericardium. From the inferior part, it returns to the same auricle by two large veins; one on the right side receives the blood in the right lobe of the liver; the other on the left side receives the blood in the left lobe, and also a trunk which corresponds\ncorresponds with the inferior vena cava in other animals. The pulmonary vessels run in the left auricle in the common way.\n\nThe absorbent system in the turtle, like that in the former clasps, consists of lacteals and lymphatics, with their common trunks the thoracic ducts; but differs from it in having no obvious lymphatic glands on any part of its body, nor plexus formed at the termination in the red veins.\n\nLacteals.\n\nThe lacteals accompany the blood vessels upon the mesentery, and form frequent net-works across these vessels: near the root of the mesentery a plexus is formed, which communicates with the lymphatics coming from the kidneys and parts near the anus. At the root of the mesentery on the left side of the spine, the lymphatics of the spleen join the lacteals; and immediately above this a plexus is formed, which lies upon the right aorta. From this plexus a large branch arises, which passes behind the right aorta to the left side, and gets before the left aorta, where it assists in forming a very large receptaculum, which lies upon that artery.\n\nFrom this receptaculum arise the thoracic ducts. From its right side goes one trunk, which is joined by that large branch that came from the plexus to the left side of the right aorta, and then passes over the spine. This trunk is the thoracic duct of the right side; for having got to the right side of the spine, it runs upwards, on the inside of the right aorta, towards the right subclavian vein; and when it has advanced a little above the lungs, it divides into branches, which near the same place are joined by a large branch, that comes up on the outside of the aorta. From this part upwards, those vessels divide and subdivide, and are afterwards joined by the lymphatics of the neck, which likewise form branches before they join those from below. So that between the thoracic duct and the lymphatics of the same side of the neck, a very intricate net-work is formed; from which a branch goes into the angle between the jugular vein and the lower part or trunk of the subclavian. This branch lies therefore on the inside of the jugular vein, whilst another gets\n\nto the outside of it, and seems to terminate in it, a little above the angle, between that vein and the subclavian.\n\nInto the above-mentioned receptaculum, the lymphatics of the stomach and duodenum likewise enter. Those of the duodenum run by the side of the pancreas, and probably receive its lymphatics and a part of those of the liver. The lymphatics of the stomach and duodenum have very numerous anastomoses, and form a beautiful net-work on the artery which they accompany. From this receptaculum likewise (besides the trunk already mentioned, which goes to the right side) arise two other trunks pretty equal in size; one of which runs upon the left side, and the other upon the right side of the left aorta, till they come within two or three inches of the left subclavian vein; where they join behind the aorta, and form a number of branches which are afterwards joined by the lymphatics of the left side of the neck; so that here a plexus is formed as upon the right side. From this plexus a branch issues, which opens into the angle between the jugular and subclavian vein.\n\nSect. III. Serpent and Crocodile.\n\nThe circulation in these is similar to that of the turtle; but we find only one ventricle. The blood goes from the right auricle to the ventricle which sends out the pulmonary artery and aorta; the blood from the pulmonary artery returns to the left auricle, that from the aorta going to the right auricle, and both the auricles opening into the ventricle.\n\nSect. IV. Frog and Lizard.\n\nThese differ from the former animals, in having only one auricle and a ventricle: and besides, the ventricle sends out a single artery, which afterwards splits into two parts; one to supply the lungs, the other runs to all the rest of the body: from the lungs and from the other parts, the blood returns into the auricle.\n\nCHAP. VII. ANATOMY OF FISHES.\n\nOf these we may first observe, that they have a very strong thick cuticle, covered with a great number of scales, laid one on another like the tiles of houses. This among other arguments is supposed to prove the human epidermis to be of a squamous structure: but the scales resemble the hairs, wool, feathers, &c. of the creatures that live in air; and below these we observe their proper cuticle and cutis.\n\nThe generality of fishes, particularly those shaped like the cod, haddock, &c. have a line running on each side. These lines open externally by a number of ducts, which throw out a mucous or slimy substance that keeps them soft and clammy, and seems to serve the same purpose with the mucous glands or ducts which are placed within many of our internal organs.\n\nIn the next place, these creatures have neither atlantal nor facial extremities, as quadrupeds and fowls; for their progression is performed in a different way swimming, from either of those species of animals: for this purpose they are provided with machines properly constructed of a great number of elastic beams, connected to each other by firm membranes, and with a tail of the same texture; their spine is very moveable towards the fins, tail, posterior part, and the strongest muscles of their bodies &c. are inserted there. Their tails are so framed as to contract to a narrow space when drawn together to either side, and to expand again when drawn to a straight line with their bodies; so, by the assistance of this broad tail, and the fins on their sides, they make their progression much in the same way as a boat with oars on its sides and rudder at its stern. The perpendicular fins situated on the superior part of their body keep them in aquilibrio, hindering the belly from turning uppermost; which it would readily do, because of the air-bag.\nChap. VII.\n\nANATOMY.\n\nOf Fishes.\n\nair-bag in the abdomen rendering their belly specifically lighter than their back; but by the resistance these fins meet with when inclined to either side, they are kept with their backs always uppermost.\n\nIt may be next observed, that these creatures have nothing that can be called a neck, seeing they seek their food in a horizontal way, and can move their bodies either upwards or downwards, as they have occasion, by the contraction or dilatation of the air-bag; a long neck, as it would hinder their progression, would be very disadvantageous in the element they live in.\n\nIn the bony fishes the bodies of the vertebrae are sometimes cylindrical, sometimes angular, and frequently compressed: they are articulated only by their bodies, as there are no articulatory processes. They may be divided into two classes; those of the tail, which are furnished with a spinous process both above and below; and those of the belly or back which have it only above. These last are usually furnished at the sides, with transverse processes for the attachment of the ribs. Of Fishes.\n\nThe spinous processes, both dorsal and sternal, are very long, especially in the flat fish. At the base of the dorsal processes there is a canal for lodging the spinal marrow, and the blood vessels pass through a similar canal at the base of the sternal processes. There is nearly the same structure in the cartilaginous fishes; but in these all the cartilages are so firmly fixed together, that only the spinous processes can be distinguished. The vertebra of a fish differs from that of other animals in the structure of its body, at each extremity of which there is a conical cavity, so that between each pair of vertebrae there is a hollow space formed by these two cones joined base to base, filled with a very soft cartilaginous or mucous substance on which the motions of the vertebrae are easily performed. The annexed table shows the proportional number of vertebra in several species of fish.\n\nTABLE of the Number of VERTEBRAE in several Species of FISHES.\n\n| SPECIES                  | Cervical Vertebrae | Dorso-lumbar Vertebrae | Lumbar Vertebrae | Coccygian Vertebrae | Total No of Vertebrae |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|\n| Raia batis.

It seems to be mostly by their acute smell that they discover their food; for their tongue seems not to have been designed for a very nice sensation, being of a pretty firm cartilaginous substance; and common experience evinces, that their sight is not of so much use to them as their smell in searching for their nourishment. If you throw a fresh worm into the water, a fish will dilate with it at a considerable distance; and that this is not done by the eye, is plain from observing, that after the same worm has been a considerable time in the water, and lost its smell, no fishes will come near it; but if you take out the bait, and make several little incisions into it, so as to let out more of the odoriferous effluvia, it will have the same effect as formerly. Now it is certain, that had the creatures discovered this bait with their eyes, they would have come equally to it in both cases. In consequence of their smell being the principal means which they have of discovering their food, we may frequently observe their allowing themselves to be carried down with the stream, that they may ascend again leisurely against the current of the water; thus the odoriferous particles swimming in that medium, being applied more forcibly to their smelling organs, produce a stronger sensation.\n\nThe optic nerves in these animals are not confounded with one another in their middle progress betwixt their origin and the orbit, but the one passes over the other without any communication; so that the nerve that comes from the left side of the brain goes distinctly to the right eye, and vice versa.\n\nIndeed it would seem not to be necessary for the optic nerves of fishes to have the same kind of connection with each other as those of man have: for their eyes are not placed in the fore part, but in the sides of their heads; and of consequence, they cannot so conveniently look at any object with both eyes at the same time.\n\nThe crystalline lens is here a complete sphere, and more dense than in terrestrial animals, that the rays of light coming from water might be sufficiently reflected.\n\nAs fishes are continually exposed to injuries in the uncertain element in which they live, and as they are in perpetual danger of becoming a prey to the larger ones, it was necessary that their eyes should never be shut; and as the cornea is sufficiently washed by the element they live in, they are not provided with palpebrae: but then, as in the current itself the eye must be exposed to several injuries, there was a necessity it should be sufficiently defended; which in effect it is by a firm pellucid membrane, that seems to be a continuation of the cuticle, being stretched over here. The epidermis is so very proper for this purpose, as being inflexible and destitute of vessels, and consequently not liable to obstructions, or, by that means, of becoming opaque. In the eye of the skate tribe, there is a digitated curtain which hangs over the pupil, and may shut out the light when the animal rests, and it is similar to the tunica adnata of other animals.\n\nAlthough it was formerly much doubted whether fishes possessed a sense of hearing; yet there can be little doubt of it now; since it is found that they have a complete organ of hearing as well as other animals, and likewise as the water in which they live is proved to be a good medium, fishes, particularly those of the skate kind, have a bag at some distance behind the eyes, which contains a fluid and a soft cretaceous substance, and supplies the place of vestibule and cochlea. There is a nerve distributed upon it, similar to the portio mollis in man. They have three semicircular canals, which are filled with a fluid, and communicate with the bag: they have likewise, as the present professor of anatomy at Edinburgh has discovered, a meatus externus, which leads to the internal ear. The cod fish, and others of the same shape, have an organ of hearing somewhat similar to the former; but instead of a soft substance contained in the bag, there is a hard cretaceous stone. In this kind of fish no meatus externus has been yet observed: And Dr Monro is inclined to think that they really have not one, from the consideration that the common canal or vestibule, where the three semicircular canals communicate, is separated from the cavity of the cranium by a thin membrane only; that this cavity, in the greater number of fishes, contains a watery liquor in considerable quantity; and that, by the thinness of the cranium, the tremor excited by a sorrowful body may readily and easily be transmitted through the cranium to the water within it, and so to the ear.\n\nThe belly is covered on the inferior part with a black-coloured thin membrane resembling our peritoneum. It is divided from the chest by a thin membranous partition, which has no muscular appearance; so that we have now seen two different sorts of animals that have no muscular diaphragm.\n\nThese creatures are not provided with teeth proper Teeth, for breaking their aliment into small morsels, as the whale does; they are generally small fishes, or other animals that need no trituration in the mouth, but spontaneously and gradually dissolve into a liquid chyle. Their teeth serve to grasp their prey, and hinder the creatures they have once caught from escaping again. For the same purpose, the internal cartilaginous basis of the bronchi, and the two round bodies situated in the posterior part of the jaws, have a great number of tentacle-hooks fixed into them, in such a manner as that anything can easily get down, but is hindered from getting back. The water that is necessarily taken in along with their food in too great quantities to be received into their jaws in deglutition, passes betwixt the surfaces of the bronchi and the flap that covers them. The compression of the water on the bronchi is of considerable use to the creature, as we shall explain by and by.\n\nThe gullet in these creatures is very short, and digestion scarcely distinguished from their stomach, seeing their performed food lies almost equally in both. The stomach is of solely an oblong figure. There are commonly found small neutral fishes in the stomach of large ones still retaining their natural form; but when touched, they melt down into\nThe guts in these animals are very short, making only three turns; the least of which ends in the common cloaca for the feces, urine, and semen, situated about the middle of the inferior part of their bodies.\n\nTo what we call pancreas, some give the name of intestinula ceca: it consists of a very great number of small threads, like so many little worms, which all terminate at last in two larger canals that open into the first gut, and pour into it a viscid liquor much about the place where the biliary ducts enter. That kind of pancreas formed of intestinula ceca is peculiar to a certain kind of fishes; for the cartilaginous, broad, and flat kind, as the skate, sole, flounder, &c., have a pancreas resembling that of the former class of animals. Their intestines are connected to the back bone by a membrane analogous to a meniscus.\n\nTheir liver is very large, of a whitish colour, and lies almost in the left side wholly, and contains a great deal of fat or oil.\n\nThe gall-bladder is situated a considerable way from their liver; and sends out a canal, the cystic duct, which joins with the hepatic duct just at the entry into the gut. Some fibres being observed stretched from the liver to the gall-bladder, but without any apparent cavity, the bile was supposed not to be carried into the gall-bladder in the usual way, but that it must either be secreted on the sides of the face, or regurgitated into it from the canal of the choledochus. It is certain, however, that hepato-cystic ducts exist in fish as well as in fowls. This, for example, is very obvious in the salmon, where large and distinct ducts run from the biliary ducts of the liver, and open into the gall bladder.\n\nThe spleen is placed near the back-bone, and at a place where it is subjected to an alternate pressure from the contraction and dilatation of the air-bag, which is situated in the neighbourhood. Since, in all the different animals we have dissected, we find the spleen attached to somewhat that may give it a conglomeration; as in the human subject and quadrupeds, it is contiguous to the diaphragm; in fowls, it is placed betwixt the back-bone, the liver, and stomach; in fishes, it lies on the lacus serius; and since we find it so well served with blood vessels, and all its blood returning into the liver; we must not conclude the spleen to be an insensible ponderous, only to serve as a balance to the animal pro equilibrio, but particularly designed for preparing the blood to the liver.\n\nThe heart is of a triangular form, with its base downwards, and its apex uppermost; which situation has been caused by the branchiae. It has but one auricle and one ventricle, because they want lungs; and one great artery. The size of the auricle and that of the ventricle are much the same; the artery sends out numberless branches to the branchiae or gills. And what is rather curious, this artery, instead of supporting all parts as in the frog, is distributed entirely upon the gills; every branch terminating there, and becoming so extremely small as at last to escape the naked eye.\n\nThese creatures have a membranous diaphragm, which forms a sac in which the heart is contained. It is very tense, and almost perpendicular to the vertebrae.\n\nThe branchiae lie in two large slits at each side of their heads, and seem to be all they have that bears any analogy to lungs. Their form is semicircular, their structure having a vast number of red fibrils standing out like a fringe, and very much resemble the vane of a feather. These branchiae are perpetually subjected to an alternate motion and pressure from the water; and we may here remark, that we have not found any red blood but in places subjected to this alternate pressure. This observation will help us in explaining the action of the lungs upon the blood. Over these gills there is a large flap, allowing a communication externally; by which the water they are obliged to take into their mouths with their food finds an exit without passing into their stomach; it is owing to these flaps coming so far down that the heart is laid commonly to be situated in their heads. The blood is collected again from the gills by a vast number of small veins, somewhat in the same manner as our pulmonary vein; but instead of going back to the heart a second time, they immediately unite, and form an aorta defendens, without the intervention of an auricle and ventricle. Hence a young anatomist may be puzzled to find out the power by which the blood is propelled from the gills to the different parts of the body; but the difficulty will be considerably lessened when we consider the manner in which the blood is carried through the liver from the intestines in man and quadrupeds. The aorta in fishes sends off branches which supply all the parts of the body excepting the gills. From the extremity of these branches the blood returns to the heart somewhat in the same manner as in the former class of animals; only there are two inferior venae cavae, whereas the former has but one.\n\nAbsorbent System in Fishes. We shall take the haddock as a general example; for the other fishes, particularly those of the same shape, will be found in general to agree with it.\n\nOn the middle of the belly of a haddock, immediately below the outer skin, a lymphatic vessel runs upwards from the anus, and receives branches from the parietes of the belly, and from the fin below the anus; near the head this lymphatic passes between the two pectoral fins; and having got above them, it receives their lymphatics. It then goes under the symphysis of the two bones which form the thorax, where it opens into a net-work of very large lymphatics, which lie close to the pericardium, and almost entirely surrounds the heart. This net-work, besides that part of it behind the heart, has a large lymphatic on each side, which receives lymphatics from the kidney, runs upon the bone of the thorax backwards; and when it has got as far as the middle of that bone, it sends off a large branch from its inside to join the thoracic duct. After detaching this branch, it is joined by the lymphatics of the thoracic fins, and soon after by a lymphatic which runs upon the side of the fish. It is formed of branches, which give it a beautiful peniform appearance.\n\nBesides these branches, there is another set deeper which\nOf fishes, which accompanies the ribs. After the large lymphatic has been joined by the above-mentioned vessels, it receives lymphatics from the gills, orbit, nose, and mouth. A little below the orbit, another net-work appears, consisting in part of the vessels above described, and of the thoracic duct. This net-work is very complete, some of its vessels lie on each side of the naevus of the gills; and from its internal part a trunk is sent out, which terminates in the jugular vein.\n\nThe lacteals run on each side of the mesenteric arteries, anastomosing frequently across these vessels. The receptaculum into which they enter is very large, in proportion to them; and consists at its lower part of two branches, of which one lies between the duodenum and stomach, and runs a little way upon the pancreas, receiving the lymphatics of the liver, pancreas, those of the lower part of the stomach, and the lacteals from the greatest part of the small intestines. The other branch of the receptaculum receives the lymphatics from the rest of the alimentary canal. The receptaculum formed by these two branches lies on the right side of the upper part of the stomach, and is joined by some lymphatics in that part, and also by some from the liver and gall-bladder, which in this fish adheres to the receptaculum. This thoracic duct takes its rise from the receptaculum, and lies on the right side of the oesophagus, receiving lymphatics from that part; and running up about half an inch, it divides into two ducts, one of which passes over the oesophagus to the left side, and the other goes straight upon the right side, passes by the upper part of the kidney, from which it receives some small branches, and soon afterwards is joined by a branch from the large lymphatic that lies above the bone of the thorax, as formerly mentioned: near this part it likewise sends off a branch to join the duct of the opposite side; and then, a little higher, is joined by those large lymphatics from the upper part of the gills, and from the fauces.\n\nThe thoracic duct, after being joined by these vessels, communicates with the net-work near the orbit, where its lymph is mixed with that of the lymphatics from the posterior part of the gills, and from the superior fins, belly, &c., and then from this net-work a vessel goes into the jugular vein just below the orbit. This last vessel, which may be called the termination of the whole system, is very small in proportion to the net-work from which it rises; and indeed the lymphatics of the part are so large, as to exceed by far the size of the sanguiferous vessels.\n\nThe thoracic duct from the left side, having passed under the gullet from the right, runs on the inside of the vena cava of the left side, receives a branch from its fellow of the opposite side, and joins the large lymphatics which lie on the left side of the pericardium, and a part of those which lie behind the heart; and afterwards makes, together with the lymphatics from the gills, upper fins, and side of the fish, a net-work, from which a vessel passes into the jugular vein of this side. In a word, the lymphatics of the left side agree exactly with those of the right side above described. Another part of the system is deeper seated, lying between the roots of the spinal processes of the backbone. This part consists of a large trunk that begins from the lower part of the fish, and as it ascends receives branches from the dorsal fins and adjacent parts of the body. It goes up near the head, and feeds a branch to each thoracic duct near its origin.\n\nThe only organs of generation in this animal are two organs situated in the abdomen uniting near the podex. These in the male are filled with a whitish firm substance called the milk, and in the female with an infinite number of little ova cluttered together, of a reddish yellow colour, called the roe. Both these at spawning time we find very much distended; whereas at another time the male organs can scarce be distinguished from the female; nor is there any proper instrument in the male for throwing the seed into the organs of the female, as in other creatures. We shall not take upon us to determine the way whereby the female sperm is impregnated; but we find that the spawn of frogs consists in the small specks wrapped up in a whitish glutinous liquor: these specks are the rudiments of the young frogs, which are nourished in that liquor till they are able to go in search of their food. In the same way, the eggs of fishes are thrown out and deposited in the sand, the male being for the most part ready to impregnate them, and they are incubated by the heat of the sun. It is curious enough to remark with what care they seek for a proper place to deposit their ova, by swimming to the shallow, where they can better enjoy the sun's rays, and thus the large jaws of other fishes. The river-fishes, again spawn in some creek free from the hazard of the impetuous stream. But whether this mixture be brought about in fishes by a simple application of the genitals to each other, or if both of them throw out their liquors at the same time in one place, and thus bring about the desired mixture, it is not easy to determine. Spallanzani has found, that the eggs of frogs, toads, and water newts, are not fecundated in the body of female; that the male emits his semen upon the spawn while it is flowing from the female; and that the fetus pre-exists in the body of the female: but whether impregnation takes place in the same manner in fishes, he has not yet been able to determine, though he seems to think it probable. These creatures are so shy, that we cannot easily get to observe their way of copulation, and are consequently but little acquainted with their natural history. Frogs, it is very evident, do not copulate: at least no farther than to allow both sexes an opportunity of throwing their sperm. Early in the spring the male is found for several days in close contact upon the back of the female, with his fore legs round her body in such a manner that makes it very difficult to separate them, but there is no communication. At this time the female lays her spawn in some place that is most secure, while the male emits his sperm upon the female spawn.\n\nAfter raising up the black peritoneum in fishes, there comes in view an oblong white membranous bag, in bladder, which there is nothing contained but a quantity of elastic air. This is the swimming-bladder: it lies close to the back-bone; and has a pretty strong muscular coat, whereby it can contract itself. By contracting this bag, and condensing the air within it, they can make their bodies specifically heavier than water, and so readily fall to the bottom; whereas the muscular fibres ceasing to act, the air is again dilated, and they become specifically lighter than water, and so swim above.\nAccording to the different degrees of contraction and dilatation of this bladder, they can keep higher or lower in the water at pleasure. Hence flounders, soles, rays or skate, and such other fishes as want this sac, are found always grovelling at the bottom of the water: it is owing to this that dead fishes (unless this membrane has been previously broke) are found swimming a-top, the mucular fibres then ceasing to act, and that with their bellies uppermost; for the backbone cannot yield, and the distended sac is protruded into the abdomen, and the back is consequently heaviest at its upper part, according to their posture.\n\nThere is here placed a glandular substance, containing a good quantity of red blood; and it is very probable that the air contained in the swimming-bladder is derived from this substance. From the anterior part of the bag go out two processes or appendices, which, according to the gentlemen of the French academy, terminate in their fauces: in a variety of other fishes we find communications with some parts of the alimentary canal, particularly the oesophagus and stomach. The salmon has an opening from the fore end of the air-bag into the oesophagus, which is surrounded by a kind of mucular fibres. The herring has a funnel-like passage leading from the bottom of the stomach into the air-bag; but it is not determined whether the air enters the air-bag by this opening, or comes out by it: the latter, however, seems to be the more probable opinion, as the glandular body is found in all fishes, whereas there are several without this passage of communication.\n\nAt the superior part of this bag there are other red-veined, coloured bodies of a glandular nature, which are connected with the kidneys. From them the ureters gourmainia down to their insertion in the vesica urinaria, which urethra lies in the lower part of the abdomen; and the urethra is there produced, which terminates in the podex.\n\nCHAP. VIII. OF MOLLUSCA.\n\nIn these animals the muscles or fleshy fibres are white, and possessed of great irritability: they retain the power of motion even after being cut into small pieces; and many parts of their bodies are capable of being reproduced after being separated. Their external surface is always moist, as there commonly exudes from it a viscid fluid. It is extremely flexible, and is furnished with organs called tentacula, which are capable of being lengthened out or contracted, so as to enable the animal to feel the better. It is uncertain whether or not these animals possess the sensation of smell, but if they do, the organ of this sense is probably situated at the entrance of their pulmonary vessels. Many of them have eyes, and some appear to be possessed of ears.\n\nTheir body is usually provided with, or at least partly enveloped by, a membranaceous covering. In many this covering is more or less calcareous, produced from a calcareous juice exuding from the surface of the animal, and forming a shell composed of one or more pieces or valves. The body of the animal is attached to this shell by muscles, which enable it to retire within the valves, or to shut them together. These muscles change their place, separating from one part, and growing to another, so as always to preserve the same relative position, notwithstanding the unequal growth of the shell. Most of these animals are inhabitants of the sea: some of them reside in fresh water; and some of them reside entirely on land.\n\nThe mollusca may be divided into three orders.\n\n1. The cephalopoda, so called because their feet, or at least the organs with which they seize their prey, are situated in the head. Their body is in the form of a sack, which, when the external covering is removed, exhibits the appearance of a compact network of fleshy fibres in three distinct layers. Of these the outermost are placed lengthwise, the middle in a cross direction, and the innermost in no regular order. By the various actions of these fibres the lack of the animal is lengthened, contracted, bent, or twisted in various directions.\n\nThese animals are furnished below the skin of the back with a fold body, which is for the most part exceedingly elastic and transparent, and is sometimes furrowed longitudinally. In all the species of sepia or cuttle-fish, except the S. octopus, which wants it, this body is a sort of bone, formed of thin concentric plates, separated by small columns, arranged so as to form a quincunx. It is oval and lenticular, or thickest in the middle.\n\nThe feet in this order are eight in number, and form a circle round the mouth; they end in suckers, by which the animal fixes itself to any substance, and are furnished with numerous muscles, by which they are moved in every direction. The other species of sepia (except the octopus and the calamari), have, besides these eight feet, two others which are longer and smaller.\n\nThey have three hearts; their respiration is carried on in the water by means of branchiae; they have very large eyes, and organs of hearing situated within the head; their stomach is very fleshy, so as to resemble the gizzard of a fowl, and they have a very large liver. They are also furnished with a peculiar gland for the purpose of secreting an inky fluid, which, when they wish to conceal themselves, they throw out, and thus obscure the water round them.\n\n2. The gastropoda, which have upon the belly a mucular plane, by the contractions of which they creep upon the belly, as may be observed in the snail; and hence their name. They have no heart; their branchiae are situated sometimes within the body, sometimes they surround the body, and are often on the back; they are naked in the first case, and in the others are covered with a kind of lid, and are of various forms. The common trunk of the blood vessels is subdivided for the purpose of distributing to the branchiae the blood which has circulated through the body. The most of this order are hermaphrodite, but require reciprocal copulation. There is almost always situated near the matrix a bag, containing a fluid, which.\nCHAP. IX. OF THE CRUSTACEA.\n\nTHE animals which compose this order have commonly been ranked among the insects, but we have thought it better to separate them, as they are possessed of character by which they are sufficiently distinguished. They have the body enveloped in a sort of armour composed of several pieces or scales, and are usually provided with a great number of jointed limbs.\n\nThe head in these animals is immovable, their principal motions being confined to the tail and feet. The tail forms a considerable portion of the animal, and is furnished with very large and strong muscles by the action of which the animal is enabled to leap and swim with great celerity.\n\nTheir feet are of different forms in the several species, and also vary in number, and in some species answer several very different purposes. What in these animals is analogous to the brain, is a long knotted nervous cord, from the knots of which the nerves are distributed to the body. Their eyes are hard and complex, and are usually placed on a sort of footstalks, which enable them to move with great facility in all directions. They are furnished with feelers and antennae as we shall see in insects. Their organs of hearing are very imperfect. They have a heart, and both an arterial and a venous system of blood vessels. They breathe by means of branchiae. Their jaws are generally numerous, very strong, and situated in a transverse direction. They are of distinct sexes, and the male has two penes.\n\nCHAP. X. OF INSECTS.\n\nAS under Entomology, now become a study so fashionable, and which has been carried to a high degree of perfection, we propose to give a particular account of the structure and economy of insects, we shall at present only offer a short sketch of their anatomy.\n\nInsects differ from the former classes, by their bodies being covered with a hard crust or scale, by their having feelers or antennae arising from their head, and many of them breathing the air through lateral pores. As to the shape of their bodies, though it somewhat differs from that of birds, being in general not so sharp before to cut and make way through the air, yet it is well adapted to their manner of life. The base of their bodies is not formed of bone, as in many other animals, but the hard external covering serves them for skin and bone at the same time. Their feelers, beside the use of cleaning their eyes, are a guard to them in their walk or flight. Their legs and wings are well fitted for their intended service; but the latter vary so much in different insects, that from them naturalists have given names to the several orders of the class. As, first, the Coleoptera, or beetle tribe, which have a crustaceous elytra or shell, that shuts together, and forms a longitudinal suture down their back.\n\nHemiptera—as in cimex, cockroach, bug, &c., which have the upper wings half crustaceous and half membranaceous; not divided by a longitudinal suture, but incumbent on each other.\n\nLepidoptera—as the butterfly, have four wings, covered with fine scales in the form of powder.\n\nNeuroptera—as the dragon-fly, spring-fly, &c., have four membranaceous transparent naked wings, generally reticulated.\n\nHymenoptera—as wasps, bees, &c., have four membranaceous wings, and a tail furnished with a fling.\n\nDiptera—as the common house-fly, have only two wings.\n\nApidae—as the scorpion, spider, &c., have no wings.\n\nThe structure of the eye in many insects is a most curious piece of mechanism. The outer part is remarkably hard, to guard against injuries; and has commonly a reticular appearance, or the whole may be looked upon as an assemblage of smaller eyes; but whether they see objects multiplied before them, has not yet been determined.\n\nLinnaeus,\nChap. XI.\n\nANATOMY.\n\nLinnaeus, and several others following him, deny the existence of a brain in these creatures.\n\nTheir ear has been lately discovered to be placed at the root of their antennae or feelers, and can be distinctly seen in some of the larger kinds.\n\nThey have a stomach, and other organs of digestion.\n\nThey have a heart and blood vessels, and circulation is carried on in them somewhat as in the former class; but the blood is without red globules; or, as naturalists speak, is colourless. In some of the larger kind, when a piece of the shell is broken, the pulsation of the heart is seen distinctly, and that sometimes for several hours after it has been laid bare.\n\nLungs. The existence of these by some has been denied. But late experiments and observations show that no species want them, or at least something similar to them; and in many insects, they are larger in proportion than in other animals; in most of them they lie on or near the surface of their body; and send out lateral pores or tracheae, by which, if the animal is besmeared with oil, it is instantly suffocated.\n\nGeneration. The same difference in sex exists in insects as in other animals, and they even appear more disposed to increase their species; many of them, when become perfect, seeming to be created for no other purpose but to propagate their like. Thus the silk-worm, when it arrives at its perfect or moth state, is incapable of eating, and can hardly fly; it endeavours only to propagate its species: after which the male immediately dies, and so does the female as soon as she has deposited her eggs.\n\nBesides those of the male and female, a third sex exists in some insects, which we call neuter. As these have not the distinguishing parts of either sex, they may be considered as eunuchs or intertete. We know of no instance of this kind in any other class of animals; and it is only found among those insects, which form themselves into societies, as bees, wasps, and ants; and here these eunuchs are real slaves, as on them lies the whole business of the economy. No hermaphrodites have as yet been discovered among insects.\n\nMany have imagined that the generality of insects were merely the production of putrefaction, because they have been observed to arise from putrid substances; but a contrary opinion is now more generally adopted; and it is pretty certain, that if putrid bodies be shut up in a close vessel, no insects are ever generated unless their ova have been originally deposited there. They are oviparous animals, and lay their eggs in places most convenient for the nourishment of their young; some in water, others in flesh; some in fruit and leaves; while others make nests in the earth or in wood, and sometimes even in the hardest stone. The eggs of all insects first become (larva) caterpillar, or maggot; from which they are changed into (pupa) chrysalis or auricula, so named from their being inclosed in a case; and these dying, or seeming to die, the (imago) fly, or butterfly, or perfect state, succeeds; and during each of these changes their appearance differs wonderfully.\n\nCHAP. XI. OF WORMS.\n\nThe worms form a class in the system of Linnaeus, comprehending the mollusca, and the next assemblage of which we are to speak, viz. the Zoophytes, besides the worms properly so called.\n\nWe have seen that insects in one part of their existence appear in the state of larvae, or organized beings resembling the common caterpillar or larvae of the butterfly. In some of these the organs of motion are very perfect, and they are furnished with regular articulated members, provided with solid parts. From these there is a gradation to the worms, which have no feet, but move forwards either by means of bristles or hairs fixed in the surface of their bodies, as in the common earth-worm and the lumbricus of the intestines, or they are provided at each extremity with a circular sucker, as in the leech, by which they fasten one end of their body to the surface on which they are to move, and proceed forward by the contractions of the muscular rings of which their body is chiefly composed. Within their body is found a white nervous cord. Those which inhabit the water carry on respiration by means of membranaceous branchiae; in others there are pores or stigmata, analogous to the rachises of insects; some of them are furnished with feelers. Of the most important of this class, the worms which inhabit the intestines of other animals, we propose to give a particular account in a future article.\n\nCHAP. XII. OF THE ZOOPHYTES.\n\nThe zoophytes form the lowest class of animated nature; and many of them bear so close a resemblance to plants and minerals, that they would seem to belong rather to the kingdoms than to that in which modern naturalists have agreed to arrange them. The mollusca possess organs of digestion, fæciliation, circulation, and respiration, and are furnished with viscera not very unlike those of the vertebrate animals. Insects form the next degree, which have no distinct circulation, and very imperfect respiratory organs; but in them we see something like a brain, and well marked organs of sensation. We observe the same in many worms, in most of which they probably exist. But in the zoophytes there is no appearance of circulation; there are no nerves, and no fenestrum or common centre of sensation; there is but little appearance\nINDEX.\n\nA\n\nABDOMEN, use of the

In consequence of the eminent talents of this philosopher he obtained the appellation of Mind. Pythagoras represents philosophers as mere spectators of the affairs of human life, and who, neglecting all other pursuits, devote their exertions to the investigation of nature, and the search after wisdom. According to this definition of a philosopher, Anaxagoras strictly merited the honourable appellation; for though he was of a respectable descent, and possessed of a considerable fortune, yet he relinquished both, so that, in the language of Cicero, he might \"give himself wholly to the divine pleasures of learning and inquiry.\" The sons of wealth, and the lovers of money will probably unite in the ridicule cast upon him by the age in which he lived, even \"that he philosophized very foolishly;\" but the mind of Anaxagoras disregarded their scorn, and persevered in his plan; and although the reader may hesitate in giving applause to the man who deprives society of the benefits of his social talent, yet the eager thirst of his mind after knowledge is entitled to becoming credit.\n\nLeaving his lands to be cultivated and enjoyed by his friends, Anaxagoras placed himself under the care of Anaximenes the Milesian. About the age of twenty he went to Athens and entered upon the study of philosophy, where he continued 30 years. Some suppose that he was the first disciple of the Ionian school, founded by Thales a teacher of philosophy in Athens. When Anaxagoras assumed the character of a public teacher of philosophy, he quickly rose to high eminence, and produced many famous scholars, among whom were Euripides the tragedian, Pericles the statesman, and the renowned Socrates. This philosopher contented himself with serving the republic in his own station, without interfering in any of the public affairs of the state. Both by the principles of wisdom which he inspired into the minds of the Athenian youth, and also by his daily advice in the most important affairs, particularly in the case of Pericles, he was of singular service to his country. But neither the friendship of the famous Pericles, nor his own general disinterestedness of character, nor his immense stores of learning, could ward off the shafts of persecution. Cleo accused him of impiety, and the introduction of new opinions concerning the gods, because he taught that the sun was a burning mass of stone, or an inanimate fiery substance. By this opinion he was said to rob the sun of his divinity, because in the popular opinion he was deemed Apollo, one of the greatest deities. But although Cleo made religion the avowed cause of the accustation of Anaxagoras, it is highly probable that civil causes chiefly operated towards his condemnation. It is, however, abundantly evident, that he did not hesitate to expose the vulgar superstitions on several occasions; but the evidence is not sufficient which pretends to prove that he was condemned for teaching the doctrine of a supreme intelligence, the creator of the world. His judges condemned him to death; but Pericles appearing in his defence, the sentence was changed from that of death to banishment and a pecuniary fine.\n\nIt is reported, that when one of his friends regretted his exile, he replied: \"It is not I who have lost the Athenians, but the Athenians who have lost me.\" Whilst a small degree of vanity appears in this sentiment, it nevertheless informs posterity with what calmness of mind he endured the changes of fortune. But other sayings tend more fully to unfold his character. During the course of a lecture one day, he was interrupted with the unpleasant news of the death of a son; he calmly replied, \"I knew that I begat him mortal.\" When he received the sentence of condemnation, he consoled himself by this consideration: \"Nature,\"\nOur information is more correct concerning his Anaxarchus opinions of the principles of nature and the origin of things. He imagined that in nature there are as many kinds of principles as there are species of compound bodies, and that the peculiar form of the primary particles of which any body is composed, is the same with the quality of the compound body itself. For instance, he supposed that a piece of gold is composed of small particles which are themselves gold, and a bone of a great number of small bones; thus, according to Anaxagoras, bodies of every kind are generated from similar particles. That part of his system is more agreeable to reason which explains the active principle in nature. According to Diogenes Laërtius, Anaxagoras taught, that \"the universe consists of small bodies composed of similar parts, and that mind is the beginning of motion.\" \"He was the first,\" (says the same writer), who superadded mind to matter, opening his work in this pleasing and sublime language: 'All things were confused; then came mind, and disposed them in order.' Plato informs us that this philosopher taught the existence of a disposing mind, the cause of all things. Anaxagoras, according to Aristotle, taught that mind was \"the cause of the world, and of all order; and that while all things else are compounded, this alone is pure and unmixed; and that he attributes to this principle two powers, to know, and to move, saying, that mind put the universe into motion.\" Cicero expressly affirms, that Anaxagoras was the first who taught, that \"the arrangement and order of all things was contrived and accomplished by the understanding and power of an infinite mind.\" (Gen. Bing.)\n\nANAXARCHUS, a Grecian philosopher, who lived under Philip of Macedon and Alexander, was born in Abdera, and belonged to the sect generally known by the name of the Eleatic. He is said to have been conducted in the progress of his early studies by the skilful hands of Diomedes of Smyrna and Metrodorus of Chios. He had the honour to be a companion of Alexander; and a few anecdotes transmitted to posterity concerning him render it evident that he treated him with the usual freedom of a friend. This philosopher candidly checked the vain glory of Alexander (when elated with pride he aspired to the honours of divinity), by pointing to his finger when it bled, saying, \"See the blood of a mortal, not of a god.\" It is likewise reported, that on another occasion, while indulging immoderately at a banquet, he repeated a verse from Euripides, reminding Alexander of his mortality. It is, however, to be regretted, that the fidelity of the philosopher was wanting at the time when the mind of Alexander was tortured with remorse at having slain his friend Clitus; for it is reported that he, on that occasion, endeavoured to soothe the agitated mind of Alexander, by saying, that \"kings, like the gods, could do no wrong.\" It is reported that Nicaeereon, king of Cyprus, exposed him to the torture of being pounded in a mortar, and that he endured this torture with incredible patience; but as the same fact is reported of Zeno the Eleatic, there is reason to suppose that it is fabulous; and it may be added, that this narrative is inconsistent with the general character of Anaxarchus, who, on account of his easy and peaceable life, received the appellation of \"The Fortunate.\" (Gen. Bing.)\n\nANAXIMANDER,\nANAXIMANDER, a famous Greek philosopher, born at Miletus in the 42d Olympiad, in the time of Polycrates tyrant of Samos. He was the first who publicly taught philosophy, and wrote upon philosophical subjects. He carried his researches into nature very far for the time in which he lived. It is said, that he discovered the obliquity of the zodiac, was the first who published a geographical table, invented the gnomon, and set up the first sun-dial in an open place at Lacedemon. He taught, that infinity of things was the principal and universal element; that this infinite always preserved its unity, but that its parts underwent changes; that all things came from it; and that all were about to return into it. According to all appearance, he meant by this obscure and indeterminate principle the chaos of the other philosophers. He asserted, that there is an infinity of worlds; that the stars are composed of air and fire, which are carried in their spheres, and that these spheres are gods; and that the earth is placed in the midst of the universe, as in a common centre. He added, that infinite worlds were the product of infinity, and that corruption proceeded from separation.\n\nANAXIMENES, born at Miletus, an eminent Greek philosopher; friend, scholar, and successor of Anaximander. He diffused some degree of light upon the obscurity of his master's system. He made the first principle of things to consist in the air, which he considered as immense or infinite, and to which he ascribed a perpetual motion. He asserted, that all things which proceeded from it were definite and circumcised; and that this air, therefore, was God, since the divine power resided in it and agitated it. Coldness and moisture, heat and motion, rendered it visible, and dressed it in different forms, according to the different degrees of its condensation. All the elements thus proceed from heat and cold. The earth was, in his opinion, one continued flat surface.\n\nANAXIMENES, a Greek historian and rhetorician, was born at Lampacus about 580 years before Christ. Diogenes, the Cynic, laid the principles of erudition in the mind of this great man. Some writers ascribe to him \"A Treatise on the principles of Rhetoric,\" which bears the name of Aristotle; and it is reported that Philip of Macedon invited him to his court to instruct his son Alexander in that science. Alexander was attended in his expedition against Persia by this learned philosopher and many other eminent men. The inhabitants of the city, which had the honour to give him birth, having espoused the cause of Darius, upon Alexander's conquering them, they entreated their countryman Anaximenes to intercede with Alexander in their behalf. He humanely undertook to interpose for them; but the king being informed of his intention, as soon as he came into his presence, swore that he would grant him nothing that he should ask. He instantly replied, \"I entreat you to destroy Lampacus, to burn its temples, and to sell the inhabitants for slaves.\" Alexander, struck with this dexterous reply, kept his word, and saved the city.\n\nAnother pleasing anecdote is related of Anaximenes. For some unrecorded cause, he being displeased with the historian Theopompus, in order to revenge himself, wrote a severe satire against the Spartans and Thebans, in a style exactly similar to that of Theopompus, and under his name addressed it to the Athenians. Theopompus was generally believed to be the author of that work, and consequently it brought upon him the odium and indignation of all Greece. Whilst this action afforded an illustrious proof of the strength of his talents, it afforded an equal evidence of the quality of his heart. The history of Philip, of Alexander, and likewise twelve books on the early history of Greece, were the productions of his pen, but are now unfortunately lost. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nANAXIMANDRIANS, in the History of Philosophy, the followers of Anaximander, the most ancient of the philosophical atheists who admitted of no other subsistence in nature but matter.\n\nANAZARBUS (Pliny), ANAZAREA (Stephanus); a town of Cilicia, on the river Pyramus, the birthplace of Dioscorides, and of the poet Oppian. It was sometimes called Caforea, in honour either of Augustus or of Tiberius. The inhabitants are called Anazarebeni (Pliny), and on coins Anazarbes after the Greek idiom. It was destroyed by a dreadful earthquake in the year 525, along with several other important cities; but they were all repaired at a vast expense by the emperor Justin; who was so much affected with their misfortune, that, putting off the diamond and purple, he appeared for several days in sack-cloth.\n\nANBERTKEND, in the eastern language, a celebrated book of the Brachmans, wherein the Indian philosophy and religion are contained. The word in its literal sense denotes the cipher wherein is the water of life. The anbertkend is divided into 50 beths or discourses, each of which consists of 10 chapters. It has been translated from the original Indian into Arabic, under the title of Morai al Maani, q. d. \"the marrow of intelligence.\"\n\nANCARANO, a town of Italy, in the marquisate of Ancona. E.

The word is derived from the Latin ancestor, contracted from antecessor, q. d. \"goer before.\"\n\nMost nations have paid honours to their ancestors. It was properly the departed souls of their forefathers that the Romans worshipped under the denominations of lares, lemures, and household gods. Hence the ancient tombs were a kind of temples, or rather altars, whereon oblations were made by the kindred of the deceased.\n\nThe Russians have still their anniversary feasts in memory of their ancestors, which they call roditoli sabot, q. d. \"kinsfolk's Sabbath;\" wherein they make formal visits to the dead in their graves, and carry them provisions, eatables, and presents of divers other kinds. They interrogate them, with loud lamentable cries, What they are doing? How they spend their time? What it is they want? and the like.\n\nThe Quoas, a people of Africa, offer sacrifices of rice and wine to their ancestors before ever they undertake any considerable action. The anniversaries of\ntheir deaths are always kept by their families with great solemnity. The king invokes the soul of his father and mother to make trade flourish and the chase succeed.\n\nThe Chinese seem to have distinguished themselves above all other nations in the veneration they bear their ancestors. By the laws of Confucius, part of the duty which children owe their parents consists in worshipping them when dead. This service, which makes a considerable part of the natural religion of the Chinese, is said to have been instituted by the emperor Kung, the fifth in order from the foundation of that ancient empire. Bibl. Un. tom. vii. The Chinese have both a solemn and ordinary worship which they pay their ancestors. The former is held regularly twice a year, viz. in spring and autumn, with much pomp. A person who was present at it gives the following account of the ceremonies on that occasion: 'The sacrifices were made in a chapel well adorned, where there were five altars furnished with censers, tapers, and flowers. There were three ministers, and behind them two young acolytes. The three former went with a profound silence, and frequent genuflexions, towards the five altars, pouring out wine; afterwards they drew near to the fifth, and when they came to the foot of the altar, half bowed down, they said their prayers with a low voice. That being finished, the three ministers went to the altar; the officiating priest took up a vessel full of wine, and drank; then he lifted up the head of a deer or goat; after which, taking fire from the altar, they all lighted a bit of paper; and the minister of the ceremonies turning towards the people, said with a loud voice, That he gave them thanks in the name of their ancestors for having so well honoured them; and in recompense he promised them, on their part, a plentiful harvest, a fruitful field, good health, and long life, and all those advantages that are most pleasing to men.\n\nThe Chinese gave their ancestors another simpler and more private worship. To this end they have in their houses a niche or hollow place, where they put the names of their deceased fathers, and make prayers and offerings of perfumes and spices to them at certain times, with bowing, &c. They do the like at their tombs.\n\nThe Jews settled in China are said to worship their ancestors like the heathens, and with the same ceremonies, except that they offer not swine's flesh. Near their synagogue they have a hall, or court of ancestors, wherein are niches for Abraham, Isaac, &c. The Jesuits also conformed, and were permitted by their general to conform to this and many other superstitious customs of the Chinese.\n\nThere is one peculiarity of another kind, wherein the Chinese show their regard for their ancestors; in proportion as any of their descendants are preferred to a higher degree or dignity, their dead ancestors are at the same time preferred and ennobled with them. The kings Ven Van, Veu Van, and Chou Cum, who were descended from vassal kings, when they mounted the imperial throne, raised their ancestors from the vassal or depending state wherein they had lived to the dignity of emperors; so that the same honours were for the future rendered them as if they had been emperors of China. The same example was followed by the subsequent kings, and now obtains among the Anchilos grandees and literati: all now worship their ancestors according to the rank which they themselves hold in the world. If the son be a mandarin, and the father only a doctor, the latter is buried as a doctor, but sacrificed to as a mandarin. The like holds in degradations, where the condition of the fathers is that of their sons.\n\nANCHILOPS, ἀγκυλος, contraction, and ωψ, eye; in Medicine, denotes an abscess, or collection of matter, between the great angle of the eye and the nose. If suffered to remain too long, or unskilfully managed, it degenerates, the stagnating humours corrupt, and an ulcer is produced. When the tumor is broke, and the tears flow involuntarily, whilst the os lachrymale is not carious, it is an aglypos; but when the ulcer is of a long standing, deep, fetid, and the os lachrymale becomes carious, it is a fistula. The cure is by reduction and excision, tying it at the root on the glandula lachrymalis, and, when ready, cutting it off. See SURGERY. Index.\n\nANCHISES, in Fabulous History, a Trojan prince, descended from Dardanus, and the son of Capys. Venus made love to him in the form of a beautiful nymph; and bore him Æneas, the hero of Virgil's Æneid.\n\nANCHOR (anchora, Lat. from ἀγκυλος, Greek), a heavy, strong, crooked instrument of iron, dropped from a ship into the bottom of the water, to retain her in a convenient station in a harbour, road, or river.\n\nThe most ancient anchors are said to have been of stone; and sometimes of wood, to which a great quantity of lead was usually fixed. In some places, baskets full of stones, and sacks filled with sand, were employed for the same use. All these were let down by cords into the sea, and by their weight stayed the course of the ship. Afterwards they were composed of iron, and furnished with teeth, which, being fastened to the bottom of the sea, prevented the vessel immovable; whence ἀγκυλος and δόντες are frequently taken for anchors in the Greek and Latin poets. At first there was only one tooth, whence anchors were called ἀγκυλοπέδια; but, in a short time, the second was added by Eupalamus, or Anacharis the Scythian philosopher. The anchors with two teeth were called ἀγκυλοπέδια or ἀγκυλοπέδια; and from ancient monuments appear to have been much the same with those used in our days, only the transverse piece of wood upon their handles (the stock) is wanting in all of them. Every ship had several anchors; one of which, surpassing all the rest in bigness and strength, was peculiarly termed ἱερα or sacra, and was never used but in extreme danger; whence sacram anchoram solvere, is proverbially applied to such as are forced to their last refuge.\n\nThe anchors now made are contrived so as to sink into the ground as soon as they reach it, and to hold a great strain before they can be loosed or dislodged from their station. They are composed of a shank, a stock, a ring, and two arms with their flukes. The stock, which is a long piece of timber fixed across the shank, serves to guide the flukes in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the ground; so that one of them sinks into it by its own weight as soon as it falls, and is still preserved steadily in that position by the stock,\nAnchor stock, which, together with the shank, lies flat on the bottom. In this situation it must necessarily sustain a great effort before it can be dragged through the earth horizontally. Indeed this can only be effected by the violence of the wind or tide, or both of them, sometimes increased by the turbulence of the sea, and acting upon the ship so as to stretch the cable to its utmost tension, which accordingly may dislodge the anchor from its bed, especially if the ground be soft and oozy, or rocky. When the anchor is thus displaced, it is said, in the sea phrase, to come home.\n\nThat the figure of this useful instrument may be more clearly understood, let us suppose a long maffy beam of iron erected perpendicularly, b, at the lower end of which are two arms, d e, of equal thickness with the beam (usually called the flukes), only that they taper towards the points, which are elevated above the horizontal plane at an angle of 30 degrees, or inclined to the shank at an angle of 60 degrees; on the upper part of each arm (in this position) is a fluke or thick plate of iron, g h, commonly shaped like an isosceles triangle whose base reaches inwards to the middle of the arm. On the upper end of the shank is fixed the stock tranversed with the flukes; the stock is a long beam of oak, f, in two parts, strongly bolted and hooped together with iron rings. See also No. 2. Closer above the stock is the ring a, to which the cable is fastened or bent; the ring is curiously covered with a number of pieces of short rope, which are twisted about it so as to form a very thick texture or covering called the padding, and used to preserve the cable from being fretted or chafed by the iron.\n\nEvery ship has, or ought to have, three principal anchors, with a cable to each, viz. the fleet, maître d'œuvre (which is the anchora facera of the ancients); the best bowser, second anchor; and small bowser, anchor d'afourche, so called from their usual situation on the ship's bows. There are besides smaller anchors, for removing a ship from place to place in a harbour or river, where there may not be room or wind for raising; these are the stream anchor, ancre de tone; the kedge and grappling, grapin: this last, however, is chiefly designed for boats.\n\nMethod of Making Anchors. The goodness of the anchor is a point of great importance. Great care is therefore to be taken, that the metal it is made of be neither too soft nor too brittle; the latter rendering it liable to break, and the former to straighten.\n\nThe shank, arms, and flukes, are first forged separately; then the hole is made at one end of the shank for the ring, which being also previously forged, is put into the hole of the shank, and the two ends shut together. After which the arms are shut to the shank one after the other, and the anchor is finished.\n\nProof is made of anchors by raising them to a great height, and then letting them fall again on a kind of iron block placed across for the purpose. To try whether the flukes will turn to the bottom and take hold of the ground, they place the anchor on an even surface, with the end of one of the flukes, and one of the ends of the stock resting on the surface: in case the other turns, and the point of the fluke rises upwards, the anchor good.\n\nIn England, France, and Holland, anchors are made of forged iron; but in Spain there are sometimes made of copper, and likewise in several parts of the South sea.\n\nFor the proportion of anchors, according to Manning, the shank is to be thrice the length of one of the flukes, and half the length of the beam. According to Aubin, the length of the anchor is to be four-tenths of the greatest breadth of the ship; so that the shank, e.g., of an anchor in a vessel 30 feet wide, is to be 12 feet long. When the shank is, for instance, eight feet long, the two arms are to be seven feet long, measuring them according to their curvity. As to the degree of curvity given the arms, there is no rule for it: the workmen are here left to their own discretion.\n\nThe latter writer observes, that the anchor of a large heavy vessel is smaller in proportion than that of a lesser and lighter one. The reason he gives is, that though the sea employs an equal force against a small vessel as against a great one, supposing the extent of wood upon which the water acts to be equal in both, yet the little vessel, by reason of its superior lightness, does not make so much resistance as the greater; the defect whereof must be supplied by the weight of the anchor.\n\nFrom these and other hydrostatic principles, the following table has been formed; wherein is shown, by means of the ship's breadth within, how many feet the beam or shank ought to be long, giving it four-tenths or two-fifths of the ship's breadth within: by which proportion might be regulated the length of the other parts of the anchor. In this table is represented likewise the weight an anchor ought to be for a ship from eight feet broad to 45, increasing by one foot's breadth; supposing that all anchors are similar, or that their weights are as the cubes of the lengths of the shanks.\n\n| Feet | Feet | Pounds |\n|------|------|--------|\n| 8    | 3½  | 33     |\n| 9    | 3⅔  | 47     |\n| 10   | 4    | 64     |\n| 11   | 4⅔  | 84     |\n| 12   | 4⅔  | 110    |\n| 13   | 5⅔  | 140    |\n| 14   | 5⅔  | 175    |\n| 15   | 6    | 216    |\n| 16   | 6⅔  | 262    |\n| 17   | 6⅔  | 314    |\n| 18   | 7⅔  | 373    |\n| 19   | 7⅔  | 439    |\n| 20   | 8    | 512    |\n| 21   | 8⅔  | 592    |\n| 22   | 8⅔  | 681    |\n| 23   | 9⅔  | 778    |\n| 24   | 9⅔  | 884    |\n| 25   | 10   | 1000   |\n| 26   | 10⅔ | 1124   |\n| 27   | 10⅔ | 1259   |\n| 28   | 11⅔ | 1405   |\n| 29   | 11⅔ | 1562   |\n| 30   | 12   | 1728   |\n| 31   | 12⅔ | 1906   |\n\nBreadth\nM. Bouguer, in his *Traité de Navire*, directs to take the length of the shank in inches, and to divide the cube of it by 1160 for the weight. The reason is obvious; because the quotient of the cube of 201 inches, which is the length of an anchor weighing 7000 lb. divided by the weight, is 1160; and therefore, by the rule of three, this will be a common divisor for the cube of any length, and a single operation will suffice.\n\nThe same author gives the following dimensions of the several parts of an anchor. The two arms generally form the arch of a circle, whose centre is three-eighths of the shank from the vertex, or point where it is fixed to the shank; and each arm is equal to the same length, or the radius; so that the two arms together make an arch of 120 degrees: the flukes are half the length of the arms, and their breadth two-fifths of the said length. With respect to the thickness, the circumference at the throat, or vertex of the shank, is generally made about a fifth part of its length, and the small end two-thirds of the throat; the small end of the arms of the flukes, three-fourths of the circumference of the shank at the throat. These dimensions should be greater when the iron is of a bad quality, especially if cast iron is used instead of forged iron.\n\nAt Anchor, the situation of a ship which rides by her anchor in a road or haven, &c.

It is commonly placed as part of the enrichments of the boultings of capitals of the Tuscan, Doric, and Ionic orders, and also of the boultings of bed mouldings of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian cornices, anchors and eggs being carved alternately through the whole building.\n\nAnchors, in Heraldry, are emblems of hope, and are taken for such in a spiritual as well as a temporal sense.\n\nAnchorage, in Law, is a duty upon ships for the use of the port or harbour where they cast anchor.\n\nAnchovy, in Ichthyology, the English name of the clupea encharculus.

The numbers, names, &c. hereof were entered by the Conqueror, in a book called Domesday Book, yet remaining in the Exchequer; so that such lands as by that book appeared to have belonged to the crown at that time, are called ancient demesne.—The tenants in ancient demesne are of two sorts; one who hold their lands frankly by charter; the other by copy of court-roll, or by the verge, at the will of the lord, according to the custom of the manor.—The advantages of this tenure are, 1. That tenants holding by charter cannot be rightfully impleaded out of their manor; and, when they are, they may abate the writ, by pleading the tenure. 2. They are free from toll for all things relating to their livelihood and husbandry; nor can be impannelled on any inquest.—These tenants held originally by ploughing the king's land, ploughing his hedges, and the like service, for the maintenance of his household; and it was on this account that such liberties were given them, for which they may have writs of nontraverent to such as take the duties of toll, &c.—No lands are to be accounted ancient demesne, but such as are held in socage. Whether land be ancient demesne or not, shall be tried by the book of Domesday.\n\nAncienty, in some ancient statutes, is used for eldership or seniority.

He studied from the ninth or tenth year of his age in the Jesuits college, where he gave such proofs of his genius, that the heads of the society tried every means to draw him over to their religion and party; but he continued firm against their attacks. He went to Geneva in 1633; and studied divinity under Spanheim, Diodati, and Tronchin, who conceived a very great esteem for him. He left Geneva in April 1641, and offered himself to the synod of Charenton in order to take upon him the office of a minister: his abilities were greatly admired by the examiners, and the whole assembly were so highly pleased with him, that they gave him the church of Meaux, the most considerable then unprovided for. Here he acquired a vast reputation for his learning, eloquence, and virtue, and was even highly respected by those of the Roman Catholic communion. He returned to his own country in the year 1653, where he remained till the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. He retired to Frankfort after this fatal blow; and having preached in the French church at Hanau, the whole congregation were so edified by it, that they immediately called together the heads of the families, in order to propose that he might be invited to accept of being minister there. The proposition was agreed to; and he began the exercise of his ministry in that church about the end of the year 1685. His preaching made so great a noise at Hanau, that the professors of divinity, and the German and Dutch ministers, attended his sermons frequently: the count of Hanau himself, who had never before been seen in the French church, came thither to hear Mr Ancillon: they came from the neighbouring parts, and even from Frankfort; people who undertook nothing of French flocked together with great eagerness, and said they loved to see him speak. This occasioned a great jealousy in the two other ministers; which tended to make his situation uneasy. He therefore went to Berlin; where he met with a kind reception from his highness the elector, and was made minister of the city. Here he had the pleasure of seeing his eldest son made judge and director of the French in the same city, and his other son rewarded with a pension and entertained at the university of Frankfort upon the Oder. He had likewise the satisfaction of seeing his brother made judge of all the French in the states of Brandenburg; and Mr Cayart his son-in-law, engineer to his electoral highness. He enjoyed these agreeable circumstances, and several others, till his death, which happened at Berlin the 3rd of September 1692, when he was 75 years of age.\n\nMr Ancillon having got a considerable fortune by marriage, was enabled thereby to gratify his passion for books; his library was accordingly very curious and large, and he increased it every day with all that appeared new and important in the republic of letters, so that at last it was one of the noblest collections in the hands of any private person in the kingdom. He published a book, in quarto, in which the whole dispute concerning Traditions is fully examined: he also wrote an apology for Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, and Beza, and several other pieces.\n\nANCLAM, a strong town of Germany, in the circle of Upper Saxony, and duchy of Pomerania, remarkable for its excellent pastures. It is seated on the river Peene. E. Long. 14. 5. N. Lat. 54. 10.\n\nANCLE, or ANKLE. See ANKLE.\n\nANCONA, Marquisate of, a province in the pope's territories in Italy. It lies between the gulf of Venice and the Appenines, which bound it on the north; Abruzzo on the east; the duchy of Spoleto, and that of Urbino, on the west. The air is indifferent; but the soil is fruitful, particularly in hemp and flax; and there is great plenty of wax and honey. It contains several large towns, as Fermo, Loreto, Recanati, Macerata, Jesi, Tolentino, Afcoli, Osimo, St Severino, Monte Alto, Camerino, and Ripatranfone, which are all archiepiscopal or episcopal sees.\n\nANCONA, a sea-port town of Italy, the capital of the marquisate of that name, and the see of a bishop. It was formerly the finest port in all Italy, being built by the emperor Trajan, about the year 1153; but was almost ruined, and its trade lost: however, it has again begun to revive. Its harbour is the best in all the pope's dominions. The town lies round it on two hills; one of which is at the point of Cape St Syriaco, from whence there is a delightful prospect. On the other stands the citadel, which commands the town and harbour. The streets of this city are narrow and uneven; and the public and private buildings inferior to those of the other great towns in Italy. The cathedral is a low dark structure; and though the front is covered with fine marble, the architecture has neither beauty nor regularity. The church of St Dominic, and that of the Franciscans, have each an excellent picture by Titian. The exchange, where the merchants meet, is a handsome square portico, in which is an equestrian statue of Trajan, who first built the port. At the four corners are four other statues. The triumphal arch of Trajan remains almost entire, with its inscription. The common people in this town are a little particular and fantastical in their dress, but the better sort follow the French mode. It is a great thoroughfare from the north of Italy to Loreto; which renders provisions very dear. The tide does not rise here above a foot, and near the Mediterranean it is scarce visible. E. Long. 15. 5. N. Lat. 43. 36.\n\nANCONES, in Architecture, the corners or quoins of walls, cross-beams, or rafters.—Vitruvius calls the consoles by the same name.\n\nANCONY, in the iron-works, a piece of half-wrought iron, of about three-quarters of 100 weight, and of the shape of a bar in the middle, but rude and unwrought at the ends. The process for bringing the iron to this state is this: They first melt off a piece from a low of cast iron, of the proper size; this they hammer at the forge into a mass of two feet long, and of a square shape, which they call a bloom; when this is done, they send it to the finery; where, after two or three heats and workings, they bring it to this figure, and call it an ancony. The middle part beat out at the finery, is about three feet long, and of the shape and thickness the whole is to be; this is then sent to the chafery, and there the ends are wrought to the shape of\nANCORARUM urbs, Ανκυρας Πόλις, a city in the Nomos Aphroditopolites, towards the Red sea; so called because there was in the neighbourhood a stone quarry, in which they hewed stone anchors (Ptolemy) before iron anchors came to be used. The gentilisious name is Ancyropolis (Stephanus).\n\nANCOURT, FLORENT CARTON d', an eminent French actor and dramatic writer, was born at Fontainebleau, October 1661. He studied in the Jesuits college at Paris under Father de la Rue; who, discovering in him a remarkable vivacity and capacity for learning, was extremely desirous of engaging him in their order; but Ancourt's aversion to a religious life rendered all his efforts ineffectual. After he had gone through a course of philosophy, he applied himself to the civil law, and was admitted advocate at 17 years of age. But falling in love with an actress, he was induced to go upon the stage, and he married her. As he had all the qualifications necessary for the theatre, he soon greatly distinguished himself; and not being satisfied with the applause only of an actor, he began to write pieces for the stage; many of which had such prodigious success, that most of the players grew rich from the profits of them. His merit in this way procured him a very favourable reception at court; and Louis XIV. showed him many marks of his favour. His sprightly conversation and polite behaviour made his company agreeable to all the men of figure both at court and in the city, and the most considerable persons were extremely pleased to have him at their houses. Having taken a journey to Dunkirk, to see his eldest daughter who lived there, he took the opportunity of paying his compliments to the elector of Bavaria, who was then at Brussels; this prince received him with the utmost civility; and having detained him a considerable time, dismissed him with a present of a diamond valued at 1000 pistoles; he likewise rewarded him in a very generous manner, when, upon his coming to Paris, Ancourt composed an entertainment for his diversion. Ancourt began at length to grow weary of the theatre, which he quitted in Lent 1718, and retired to his estate of Courcelles le Roy, in Berry, where he applied himself wholly to devotion, and composed a translation of David's Psalms in verse, and a sacred tragedy, which were never printed. He died the 6th of December 1726, being 65 years of age.—The plays which he wrote are 52 in all; most of which were printed separately at the time when they were first represented; they were afterwards collected into five volumes, then into seven, and at last into nine. This last edition is the most complete.\n\nANCHE, a small town of France, in Picardy, with the title of a marquisate, seated on a little river of the same name. E. Long. 2. 45. N. Lat. 49. 59.\n\nANCUS MARTIUS, the fourth king of the Romans, succeeded by Tullus Hostilius, 639 years before Christ. He defeated the Latins, subdued the Fidenates, conquered the Sabines, Volsci, and Veientines, enlarged Rome by joining to it Mount Janiculum, and made the harbour of Ostia. He died about 615 years before the Christian era.\n\nANCYCLE, in Antiquity, a kind of shield that fell, as was pretended, from heaven, in the reign of Numon Pompilius; at which time, likewise, a voice was heard declaring that Rome should be mistress of the world as long as she should preserve this holy buckler. It was kept with great care in the temple of Mars, under the direction of twelve priests; and lest any should attempt to steal it, eleven others were made to like, as not to be distinguished from the sacred one. These ancylia were carried in procession every year round the city of Rome.\n\nANCYCLE, in Surgery. See Ancylosis.\n\nANCYLOBLEPHARON, (from αγκύλος, bent, and βλέφαρον, an eyelid); a disease of the eye, which closes the eyelids. Sometimes the eyelids grow together, and also to the tunica albuginea of the eye, from carelessness when there is an ulcer in these parts. Both these cases are called ancyloblepharon by the Greeks. This disorder must be distinguished from that coalition of the eyelids which happens from vicious matter glueing them together. If the cohesion is on the corner, the sight is inevitably lost. This hath sometimes happened in the smallpox. If there is only a growing together of the eyelids, they may be separated with the speculum, and pledgets kept between them to prevent their reunion. If the eyelids adhere to the eye, they are to be separated by a fine edged knife; and their reunion is to be prevented by a proper use of injections, and lint placed between them, after dipping it in some proper liniment.\n\nANCYLOGLOSSUM, (from αγκύλος, crooked, and γλώσσα, the tongue); a contraction of the ligaments of the tongue. Some have this imperfection from their birth, others from some disease. In the first case, the membrane which supports the tongue is too short or too hard; in the latter, an ulcer under the tongue, healing and forming a cicatrix, is sometimes the cause: These speak with some difficulty. The ancyloglossi by nature are late before they speak; but when they begin, they soon speak properly. These we call tongue-tied. Maurice says, that in this case it is a small membranous production, which extends from the frenulum to the tip of tongue, that hinders the child from sucking, &c. He justly condemns the cruel practice among nurses, of tearing this membrane with their nails; for thus ulcers are sometimes formed, which are of difficult cure: he advises to snip it with scissors in two or three places, taking care not to extend the points of the scissors so far as the frenulum. The instances rarely occur which require any kind of assistance; for if the child can thrust the tip of its tongue to the outer edge of its lip, this disease does not exist; and if the tongue is not greatly restrained, the frenulum will stretch by the child's sucking and crying.\n\nANCYLOSIS, in Surgery, implies a distortion or stiffening of the joints, caused by a settlement of the humours, or a diffusion of the nerves; and therefore remedies of a mollifying and relaxing nature are required.\n\nANCYRA, the capital of Galatia, (Livy, Pliny, Ptolemy); at no great distance from the river Halys, (Livy): said to be built by Midas, king of Phrygia, and to take its name from an anchor found there (Pausanias). It was greatly improved by Augustus, deemed\nANCYSTRUM. See Botany Index.\n\nANDALUSIA, in Antiquity, a fort of gladiators, who, mounted on horseback or in chariots, fought hoodwinked, having a helmet that covered their eyes.\n\nANDALUSIA, is the most western province of Spain, having Extremadura and La Mancha on the north; the kingdom of Granada, the straits of Gibraltar, and the ocean, on the east and south; and on the west, the kingdom of Algarva in Portugal, from which it is separated by the river Guadiana. It is about 182 miles long, and 150 broad. The chief cities and towns are Seville the capital, Baeza, Gibraltar, Cordova, Cadiz, Medina Sidonia, Jaen, Port St Mary, &c. It is the best, most fruitful, and the richest part of all Spain. There is a good air, a serene sky, a fertile soil, and a great extent of sea coast fit for commerce.\n\nNew ANDALUSIA, a division of the province of Terra Firme in South America, whose boundaries cannot be well ascertained, as the Spaniards pretend a right to countries in which they have never established any settlements. According to the most reasonable limits, it extends in length 300 miles from north to south, and about 270 in breadth from east to west. The interior country is woody and mountainous, variegated with fine valleys that yield corn and pasturage. The produce of the country consists chiefly in dying drugs, gums, medicinal roots, brazil wood, sugar, tobacco, and some valuable timber. To this province also belonged five valuable pearl fisheries. The capital of New Andalusia is Comana, Cumana, or New Corduba, situated in N. Lat. 9° 55', about nine miles from the north sea. Here the Spaniards laid the foundation of a town in the year 1520. The place is strong by nature, and fortified by a castle capable of making a vigorous defense; as appeared in the year 1670, when it was assaulted by the Bucaniers, who were repulsed with very great slaughter.\n\nANDAMAN, or ANDERMAN Islands, in the East Indies, situated about 80 leagues distance from Tanafferm on the coast of Siam. They are but little known. The East India ships sometimes touch at them, and are supplied by the natives with rice, herbs, and fruits. The inhabitants are by some represented as a harmless inoffensive race of men, and by others as cannibals. E. Long. 92° 0'. N.

E. Long. 2° 50'. N. Lat. 44° 24'.\n\nANDERAB, the most southern city of the province of Balkh, possessed by the Uzbek Tartars. It is very rich and populous, but a place of no great strength. The neighbouring mountains yield excellent quarries of lapis lazuli, in which the Bukhars drive a great trade with Persia and India.—This city is situated at the foot of the mountains dividing the dominions of the Great Mogul and Persia from Great Bukharia. As there is no other way of crossing these mountains but by the road through this city, all travellers with goods must pay 4 per cent. On this account the khan of Balkh maintains a good number of soldiers in the place.\n\nANDERNACHT, a city of Cologne, in the circle of the Lower Rhine. It is situated in a plain on the river Rhine; and is fortified with a wall, castle, and bulwarks. It has a trade in stone jugs and pitchers, which are sent to the mineral waters at Dünchstein.

He was sometime a student of Lincoln-college, Oxford; and removed from thence to the Inner Temple, where he applied himself diligently to the study of the law, and became a barrister. In the ninth of Queen Elizabeth he was both Lent and Summer reader, and in the 16th double reader. He was appointed her majesty's sergeant-at-law in the 19th year of her reign; and some time after, one of the justices of the assize. In 1582 he was made lord chief justice of the common pleas, and in the year following was knighted. He held his office to the end of his life, died in the year 1605, and was buried at Eyworth in Bedfordshire. He was an able, but unamiable lawyer; a scourge to the Puritans; and a strenuous supporter of the established church. His works are, 1.

He was appointed one of the trustees for establishing the colony of Georgia in America; and was also one of the court of assistants of the Scots corporation in London. The time of the publication of his \"Historical and Chronological Deduction of Trade and Commerce,\" a work replete with useful information, was about the year 1762. He was twice married; by the first wife he had issue a daughter, married to one Mr Hardy, an apothecary in the Strand, who are both dead without issue; he afterwards became the third husband of the widow of Mr Coulter, formerly a wholesale linen draper in Cornhill, by whom he had no issue. She was, like him, tall and graceful; and her face has been thought to have some resemblance to that of the ever-living countess of Desmond, given in Mr Pennant's first Tour in Scotland. Mr Anderson died at his house in Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell, January 10, 1775. He had a good library of books, which were sold by his widow, who survived him several years, and died in 1781.\n\nANDES, a great chain of mountains in South America, which running from the most northern part of Peru to the straits of Magellan, between 3000 and 4000 miles, are the longest and most remarkable in the world. The Spaniards call them the Cordillera de los Andes. They form two ridges, the lowermost of which is overspread with woods and groves, and the uppermost covered with everlasting snow. Those who have been at the top, affirm, that the sky is always serene and bright; the air cold and piercing; and yet so thin, that they were scarce able to breathe, and the respiration, was much quicker than ordinary; and this is attended with retching and vomiting; which, however, has been considered by some merely accidental. When they looked downwards, the country was hid by the clouds that hovered on the mountain's sides. The mountains just mentioned, which have been frequently ascended, are much inferior in height to many others in this enormous chain. The following is the account given of the mountain called Pichincha, by the mathematicians sent by the kings of France and Spain to make observations in relation to the figure of the earth.\n\nSoon after our artists arrived at Quito, they determined to continue the series of the triangles for measuring an arch of the meridian to the south of that city: the company accordingly divided themselves into two bodies, consisting of French and Spaniards, and each retired to the part assigned them. Don George Juan and M. Godin, who were at the head of one party, went to the mountain of Pambamarca; while M. Bouguer, de la Condamine, and Don Ulloa, together with their assistants, climbed up to the highest summit of Pichincha. Both parties suffered extremely, as well from the severity of the cold as from the impetuosity of the winds, which on these heights blow with incessant violence; difficulties the more painful, as they had been little used to such sensations. Thus in the torrid zone, nearly under the equinoctial, where it is natural to suppose they had most to fear from the heat, their greatest pain was caused by the excessiveness of the cold.\n\nTheir first scheme for shelter and lodging in these uncomfortable regions, was to pitch a field-tent for each company; but on Pichincha this could not be done from the narrowness of the summit; they were therefore obliged to be contented with a hut so small that they could hardly all creep into it. Nor will this appear strange, if the reader considers the bad disposition and smallness of the place, it being one of the loftiest crags of a rocky mountain, 100 fathoms above the highest part of the desert of Pichincha. Such was the situation of their mansion, which, like all the other adjacent parts, soon became covered with ice and snow. The ascent up this stupendous rock, from the base, or the place where the mules could come, to their habitation was so craggy as only to be climbed on foot; and to perform it cost them four hours continual labour and pain, from the violent efforts of the body, and the subtlety of the air; the latter being such as to render respiration difficult.\n\nThe strange manner of living to which our artists were reduced during the time they were employed in a geometrical menuration of some degrees of the meridian, may not perhaps prove uninteresting to the reader; and therefore the following account is given as a specimen of it. The desert of Pichincha, both with regard to the operations performed there and its inconveniences, differing very little from others, an idea may be very easily formed of the fatigues, hardships, and dangers, to which they were continually exposed during the time they were prosecuting the enterprise, with the conduct of which they had been honoured. The principal difference between the several deserts consisted in their greater or lesser distance from places where they could procure provisions; and in the inclemency of the weather, which was proportionate to the height of the mountains, and the season of the year.\n\nThey generally kept within their hut. Indeed they were obliged to do this, both on account of the intenseness of the cold, the violence of the wind, and their being continually involved in so thick a fog, that an object at six or eight paces was hardly discernible. When the fog cleared up, the clouds by their gravity moved nearer to the surface of the earth, and on all sides surrounded the mountains to a vast distance, representing the sea, with their rock like an island in the centre of it. When this happened, they heard the horrid noises of the tempests, which then discharged themselves on Quito and the neighbouring country. They saw the lightnings issue from the clouds, and heard the thunders roll far beneath them; and whilst the lower parts were involved in tempests of thunder and rain they enjoyed a delightful serenity; the wind was abated, the sky clear, and the enlivening rays of the sun moderated the severity of the cold. But their circumstances were very different when the clouds rose; their thickness rendered respiration difficult; the snow and hail fell continually; and the wind returned with all\nAndes all its violence; so that it was impossible entirely to overcome the fears of being, together with their hut, blown down the precipice, on whose edge it was built, or of being buried under it by the daily accumulations of ice and snow.\n\nThe wind was often so violent in these regions, that its velocity dazzled the sight, whilst their fears were increased from the dreadful concussions of the precipice, caused by the fall of enormous fragments of rocks. These crashes were the more alarming, as no other noises are heard in these deserts; and during the night, their rest, which they so greatly wanted, was frequently disturbed by such sudden sounds. When the weather was anything fair with them, and the clouds gathered about some of the other mountains which had a connexion with their observations, so that they could not make all the use they desired of this interval of good weather, they left their hut to exercise themselves. Sometimes they descended to some small distance; and at others, amused themselves with rolling large fragments of rocks down the precipice; and these frequently required the joint strength of them all, though they often saw the same effected by the mere force of the wind. But they always took care in their excursions not to go so far out, but that on the least appearance of the clouds gathering about their cottage, which often happened very suddenly, they could regain their shelter. The door of their hut was fastened with thongs of leather, and on the inside not the smallest crevice was left unstoppered; besides which, it was very compactly covered with straw: but notwithstanding all their care, the wind penetrated through. The days were often little better than the nights; and all the light they enjoyed was that of a lamp or two, which they kept continually burning.\n\nThough their hut was small, and crowded with inhabitants, besides the heat of the lamps; yet the intensity of the cold was such, that every one of them was obliged to have a chafing-dish of coals. These precautions would have rendered the rigour of the climate supportable, had not the imminent danger of perishing by being blown down the precipice roused them, every time it snowed, to encounter the severity of the outward air; and fall out with shovels to free the roof of their hut from the masses of snow which were gathering on it. Nor would it, without this precaution, have been able to support the weight. They were not indeed without servants and Indians; but these were so benumbed with the cold, that it was with great difficulty they could get them out of a small tent, where they kept a continual fire. So that all our artists could obtain from them was to take their turns in this labour; and even then they went very unwillingly about it, and consequently performed it slowly.\n\nIt may easily be conceived what this company suffered from the aperitiveness of such a climate. Their feet were swollen, and so tender, that they could not even bear the heat; and walking was attended with extreme pain. Their hands were covered with chilblains; their lips swelled and chopped; so that every motion in speaking, or the like, drew blood; consequently they were obliged to strict taciturnity, and little disposed to laugh, as, by causing an extension of the lips, it produced such fissures as were very painful for two or three days after.\n\nTheir common food in this inhospitable region was a little rice boiled with some flesh or fowl procured from Quito; and, instead of fluid water, their pot was filled with ice. They had the same resource with regard to what they drank: and while they were eating, every one was obliged to keep his plate over a chafing-dish of coals, to prevent his provisions from freezing. The same was done with regard to the water. At first they imagined the drinking strong liquors would diffuse a heat through the body, and consequently render it less sensible of the painful sharpness of the cold; but, to their surprise, they felt no manner of strength in such liquors, nor were they any greater preservative against the cold than common water.\n\nAt the same time, they found it impossible to keep the Indians together. On their first feeling of the climate, their thoughts were immediately turned on deserting their masters. The first intimation they had of this kind was so unexpected, that, had not one, of a better disposition than the rest, it had acquainted them of their design, it might have proved of very bad consequence. The affair was this: There being on the top of the rock no room for pitching a tent for the Indians, they used every evening to retire to a cave at the foot of the mountain; where, besides a natural diminution of the cold, they could keep a continual fire; and consequently enjoyed more comfortable quarters than their masters. Before they withdrew at night, they fastened on the outside the door of the hut, which was so low that it was impossible to go in or out without stooping; and as every night the hail and snow which had fallen formed a wall against the door, it was the business of one or two of the Indians to come early and remove this obstruction. For though the negro servants were lodged in a little tent, their hands and feet were so covered with chilblains, that they would rather have suffered themselves to have been killed than move. The Indians therefore came constantly up to dispatch this work betwixt nine and ten in the morning: but they had not been there above four or five days, when they were not a little alarmed to see ten, eleven, and twelve o'clock come, without any news of their labours; when they were relieved by the honest servant mentioned above, who had withstood the seduction of his countrymen, and informed his masters of the defection of the four others. As soon as the snow was cleared away from the door, they dispatched the Indian to the corregidor of Quito, who with equal dispatch sent other Indians, threatening to chastise them severely if they were wanting in their duty.\n\nBut the fear of punishment was not sufficient to induce them to support the rigour of this situation; for within two days they deserted. The corregidor therefore, to prevent any other inconvenience, sent four Indians under the care of an alcade, and gave orders for their being relieved every fourth day.\n\nTwenty-three tedious days our artists spent on this rock, viz. to the 6th of September, and even without any possibility of finishing their observations of the angles; for when it was fair and clear weather with them, the others, on whose summits the signals which formed the triangles for measuring the degrees of the meridian, were hid in the clouds; and when those were clear, Pichincha was involved in clouds. It was therefore necessary to erect their signals in a lower situation,\nand in a more favourable region. This, however, did not produce any change in their habitation till the beginning of December; when, having finished the observations which particularly concerned Pichincha, they proceeded to others; but with no abatement either of inconveniences, cold, or fatigue; for the places where they made their observations being necessarily on the highest parts of the deserts, the only respite in which they enjoyed some little ease was during the short interval of passing from one to the other.\n\nIn all their stations subsequent to that on Pichincha, during their fatiguing mensuration of the degrees of the meridian, each company lodged in a field-tent, which, though small, they found less inconvenient than the hut on Pichincha; though at the same time they had more trouble, being often obliged to clear it from the snow, as the weight of it would otherwise have demolished the tent. At first, indeed, they pitched it in the most sheltered places; but on taking a resolution that the tents themselves should serve for signals, to prevent the inconvenience of having others of wood, they removed them to a more exposed situation, where the impetuosity of the winds sometimes tore up the piquets, and blew them down.\n\nThough this mountain is famous for its great height, it is considerably lower than the mountain of Cotopaxi; but it is impossible to conceive the coldness of the summit of the last mentioned mountain from that felt on this; since it must exceed every idea that can be formed by the human mind, though they are both seated in the midst of the torrid zone. In all this range of mountains, there is said to be a constant inferior boundary, beyond which the snow never melts; this boundary, in the midst of the torrid zone, is said by some to be 2434 fathoms above the level of the sea; by others, only 2400 feet. The snow indeed falls much lower, but then it is subject to be melted the very same day. It is affirmed, that there are in the Andes 16 volcanoes or burning mountains, which throw out fire and smoke with a terrible noise. The height of Chimborazo, said to be the highest peak of the Andes, has been determined by geometrical calculations to be 20,283 feet. But the great differences between the calculators of the height of mountains in other parts of the world, must very much diminish the credit of such calculations. Instances of this we have already given under the article Ætna. No less remarkable are the differences concerning the height of the Peak of Teneriffe; which, according to the calculations of Varinus, is three miles and three quarters, or 19,800 feet; and according to those of Dr Heberden, it is only 15,396 feet; and according to those of M. Feuille, is no more than 13,128 feet. From these specimens, we can scarce avoid concluding, that all the methods hitherto invented for calculating the exact height of mountains are insufficient.\n\nAs all or most rivers have their source in mountains, it is no wonder a great number run down the sides of the Andes. Some hurry along with a prodigious rapidity; while others form beautiful cascades, or run through holes in rocks, which look like bridges of a stupendous height. There is a public road through the mountains, 1000 miles in length, part of which runs from Quito to Culco.\n\nAndes, a hamlet of Mantua in Italy, the birthplace of Virgil. Hence the epithet Andinus (Silius Italicus). Now called Pietola, two miles to the west of Mantua.\n\nAndretium; Andretium (Strabo); Andecrum, or Andereum (Ptolemy): An inland town of Dalmatia. The genuine name is Andeirium (Inscription). It is described as situated near Salone, on a naturally strong and inaccessible rock, surrounded with deep valleys, with rapid torrents; from which it appears to be the citadel now called Clissa. E.

Tacitus calls an inhabitant Lingon. E. Long. 5° 22'. N. Lat. 48° 0'.\n\nAndover, a large market town in Hampshire, which is situated on a branch of the river Test. It has several inns, which afford good accommodation for travellers; and has a market on Saturday, well stocked with provisions. It is governed by a bailiff, a steward, a recorder, ten approved men, and twenty-two capital burgesses, who yearly choose the bailiff, and he elects two serjeants at mace to attend him. The living is a vicarage, valued at £71 l. 4s. 4d. in the king's books. W. Long. 0° 56'. N. Lat. 51° 20'.\n\nAndrachne, bastard orpine. See Botany Index.\n\nAndrade, Diego de Payva d', or Andradus, a learned Portuguese, born at Coimbra, who distinguished himself at the council of Trent, where King Sebastian sent him as one of his divines. There is scarce any Catholic author who has been more quoted by the Protestants than he, because he maintained some opinions a little extravagant concerning the salvation of the Heathens. Andrada was esteemed an excellent preacher. His sermons were published in three parts, the second of which was translated into Spanish by Benedict de Alcoran. Many encomiums have been bestowed upon Andrada. Oforius in his preface to the \"Orthodox Explanations of Andradus,\" gives him the character of a man of wit, vast application, great knowledge in the languages, with all the zeal and eloquence necessary to a good preacher; and Rolfeidus says, that he brought to the council of Trent the understanding of a most profound divine, and the eloquence of a consummate orator.\n\nAndrapodismus, in Ancient Writers, the felling of persons for slaves. Hence also andrapodistes, a dealer in slaves, more particularly a kidnapper, who steals men or children to sell them; a crime for which the Thessalians were noted.\n\nAndrapodocapelli, in Antiquity, a kind of dealers in slaves. The Andrapodocapelli had a particular process for taking off moles and the like disfigurements on the faces of the slaves they kept for sale, by rubbing them with bran. At Athens, several places in the forum were appointed for the sale of slaves. Upon the first day of every month, the merchants call-\nANDREA, St., a small village on the Malabar coast in the East Indies, founded originally by the Portuguese. It takes its name from a church dedicated to St Andrew, and served by the priests of St Thomas.—On the shore of St Andrea, about half a league out in the sea, lies Mud-bay, a place which few in the world can parallel. It is open to the wide ocean, and has neither island nor bank to break the force of the billows, which come rolling with great violence from all parts, in the south-west monsoons; but on this bank of mud they lose themselves in a moment; and ships lie on it as secure as in the best harbour, without motion or disturbance. It reaches about a mile along shore, and has been observed to shift its place from the northward about three miles in 30 years. From St Andrea to Kranganor, about 12 leagues to the south, the water has the bad property of causing swellings in the legs of those who drink it constantly. Some it affects in one leg, and some in both. It causes no pain, but itching; nor does the swelled leg seem heavier to the owner than the small one, though some have been seen a yard in circumference at the ankle. The Roman legends impute the cause of this distemper (for which no preventive or cure hath been hitherto found) to a curse laid by St Thomas upon his murderers and their posterity; though, according to the Romans themselves, St Thomas was killed by the Tillinga priests at Meliapar, on the coast of Coromandel, about 400 miles distant, and where the natives have not this distemper.\n\nANDREAS, John, a celebrated canonist in the 14th century, was born at Mugello, near Florence; and was professor of canon law at Padua, Pisa, and afterwards at Bologna. It is said that he macerated his body with fasting; and lay upon the bare ground every night for 20 years together, covered only with the skin of a bear. This is attested by very good authors; but if the story which Poggius tells of him in his jets be true, he must afterwards have relaxed much of this continency: “Joanem Andreae (says he), doctorrem Bononiensem, cuius fama admodum vulgata est, subagitantem ancillam domesticae uxoris comprehendit: re inducta stupesfacta mulier in virum verfa, Ubi nunc, ait, Joannes, est fapientia vestra? Ille nil amplius locutus, In vulva illius, respondit, loco admodum sapientiae accommodato.” The French translation of this perhaps will not be displeasing.\n\nJean, dit André, fameux Docteur des Loix,\nFut pris un jour au péché d’amourette:\nIl accolloit une jeune fouibrette.\nSa femme vint, fit un signe de croix.\nHo ho, dit elle, est ce vous? non je pense:\nVoue, dont par-tout en vante la prudence.\nQu’est devenu cet esprit si futile?\nLe bon André, pourfendant son négoce,\nHonteux pourtant, ma foi, répondit-il,\nPrudence, esprit, tout git dans cette faute.\n\nSince it is agreed that John Andreas had a bastard, this story is at the bottom very probable; and it was perhaps with the mother of Banicontius that his wife found him. Andreas had a beautiful daughter, named Novella, whom he loved extremely: and he is said to have instructed her so well in all parts of learning, that when he was engaged in any affair which hindered him from reading lectures to his scholars, he sent his daughter in his room; and left her beauty should prevent the attention of the hearers, she had a little curtain drawn before her. To perpetuate the memory of this daughter, he entitled his commentary upon the Decretals of Gregory IX, the Novella. He married her to John Calderinus, a learned canonist. The first work of Andreas was his Gloss upon the Sixth Book of the Decretals, which he wrote when he was very young. He wrote also Glosses upon the Clementines; and a Commentary in regulas Sexti, which he entitled Mercurialis, because he either engaged in it on Wednesdays (diebus Mercurii), or because he inherited his Wednesdays disputes in it. He enlarged the Speculum of Durand, in the year 1347. This is all which Mr Bayle mentions of his writings, though he wrote many more. Andreas died of the plague at Bologna in 1348, after he had been a professed 45 years; and was buried in the church of the Dominicans. Many eulogiums have been bestowed upon him. He has been called Archidoc tor decretorum: In his epitaph, Rabbi doctorum; lux, cenor, normae morum; “Rabbi of the doctors, the light, censor, and rule of manners.” And it is said, that Pope Boniface called him lumen mundi, “the light of the world.”\n\nAndreas, John, was born a Mahometan, at Xativa in the kingdom of Valencia, and succeeded his father in the dignity of alfaqui of that city. He was enlightened with the knowledge of the Christian religion by being present at a sermon in the great church of Valencia on the day of Assumption of the Blest Virgin, in the year 1487. Upon this he desired to be baptized; and, in memory of the calling of St John and St Andrew, he received the name John Andreas. “Having received holy orders (says he), and from an alfaqui and a slave of Lucifer, become a priest and minister of Christ; I began, like St Paul, to preach and publish the contrary of what I had erroneously believed and asserted; and, with the assistance of Almighty God, I converted at first a great many souls of the Moors, who were in danger of hell, and under the dominion of Lucifer, and conducted them into the way of salvation. After this, I was sent for by the most catholic princes King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, in order to preach in Grenada to the Moors of that kingdom, which their majesties had conquered: by God’s blessing on my preaching, an infinite number of Moors were brought to abjure Mahomet, and to turn to Christ. A little after this, I was made a canon by their grace; and sent for again by the most Christian Queen Isabella to Arragon, that I might be employed in the conversion of the Moors of those kingdoms, who still persisted in their errors, to the great contempt and dishonour of our crucified Saviour, and the prodigious loss and danger of all Christian princes. But this excellent and pious design of her majesty was rendered ineffectual by her death.” At the desire of Martin Garcia, bishop of Barcelona, he undertook to translate from the Arabic, into the language of Arragon, the whole law of the Moors; and after having finished this undertaking, he composed his famous work of The Confusion of the Sect of Mahomed; it contains twelve chapters,\nchapters, wherein he has collected the fabulous stories, impostures, forgeries, brutalities, follies, obscenities, abominations, impossibilities, lies, and contradictions, which Mahomet, in order to deceive the simple people, has dispersed in the writings of that sect, and especially in the Alcoran, which, as he says, was revealed to him in one night by an angel, in the city of Meke; though in another place he contradicts himself, and affirms that he was 20 years in composing it. Andreas tells us, he wrote this work, that not only the learned amongst Christians, but even the common people, might know the different belief and doctrine of the Moors; and on the one hand might laugh and ridicule such insolent and brutal notions, and on the other might lament their blindness and dangerous condition. This book, which was published at first in Spanish, has been translated into several languages; all those who write against the Mahometans quote it very much.\n\nANDREINI, ISABELLA, a native of Padua, was an excellent poetess, and one of the best comedians in Italy, towards the beginning of the 17th century. The Intenti of Pavia thought they did their society an honour by admitting her a member of it; and she, in acknowledgment of this honour, never forgot to mention amongst her titles that of Academica Infanta; her titles were these, \"Isabella Andreini, comica gelosa, academica infanta, detta l'accesta.\" She was also a woman of extraordinary beauty; which, added to a fine voice, made her charm both the eyes and ears of the audience. She died of a miscarriage, at Lyons, the 10th of June 1604, in the 42nd year of her age. Her death being a matter of general concern and lamentation, there were many Latin and Italian elegies printed to her memory: several of these pieces were placed before her poems in the edition of Milan, in 1605. Besides her sonnets, madrigals, songs, and eclogues, there is a pastoral of hers entitled Myrtila, and letters, printed at Venice in 1610. She sung extremely well, played admirably on several instruments, understood the French and Spanish languages, and was not unacquainted with philosophy.\n\nANDRELINUS, PUBLIUS TAUSTUS, born at Forli in Italy. He was long time professor of poetry and philosophy in the university of Paris. Louis XII. of France made him his poet laureat; and Erasmus tells us he was likewise poet to the queen. His pen was not wholly employed in making verses; for he wrote also moral and proverbial letters in prose, which were printed several times. His poems, which are chiefly in Latin, are inserted in vol. i. of the Delicie Poetarum Italorum. M. de la Monnoie tells us, \"that Andrelinus, when he was but 22 years old, received the crown of laurel: That his love verses, divided into four books, entitled Livia, from the name of his mistress, were esteemed so fine by the Roman Academy, that they adjudged the prize of the Latin elegy to the author.\" He died in 1518. This author's manner of life was not very exemplary; yet he was so fortunate, says Erasmus, that though he took the liberty of rallying the divines, he was never brought into trouble about it.\n\nANDREW, Sr., the apostle, born at Bethsaida in Galilee, brother to Simon Peter. He had been a disciple of John the Baptist, and followed Jesus upon the testimony given of him by the Baptist (John i. 32, 37). He followed our Saviour with another of John's disciples, and went into the house where Jesus lodged; here he continued from about four o'clock in the afternoon till it was night. This was the first disciple whom our Saviour received into his train. Andrew introduced his brother Simon, and they passed a day with Christ, after which they went to the marriage in Cana (id. ii.), and at last returned to their ordinary occupation. Some months after, Jesus meeting them while they were both fishing together, called them to him, and promised to make them fishers of men. Immediately they left their nets, followed him (Mat. iv. 19), and never afterwards separated from him.\n\nAfter our Saviour's ascension, his apostles having determined by lot what parts of the world they should severally take, Scythia and the neighbouring countries fell to St Andrew, who, according to Eusebius, after he had planted the gospel in several places, came to Patrae in Achaea, where, endeavouring to convert the proconsul Ægeas, he was by that governor's orders scourged, and then crucified. The particular time of his suffering martyrdom is not known; but all the ancient and modern martyrologies, both of the Greeks and Latins, agree in celebrating his festival upon the 30th of November. His body was embalmed, and decently interred at Patrae by Maximilla, a lady of great quality and estate. Afterwards it was removed to Constantinople by Constantine the Great, and buried in the great church, which he had built to the honour of the apostles. There is a cross to be seen at this day in the church of St Victor at Marseille, which is believed by the Romans to be the same that St Andrew was fastened to. It is in the shape of the letter X, and is enclosed in a silver shrine. Peter Chrysologus says, that he was crucified upon a tree; and the spurious Hippolytus affirms it was an olive tree.\n\nANDREW, or Knights of St Andrew, an order of knights, more usually called the order of the thistle. See Thistle.\n\nKnights of St Andrew, is also an order instituted by Peter the Great of Muscovy in 1608; the badge of which is a golden medal; on one side whereof is represented St Andrew's cross, with these words, Caesar Pierre monarchique de tout le Russe. This medal, being fastened to a blue ribbon, is suspended from the right shoulder.\n\nSt Andrew's Cross, one in form of the letter X. See Cross.\n\nSt Andrew's Day, a festival of the Christian church, celebrated on the 30th of November, in honour of the apostle St Andrew.\n\nANDREW'S, St, a town of Fifeshire in Scotland, once the metropolis of the Pictish kingdom, lying in W. Long. 2. 25. N. Lat. 56. 18. If we may credit legend, St Andrew's owes its origin to a singular accident. St Regulus (or St Rule, as he is likewise called), a Greek of Achæa, was warned by a vision to leave his native country, and visit Albion, an island placed in the remotest part of the world; and to take with him the arm-bone, three fingers, and three toes, of St Andrew. He obeyed, and set sail with his companions, but had a very tempestuous passage. After being tossed for some time on a stormy sea, he was at last shipwrecked on the coast of Otholania, in the territories of Hergalus king of the Picts, in the year 370. On hearing\nAndrew's ing of the arrival of the strangers, with their precious relics, the king immediately gave orders for their reception, afterwards presenting the saint with his own palace, and building near it the church, which still bears the name of St Regulus.\n\nAt this time the place was styled Muircroft, or the land of boars; all round was forest, and the lands bestowed on the saint were called Byrethib. The boars equalled in size the ancient Erymanthian; as a proof of which, two tusks, each sixteen inches long and four thick, were chained to the altar of St Andrew's. St Regulus changed the name to Kilrymont; and established here the first Christian priests of the country, called Culdees. The church was supreme in the kingdom of the Picts; Ungus having granted to God and St Andrew, that it should be the head and mother of all the churches in his dominions. He also directed that the crofs of St Andrew should become the badge of the country. In 518, after the conquest of the Picts, he removed the episcopal see to St Andrew's, and the bishop was styled maximus Scotorum episcopus. In 1441, it was erected into an archbishopric by Sextus IV., at the intercession of James III. In 1606, the priory was suppressed; and, in 1617, the power of election was transferred to eight bishops, the principal of St Leonard's college, the archdeacon, the vicars of St Andrew's, Leuchars, and Cupar. This see contained the greatest part of the shire of Fife, with a part of Perth, Forfar, and Kincardine thires, and a great number of parishes, churches, and chapels in other dioceses.\n\nThe town of St Andrew's was erected into a royal borough by David I. in the year 1140, and its privileges afterwards confirmed. The charter of Malcolm II. is preserved in the tolbooth; and appears written on a bit of parchment, but the contents equally valid with what would at this time require whole skins. Here also are kept the silver keys of the city; which, for form's sake, are delivered to the king, if he should visit the place, or to a victorious enemy, in token of submission. In this place, likewise, is to be seen the monstrous axe which, in 1646, took off the heads of Sir Robert Spotwood and other distinguished loyalists. The town underwent a siege in 1337; at which time it was possessed by the English and other partizans of Balliol; but the loyalists, under the earls of March and Fife, made themselves masters of it in three weeks, by the help of their battering machines.\n\nSt Andrew's is now greatly reduced in the number of its inhabitants; at present scarcely exceeding 2000. It is impossible to ascertain the fact when it was the seat of the primate: all that can be known is, that during the period of its splendour, there were between sixty and seventy bakers; but now nine or ten are sufficient for the place. It is a mile in circuit, and contains three principal streets. On entering the west port, a well built street, straight, and of a vast length and breadth appears; but so grass-grown, and presenting such a dreary solitude, that it forms the perfect idea of having been laid waste by the pestilence.\n\nThe cathedral of St Andrew's was founded by Bishop Arnold in 1151, but did not attain its full magnificence till 1318. Its length from east to west was 370 feet; that of the transept, 322. But though this vast pile was 157 years in building, John Knox, in June 1559, effected its demolition in a single day; and so effectually has it been destroyed, that nothing now remains but part of the east and west ends, and of the fourth side.\n\nNear the east end is the chapel of St Regulus; the tower of which is a lofty equilateral triangle, of 20 feet each side, and 103 feet high; the body of the chapel remains, but the two side chapels are ruined. The arches of the windows and doors are round, and some even more than semicircles; an undoubted proof of their antiquity.\n\nThe priory was founded by Alexander I. in 1122; and the monks (canons regular of St Augustine) were brought from Scone, in 1140, by Robert bishop of this fee. By an act of parliament, in the time of James I., the prior had precedence of all abbots and priors, and on the days of festival wore a mitre and all episcopal ornaments. Dependent on this priory were those of Lochleven, Portmeak, Monimusk, the Isle of May, and Pittenweem, each originally a seat of the Culdees. The revenues of the house were vast, viz. in money 2237l. 2s. 10½d.; 38 chalders 1 boll 3 firlets of wheat; 132 ch. 7 bolls of bear; 114 ch. 3 bolls 1 peck of meal; 151 ch. 10 bolls 1 firlet 1 peck and a half of oats; 3 ch. 7 bolls of pease and beans; 480 acres of land also belonged to it. Nothing remains of the priory except the walls of the precinct, which show its vast extent. In one part is a most artless gate-way, formed only of seven stones. This enclosure begins near the cathedral, and extends to the shore.\n\nThe other religious houses were, one of Dominicans founded in 1274, by Bishop Withart; another of Observantines, founded by Bishop Kennedy, and finished by his successor Patrick Graham in 1478; and, according to some, the Carmelites had a fourth.\n\nImmediately above the harbour stood the collegiate church of Kirk-leugh, originally founded by Constantine III., who, retiring from the world, became here a Culdee. From its having been first built on a rock, it was styled, Propositura Sancta Mariae de rupe.\n\nOn the east side of the city are the poor remains of the castle, on a rock overlooking the sea. This fortress was founded in 1407, by Bishop Trail, who was buried near the high altar of the cathedral, with this singular epitaph:\n\nHic fuit ecclesia dirella columna, fenofra Lucida, iburitulum redolens, campana sonora.\n\nThe castle was the residence of Cardinal Beaton; who, after the death of George Wishart, apprehending some danger, caused it to be fortified so strongly as to be at that time deemed impregnable. In this fortress, however, he was surprised and assassinated by Norman Leslie with 15 others. They seized on the gate of the castle early in the morning of May 29, 1546; it having been left open for the workmen who were finishing the fortifications; and having placed sentinels at the door of the cardinal's apartment, they awakened his numerous domestics one by one; and, turning them out of the castle, they, without violence, tumult, or offering an injury to any other person, inflicted on Beaton the death he justly merited. The conspirators were immediately besieged in this castle by the regent, earl of Arran; and notwithstanding they had acquired no greater strength than 150 men, they refused all his efforts for five months. This, however, was owing to\nAndrew's the unkindliness of the besiegers more than to the strength of the place or the valour of the besieged; for in 1547 the castle was reduced and demolished. The entrance of it is still to be seen; and the window is shown, out of which it is said the cardinal leaned to glut his eyes with the cruel martyrdom of George Wishart, who was burnt on a spot beneath.\n\nIn the church of St Salvator is a most beautiful tomb of Bishop Kennedy, who died, an honour to his family, in 1466. The Gothic work is uncommonly elegant. Within the tomb were discovered five magnificent maces, which had been concealed here in troublesome times. One was given to each of the other three Scotch universities, and three are preserved here. In the top is represented our Saviour; around are angels, with the instruments of the passion.\n\nWith these are shown some silver arrows, with large silver plates affixed to them, on which are inscribed the arms and names of the noble youth, victors in the annual competitions in the generous art of archery, which were dropped but a few years ago; and golf is now the reigning game. That sport, and foot-ball, were formerly prohibited, as useless and unprofitable to the public; and at all weapon feasting, or reviews of the people, it was ordered, that fute-ball and golfe be utterly cryed down, and that bow-markes be made at ilk parish kirk, a pair of butts and shooting being used; and that ilk man schute sixe floates at least, under the paine to be raised upon them that cummis not, at leaft two pennyes to be given to them that cummis to the bow-markes to drink.\n\nThe celebrated university of this city was founded in 1411, by Bishop Wardlaw. It consisted once of three colleges. 1. St Salvator's, founded in 1438, by Bishop Kennedy. This is a handsome building, with a court or quadrangle within; on one side is the church, on another the library; the third contains apartments for students; the fourth is unfinished. 2. St Leonard's college was founded by Prior Hepburn, in 1522. This is now united with the last, and the buildings fold, and converted into private houses. 3. The new, or St Mary's college, was established by Archbishop Hamilton in 1553; but the house was built by James and David Bethune, or Beaton, who did not live to complete it. This is said to have been the site of a sebola illuftris long before the establishment even of the university, where several eminent clergymen taught, gratis, the sciences and languages. But it was called the new college, because of its late erection into a divinity college by the archbishop.\n\nThe university is governed by a chancellor, an office originally designed to be perpetually vested in the archbishops of St Andrew's; but since the Reformation, he is elected by the two principals, and the professors of both the colleges.\n\nThe rector is the next great officer; to whose care are committed the privileges, discipline, and statutes of the university. The colleges have their rectors, and professors of different sciences, who are indefatigable in their attention to the instruction of the students, and to that essential article their morals. This place possesses several very great advantages respecting the education of youth. The air is pure and salubrious; the place for exercise, dry and extensive; the exercises themselves are healthy and innocent. The university is fixed in a peninsula country; remote from all commerce with the world, the haunt of dissipation. From the smallness of the society, every student's character is perfectly known. No little irregularity can be committed, but it is instantly discovered and checked; vice cannot attain a head in this place, for the incorrigible are never permitted to remain the corrupters of the rest.\n\nThe trade of St Andrew's was once very considerable. So late as the reign of Charles I, this place had thirty or forty trading vessels, and carried on a considerable herring and white fishery, by means of bulks, in deep water; which fisheries had for ages been the grand source of their commerce, wealth, and splendour. After the death of the king, this whole coast, and St Andrew's in particular, became a scene of murder, plunder, and rapine: every town suffered in proportion to its magnitude and opulence. Nor were those hypocritical ruffians satisfied with the shipping, merchandise, plate, cattle, and whatever came within their sight; they also laid the whole coast under contribution. St Andrew's was required to pay £1000; but the inhabitants not being able to raise that sum after being thus plundered, the general compounded for £500, which was raised by a loan at interest, and hath remained a burden upon the corporation, it is believed, ever since.\n\nThe harbour is artificial, guarded by piers, with a narrow entrance, to give shelter to vessels from the violence of a very heavy sea, by the encroachments of which it has suffered much. The manufactures this city might in former times possess, are now reduced to one, that of golf balls; which, trifling as it may seem, maintains a great number of people. It is, however, commonly fatal to the artists; for the balls are made by stuffing a great quantity of feathers into a leather case, by help of an iron rod, with a wooden handle, pressed against the breast, which seldom fails to bring on a consumption.\n\nAndrews, Lancelot, bishop of Winchester, was born at London in 1555, and educated at Cambridge. After several preferments, he was made bishop, first of Chichester, then of Ely, and, in 1618, was raised to the see of Winchester. This very learned prelate, who was distinguished by his piety, charity, and integrity, may be justly ranked with the best preachers and completest scholars of his age; he appeared to much greater advantage in the pulpit than he does now in his works, which abound with Latin quotations and trivial witticisms. His sermons, though full of puns, were suited to the taste of the times he which he lived, and were consequently greatly admired. He was a man of polite manners and lively conversation; and could quote Greek and Latin authors, or even pun, with King James. There is a pleasant story related of him in the life of Waller the poet. When that gentleman was young, he had the curiosity to go to court, and stood in the circle to see King James dine; where, among other company, there sat at table two bishops, Neale and Andrews. The king propounded aloud this question, Whether he might not take his subject's money when he needed it, without all this formality of parliament? Neale replied, \"God forbid you should not; for you are the breath of our nostrils.\" Whereupon the king turned, and said to the bishop of Winchester, \"Well, my lord, what\nAndrews: say you?\" \"Sir (replied the bishop), I have no skill to judge of parliamentary cases.\" The king answered, \"No put-offs, my lord; answer me presently.\" \"Then, Sir (said he), I think it lawful for you to take my brother Neale's money, for he offers it.\" Mr. Wal- ler says, the company was pleased with this answer, but the wit of it seemed to affect the king; for a certain lord coming soon after, his majesty cried out, \"O, my lord, they say you lig with my lady.\" \"No, Sir (says his lordship, in confusion), but I like her company because she has so much wit.\" \"Why then (says the king) do not you lig with my lord of Winchester there?\" This great prelate was in no less reputation and esteem with King Charles I., than he had been with his predecessors. He died at Winchester house in Southwark, September 27, 1626, in the 71st year of his age; and was buried in the parish church of St. Saviour's, where his executors erected to him a very fair monument of marble and alabaster, on which is an elegant inscription, in Latin, written by one of his chaplains. Mr. Milton also, at 17 years of age, wrote a beautiful elegy on his death, in the same language. Bishop Andrews had, 1. A share in the translation of the Pentateuch, and the historical books from Joshua to the first book of Chronicles exclusively. He also wrote,\n\n2. *Tortura Tertii*, in answer to a work of Cardinal Bellarmine, in which that cardinal affirms the name of Matthew Torius.\n\n3. A Manual of Private Devotions;\n\nand, 4. A Manual of Directions for the Visitation of the Sick; besides the Sermons and Tracts, in English and Latin, published after his death.\n\n**ANDRIA**, in Grecian Antiquity, public entertainments first instituted by Minos of Crete, and, after his example, appointed by Lycurgus at Sparta, at which a whole city or a tribe assisted. They were managed with the utmost frugality; and persons of all ages were admitted, the younger fort being obliged by the law-giver to repair thither as to schools of temperance and sobriety.\n\n**ANDRIA**, a city and a bishop's see in the territory of Bari, in the kingdom of Naples. It is pretty large, well peopled, and seated in a spacious plain, four miles from the Adriatic coast. E. Long. 17°. N.

After a complete victory over Juventus, the Roman praetor sent against him, he assumed kingly power, but exercised it with vast cruelty. At last, the Romans obliged him to fly into Thrace, where he was betrayed and delivered into the hands of Metellus. This victory gained Macedonia once more into the power of the Romans, and to Metellus the name of *Macedonicus*, but cost the Romans 25,000 men. Andriscus adorned the triumph of Metellus, walking in chains before the general's chariot.\n\n**ANDROAS**, or **Androdamas**, among Ancient Naturals, a kind of pyrite, to which they attributed certain magical virtues.\n\n**ANDROGEUS**, in Fabulous History, the son of Minos king of Crete, was murdered by the Athenian youth and those of Megara, who envied his being always victor at the Attic games. But Minos having taken Athens and Megara, obliged the inhabitants to Androgy-nes.\n\n**ANDROGYNES**, in Natural History, a name given to those living creatures which, by a monstrous formation of their generative parts, seem (for it is only seeming) to unite in themselves the two sexes, that of the male and of the female. This *lusus naturae*, this defect, or perhaps redundancy, in the animal structure, is described by medical authors in the following manner: \"There is a depravation in the structure of the parts intended by nature for propagation, when, besides those concealed parts that are found necessary for the discharge of prolific functions, the pudenda of the other sex likewise appear. This monstrous production of nature is diversified in four different ways; of which three appear in males and one in females. In men, the female pudendum, clothed with hair, sometimes appears contiguous to the perineum; at other times, in the middle of the scrotum; at other times, which constitutes the third diversity, through that part itself which in the midst of the scrotum exhibits the form of a pudendum, urine is emitted. Near that part which is the test of puberty, and above the pudendum, even in females, the masculine genitals appear in some, conspicuous in all their three forms, one resembling the veretrum or yard, the other like the two testicles; but for the most part it happens, that, of the two instruments of generation, one is feeble and inert; and it is extremely rare that both are found sufficiently valid and proper for feats of love; nay, even in a great many, both these members are deficient and impotent, so that they can perform the office neither of a male nor of a female.\"\n\nWith respect to them, it appears, from a collation of all the circumstances which have been observed by naturalists worthy of credit, that there is no such thing as a perfect *androgyne*, or real hermaphrodite; that is to say, a living creature, which, by its unnatural, or rather preternatural structure, possesses the genuine powers of both sexes, in such a manner as to be qualified for performing the functions of either with luci-ces: the irregularity of their fabrication almost always confits in something superfluous added to one of the two sexes, which gives it the appearance of the other, without bestowing the real and characteristic distinction; and every *hermaphrodite* is almost always a very woman. Since this monstrous exhibition of nature is not such as to abrogate the rights or destroy the character of humanity amongst human beings, this involuntary misfortune implies no right to deprive those upon whom it is inflicted by nature of the privileges natural to every citizen; and as this deficiency is no more infectious than any other corporeal mutilation, it is not easy to see why marriage should be prohibited to one of these unhappy beings, merely on account of its equivocal appearance, which acts in the character of its prevailing sex. If such a creature, by the defect of its construction, should be barren, this does not infer any right of dissolving the marriage which it may have contracted, more than the same sterility proceeding from any cause whether known or unknown, if his or her comfort should not on that account require a divorce.\nIt is only the licentious abuse either of one or the other sex which can be subjected to the animadversion of the police. See HERMAPHRODITE.\n\nSuch are the sentiments of the authors of the French Encyclopedie. After all, we cannot forbear to add, that from such heterogeneous matches nature seems to recoil with innate and inextinguishable horror. Nor are any of these invincible aversions implanted in our frame without a final cause worthy of its Author. We would gladly ask these free-thinking gentlemen, in cases where the sexes are so unnaturally confounded, how the police can, by its most severe and rigorous animadversions, either detect or prevent those licentious abuses against which they remonstrate? Since, therefore, an evil so baneful to human society could no otherwise be prevented than by the sanction of Nature against such horrible conjunctions, the instinctive antipathy which they inspire was highly worthy of her wisdom and purity.\n\nANDROGYNES, in Ancient Mythology, creatures of whom according to the fable, each individual possessed the powers and characters of both sexes, having two heads, four arms, and two feet. The word itself is compounded of two Greek radical words; ἀνήρ, in genitive ἀνδρός, a male; and γυνή, a female. Many of the rabbinical writers pretend, that Adam was created double, one body being male, the other female, which in their origin not being essentially joined, God afterwards did nothing but separate them.\n\nThe gods, says Plato in his Banquet, had formed the structure of man round, with two bodies and two sexes. This fantastic being, possessing in itself the whole human system, was endowed with a gigantic force, which rendered it insolent, inasmuch that it resolved to make war against the gods. Jupiter, exasperated, was going to destroy it; but, sorry at the same time to annihilate the human race, he satisfied himself with debilitating this double being, by disjoining the male from the female, and leaving each half to subsist with its own powers alone. He assigned to Apollo the task of repolishing these two half bodies, and of extending their skins so that the whole surface might be covered. Apollo obeyed, and fastened it at the umbilicus: If this half should still rebel, it was once more to be subdivided by another section, which would only leave it one of the parts of which it was then constituted; and even this fourth of a man was to be annihilated, if it should persist in its obstinacy and mischief. The idea of these androgynes might well be borrowed from a passage in Moles, where that historian of the birth and infancy of nature, describes Adam as calling Eve bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. However this may be, the fable of Plato has been used with great ingenuity by a French poet, who has been rendered almost as conspicuous by his misfortunes as by his verses. With the ancient philosopher, he attributes the propensity which attracts one of the sexes towards the other, to the natural ardour which each half of the androgynes feels for reunion; and their inconsistency, to the difficulty which each of the separated parts encounters in its efforts to recover its proper and original half. If a woman appears to us amiable, we instantly imagine her to be that moiety with whom we should only have constituted one whole, had it not been for the insolence of our original double-foxed progenitor:\n\nThe heart, with fond credulity impris'd,\nTells us the half is found, and hopes for rest;\nBut 'tis our curse, that sad experience shows,\nWe neither find our half, nor gain repose.\n\nANDROGYNOUS, in Zoology, an appellation given to animals which have both the male and female sex in the same individual.—In Botany, the term is applied to such plants as bear both male and female flowers on the same root.\n\nANDROIDES, in Mechanics, a human figure, which, by certain springs or other movements, is capable of performing some of the natural motions of a living man. The motions of the human body are more complicated, and consequently more difficult to be imitated, than those of any other creature; whence the construction of an androides, in such a manner as to imitate any of these actions with tolerable exactness, is justly supposed to indicate a greater skill in mechanics than any other piece of workmanship whatever.\n\nA very remarkable figure of this kind appeared in Paris, in the year 1738. It represented a flutist-player, and was capable of performing many different pieces of music on the German flute; which, considering the difficulty of blowing that instrument, the different contractions of the lips necessary to produce the distinctions between the high and low notes, and the complicated motions of the fingers, must appear truly wonderful.\n\nThis machine was the invention of M. Vaucanson, member of the Royal Academy of Sciences; and a particular description of it was published in the Memoirs of the Academy for that year.\n\nThe figure itself was about five feet and a half in height, situated at the end of an artificial rock, and placed upon a square pedestal four feet and a half high and three and a half broad. The air entered the body by three pipes separated one from the other. It was conveyed to them by nine pair of bellows, three of which were placed above and six below. These were made to expand and contract regularly in succession by means of an axis of steel turned round by some clockwork. On this axis were different protuberances at proper distances, to which were fixed cords thrown over pulleys, and terminating in the upper boards of the bellows, so that, as the axis turned, these boards were alternately raised and let down. A contrivance was also used to prevent the disagreeable hissing fluttering noise usually attending the motion of bellows. This was by making the cord, by which the bellows was moved, pass, in its descent, upon one end of a smaller lever, the other end of which ascending forced open the small leather valve that admitted the air, and kept it so, till the cord being relaxed by the descent of the upper board, the lever fell, and the air was forced out. Thus the bellows performing their functions constantly without the least hissing, or other noise, by which it could be judged in what manner the air was conveyed to the machine. The upper boards of three of the pairs of bellows were pressed down by a weight of four pounds, that of three others by a weight of two pounds, and\nAndrocles, and those of the three remaining ones by nothing but their own weight.\n\nThe three tubes, by which the air entered, terminated in three small reservoirs in the trunk of the figure. There they united, and ascending towards the throat, formed the cavity of the mouth, which terminated in two small lips adapted in some measure to perform their proper functions. Within this cavity also was a small moveable tongue; which, by its play, at proper periods, admitted the air, or intercepted its passage to the flute.\n\nThe fingers, lips, and tongue, received their proper directions by means of a steel cylinder turned by clock-work. It was divided into 15 equal parts, which by means of pegs, pressing upon the ends of 15 different levers, caused the other extremities to ascend. Seven of these levers directed the fingers, having wires and chains affixed to their ascending extremities, which being attached to the fingers, caused them ascend in proportion as the other extremity was pressed down by the motion of the cylinder, and vice versa. Thus the ascent or descent of one end of a lever produced a similar ascent or descent in the corresponding finger, by which one of the holes of the flute was occasionally opened or closed, as by a living performer. Three of the levers served to regulate the ingreeds of the air, being contrived so as to open and shut, by means of valves, the three reservoirs of air above-mentioned, so that more or less strength might be given, and a higher or lower note produced as occasion required. The lips were, by a similar mechanism, directed by four levers, one of which opened them, to give the air a freer passage; the other contracted them; the third drew them backward; and the fourth pushed them forward. The lips were projected upon that part of the flute which receives the air; and, by the different motions already mentioned, modified the tone in a proper manner. The remaining lever was employed in the direction of the tongue, which it easily moved so as to shut or open the mouth of the flute.\n\nThus we see how all the motions necessary for a German flute player could be performed by this machine; but a considerable difficulty still remains, namely, how to regulate these motions properly, and make each of them follow in just succession. This, however, was effected by the following simple method. The extremity of the axis of the cylinder was terminated on the right side by an endless screw, consisting of twelve threads, each placed at the distance of a line and a half from the other. Above this screw was fixed a piece of copper, and in it a steel pivot, which, falling in between the threads of the screw, obliged the cylinder to follow the threads, and, instead of turning directly round, it was continually pushed to one side. Hence, if a lever was moved, by a peg placed on the cylinder, in any one revolution, it could not be moved by the same peg in the succeeding revolution, because the peg would be moved a line and a half beyond it by the lateral motion of the cylinder. Thus, by an artificial disposition of those pegs in different parts of the cylinder, the statue was made, by the successive elevation of the proper levers, to exhibit all the different motions of a flute-player, to the admiration of every one who saw it.\n\nThe construction of machines capable of imitating even the mechanical actions of the human body, show exquisite skill; but what shall we say of one capable, not only of imitating actions of this kind, but of acting as external circumstances require, as though it were endowed with life and reason? This, nevertheless, has been done. M. de Kempelen, a gentleman of Pressburg in Hungary, excited by the performances of M. de Vaucanson, at first endeavoured to imitate them, and at last far excelled them. This gentleman constructed an Androcles capable of playing at chess!—Every one who is in the least acquainted with this game must know, that it is so far from being mechanically performed, as to require a greater exertion of the judgment and rational faculties than is sufficient to accomplish many matters of greater importance. An attempt, therefore, to make a wooden chess-player, must appear as ridiculous as to make a wooden preacher or councillor of state. That this machine really was made, however, the public have had ocular demonstration. The inventor came over to Britain in 1783, where he remained above a year with his automaton.\n\nIt is a figure as large as life, in a Turkish dress, sitting behind a table, with doors of three feet and a half in length, two in depth, and two and a half in height. The chair on which it sits is fixed to the table, which runs on four wheels. The automaton leans its right arm on the table, and in its left hand holds a pipe; with this hand it plays after the pipe is removed. A chess board of 18 inches is fixed before it. This table, or rather cupboard, contains wheels, levers, cylinders, and other pieces of mechanism; all which are publicly displayed. The vestments of the automaton are then lifted over its head, and the body is seen full of similar wheels and levers. There is a little door in its thigh, which is likewise opened; and with this, and the table also open, and the automaton uncovered, the whole is wheeled about the room. The doors are then shut, and the automaton is ready to play; and it always takes the first move.\n\nAt every motion the wheels are heard; the image moves its head, and looks over every part of the chess board. When it checks the queen, it shakes its head twice, and thrice in giving check to the king. It likewise shakes its head when a false move is made, replaces the piece, and makes its own move; by which means the adversary loses one.\n\nM. de Kempelen remarks as the most surprising circumstance attending his automaton, that it had been exhibited at Pressburg, Vienna, Paris, and London, to thousands, many of whom were mathematicians and chess-players, and yet the secret by which he governed the motion of its arm was never discovered. He prided himself solely on the construction of the mechanical powers, by which the arm could perform ten or twelve moves. It then required to be wound up like a watch, after which it was capable of continuing the same number of motions.\n\nThe automaton could not play unless M. de Kempelen or his substitute was near it to direct its moves. A small square box, during the game, was frequently consulted by the exhibitor; and herein consisted the secret, which he said he could in a moment communicate. He who could beat M. de Kempelen was, of course, certain of conquering the automaton. It was made in 1769. His own account of it was:\n\n\"C'est\nAndrolypse \"C'est une bagatelle qui n'est pas sans mérite du côté du mécanisme; mais les effets n'en paraissent si merveilleux que par la hardiesse de Pidée, et par l'heureux choix des moyens employés pour faire illusion.\"\n\nThe strongest and best armed loadstone was allowed to be placed on the machine by any of the spectators.\n\nAs the inventor of this admirable piece of mechanism hath not yet thought proper to communicate to the public the means by which it is actuated, it is in vain for any, except those who are exquisitely skilled in mechanics, to form conjectures concerning them.—Many other curious imitations of the human body, as well as that of other animals, have been exhibited, though none of them equal to the last mentioned one. See the article Automaton.\n\nANDROLEPSY, in Grecian Antiquity, an action allowed by the Athenians against such as protected persons guilty of murder. The relations of the deceased were empowered to seize three men in the city or house whither the malefactor had fled, till he were either surrendered, or satisfaction made some way or other for the murder.\n\nANDROMACHE, the wife of the valiant Hector, the mother of Astyanax, and daughter of Eetion king of Thebes in Cilicia. After the death of Hector and the destruction of Troy, she married Pyrrhus; and afterwards Helenus the son of Priam, with whom she reigned over part of Epirus.\n\nANDROMEDA, in Astronomy, a northern constellation, behind Pegasis, Cassiopeia, and Perseus. It represents the figure of a woman chained; and is said to have been formed in memory of Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, and wife of Perseus, by whom she had been delivered from a sea monster, to which she had been exposed to be devoured for her mother's pride. Minerva translated her into the heavens.\n\nThe stars in the constellation Andromeda, in Ptolemy's catalogue are 23, in Tycho's 22, in Bayer's 27, in Mr Flamsteed's no less than 84.\n\nANDROMEDA, the name of a celebrated tragedy of Euripides, admired by the ancients above all the other compositions of that poet, but now lost.\n\nIt was the representation of this play, in a hot summer day, that occasioned that epidemic fever, or phrensy, for which the Abderites are often mentioned, where-in they walked about the streets, rehearsing verses, and acting parts of this piece. See ABERA.\n\nANDROMEDA, or Marth Cyclus. See Botany Index.\n\nANDRON, in Grecian Antiquity, denotes the apartment in houses designed for the use of men; in which sense it stands opposed to Cyanecum.—The Greeks also gave their dining-rooms the title of andron, because the women had no admittance to feasts with the men.\n\nANDRONA, in ancient writers, denotes a street, or public place, where people met and conversed together. In some writers, androna is more expressly used for the space between two houses; in which sense, the Greeks also use the term androna, for the way or passage between two apartments.\n\nANDRONA is also used, in ecclesiastical writers, for that part in churches destined for the men. Anciently it was the custom for the men and women to have separate apartments in places of worship, where they performed their devotions afundra; which method is still religiously observed in the Greek church. The androna, or androna, was in the southern side of the church, and the women's apartment on the northern.\n\nANDRONICUS I. Comnenus, emperor of the East, was the son of Isaac, and grandson of Alexius Comnenus. Naturally endowed with a vigorous habit of body, and a firm mind, active, temperate, martial, and eloquent, he shines as one of the most conspicuous characters of his age. Following the bent of his inclination, he attended the Roman army in their retreat; but in their march through Asia Minor, wandering into the mountains, he fell into the hands of some Turkish hussars, was carried to the sultan, and remained his prisoner. But regaining his liberty, both his virtues and vices soon recommended him to the favour of his cousin Manuel, the reigning emperor. The vicious heart of Andronicus manifested itself clearly in maintaining a licentious correspondence with Eudocia the emperor's niece, while the emperor himself lived in public incest with her sister Theodora. His martial spirit gained him a considerable command in Cilicia, where he laid siege to Mophaelia; but by a successful fall of the enemy, he was obliged to raise the siege, and retire in considerable disorder. Infamed with a desire of revenging the infamy of their sister in his blood, the brothers of Eudocia made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Andronicus at midnight in his tent; but being providentially awakened, he defended himself with surprising bravery, forced his way through his enemies, and escaped in safety. Afterwards engaging in a treasonable correspondence, with the emperor of Germany and the king of Hungary, he was arrested, and thrown into confinement. He remained in this state about twelve years, and after several repeated attempts to escape, he at last effected his purpose; and fled for refuge to the court of the great duke of Russia. The cunning of Andronicus soon found means to regain his favour with the emperor Manuel; for having exerted all his influence, he succeeded in obtaining the Russian prince, to engage to join his troops with those of Manuel, in the invasion of Hungary. Accordingly, on account of his important service, he obtained a free pardon from the emperor, and after an expedition to the Danube, returned with him to Constantinople. He again fell under the displeasure of the emperor, by refusing to take an oath of allegiance to the prince of Hungary, his intended son-in-law, and consequently presumptive heir to the crown, and was thereupon, returned to his former command in Cilicia. While residing here, his powerful address captivated the heart of Philippa, daughter of the Latin prince of Antioch, and sister to the empress Maria; and in her company, he spent his time in all the amusements that country could afford, till the emperor's resentment put a stop to their correspondence. Thus circumstanced, he collected a band of adventurers, and undertook a pilgrimage to the holy land, where by his insinuating turn of mind, he so far succeeded in gaining the favour of the king and clergy, as to be invested with the lordship of Berytus on the coast of Phoenicia. In this neighbourhood, Theodora the beautiful widow of Baldwin, king of Jerusalem, and nearly allied in blood to him, resided. The personal accomplishments and address of Andronicus captivated her heart, and she became\ncame the third victim to his artful seduction, and lived publicly as his concubine. Still pursued by the emperor with unabating resentment, he was forced to take refuge in Damascus, and then in several other places in the east, till at length he settled in Asia Minor. While residing here, he made frequent incursions into the province of Trebizond, and seldom returned without success. After several occurrences, Theodora was made captive, by the governor of Trebizond, along with her two children, and sent to Constantinople; upon which Andronicus implored and obtained pardon. He acted the affected penitent in such a manner, that he again ingratiated himself into the favours both of the church and state; but was sent to dwell at Oenoë, a town situated on the Euxine coast.\n\nIn the year 1177 Manuel died, and was succeeded by his son Alexius II., a youth about twelve or fourteen years of age, without wisdom or experience, by which the ambition of Andronicus was again called into action. A civil war having been occasioned, by the misconduct of the empress in Constantinople, the public mind was directed towards Andronicus, as the only person whose rank and accomplishments could restore the public tranquillity. Incited by the patriarchs and patricians, he marched towards Constantinople, which he entered, took possession of the palace, confined the empress, confirmed her minister to death, assumed the office of protector, put to death many persons of distinction, tried and executed the queen, on a charge of corresponding with the king of Hungary, and vowed fidelity to the young emperor upon his coronation, at the same time teaching the necessity of an experienced ruler, to avenge the evils that threatened the empire; upon which his adherents called out \"Long live Alexius and Andronicus, Roman emperors.\" While he affected reluctance, he was elevated to a partnership in the empire. This conjunction of the royal power was soon dissolved, by the murder of the unfortunate Alexius. The body of the deceased being brought into his presence, striking it with his foot, he said, \"Thy father was a knave, thy mother a whore, and thyself a fool.\"\n\nHaving arrived at the dignity of sole emperor, A.D. 1183, he continued to sway the sceptre, with a mixture of justice and bounty towards his subjects at large, but those whom he feared or hated he governed with the most cruel tyranny. The noble families that were either put off, or exiled by him, were all allied to the Comneni. Some of these were engaged in revolt; and the public calamity was heightened, by an invasion of the Sicilians, in which they took and sacked Thessalonica. A rival without merit, and a people without arms, at last overturned his throne. A descendant from the first Alexius, in the female line, named Isaac Angelus, being singled out by Andronicus, as a victim to his cruelty, he with courage and resolution defended his life and liberty, flew his executioner, fled to the church of St Sophia, and there took refuge with several of his friends. Isaac was instantly raised by the populace, from a sanctuary to a throne. When this event took place, Andronicus was absent from Constantinople; but he no sooner heard of it, than he with the utmost speed returned. Upon his arrival there, he found himself deserted by all, and was seized, and dragged in chains before the new emperor. All the eloquence he displayed was of no avail; for Isaac delivered him into the hands of those whom he had injured, and for the space of three days, he endured with uncommon patience, all the insults and torments that were inflicted upon him. In the midst of these he would frequently cry out, \"Lord have mercy upon me,\" and, \"why will you break a broken reed?\" At last, two friendly or furious Italians, plunging their swords into his body put a period to his life. His death in the 73rd year of his age, terminated the dynasty of the Comneni. (Gen. Bing.)\n\nAndronicus of Cyrrhus, an Athenian astronomer, built at Athens an octagon tower, with figures carved on each side, representing the eight principal winds. A brass Triton at the summit, with a rod in its hand, turned round by the wind, pointed to the quarter from whence it blew. From this model is derived the custom of placing weathercocks on steeples.\n\nANDROPHAGI, in Ancient Geography, the name of a nation whose country, according to Herodotus, was adjacent to Scythia. Their name, compounded of two Greek words, signifies man-eaters. Herodotus does not inform us whether their manner of subsisting corresponded with their name; whether they were so savage as to eat human flesh. See the article Anthrophagi. They are represented, however, as the most barbarous and fierce of all nations. They were not governed by laws: the care of their cattle was their chief employment. Their dress was like that of the Scythians; and they had a language peculiar to themselves.\n\nANDROPOGON, or MAN'S-BEARD. See Botany Index.\n\nANDROS, one of the ancient Cyclades, lying between Tenedos and Euboea: being one mile distant from the former, and ten from the latter. The ancients gave it various names, viz. Cauros, Laifa, Nonagria, Epagris, Antandros, and Hydrufa. The name of Andros it received from one Andreas, appointed, according to Diodorus Siculus, by Rhadamantus, one of the generals, to govern the Cyclades, after they had of their own accord submitted to him. As to the name of Antandros, the same author tells us, that Acanthus the son of Æneas, being taken prisoner by the Pelagians, gave them this island for his ransom, which on that account was called Antandros, or \"delivered for one man.\" The name of Hydrufa it obtained in common with other places well supplied with water. It had formerly a city of great note, bearing the same name, and situated very advantageously on the brow of a hill, which commanded the whole coast. In this city, according to Strabo and Pliny, stood a famous temple dedicated to Bacchus. Near this temple, Mutianus, as quoted by Pliny, tells us, there was a spring called the gift of Jupiter; the water of which had the taste of wine in the month of January, during the feast of Bacchus, which lasted seven days. The same author adds, that the waters, if carried to a place whence the temple could not be seen, lost their miraculous taste. Pausanias makes no mention of this spring; but says, that, during the feast of Bacchus, wine flowed, or was at least by the Andrians believed to flow, from the temple of that god. The priests, no doubt, found their account in keeping up this belief, by conveying, through secret conduits, a great quantity of wine into the temple.\n\nThe Andrians were the first of all the islanders who joined...\njoined the Persians at the time Xerxes invaded Greece; and therefore Themistocles, after the victory at Salamis, resolved to attack the city of Andros, and oblige the inhabitants to pay large contributions for the maintenance of his fleet. Having landed his men on the island, he sent heralds to the magistrates, acquainting them, that the Athenians were coming against them with two powerful divinities, persuation and force; and therefore they must part with their money by fair means or foul. The Andrians replied, That they likewise had two mighty deities who were very fond of their island, viz. poverty and impaffibility; and therefore could give no money. Themistocles, not satisfied with this answer, laid siege to the town; which he probably made himself master of and destroyed, as we are informed by Plutarch, that Pericles, a few years after, sent thither a colony of 250 Athenians. It was, however, soon retaken by the Persians; and, on the overthrow of that empire by Alexander the Great, submitted to him, along with the other islands. On his death it sided with Antigonus, who was driven out by Ptolemy. The successors of the last mentioned prince held it to the times of the Romans; when Attalus, king of Pergamus, besieged the metropolis at the head of a Roman army; and, having taken it, was by them put in possession of the whole island. Upon the death of Attalus, the republic claimed this island, as well as his other dominions, in virtue of his last will.\n\nAndros is now subject to the Turks; and contains a town of the same name, with a great many villages. It is the most fruitful island in all the Archipelago, and yields a great quantity of silk. There are said to be about 12,000 inhabitants, besides those of the villages Ami and Amoldeos, who are about two hundred, have a different language and customs, and are called Albanese. There are seven monasteries, a great number of churches, and a cathedral for the bishops of the Roman Catholic persuasion; but most of the inhabitants are of the Greek communion. The Jesuits had a house and a church in this island; but they were forced to quit them long ago. Here are some delightful valleys; but the air is bad, and the water of the city worse. The women would be agreeable enough, if it was not for their drels, which is very unbecoming; for they stuff out their clothes without the least regard to their shape: but the Albanese women make a much better appearance. The peasants make wicker-baskets, wherewith they supply the greatest part of the Archipelago. They have all sorts of game in the woods and mountains, but know not how to take them for want of guns. Their principal food is goats flesh; for there is no fish to be met with on their coasts. When they are sick, they are obliged to let the disease take its natural course, having neither physician nor surgeon on the island. A cad, assisted by a few of the principal persons of the island, has the management of civil affairs, and his residence is in the castle: an aga, who presides over the military force, lives in a tower without the city. About two miles from the present town are still to be seen the ruins of a strong wall with the fragments of many columns, chapiters, bases, broken statues, and several inscriptions, some of which mention the senate and people of Andros, and the priests of Bacchus; from which it is probable that this Andros was the site of the ancient city.

Now Bardsey, distant about a mile from the coast of North Wales.\n\nANDROSACE. See Botany Index.\n\nANDRUM, a kind of hydrocele, to which the people of Malabar are very subject.—Its origin is derived from the bad quality of the country waters, impregnated with certain salts, the source of most other diseases that affect the Malabarians. Its signs, or symptoms, are an erysipelas of the scrotum, returning every new moon, by which the lymphatics, being eroded, pour a serous saline humour into its cavity. The drum is incurable; those once seized with it have it for life; but it is not dangerous, nor very troublesome to those used to it; though sometimes it degenerates into a hydrocarcose. The method of prevention is by a heap of sand fetched from a river of the province Mangatti, and fired in the wells. This is practised by the rich. As to the cure, they have only a palliative one; which is by incision, or tapping, and drawing off the water from the scrotum, once in a month or two.\n\nANDYAL, downy sow-thistle. See Botany Index.\n\nANDUXAR, a city in the province of Andalusia, in Spain, seated on the Guadalquivir. It is pretty large, indifferently rich, and defended by a good castle.

The word is Greek, ἀνεκδοτα, q. d. things not yet known or hitherto kept secret. Procopius gives this title to a book which he published against Julianian and his wife Theodora; and he seems to be the only person among the ancients who has represented princes such as they are in their domestic relations.—Varillas has published Anecdotes of the House of Medicis.\n\nAnecdotes is also an appellation given to such works of the ancients as have not yet been published. In which sense, M. Muratori gives the name Anecdota Graeca to several writings of the Greek fathers, found in the libraries, and first published by him.—F. Martene has given a Thebaurus Anecdotarum Novus, in folio, 5 vols.\n\nANEE, in Commerce, a measure for grain, used in some provinces of France. At Lyons, it signifies also a certain quantity of wine, which is the load an ass can carry at once: which is fixed at 80 English quarts, wine measure.\n\nANEMOMETER,\nANEMOMETER, in Mechanics, implies a machine for measuring the force and velocity of the wind.\n\nVarious machines of this kind have been invented at different times, and by different persons. The following has been often experienced, and found to answer the intention.\n\nAn open frame of wood, ABCDEFGHI *, is supported by the shaft or arbor I. In the two cross-pieces HK, LM, is moved a horizontal axis QM, by means of the four sails ab, cm, Of, gh, exposed to the wind in a proper manner. Upon this axis is fixed a cone of wood, MNO; upon which, as the sails move round, a weight R, or S, is raised by a string round its surfaces, proceeding from the smaller to the larger end NO. Upon this larger end or base of the cone, is fixed a rocket wheel k, in whose teeth the click X falls, to prevent any retrograde motion from the depending weight.\n\nThe structure of this machine sufficiently shows that it may be accommodated to estimate the variable force of the wind; because the force of the weight will continually increase as the string advances on the conical surface, by acting at a greater distance from the axis of motion; consequently, if such a weight be added on the smaller part M, as will just keep the machine in equilibrium in the weakest wind, the weight to be raised, as the wind becomes stronger, will be increased in proportion, and the diameter of the cone NO may be so large in comparison to that of the smaller end at M, that the strongest wind shall but just raise the weight at the greater end.\n\nIf, for example, the diameter of the axis be to that of the base of the cone NO as 1 to 28; then, if S be a weight of one pound at M on the axis, it will be equivalent to 28 pounds when raised to the greater end; if therefore, when the wind is weakest, it supports one pound on the axis, it must be 28 times as strong to raise the weight to the base of the cone. If therefore a line of scale of 28 equal parts be drawn on the side of the cone, the strength of the wind will be indicated by that number on which the string rests.\n\nANEMONE, WIND-FLOWER. See Botany Index.\n\nSec. ANEMONE. Sec ANIMAL-FLOWER.\n\nANEMOSCOPE, a machine that shows either the course or velocity of the wind. (See also the article Wind Gauge.)\n\nThe machine which shows the course of the wind, or from what point of the compass it blows, consists of an index moving about an upright circular plate, like the dial of a clock, on which the 32 points of the compass are drawn instead of the hours. The index, which points to the divisions on the dial, is turned by a horizontal axis, having a trundle-head at its external extremity. This trundle-head is moved by a cog-wheel on a perpendicular axis; on the top of which a vane is fixed, that moves with the course of the wind, and puts the whole machine in motion. The whole contrivance is extremely simple; and nothing required in the construction, but that the number of cogs in the wheel, and rounds in the trundle-head, be equal; because it is necessary, that, when the vane moves entirely round, the index of the dial also make a complete revolution.—An anemoscope of this kind is placed in one of the turrets of the queen's palace. The anemoscope, calculated for indicating the force or velocity of the wind, is the same with what most writers call an anemometer; and we have accordingly described one of those machines under that article. We shall here add another, contrived by the late Mr Pickering, and published in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 473. This anemoscope is a machine four feet and a quarter high, consisting of a broad and weighty pedestal, a pillar fastened into it, and an iron axis of about half an inch diameter fastened into the pillar. Upon this axis turns a wooden tube; at the top of which is placed a vane, of the same materials, 21 inches long, consisting of a quadrant, graduated, and fitted with an iron rim, notched to each degree; and a counterpoise of wood, as in the figure, on the other. Through the centre of the quadrant runs an iron pin, upon which are fastened two small round pieces of wood, which serve as moveable radii to describe the degrees upon the quadrant, and as handles to a vellum or sail, whose pane is one foot square, made of canvas, stretched upon four battens, and painted. On the upper batten, next to the flood rim of the quadrant, is a small spring which catches at every notch corresponding to each degree, as the wind shall, by pressing against the sail, raise it up; and prevents the falling back of the sail, upon lessening of the force of the wind. At the bottom of the wooden tube, is an iron index, which moves round a circular piece of wood fastened to the top of the pillar on the pedestal, on which are described the 32 points of the compass. The figure of this machine is given on Plate XXXIII. fig. 3, where a is the pedestal; b, the pillar on which the iron axis is fitted; c, the circle of wood, on which are described the 32 points of the compass; d, the wooden tube upon its axis; f, the vellum; g, the graduated quadrant; h, the counterpoise of the vane. The adjoining figure represents the vellum, which takes off; a is the plane of the vellum; b, the spring; cc, the wooden radii; dd, the holes through which the pin in the centre of the quadrant goes. Its uses are the following:\n\n1. Having a circular motion round the iron axis, and being furnished with a vane at top and index at the bottom, when once you have fixed the artificial cardinal points, described on the round piece of wood on the pillar, to the same quarters of the heavens, it gives a faithful account of that quarter from which the wind blows. 2. By having a vellum or sail elevated by the wind along the arch of the quadrant to a height proportionable to the power of the column of wind pressing against it, the relative force of the wind, and its comparative power, at any two times of examination, may be accurately taken. 3. By having a spring fitted to the notches of the iron with which the quadrant is flood, the vellum is prevented from returning back upon the fall of the wind; and the machine gives the force to the highest blast, since the last time of examination, without the trouble of watching it.\n\nThe ingenious contriver of this machine tells us, that he carefully examined what dependence may be had upon it, during the storms of February 1743-4, and found that it answered exceedingly well; for that, in such winds as the sailors call violent storms, the machine had six degrees to spare for a more violent gust, before it comes to a horizontal position. It is certainly\nAnethum tainly to be depended upon in ordinary weather, the velum being hung so tenderly as to feel the most gentle breeze. There is however reason to fear, that the exposing the anemoscope to all winds for a continuance, must disorder it, especially irregular blasts and squalls. It may not therefore be amiss, in violent weather, for the observer to take the tube with its vane and velum in his hand, in order to know the force of the wind; and when he has finished his observations, to carry the machine into the house, till the violence of the storm is abated, when it may be replaced in its former situation.\n\nANETHUM, DILL and FENNEL. See Botany Index.\n\nANEURISM, in Surgery, a throbbing tumor, distended with blood, and formed by a dilatation or rupture of an artery. See Surgery Index.\n\nANGARI, or ANGARI, in Antiquity, denote public couriers, appointed for the carrying of messages. The ancient Persians, Budeus observes, had their ἀγαρίους ἀνεμοκεφάλους; which was a set of couriers on horseback, posted at certain stages or distances, always in readiness to receive the despatches from one, and forward them to another, with wonderful celerity, answering to what the moderns call postes, q.d. postes, as being posted at certain places or stages. The angari were also called by the Persians affandes; by the Greeks ἀγαρίους, on account of the long journeys they made in one day, which, according to Suidas, amounted not to less than 1500 stadia.\n\nANGARIA, in Roman Antiquity, a kind of public service imposed on the provincials, which consisted in providing horses and carriages for the conveyance of military stores and other public burdens. It is sometimes also used for a guard of soldiers, posted for the defence of a place. In a more general sense it is used for any kind of oppression or services performed through compulsion.\n\nANGAZYA, one of the Comora islands, lying between the north end of Madagascar and the coast of Zanguebar in Africa, from Lat. 10° to 15° S. It is inhabited by Moors, who trade with divers parts of the continent, in cattle, fruits, and other commodities of the island; which they exchange for calicoes and other cotton cloths. The houses here are built of stone, and lime made of calcined oyster shells; with which the walls and roof are plastered in a very elegant manner. The government of Angazya is a pure aristocracy; the island being subject to 10 lords, who have all the title of Sultan. The people are very careful of their women; never permitting strangers to see them, without permission from a sultan, or an order which the stranger brings with him. Many of them read and write Arabic with great facility; and some even understand Portuguese, which they learn from their intercourse with Mozambique, whither they trade in vessels of 40 tons burthen.\n\nANGIOTOMY, in Surgery, implies the opening a vein or artery, as in bleeding; and consequently includes both arteriotomy and phlebotomy.\n\nANGEL, a spiritual intelligent substance, the first in rank and dignity among created beings. The word angel is Greek, and signifies a messenger: the Hebrew אֵלֶּה signifies the same thing. The angels are in Daniel (chap. iv. ver. 13, &c.) called וְאֵלֶּה, or watchers, from their vigilance: for the same reason they are, in Angel. The remains we have of the prophecy attributed to Enoch, named Egregori; which word imports the same in Greek.\n\nAngels, therefore, in the proper signification of the word, do not import the nature of any being, but only the office to which they are appointed, especially by way of message or intercourse between God and his creatures; in which sense they are called the ministers of God, who do his pleasure, and ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation. That there are such beings as we call angels, that is, certain permanent substances, invisible and imperceptible to our senses, endowed with understanding and power superior to that of human nature, created by God, and subject to him as the Supreme Being; ministering to his divine providence in the government of the world by his appointment, and more especially attending the affairs of mankind; is a truth so fully attested by Scripture, that it cannot be doubted. Nay, the existence of such invisible beings was generally acknowledged by the ancient heathens, though under different appellations: the Greeks called them demons; and the Romans genii, or lares. Epicurus seems to have been the only one among the old philosophers who absolutely rejected them. Indeed, the belief of middle intelligences influencing the affairs of the world, and serving as ministers or interpreters between God and man, is as extensive as the belief of a God; having never, so far as we know, been called in question by those who had any religion at all.\n\nThe creation of angels is not indeed expressly mentioned by Moses in the first of Genesis, yet it is generally considered by judicious expositors as implied. The reason why the sacred historian is silent on this subject, is supposed by Berrington to be the natural proneness of the Gentile world, and even of the Jews, to idolatry. On this And it is thought, if they worshipped mere material Creation, elements, which was the case, much more might they be inclined to worship such superior and sublime beings as angels. But a better reason is perhaps given by other writers, viz. that this first history was purposely written principally for information concerning the visible world; the invisible, of which we know but in part, being referred for a better life.\n\nOn what day they were created has been matter of conjecture. It is a point on which learned men have differed. The Socinians, indeed, hold, says Bishop Hopkins, that it was long before the account given by Moses: but it must have been within the six days of creation; because, as we are informed, that within this space God made heaven and earth, and all things that are therein. All the writers that we have seen on this subject, think they were included in the first day's work, when the heavens were framed.\n\nIt has been thought by some persons, that the words of Job, \"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy,\" militate against the creation of angels within the six days. About the meaning of these words, however, expositors are not agreed; but admitting that they refer literally to angels, Dr Lightfoot, Caryl, and others, see no difficulty in the passage. The Doctor thinks they were created on the first day, with the heavens; and that they were spectators of God's works in the other parts of creation,\nand praised and magnified the Lord for his works all along; finging and shouting when God laid the foundation of the temple, Ezra iii.\n\nOn a subject of this nature, it would be imprudent to indulge a spirit of conjecture: Scripture is the only standard by which truth and error can be tried, and to this we must ultimately appeal. In is acknowledged that Moles has not expressly mentioned angels by name; yet, as we have remarked, their creation is undoubtedly implied; for the heavens must include all that are in them; and therefore it is that the divine penman says, in the conclusion of his narrative, \"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.\" Of the host of heaven, the angels must form a considerable part; they are expressly called the heavenly host, and the armies of heaven, Dan. iv. 35. Luke ii. 13.\n\nAnd if divine authority be admitted as decisive, the reasons adduced by Jehovah for the sanctification of a sabbath, demonstrate that they did not exist previous to the creation of the heavens. It is, surely, asserted with propriety, that in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is. Similar to which is a declaration of the divine historian relating to the same fact.—\"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made,\" Gen. ii. 3. Now if angels existed prior to the six days of creation, the language of Moles is far from being accurate and intelligible; and especially when it is considered that the obscurity might have been removed by adding, \"from all the work which God had then created and made.\"\n\nBut if angels were created before the heavens, where could they exist? For, as the learned Gill has remarked, \"though angels have no bodies, and so are not in place circumscriptively; yet as they are creatures, they must have an habitation, somewhere in which they are definitely; so that they are here, and not there, and much less everywhere: Now where was there an habitation, a somewhere, for them to exist in, before the heavens and the earth were made? It is most reasonable, therefore, to conclude, that as God prepared an habitation for all the living creatures before he made them; as the sea for the fishes, the expanse, or air, for the fowls, and the earth for men and beasts; so he made the heavens first, and then the angels to dwell in them.\"\n\nThat this was the fact, will appear very evident, if the words of Moles be impartially considered. \"In the beginning (says he), God created the heavens and the earth;\" which words must refer to either the beginning of creation or of time: if to the former, and angels previously existed, the language is neither intelligible nor conformable to truth; if to the latter, the difficulty remains; for what is time but the measure of created existence. \"Time (says the judicious Charlock *) began with the foundation of the world: before the beginning of the creation and the beginning time, there could be nothing but eternity; nothing but what was uncreated, that is, nothing but what was without beginning.\" But if angels were in a pre-existent state, the historian's language is unaccountably strange and inaccurate: for if the phrase in the beginning, which is remarkably emphatical, refer to the creation of the heavens and the earth only, they are unhappily expressed; to expressed, indeed, as to convey no meaning to those who consider words as the vehicle of thought, and as intended to express clearly to others the meaning of the writer. For the natural obvious sense is as follows—\"In the beginning of the creation of the heavens and the earth, God created the heavens and the earth;\" which language is not only a departure from that perspicuity and precision which distinguish all his narrations, but entirely irrational and absurd.\n\nThat the words in the beginning refer to the first creation, cannot be doubted, if it be remembered, that Jehovah himself founds a claim to eternity on this very ground: \"Before the day was, I am he.\"— \"Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hast formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God,\" If. xliii. 13. Pf. ix. 2. See also Prov. viii. 22, 23, &c. Now there could be no propriety in this kind of reasoning, if angels or any other creature existed before the creation of the world, because all claims to eternity from such premises would apply even to Gabriel as well as to Jehovah. \"Before the world was,\" is, in Scripture language, a phrase always expressive of eternity; and on this principle the evangelist John affirms the divinity of Jesus Christ in the first chapter of his history. For this purpose he alludes to the words of Moles, and introduces his divine matter to notice by celebrating the first act of his creative power. \"In the beginning (says he) was the Word;\" that is, Dr Doddridge remarks §, before the foundation of the world, or the first production of any creature: and Dr Sherlock § is Expositor, clearly of opinion, that the words, in their most common acceptation, signify the first creation of all things, and are a demonstration of the divinity of Christ. Of the same mind was Dr Owen. He says, 129. See that if the phrase beginning does not absolutely and for all Whitmally express eternity, yet it doth a pre-existence to the by on whole creation, which amounts to the same thing; for if nothing can pre-exist before all creatures but the nature of God, which is eternal, unless we suppose a creature before the creation of any. But what is meant by this expression is fully declared by other passages of Scripture: \"I was set up from everlasting, before the beginning, or ever the earth was;\" \"Glory thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was;\" both which passages not only explain the text, but undeniably prove the pre-existence of Christ the Son of God. It should be remembered, that, in the passage under consideration, Trinity, the evangelist's argument for the divinity of Jesus Christ p. 43, is grounded on his pre-existing the creation of the world; and it is consequently affirmed, that he is the creator of all things: but if angels had a being before the period to which he alludes, the argument loses all its force, and no more proves the divinity of Christ than the divinity of an angel (a).\n\nIf, therefore, the words of Moles be impartially viewed\n\n(A) Of this Socinus and his followers were aware; and therefore artfully endeavoured to evade the force of the\nviewed in their obvious natural meaning, and compared with other passages of Scripture that relate to the same subject, we have no doubt but every unprejudiced mind will perceive, that as he intended to give a summary history of the creation of all things both in heaven and in earth, he has done it in language intelligible and accurate, and in terms sufficiently explicit.\n\nAs to the nature of these beings, we are told, that they are spirits; but whether pure spirits divested of all matter, or united to some thin bodies, or corporeal vehicles, has been a controversy of long standing. Not only the ancient philosophers, but some of the Christian fathers, were of opinion, that angels were clothed with ethereal or fiery bodies, of the same nature with those which we shall one day have when we come to be equal to them. But the more general opinion, especially of later times, has been, that they are substances entirely spiritual, though they can at any time assume bodies, and appear in human or other shapes.\n\nThat the angelical powers and abilities vastly excel those of man, cannot be denied, if we consider, that their faculties are not clogged or impeded, as ours are, by any of those imperfections which are inseparable from corporeal being: so that their understandings are always in perfect vigour; their inclinations regular; their motions strong and quick; their actions irresistible by material bodies, whose natural qualities they can control, or manage to their purposes, and occasion either blessings or calamities, public or private, here below; instances of which are too numerous to mention.\n\nBesides their attendance on God, and their waiting and executing of his commands, they are also presumed to be employed in taking care of mankind and their concerns: and that every man had such a tutelar or guardian angel, even from his birth, was a firm belief and tradition among the Jews; and our Saviour himself seems to have been of the same sentiment. The heathens were also of the same persuasion, and thought it a crime to neglect the admonitions of so divine a guide. Socrates publicly confessed himself to be under the direction of such an angel, or demon, as several others have since done. And in this tutelar genius of each person they believed his happiness and fortune depended. Every genius did his best for the interest of his client; and if a man came by the worst, it was a sign the strength of his genius was inferior to that of his opponent, that is, of an inferior order; and this was governed by chance. There were some genii, whose ascendancy was so great over others, that their very presence entirely disconcerted them; which was the case of that of Augustus in respect of that of Mark Anthony; and for the same reason, perhaps, some persons have wit, and speak well, when others are absent, in whose presence they are confounded, and out of countenance. The Romans thought the tutelar genii of those who attained the empire, to be of an eminent order; on which account they had great honours shown them. Nations and cities also had their several genii. The ancient Persians so firmly believed the ministry of angels, and their superintendence over human affairs, that they gave their names to their months, and the days of their month; and assigned them distinct offices and provinces: and it is from them the Jews confess to have received the names of the months and angels, which they brought with them when they returned from the Babylonish captivity. After which, we find they also assigned charges to the angels, and in particular the patronage of empires and nations; Michael being the prince of the Jews, as Raphael is supposed to have been of the Persians.\n\nThe Mahometans have so great a respect for the angels, that they account a man an infidel who either denies their existence, or loves them not. They believe them to be free from sin, enjoying the presence of God, to whom they are never disobedient: that they have subtle pure bodies, being created of light; and have no distinction of sexes, nor do they need the refreshment of food or sleep. They suppose them to have different forms and offices: That some adore God in several postures; others sing his praises, and intercede for men; some carry and encompass his throne; others write the actions of men, and are assigned guardians to them.\n\nAs the numbers of these celestial spirits are very great, it is likewise reasonable to believe that there are several orders and degrees among them; which is also confirmed by Scripture; whence some speculative men have distributed them into nine orders, according to the different names by which they are there called; and reduced those orders into three hierarchies, as they call them; to the first of which belong seraphim, cherubim, and thrones; to the second, dominions, virtues, and powers; and to the third principalities, archangels, and angels. They imagine farther, that there are some who constantly reside in heaven; others who are ministers, and sent forth, as there is occasion, to execute the orders they receive from God by the former. The Jews reckon but four orders or companies of angels, each headed by an archangel; the first order being that of Michael, the second of Gabriel, the third of Uriel, and the fourth of Raphael; but though the Jews believe them to be four, yet it seems there were rather seven. The Persians also held, there were subordinate degrees among the angels.\n\nAlthough the angels were originally created perfect, of the far good, and obedient to their Maker's will, yet some of ten angels, them sinned, and kept not their first estate, but left their habitation; and so, of the most blest and glorious, became the most vile and miserable of all God's creatures. They were expelled the regions of light, and cast down to hell, to be reserved in everlasting chains under darkness, until the day of judgment. With heaven they lost their heavenly disposition, which delighted once in doing good and praising God; and fell into a settled rancour against him, and malice against\n\nthe apostle's reasoning, by interpreting the phrase in the beginning either in a figurative sense, or as referring to the beginning of John the Baptist's ministry. We will only subjoin, that we do not remember to have seen any writer deviate from the primary obvious meaning of the passage, who had not some hypothesis to support inimical to truth.\nAngel against men: their inward peace was gone; all desire of doing good departed from them; and, instead thereof, revengeful thoughts and despair took possession of them, and created an eternal hell within them.\n\nWhen, and for what offence, these apostate spirits fell from heaven, and plunged themselves into such an abyss of wickedness and woe, are questions very hard, if not impossible, to be determined by any clear evidence of Scripture. As to the time, we are certain that it could not be before the fifth day of creation; because on that day it is said, \"God saw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good;\" but that it was not long after it is very probable, as it must have preceded the fall of our first parents. Some have imagined it to have been after; and that carnality, or lusting to converse with women upon earth, was the sin which ruined them: an opinion (a) built upon a mistaken interpretation of Scripture, as if angels were meant by the sons of God who are said to have begotten the mighty men of old on the daughters of men. Others have supposed, that the angels, being informed of God's intention to create man after his own image, and to dignify his nature by Christ's assuming of it, and thinking their glory to be eclipsed thereby, envied man's happiness, and so revolted; and with this opinion that of the Mahometans has some affinity; who are taught, that the devil, who was once one of those angels who are nearest to God's presence, and named Azazel, forfeited paradise for refusing to pay homage to Adam at the command of God. But on what occasionsoever it first showed itself, pride seems to have been the leading sin of the angels; who, admiring and valuing themselves too much on the excellence of their nature and the height of their station, came at length to entertain so little respect for their Creator, as to be guilty of downright rebellion and apostasy.\n\nIt is certain from Scripture, that these fallen angels were in great numbers, and that there were also some order and subordination preserved among them; one especially being considered as their prince, and called by several names, Beelzebub, Satan, or Samael by the Jews; Abdraman by the Persians; and Eblis by the Mahometans. Their constant employment it not only doing evil themselves, but endeavouring by all arts and means to seduce and pervert mankind, by tempting them to all kind of sin, and thereby bringing them into the same desperate state with themselves.\n\nAngel is likewise a title given to bishops of several churches. In this sense St Paul is understood by some authors, where he says, Women ought to be covered in the church, because of the angels. The learned Dr Prideaux observes, that the minister of the synagogue, who officiated in offering up the public prayers, being the mouth of the congregation, delegated by them as their representative, messenger, or angel, to speak to God in prayer for them, was therefore, in the Hebrew language, called the angel of the church; and from thence the bishops of the seven churches of Asia are, by a name borrowed from the synagogue, called the angels of those churches.\n\nAngel, in Commerce, the name of a gold coin formerly current in England. It had its name from the figure of an angel represented upon it, weighed four pennyweights, and was twenty-three and a half carats fine. It had different values in different reigns; but is at present only an imaginary sum, or money of account, implying ten shillings.\n\nAngel-Fish. See Squalus, Ichthyology Index.\n\nANGELIC, or Angelical, something belonging to, or that partakes of, the nature of angels. We say an angelical life, &c. St Thomas is styled the angelical doctor. The angelical salutation is called by the Romansis Ave Maria; sometimes simply angelus.\n\nAngelical Garment (Angelica vesicaria), among our ancestors, was a monkish garment, which laymen put on a little before their death, that they might have the benefit of the prayers of the monks. It was from them called angelical, because they were called angels, who by these prayers anima saluti succurrebant. Hence, where we read the phrase monachus ad succurrendum in our old books, it must be understood of one who had put on the habit when he was at the point of death.\n\nANGELICA. See Botany Index.\n\nANGELICS, Angelici, in Church History, an ancient sect of heretics, supposed by some to have got this appellation from their excessive veneration of angels; and by others, from their maintaining that the world was created by angels.\n\nAngelics is also the name of an order of knights, instituted in 1191, by Angelus Flavius Commenus emperor of Constantinople.\n\nAngelics is also a congregation of nuns, founded at Milan in 1534, by Louisa Torelli, countess of Guastalla. They observe the rule of St Augustine.\n\nANGELITES, in Ecclesiastical History, a sect of Christian heretics, in the reign of the emperor Anastasius, and the pontificate of Symmachus, about the year 494, so called from Angelium, a place in the city of Alexandria, where they held their first meetings. They were called likewise Severites, from one Severus, who was the head of their sect; as also Theodofians, from one\n\n(a) This opinion seems to have been originally occasioned by some copies of the Septuagint, which, in the days of St Austin, had in this place the angels of God. Lactantius supposes the angels, who were guilty of this enormity, had been sent down by God to guard and take care of mankind; and being endowed with free-will, were charged by him not to forfeit the dignity of their celestial nature, by defiling themselves with the corruptions of the earth; but that the devil at length enticed them to debauch themselves with women. He adds, that, not being admitted into heaven by reason of the wickedness into which they had plunged themselves, they fell down to the earth, and became the devil's ministers; but that those who were begotten by them, being neither angels nor men, but of a middle nature, were not received into hell, no more than their parents were into heaven. Hence arose two kinds of demons, celestial and terrestrial. These are unclean spirits, the authors of whatever evils are committed, and whose prince is the devil. From hence very probably proceeded the notions of Incubi, or demons who are supposed to have carnal knowledge of women.\nANGELO, Michael. There were five celebrated Italian painters of this name, who flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries; but the two most distinguished of them are these.—First, Michael Angelo Buonarotti, who was a most incomparable painter, sculptor, and architect, born in 1474, in the territory of Arezzo in Tuscany. He was the disciple of Dominico Ghirlandaio; and erected an academy of painting and sculpture in Florence, under the protection of Lorenzo di Medici; which, upon the troubles of that house, was obliged to remove to Bologna. About this time he made an image of Cupid, which he carried to Rome, broke off one of its arms, and buried the image in a place he knew would soon be dug up, keeping the arm by him. It was accordingly found, and sold to Cardinal St Gregory for an antique; until Michael, to their confusion and his own credit, discovered his artifice, and confirmed it by the deficient arm which he produced: it is rather unusual for the manufacturers of antiques to be so ingenious. His reputation was so great at Rome, that he was employed by Pope Sixtus to paint his chapel; and by the command of Pope Paul III., executed his most celebrated piece, The Last Judgment. He has the character of being the greatest designer that ever lived; and it is universally allowed that no painter ever undertook anatomy so well. He died immensely rich at Rome, in 1564.—Secondly, Michael Angelo de Caravaggio, born at that village in Milan, in 1569. He was at first no more than a bricklayer’s labourer; but he was so charmed with seeing some painters at work, that he immediately applied himself to the art; and made such progress in a few years, that he was admitted as the author of a new style of painting. It was observed of Michael Angelo Buonarotti, that he was incomparable in designing, but knew little of colouring; and of Caravaggio, that he had as good a gift in colouring as he had a bad one in designing. There is one picture of his in the Dominican church at Antwerp, which Rubens used to call his master. It is said of this painter, that he was so strangely contentious, that the pencil was no sooner out of his hand but his sword was in it. He died in 1609.\n\nANGELO, St., a small but strong town of Italy, in the Capitanata. There are several other towns and castles of the same name in Italy, and particularly the castle of St. Angelo at Rome. E. Long. 15° 36' N. Lat. 41° 43'.\n\nANGELOS, Los, a province of Mexico, the ancient republic of Tlaxcala, of which a city called Tlaxcala was once the capital. That city is now reduced to an inconsiderable village, and has given place to another called Puebla des los Angelos, or the city of Angels. It is situated in W. Long. 103° 12' and N. Lat. 19° 13'. It was formerly an Indian town; but in 1530 was entirely abandoned by the natives, on account of the cruelties of the Spaniards. A succeeding viceroy of Mexico, by a milder treatment, recalled them; and the town is now exceedingly rich and populous, so as even to vie with Mexico itself in magnificence. It is situated on the river Zacatula, in Angelot, a fine valley, about 25 leagues to the eastward of Mexico. In the middle is a beautiful and spacious square, from whence run the principal streets in direct lines, which are crossed by others at right angles. One side is almost entirely occupied by the magnificent front of the cathedral; while the other three consist of piazzas, under which are the shops of tradesmen. The city is the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Mexico, and we may form a judgment of the wealth of the place by the revenue of the cathedral and chapter, which amounts to 300,000 pieces of eight annually. It must be remembered, however, that in all polite countries the wealth of the laity by no means bears the same proportion to that of the clergy as in Britain. What contributes greatly to increase the riches of this province is, that here is situated the city of Vera Cruz, the natural centre of all the American treasures belonging to Spain. See Vera Cruz.\n\nANGELOT, an ancient English gold coin, struck at Paris, while under subjection to the English. It was thus called from the figure of an angel supporting the escutcheon of the arms of England and France. There was another coin of the same denomination struck under Philip de Valois.\n\nAngelot is also used in Commerce to denote a small, fat, rich sort of cheese, brought from Normandy. Skinner supposes it to have been thus called from the name of the person who first made it up in that form, and perhaps stamped it with his own name. Menage takes it to have been denominated from the resemblance it bears to the English coin called angelot. It is made chiefly in the Pays de Bray, whence it is also denominated angelot de Bray. It is commonly made in vats, either square or shaped like a heart.\n\nANGER, a violent passion of the mind, consisting in a propensity to take vengeance on the author of some real or supposed injury done the offended party.\n\nAnger is either deliberative or instinctive; and the latter kind is rash and ungovernable, because it operates blindly, without affording time for deliberation or foresight. Bishop Butler very justly observes, that anger is far from being a selfish passion, since it is naturally excited by injuries offered to others as well as to ourselves; and was designed by the Author of nature not only to excite us to act vigorously in defending ourselves from evil, but to interest us in the defence or rescue of the injured and helpless, and to raise us above the fear of the proud and mighty oppressor.\n\nNeither, therefore, is all anger sinful: hence the precept, \"Be ye angry and sin not.\"—It becomes sinful, however, and contradicts the rule of Scripture, when it is conceived upon slight and inadequate provocations, and when it continues long. It is then contrary to the amiable spirit of charity, which \"suffereth long, and is not easily provoked.\" Hence these other precepts, \"Let every man be slow to anger;\" and, \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"\n\nThese precepts, and all reasoning indeed upon the subject, suppose the passion of anger to be within our power: and this power consists not so much in any faculty we have of appeasing our wrath at the time (for we are passive under the smart which an injury or affront occasions, and all we can then do is to prevent its breaking out into action), as in so mollifying our minds\nminds by habits of just reflection, as to be less irritated by imprestions of injury, and to be sooner pacified.\n\nAs reflections proper for this purpose, and which may be called the fedatives of anger, the following are suggested by Archdeacon Paley in his excellent treatise Book III. of Moral and Political Philosophy.*—“The possibility of mistaking the motives from which the conduct that offends us proceeded; how often our offences have been the effect of inadvertency, when they were mistaken for malice; the inducement which prompted our adversary to act as he did, and how powerfully the same inducement has, at one time or other, operated upon ourselves; that he is suffering perhaps under a contrition, which he is ashamed, or wants opportunity, to confess; and how ungenerous it is to triumph by coldness or insult over a spirit already humbled in secret; that the returns of kindness are sweet, and that there is neither honour nor virtue nor use in resisting them—for some persons think themselves bound to cherish and keep alive their indignation, when they find it dying away of itself. We may remember that others have their passions, their prejudices, their favourite aims, their fears, their cautions, their interests, their sudden impulses, their varieties of apprehension, as well as we: we may recollect what hath sometimes passed in our own minds, when we have got on the wrong side of a quarrel, and imagine the same to be passing in our adversary’s mind now; when we became sensible of our misbehaviour, what palliations we perceived in it, and expected others to perceive; how we were affected by the kindness, and felt the superiority, of a generous reception and ready forgiveness; how persecution revived our spirits with our enmity, and seemed to justify the conduct in ourselves which we before blamed. Add to this, the indecency of extravagant anger; how it renders us, whilst it lasts, the scorn and sport of all about us, of which it leaves us, when it ceases, sensible and ashamed; the inconveniences and irrevocable misconduct into which our irascibility has sometimes betrayed us; the friendships it has lost us; the distresses and embarrassments in which we have been involved by it, and the fore repentance which on one account or other it always costs us.\n\n“But the reflection calculated above all others to allay that haughtiness of temper which is ever finding out provocations, and which renders anger so impetuous, is that which the gospel proposes; namely, that we ourselves are, or shortly shall be, suppliants for mercy and pardon at the judgment seat of God. Imagine our secret sins all disclosed and brought to light; imagine us thus humbled and exposed; trembling under the hand of God; casting ourselves on his compassion; crying out for mercy—imagine such a creature to talk of satisfaction and revenge, refusing to be entreated, disdaining to forgive, extreme to mark and to resent what is done amiss; imagine, I say, this; and you can hardly feign to yourself an instance of more impious and unnatural arrogance.”\n\nPhysicians and naturalists have recorded instances of very extraordinary effects of this passion. Borrichius cured a woman of an inveterate tertian ague, which had baffled the art of physic, by putting the patient in a furious fit of anger. Valeriola made use of the same means, with the like success, in a quartan ague. The same passion has been equally salutary to paralytic, gouty, and even dumb persons; to which last it has sometimes given the use of speech. Ettmuller gives divers instances of very singular cures wrought by anger; among others, he mentions a person laid up in the gout, who being provoked by his physician, flew upon him, and was cured. It is true, the remedy is somewhat dangerous in the application, when a patient does not know how to use it with moderation. We meet with several instances of princes to whom it has proved mortal; e.g., Valentinian the first, Wenceslaus, Matthias Corvinus king of Hungary, and others. There are also instances wherein it has produced the epilepsy, jaundice, cholera morbus, diarrhoea, &c. In fact, this passion is of such a nature, that it quickly throws the whole nervous system into preternatural convulsions, by a violent stricture of the nervous and muscular parts: and surprizingly augments not only the fistule of the heart and of its contiguous vessels, but also the tone of the fibrous parts in the whole body. It is also certain, that this passion, by the spasmodic stricture it produces in the parts, exerts its power principally on the stomach and intestines, which are highly nervous and membranous parts; whence the symptoms are more dangerous, in proportion to the greater confection of the stomach and intestines, with the other nervous parts, and almost with the whole body. The unhappy influence of anger likewise, on the biliary and hepatic ducts, is very surprising; since by an intense contraction of these, the liver is not only rendered irritable, but stones also are often generated in the gall-bladder and biliary ducts: these accidents have scarcely any other origin than an obstruction of the free motion and efflux of the bile, by means of this violent stricture. From such a stricture of these ducts likewise proceeds the jaundice, which in process of time lays a foundation for calculous concretions in the gall-bladder. Lastly, By increasing the motion of the fluid, or the spasms of the fibrous parts, by means of anger, a larger quantity of blood is propelled with an impetus to certain parts; whence it happens that they are too much distended, and the orifices of the veins distributed there opened. It is evident from experience, that anger has a great tendency to excite enormous hemorrhages, either from the nose, the aperture of the pulmonary artery, the veins of the anus; or in women, from the uterus, especially in those previously accustomed and disposed to such evacuations.\n\nANGERMANIA, or Angermanland, a province of Sweden, bounded on the north by Lapland and Bothnia, on the east by the gulf of Bothnia and Medelpadia, and on the west by Jemtli and Hermed. It is full of rocks, mountains, and forests; and there is one very high mountain called Scull. It has excellent iron works, and lakes abounding with fish.\n\nANGERMOND, a town of the duchy of Berg, in Germany, on the east side of the Rhine, subject to the Elector Palatine. E. Long. 6° 20'. N. Lat. 51° 10'.\n\nANGERONA, in Mythology, the name of a Pagan deity whom the Romans prayed to for the cure of the quinsy, in Latin, angina. Pliny calls her the goddess of silence and calmness of mind, who banishes all uneasiness and melancholy. She is represented with her mouth covered, to denote patience and refraining from complaints. Her statue was set up, and sacrificed to, in the temple of the goddess Volupia, to show\nANGERONALIA, in Antiquity, solemn feasts held by the Romans the 21st of December, in honour of Angeronia, or Angeronia, the goddess of patience and silence. Peltus and Julius Modestus, quoted by Macrobius, Saturn. Lib. I. cap. 10, derive the name from angina, \"quinsy;\" and suppose the goddess to have been thus denominated, because she presided over that disease.—Others suppose it formed from angor, \"grief, pain;\" to intimate that she gave relief to those afflicted therewith.—Others deduce it from angos, \"I press, I clothe,\" as being reputed the goddess of silence, &c.\n\nANGERS, a city of France, and capital of the former duchy of Anjou, now the department of the Maine and Loire. It is seated a little above the place where the Sarthe and the Loire lose themselves in the Maine. This last river divides the city into two equal parts, called the High and the Low Town. There are twelve parishes in the city, and four in the suburbs, which contain upwards of 36,000 inhabitants. Besides these, there are eight chapters, and a great number of convents for both sexes. Its greatest extent is along the declivity of a hill, which reaches quite down to the river side. The castle was built by St Louis, about the middle of the 13th century. The walls, towers, and numerous towers which yet subsist, evince its former magnificence; and its situation in the centre of the city, on a rock overhanging the river, conduces to give it an air of grandeur, though at present in decay. It was the principal residence of the kings of Sicily, as dukes of Anjou, but is now in a state of total ruin. The cathedral of Angers is a venerable structure; and although it has undergone many alterations in the course of ages since its construction, yet the architecture is singular, and deserves attention. Here lies interred with her ancestors the renowned Margaret, daughter of René king of Sicily, and queen of Henry VI. of England. She expired, after her many intrepid, but ineffectual, efforts, to replace her husband on the throne, in the year 1482, at the castle of Dampierre in Anjou. Near the church of St Michael is the handsome square in the city, from whence runs a street which has the name of the church. On one side of this street is the town-house; which has a fine tower, with a clock, raised upon an arch, which serves for a passage into the great square. There are two large bridges, which keep up a communication between the two parts of the city; and in the lesser of these there is another square, which serves for a market. The university of Angers was founded in 1398, and the academy of belles lettres in 1685. This last consists of thirty academicians. At the end of the suburb of Brefigny are the quarries of Angers, so famous for the fine flate which is got from thence. The pieces are of the thickness of a crown piece, and a foot square. All the houses in Angers are covered with this slate, which has gained it the appellation of the Black City. The walls with which King John of England surrounded it in 1214 remain nearly entire, and are of very great circumference. W. Long. o. 30. N. Lat. 47. 28.\n\nANGHIERA, a town of Italy, in the duchy of Milan, and capital of a county of the same name. It is seated on the eastern side of the lake Maggiore, in E. Long. 9. 5. N. Lat. 45. 42.\n\nANGINA, in Medicine, a violent inflammation of the throat, otherwise called quinsy. See Medicine Index.\n\nANGINA Pectoris. See Medicine Index.\n\nANGIOSPERMIA, in the Linnaean system of botany, the second order in the class didynamia. It consists of those plants, of that class, whose seeds are enclosed in a pericarpium. In this order the stigma is generally obtuse. These are the personati of Tournefort.\n\nANGITIAE LUCUS OR NEMUS, (Virg.), situated on the west side of the Lacus Fucinus. The inhabitants are called Lucenses, by Pliny. Angitia was sister of Medea, who taught antidotes against poison and serpents, according to Sil. Italicus. But Servius on Virgil says, that the inhabitants called Medea by this name for the same reason. The town is now called Luco.\n\nANGLE, the inclination of two lines meeting one another in a point. See Geometry.\n\nANGLE of Incidence, in Optics, the angle which a ray of light makes with a perpendicular to that point of the surface of any medium on which it falls; though it is sometimes understood of the angle which it makes with the surface itself.\n\nANGLE of Refraction now generally means the angle which a ray of light, refracted by any medium, makes with a perpendicular to that point of the surface on which it was incident; but has sometimes been understood of the angle which it makes with the surface of the refracting medium itself.\n\nANGLER, a person who practises the art of angling, whether as a diversion or otherwise. See the article Angling.\n\nANGLER, the English name of a species of lophus. See Lophus, Ichthyology Index.\n\nANGLES, an ancient German nation, originally a branch of the Suevi; who, after various migrations, settled in that part of Denmark, and duchy of Sleswick, which to this day is called Angel, and of which the city of Flensburg is the capital. Here they were known, even in the time of Tacitus, by the name of Anglii. The origin of this name is variously accounted for. According to Saxo-Grammaticus, they were called Anglii, from one Angulus, son to Humblus king of Denmark. Widifchind, a Saxon writer, will have them to be called Anglii, from an island in the corner or angle of the sea, which they conquered. Goropius derives their name from the Saxon word Angel or Engel, signifying a fish-hook; the Angles, like the other Saxon nations, being greatly addicted to piracy, and on that account being so named by the neighbouring nations; as if, like hooks, they caught all that was in the sea. To this nation the British ambassadors are said to have applied, when soliciting succours against the Scots and Picts. The Angles, therefore, came over in greater numbers than any other Saxon nation; and accordingly had the honour of giving the name of Anglia to England. See England.\n\nANGLESEY, ISLE OF, is the most western county of North Wales. It is 24 miles in length, 18 in breadth, and sends one member to parliament. It is separated from Caernarvonshire by a strait called Menai.\nAnglesey. Menai, and on every other side is surrounded by the sea. It is a fertile spot, and abounds in corn, cattle, flesh, fish, and fowls.\n\nAt Port Aethwy, the most general ferry into the island, there is a great passage of cattle. It is computed that the island sends forth annually from 12,000 to 15,000 head, and multitudes of sheep and hogs. It is also computed that the remaining flock of cattle is 30,000. In 1770 upwards of 90,000 bushels of corn were exported, exclusive of wheat. The improvement in husbandry has greatly increased since the suppression of smuggling from the Isle of Man; before that time every farmer was mounted on some high promontory, expecting the vessel with illicit trade; but since that period, he sets in earnest to industry and cultivation. Not but that the island was in the most remote times famous for its fertility: Mon, Mam Gymry, the Nursing mother of Wales, was a title it assumed even in the 12th century.\n\nThis island is divided into 74 parishes, of which most of the churches are situated near the shores. By an account given on the 13th of August 1563, there were 201 households, or families, in Anglesey; allowing five to a family, the whole number of inhabitants at that period was 10,050. In 1776, the number of houses in Anglesey was about 3956; allowing five persons to a family, the whole number of inhabitants was at that time 19,780; which wants only 340 of doubling the number of inhabitants in the intervening space. The chief town is Beaumaris.\n\nIn ancient times this island was called Mon, Mona or Mong. It was the great nursery of the religion of the Druids; being the residence of the grand druid, or chief pontiff, and consequently of all the learned doctors in that religion.\n\nMany ancient monuments of druidic fill remain in the island.—At Tre'r Dryw, or the habitation of the arch druid, are several mutilated remains, which have been described by Mr Rowlands. His Bryn Gwyn, or Brein Gwyn, or royal tribunal, is a circular hollow of 180 feet in diameter, surrounded by an immense agger of earth and stones, evidently brought from some other place, there not being any mark of their being taken from the spot. It has only a single entrance. This is supposed to have been the grand confabulary of the druidical administration.—Not far from it was one of the Gorfeddau, now in a manner dispersed, but which once consisted of a great copped heap of stones, on which sat aloft a druid, instructing the surrounding people multa de Decorum immortalium vit et potestate dis patare, et juventati tradunt; Cæs. Lib. 6.—Here were also the relics of a circle of stones, with the cromlech in the midst; but all extremely imperfect. Two of the stones are very large; one, which serves at present as part of the end of a house, is 12 feet 7 inches high, and 8 feet broad; and another 11 feet high, and 23 feet in girth. Some lesser stones yet remain. This circle, when complete, was one of the temples of the druids, in which their religious rites were performed. It is the conjecture of Mr Rowlands, that the whole of these remains were surrounded with a circle of oaks, and formed a deep and sacred grove: Jam per se roborum elegant lucos, neque ulla sacra fine ea fronde conficiunt; (Plin. Hist. Nat. xv. 44.)—Near this is Caer Leb, or the moated intrenchment; of a square form, with a double rampart, and broad ditch intervening, and a lesser on the outside. Within are foundations of circular and of square buildings. This Mr Rowland supposes to have been the residence of the arch druid, and to have given the name, Tre'r Dryw, to the township in which it stands. At Trev Wry are several faint traces of circles of stones, and other vestiges of buildings; but all so dilapidated, or hid in weeds, as to become almost formless. Bodruddin, or the habitation of the druids, Tre'r-Beirdld, or that of the bard, and Bodowyr, or that of the priests, are all of them hamlets, nearly surrounding the seat of the chief druid, composing the essential part of his suite. At the last is a thick cromlech, resting on three stones.\n\nThe shore near Porthamel, not far from hence, is famed for being the place where Suetonius landed, and put an end in this island to the druid reign. His infantry passed over in flat-bottomed boats, perhaps at the spot still called Pant yr Ycerphie, or the valley of Skiffs. His cavalry crossed partly by fording, partly by swimming. Of the conflict on this occasion we have the following animated description by Tacitus*: \"Annal. \"Stat pro litoro diversa acies, densa armis virifque, xiv. 39. intercursantibus feminis in modum furiarum, velle ferarii, criminis defectis, faces perferabant; druidæque circum, preces diras sublatis ad colum manibus fundentes. Novitate alçetus percuteere militem, ut quasi herentibus membris, immobile corpus vulneribus praebent. Dein cohortationibus ducis, et se ipse stimulantes, ne muliebre et fanaticum agmen pavererent, inferunt signa, sternuntque obvios et igni fuo involvent. Præsidium pothac impolitum vicis, exciftique luci, faui superstitionibus faciri. Nam eruore captivo adolere aras, et hominum fibris confunere deos fas habeant.\"—Thus Englished: \"On the shore stood a motley army in close array, and well armed; with women running wildly about in black attire with dishevelled hair, and like the furies brandishing their torches; surrounded by the druids, lifting up their hands to heaven, and pouring forth the most dreadful imprecations. The soldiery stood astonished with the novelty of the sight. His limbs grew torpid, and his body remaining motionless resigned to every wound. At length, animated by their leader, and rousing one another not to be intimidated with a womanly and fanatic band, they displayed their ensigns, overthrew all who opposed them, and flung them into their own fires. After the battle, they placed garlands in the towns, and cut down the groves consecrated to the most horrible superstitions: for the Britons held it right to sacrifice on their altars with the blood of their captives, and to consult the gods by the inspection of human entrails.\" There are no traces of any Roman works left in this country. Their stay was so short, that they had not time to form anything permanent.\n\nNear the ferry of Moel y Don appear the fine woods of Sir Nicholas Bayley, skirting the Menai for a considerable way. The wooded part of the island is on this side. It commences at Llanidan, and recalls the ancient British name of Anglesey, Ynyr Dywyll, or the Dark Island, on account of the deep shade of its groves; but at present it is (except in this part) entirely divested of trees; and the climate so adverse to their growth, that in most parts it is with great difficulty\nAnglesey, the gentry can raise a plantation round their houses.\n\nPlas Newydd, the seat of Sir Nicholas Bayley, lies close upon the water, protected on three sides by venerable oaks and ashes. The view up and down this magnificent river-like strait is extremely fine. The shores are rocky; those on the opposite side covered with woods; and beyond loom a long range of Snowdonian Alps. Here stood a house built by Gwenllian, a descendant of Cadrod Hardd. The mansion has been improved, and altered to a castellated form by the present owner.\n\nIn the woods are some very remarkable druidical antiquities. Behind the house are to be seen two vast cromlechs. The upper stone of one is 12 feet 7 inches long, 12 broad, and four thick, supported by five tall stones. The other is but barely separated from the first; it is almost a square, of five feet and a half, and supported by four stones. The number of supporters to cromlechs is merely accidental, and depends on the size or form of the incumbent stone. These are the most magnificent we have, and the highest from the ground; for a middle-sized horse may easily pass under the largest. In the lands of Llugwy, indeed, there is a most stupendous one of a rhomboidal form. The greatest diagonal is 17½ feet, the lesser 15, and the thicknesses three feet nine inches; but its height from the ground is only two feet: it was supported by several stones. The Welsh, who ascribe everything stupendous to our famous British king, call it Arthur's Quoit. In the woods at this place are some druidical circles nearly contiguous to each other.\n\nAt a small distance from Beaumaris, on the shore, stand the remains of Llanvaes, or the Friars. It was founded by Prince Llewelyn ap Jerwerth, and according to the general tradition of the country, over the grave of his wife Joan, daughter of King John, who died in 1237, and was interred on the spot. Here also were interred a son of a Danish king, Lord Clifford, and many barons and knights who fell in the Welsh wars. It was dedicated to St Francis, and consecrated by Howel bishop of Bangor, a prelate who died in 1249. The religious were Franciscans, or minor friars. Their church and house were destroyed, and their lands wasted, in the insurrection made soon after the death of Llewelyn, last Welsh prince, by his relation Madoc. Edward II, in consideration of their misfortunes, remitted to them the payment of the taxes due to him, which before the war were levied at the rate of £21 10s. These friars were strong favourites of Owen Glendwr. Henry IV, in his first march against Owen, plundered the convent, put several of the friars to the sword, and carried away the rest; but afterwards set them at liberty, made restitution to the place, but peopled it with English recluses. It possibly was again reduced to ruin: for Henry V, by patent, establishes here eight friars, but directs that only two should be Welsh. At the dissolution, Henry VIII, sold the convent and its possessions to one of his courtiers. They became in later days the property of a family of the name of White (now extinct), who built here a good mansion. It of late became, by purchase, the property of Lord Bulkeley. The church is turned into a barn, and the coffin of the princess Joan now serves for a watering trough.—A little farther is Castell Aber Llennawg, a small square fort, with the remains of a little round tower at each corner. In the middle stood a square tower. A fosse surrounds the whole. A hollow way is carried quite to the shore, and at its extremity is a large mound of earth, designed to cover the landing. This castle was founded by Hugh Lupus earl of Chester, and Hugh the Red earl of Shrewsbury, in 1098, when they made an invasion, and committed more savage barbarities on the poor natives, especially on one Kenred a priest, than ever stained the annals of any country. Providence sent Magnus king of Norway to revenge the cruelties. His coming was to all appearance casual. He offered to land, but was opposed by the earls. Magnus stood in the prow of his ship, and calling to him a most expert Bowman, they at once directed their arrows at the earl of Shrewsbury, who stood all armed on the shore. An arrow pierced his brain through one of his eyes, the only defenceless part. The victor, seeing him spring up in the agonies of death, insultingly cried out in his own language, Leite loupe, \"Let him dance.\" This fort was garrisoned so lately as the time of Charles I, when it was kept for the parliament by Sir Thomas Cheadle; but was taken by Colonel Robinson in 1645.\n\nAbove Llandona is a high hill, called Burid Arthur, or Arthur's round table; the true name was probably Din, or Dinas Sulwy: for a church immediately beneath bears that of Llanwihangle Din-Sulwy. On the top of it is a great British fort, surrounded by a double row of rude stones with their sharp points upward; and in some parts the ramparts are formed of small stones. In the area are vestiges of oval buildings; the largest is formed with two rows of flat stones set on end. There had been the temporary habitations of the poachers. It had been a place of vast strength: for, besides the artificial defence, the hill slopes steeply on all sides, and the brink next to the ramparts is mostly precipitous. It is worth while to ascend this hill for the sake of the vast prospect; and intermixture of sea, rock, and alps, most strangely great.\n\nAbout two miles south of Plas Gwyn, the seat of Paul Panton, Esq., was situated Pennymynydd, once the residence of the ancestors of Owen Tudor, second husband to Catherine of France, queen dowager of Henry V; \"who being (as honest Halle informs us) young and lusty, following more her own appetite than friendly confail, and regarding more her private affection than her open honour, took to husband privily (in 1428) a goodly gentleman, and a beautiful person, garnished with many godly gifts both of nature and of grace, called Owen Teuther, a man brought forth and come of the noble lignage and ancient lyne of Cadwaladar, the last kyngge of the Brittonnes.\" The match, important in its consequences, restored the British race of princes to this kingdom: These reigned long, under the title of the House of Tudor; the mixed race having ceased on the accession of Henry VII, grandson to our illustrious countryman. The remains of the residence of the Tudors are, the door of the gateway; part of the house, and the great chimney-piece of the hall, are to be seen in the present farm-house. Some coats of arms, and dates of the building or time of repairs, are to be seen, with the initial letters of the names of the owners. The Tudors, for a considerable space before the extinction of their race, assumed the name of Owen. Richard\nAnglesey was the last male of the family, and was sheriff of the county in 1657. Margaret, heiress of the house, married Coningby Williams, Esq., of Glan y Gors, in this island, who possessed it during his life. It was afterwards sold to Lord Bulkeley, in whose descendant it still continues. In the church of Penmynydd is a most magnificent monument of white alabaster, removed at the dissolution from the abbey of Llanvaes to this place; probably erected in memory of one of the House of Tudor, who had been interred there. On it is the figure of a man in complete armour, a conic helm, and mail guard down to his breast; his lady is in a thick angular hood; their feet rest on lions, and their heads are supported by angels.\n\nOn the western point of the bay is a small cape, flat at top, called Caffell Mawr, joined to the land by a low isthmus. It is composed of limestone, which is carried to distant parts in small vessels, which lie in a small channel near the rock, and by their numbers frequently enliven the view. Roman coins have been found in this neighbourhood; but there are no vestiges of there having been any station. Beyond Caffell Mawr, on the shore, are vast blocks of black marble filled with shells, coralloids, and fungitae.\n\nAt Tryclwyn mountain is the most considerable body of copper ore perhaps ever known. The part of Tryclwyn which contains it is called Parys mountain. Of this mountain, and the works there carried on, we have the following very curious and particular account by Mr Pennant*:\n\n\"The external aspect of the hill is extremely rude, and rises into enormous rocks of coarse white quartz. The ore is lodged in a basin, or hollow, and has on one side a small lake, on whose waters, dilatable as those of Avernus, no bird is known to alight. The whole aspect of this tract has, by the mineral operations, assumed a most savage appearance. Suffocating fumes of the burning heaps of copper arise in all parts, and extend their baneful influence for miles round. In the adjacent parts vegetation is nearly destroyed: even the mosses and lichens of the rocks have perished; and nothing seems capable of resisting the fumes but the purple melia grafis, which flourishes in abundance. It is thought that the ore had been worked in a very distant period. Vestiges of the ancient operations appear in several parts, carried on by trenching, and by heating the rocks intensely, then suddenly pouring on water, so as to cause them to crack or scale; thus awkwardly supplying the use of gunpowder. Pieces of charcoal were also found, which proves that wood was made use of for that purpose. As the Britons imported all works in brats, it is certain that the Romans were the undertakers of these mines; and it is very probable that they sent the ore to Caerhêl to be melted, the place where the famous cake of copper was discovered. They might likewise have had a melting hearth in this island; for a round cake of copper was discovered at Llanvaethill, a few miles from this place. Its weight was fifty pounds, and it had on it a mark resembling an L.\n\n\"In the year 1762, one Alexander Frazer came into Anglesey in search of mines. He visited Parys mountain; called on Sir Nicholas Bayley, and gave him flattering an account of the prospect, as induced him to make a trial, and sink shafts. Ore was discovered; but before any quantity could be gotten, the mines were overpowered with water. In about Anglesey two years after, Messrs. Roe and Co. of Macclesfield applied to Sir Nicholas for a lease of Penrhyn ddu mine in Caernarvonshire; with which they were, much against their wills, compelled to take a lease of part of this mountain, and to carry on a level, and make a fair trial. The trial was accordingly made; ore was discovered; but the expenses overbalanced the profits. They continued working to great loss; and at length determined to give the affair up. They gave their agent orders for that purpose: but he, as a final attempt, divided his men into ten several companies, of three or four in a partnership, and let them sink shafts in various places, about eight hundred yards eastward of a place called the Golden Venture, on a presumption that a spring, which issued from near the place, must come from a body of mineral. His conjecture was right; for in less than two days they met with, at the depth of seven feet from the surface, the solid mineral, which proved to be that body which has since been worked to such advantage. The day that this discovery was made was March 2, 1768: which has ever since been observed as a festival by the miners. Soon after this discovery, another adventure was begun by the reverend Mr Edward Hughes, owner of part of the mountain, in right of his wife Mary Lewis of Llys Dulas; so that the whole of the treasure is the property of Sir Nicholas Bayley and himself. The body of copper ore is of unknown extent. The thickness has been ascertained in some places by the driving of a level under it, several years ago, and it was found to be in some places twenty-four yards. The ore is mostly of the kind called by Cronfield, Pyrites cupri flavo viridefusca, and contains vast quantities of sulphur. It varies in degrees of goodness; some of it is rich, but the greater part poor in quality.\n\n\"There are other species of copper ore found here. Of late a vein of the Pyrites cupris grifescens of Cronfield, about seven yards wide, has been discovered near the west end of the mountain: some is of an iron grey, some quite black; the first contains fifteen lb. of copper per 100 lb. the last forty. An ore has been lately found, in form of loose earth, of a dark purplish colour; and the best of it has produced better than eight in twenty. Some years ago, above thirty pounds of native copper were found in driving a level through a turbergy; some was in form of mols, some in very thin leaves.\n\n\"It is quarried out of the bed in vast masses; is broken into small pieces; and the most pure part is sold raw, at the rate of about 3l. to 6l. per ton, or sent to the melting-houses of the respective companies to be melted into metal. Mr Hughes has great furnaces of his own at Ravenhead near Liverpool, and at Swaney in South Wales. An idea of the wealth of these mines may be formed, by considering that the Macclesfield Company have had at once fourteen thousand tons of ore upon bank, and Mr Hughes thirty thousand.\n\n\"The more impure ore is also broken to the size of about hens eggs; but in order to clear it from the quantity of sulphur with which it abounds, as well as other adventitious matter, it must undergo the operation of burning. For that purpose it is placed between two parallel walls of vast length; some kilns are 20, others...\"\nAnglesey, 40, and 50 yards in length; some 10, others 20 feet wide, and above four feet in height. The space between is not only filled, but the ore is piled many feet higher, in a convex form, from end to end. The whole is then covered with flat stones, closely luted with clay; and above is placed a general integument of clay, and small rubbish of the work, in order to prevent any of the fumes from evaporating. Of late, some kilns have been constructed with brick arches over the ore, which is found to be the best method of burning. Within these few years, attempts are made to preserve the sulphur from flying away; and that is done by flues made of brick whose tops are in form of a Gothic arch, many scores of feet in length. One end of these opens into the beds of copper which are to be burnt. These beds are set on fire by a very small quantity of coal, for all the rest is effected by its own phlogiston. The volatile part is confined, and directed to the flues; in its course the sulphureous particles strike against their roofs, and fall to the bottom in form of the finest brimstone; which is collected and carried to adjacent houses, where it is melted into what is called in the shops \"stone-brimstone.\"\n\n\"The beds of copper, thus piled for burning, are of vast extent. Some contain 400 tons of ore, others 2000. The first require four months to be completely burnt, the last near ten. Thus burnt, it is carried to proper places to be dressed, or washed, and made merchantable. By this process the ore is reduced to a fourth part in quantity, but considerably improved in quality; and by this means the water is strongly or richly impregnated with copper, which is dissolved by the acid quality of the sulphur; and is collected or precipitated again by iron in the above-described pits. The iron is all dissolved.\n\n\"But a far richer produce of copper is discovered from the water lodged in the bottom of the bed of ore, which is highly saturated with the precious metal. This is drawn up, either by means of windmills or windmills, to the surface, and then distributed into numbers of rectangular pits 36 feet long, some pits more some less, 12 to 15 feet broad and 20 inches deep. To speak in the language of the adept, Venus must make an afflatusion with Mars, or this solution will have no effect. In plain English, a quantity of iron must be immersed in the water. The kind of iron is of no moment; old pots, hoops, anchors, or any refuse, will suffice; but of late, for the convenience of management, the adventurers procure new plates, four feet long, one and a half broad, and three quarters of an inch thick. These they immerse into the pits. The particles of copper instantly are precipitated by the iron, and the iron is gradually dissolved into a yellow ochre. Great part of it floats off by the water, and sinks to the bottom. The plates, or the old iron (as it happens), are frequently taken out, and the copper scraped off; and this is repeated till the whole of the iron is consumed. The copper thus procured differs little from native copper, and is prized accordingly, and sold for prices from £5. to £4. a ton.\n\n\"This discovery is far from new: it has been practised long in the Wicklow mines in Ireland; and above a century in those of Hern-grundt in Hungary, where it is called \"siment copper.\" The waters of the Hungarian mines are much more strongly impregnated with copper than those of Parys mountain. The first ef. Anglesey, feels its operation in 12 or about 20 days, the last requires two months. Horse shoes, iron made in shape of hearts, and other forms, are put into the foreign waters; and when perfectly transmuted, are given as presents to curious strangers.\n\n\"The ore is not got in the common manner of mining, but is cut out of the bed in the same manner as stone is cut out of a quarry. A hollow is now formed in the solid ore open to the day, and extends about 100 yards in length, about 40 yards in breadth, and 24 yards in depth. The ends are at present undermined, but supported by vast pillars and magnificent arches, all metallic; and these caverns meander far under ground. These will soon disappear, and thousands of tons of ore be gotten from both the columns and roofs. The sides of this vast hollow are mostly perpendicular, and access to the bottom is only to be had by small steps cut in the ore; and the curious visitor must trust to them and a rope, till he reaches some ladders, which will conduct him the rest of the descent. On the edges of the chasms are wooden platforms, which project far; on them are windlasses, by which the workmen are lowered to transact their business on the face of the precipice. There suspended, they work in mid air, pick a small place for a footing, cut out the ore in vast masses, and tumble it to the bottom with great noise. In such situations they form caverns, and there appear safely lodged till the rope is lowered to convey them up again. Much of the ore is blasted with gunpowder, eight tons of which are said to be annually used for the purpose.\n\n\"Nature hath been profuse in bestowing her mineral favours on this spot: for above the copper ore, and not more than three quarters of a yard beneath the common soil, is a bed of yellowish greasy clay, from one to four yards thick, containing lead ore, and yielding from 600 to 1000 pounds weight of lead from one ton; and one ton of the metal yields not less than 57 ounces of silver. Mixed with the earth, are frequently certain parts of the colour of cinnabar. Whether these are symptomatic of the sulphureous artificial silver ores or of quicksilver, I will not pretend to decide. Something interferes with the successful melting of this earth in the grate; insomuch that it has not yet been of that profit to the adventurers which might reasonably be expected from the crucible assays of it, and they have at this time about 8000 tons on bank undisturbed. This place has been worked for lead ore, in very distant times. In the bottom of the pool was found an ancient melting hearth of grit stone, and several bits of melted lead, of about four inches in length, two in breadth, and half an inch thick.\n\n\"These works have added greatly to the population of the island; for about 1500 persons are employed; who, with their families, are supposed to make near 8000 persons, getting their bread from these mines. The little village of Anlweh, the port of the place, is increasing fast, and the market grows considerable. At the season of the greatest work, Mr Hughes's men alone receive for many weeks 200l. in one week, and 150l. in another, merely for subsistence. The port is no more than a great chasm between two rocks, running far into land, and dry at low water;\nAngling into which floops run, and lie secure to receive their lading.\"\n\nNear Kemlyn bay is a quarry of marble, common to this place, some parts of Italy, and to Corsica, and known in the shops by the name of Verde di Corsica. Its colours are green, black, white, and dull purple, irregularly disposed. In different blocks one or other of the colours is frequently wanting; but among the green parts are often found narrow veins of a most elegant and silky white alabaster. It is a compound species of marble; part is calcareous, and may be acted on by aquafortis. The green parts partake of the nature of jasper. It is apt to be interfered by small cracks, or by alabaster veins, therefore incapable of taking a high polish. This quarry lies on the lands of Monachty, in the parish of Llan-Fair-Ynghornwy; and it is found again in the isle of Skerries, off this parish. Neither the quarry nor the alabaster are at present in use. In Rhoconlyn parish, a green amethystus, or brittle alabaster, is met with in great plenty in a green marble similar to the above; but by reason of the inflexible quality of its fibres not applicable to the same use.\n\n**ANGLING**, among sportsmen, the art of fishing with a rod, to which are fitted a line, hook, and bait. See **Fishing-Rod**, **Fishing-Hook**, **Fishing-Fly**.\n\nThe angler's first business is to attract the fish to the place intended for angling. The method of doing this, in standing waters, by throwing in grains, chopped worms, and the like, is well known; but the chief difficulty is in running rivers and brooks. The method, in this case, is to prepare a tin box capable of holding some hundreds of worms, bored on all sides, and full of holes of such a size as they may be just able to crawl out at; there must be a plummet fastened to this box to sink it, and a line to draw it back at pleasure; in this case it is to be thrown into the water in a proper place, above which the angler may stand under cover. The worms will slowly and gradually crawl out of this box, and the fish will be gathered about to feed on them; the baited hook is to be thrown in higher up and carried down by the stream. If this method do not bring the fish about the place in a little time, there is reason to suspect that some pike lies lurking thereabout, and deters them: in this case, it is proper to throw out a baited hook, and he will generally be taken; after this the attempt will succeed.\n\nWhen the angler takes his stand, he is to shelter himself under some tree or bush, or stand so far from the brink of the water that he can only discern his float; as the fish are timorous and easily frightened away. The angling rod must be kept in a moderate state, neither too dry nor too moist: in the first case, it will be brittle; in the other, rotten. When pastes are used, it is proper to mix a little tow with them, and rub them over with honey; finally, a small anointing with butter is of great use to keep them from washing off the hook. The eyes of any fish that is taken are an excellent bait for almost any other kind of fish. The best way of angling with the fly is down the river, and not up; neither need the angler ever make above half a dozen of trials in one place, either with fly or ground bait, when he angles for trout: by that time the fish will either offer to take, or refuse the bait and not stir at all.\n\nIn a pond, the best place for the angler to take his stand is usually that where the cattle go up into water: in rivers, if breams are fished for, it should be in the deepest and most quiet places; it cells, under the banks of rivers that hang over; perch are to be expected in clean places, where the stream is swift; and chub in deep shaded holes: roach are mostly found where the perch are, and trout only in swift and clear streams. Places where there are many weeds, or old stumps of trees, harbour fish in great numbers, and they usually bite freely there; but there is danger of entangling the line, or fastening the hook to the weeds. In case of this accident, recourse is to be had to a ring of lead, of about six inches round, fastened to a small pack-thread: this ring is to be thrust over the rod, and let fall into the water. It will defend to the place where the hook is entangled; and then, by pulling the pack-thread gently, the hook will be soon disengaged, or at the worst it can only be broke off near the end of the line; whereas, when this is not employed, the rod itself is sometimes broken, or the line nearer its upper end.\n\nDeep waters are best for angling in, for the fish do not love to be disturbed by wind and weather. The openings of sluices and mill dams always bring fish up the current to seek for the food which is brought with the stream; and angling in these places is usually successful.\n\nThe best season is from April to October; for, in very cold stormy weather, the fish will not bite; the best times of the day are from three till nine in the morning, and from three in the afternoon till sunset. In an easterly wind, there is never much sport for the angler; the southerly winds are the best for his purpose, and a warm but lowering day is most of all to be chosen; a gentle wind, after a sudden shower, to disturb the water, makes a very good opportunity for the angler: the cooler the weather in the hottest months, the better; but in winter, on the contrary, the warmer the day the better. A cloudy day, after a bright moonlight night, is always a good day for sport; for the fish do not care for going after prey in the bright moonshine, and are therefore hungry the next morning.\n\nThose who are fond of angling might save themselves some fruitless trouble by observing when small fish in a jar take or refuse food. See Fish.\n\nThe several methods of angling for salmon, trout, carp, tench, perch, pike, dace, gudgeons, roach, flounder, &c., may be seen under the article Fishing.\n\n**ANGLO-CAVINISTS**, a name given by some writers to the members of the church of England, as agreeing with the other Calvinists in most points except church government.\n\n**ANGLO-SAXON**, an appellation given to the language spoken by the English Saxons; in contradiction from the true Saxon, as well as from the modern English.\n\n**ANGUS, THOMAS**, an English priest, well known for the singularity of his opinions, and several little tracts which he wrote in the 17th century. He went by several names. Mr Baillet says his true name was White; but that he used to disguise it under that of Candidus, Albus, Bianchi, and Ricbworth; but he was most known in France by the name of Thomas Anglus.\nDes Cartes generally called him Mr Vitae. He passed some time in most countries of Europe; but his longest stay was at Rome and Paris. When he was in England, he lived a considerable time in the family of Sir Kenelm Digby; and seems to have had a great esteem for the opinions of this gentleman, as may be seen in his writings, particularly in the Preface to his Latin work concerning the Institutions of the Peripatetic Philosophy, according to the hypothesis of Sir Kenelm. He was a great advocate for the Peripatetic philosophy. He attempted even to make the principles of Aristotle subservient to the explaining the most impenetrable mysteries of religion; and with this view he engaged in the discussion of predestination, free will, and grace. Mr Baillet says, \"What he wrote upon this subject resembles the ancient oracles for obscurity.\" In such abstruse points as we have mentioned, he was much embarrassed; and, by giving too great scope to his own thoughts, he pleased neither the Molinists nor Jansenists. He is allowed, however, to have been a man of an extensive and penetrating genius. On the 10th of June 1658, the congregation of the Index Expurgatorius at Rome condemned some treatises of Thomas Aquinas. The doctors of Douay censured also 22 propositions extracted from his Sacred Institutions. He published his Supplicatio populativa justitiae, in opposition to their censure; wherein he complains that they had given him a vague undetermined censure, without taxing any particular proposition. He died some time after the restoration of Charles II., but in what year is uncertain.\n\nANGOLA, a city of Chili in South America, situated in W. Long. 72° 5'. S. Lat. 37° 36'.\n\nANGOLA, a kingdom on the western coast of Africa, lying, according to the most probable accounts, between Lat. 8° 30' and 16° 21'. S. forming a coast of upwards of 480 miles; but how far it extends from west to east, has never been exactly determined. Angola Proper is bounded on the north by the river Dande, which separates it from Congo; and on the south by the Cuanza, by which it is separated from Benguela. This last, however, is now included in the kingdom of Angola, having been conquered by its monarchs, though it still retains the name of kingdom, and is included in the dimensions we have just now given. The air here is very hot and unwholesome, and the country mountainous; there being but few plains to be met with in it, except on the sea coast, and between the huge ridges of mountains.\n\nThat part of the kingdom which we have distinguished by the name of Angola Proper, was subject to the kings of Congo in the year 1484, when the Portuguese first discovered the country: but how long it had been so before that time, is not known; the inhabitants being utterly destitute of chronology, and having no other way of distinguishing past events, but by saying they happened in such a king's reign. Neither, though Angola became a distinct kingdom since its discovery by the Portuguese, is it known with more certainty at what time that revolution happened; or whether the Portuguese were not concerned in afflicting the viceroy of the king of Congo, who governed the province of Angola, to set up for himself.\n\nAll accounts agree, that this kingdom was founded by one Ngola or Angola, from whom it took its name. According to the tradition of the country, this Ngola was a smith, and the inventor of that trade, in which he had been instructed by the demons of the country. Tradition in consequence of this, he became exceeding rich, not concerning in gold, silver, or shell money, which were not at that time in use, but in corn, cattle, and fruits, which were then exchanged in traffic. The country being not long after visited by a grievous famine, Ngola generously relieved his distressed countrymen, and saved the lives of some thousands. In gratitude for this generosity, he was unanimously chosen king; and hence the smith's trade is reckoned among the royal arts of Angola.\n\nAccording to other accounts, which can be more authentic, who, having become powerful by the reduction of several of the neighbouring states, was induced to set up for himself. Dreading, nevertheless, the power of his old master, he chose to send him the usual tribute and presents annually, till he reigned himself firmly seated on the throne, and had secured it to his descendants. His measures were greatly facilitated by the wars which the king of Congo was then engaged in with the Gia-gas, a barbarous nation in the neighbourhood. These made such a powerful inroad into his dominions that he was glad to ask assistance from Ngola; not as a subject, but as a friend and ally. This was readily granted; and the two monarchs continued ever after sending presents and assistance to each other, and encouraging a mutual commerce between their subjects.\n\nNgola lived to a great age, highly respected by his subjects, and in alliance with the king of Congo and the Portuguese, whose numerous settlements on the coast had made them become very powerful. According to the custom of the country, he had many wives and concubines. By his chief favourite he had three daughters, Zunda Rianga, Tumba Rianga, and another whose name is unknown. Towards the latter part of his life, the king's chief care was to secure the crown to the eldest of these; for which purpose he consulted his beloved queen, who encouraged him in the design with all the eloquence in her power. By her advice, he sent for his lieutenant-general, a favourite slave, whom he had created viceroy over the whole kingdom, to acquaint him with his resolution. The artful minister did not fail to applaud his design, though his intention was to defraud the princes, and seize the throne for himself. He accordingly took the opportunity, one day, when that princes and the whole court were employed in sowing their lands, to spread a report that the Angolic enemies had entered the kingdom, and were destroying everything with fire and sword. In this confusion, the treacherous viceroy conducted the three princesses to the royal palace; and acquainting Ngola with the pretended danger, urged him to betake himself to a speedy flight. The frightened monarch, unable to stir with age, desired his minister to take the most proper means for his safety: whereupon, being a stout young fellow, he takes his majesty on his back, and carries him into a neighbouring wood; where he sooner had him in a convenient place, than he stabbed him with a dagger. This stratagem was too shallow to remain long concealed; the murderer was quickly discovered, and many of the nobles rose in arms against him; but finding his party too strong to be opposed, they were at last obliged to submit, and suffer him.\nhim quietly to ascend the throne, upon his publicly declaring that he had not seized it but with a view of securing it to the princess Zunda Riangola.\n\nTo this princess the usurper palliated his conduct in the best manner he could; and he had art enough to disguise her resentment so effectually, that he never discovered the smallest occasion for jealousy. At last, his sudden death gave Zunda an opportunity of ascending the throne peaceably; when she behaved with such moderation and justice as to gain the love and affection of all her subjects. Her jealous temper prevented her from marrying; and, by giving too much way to it, she came at last to dread as rivals the two sons of her youngest sister Tumba, and to form designs against their life. To accomplish her purposes, she ordered them to be brought to court, pretending to have them educated under her own eye. This was declined for some time; but at length the queen prevailed so far as to have the eldest sent to her; whom she no sooner got into her power, than she caused him to be massacred, with all his attendants; only one escaping, all covered with wounds, to carry the dreadful news to the princess and her husband.\n\nOn hearing of this bloody act, the afflicted parents immediately rallied forth at the head of all their vassals. They were waited for by Queen Zunda at the head of a numerous army; but no sooner did her soldiers perceive the parents of the deceased prince, than they immediately abandoned the queen to their resentment. Tumba immediately rushed upon her father, and stabbed her to the heart; after which, she commanded her entrails to be taken out, and thrown into the hole in which her son's body had been cast. Upon this Tumba was crowned queen of Angola, and invited her husband to participate with her in the management of public affairs. This offer he was too wise to accept; and Tumba, upon his refusal, resigned the crown into the hands of her surviving son, named Angola Chilivagni. He proved a great and wise prince, extending his dominions by conquest, and gaining the love of his subjects by the moderation and equity of his government. He was succeeded by one of his younger sons, named Dambi Angola; who no sooner ascended the throne, gola a cruel than he put all his brethren to death, left they should unite in favour of the eldest. The rest of his reign proved conformable to such a beginning. He was a monster of cruelty, avarice, lewdness, and perfidy. Death, however, in a short time, happily delivered his subjects from this tyrant; who, notwithstanding his infamous life, was buried with the greatest magnificence; and a mound was erected over his grave, containing, according to the custom of the country, of a prodigious number of human victims which had been sacrificed to his ghost. Dambi Angola was succeeded by Ngola Chilivagni, a warlike and cruel prince. He conquered many nations, and made the most dreadful incursions into the kingdom of Congo, along the rivers of Danda, Lucalla, Zanda, and Coanza; whose waters were often tinged with the blood of thousands whom he massacred in his excursions. Notwithstanding these butcheries, Ngola Chilivagni showed such generosity to those who readily submitted to him, that he was sure to conquer, not only wherever he came, but wherever he seemed to direct his forces. At last, as if weary of conquest, he planted a tree on the banks of the Coanza, about eight leagues from Loanda San Paulo, as a boundary to his ravages. This tree the Portuguese called Ifandé, or Ifandaura; and afterwards erected a fortress near it.\n\nThe same folly and insolence which took place in the fancies breast of Alexander the Great, on account of his rapid himself a conquests, soon puffed up the mind of this petty African tyrant. Because he had conquered and ravaged some of the neighbouring countries, and brought under his subjection a few cowardly barbarians; he first fancied himself invincible, and then that he was a god. He demanded the same adoration and respect that was paid to other deities; and with this demand his subjects were servile enough to comply. This pretended deity, however, was forced to submit to the fate of other mortals, and died without leaving a successor behind him.\n\nOn the decease of Ngola Chilivagni, the states elected Ngingha-Angola-Chilombo-Kickafanda, great nephew to Queen Tumba's husband, as his successor. He proved such a rapacious and cruel tyrant, that his subjects universally wished for his death; which, luckily for them, soon happened. He was interred with the usual pomp and solemnities, particularly that of having a whole hecatomb of human victims sacrificed upon his grave. His son Bandi Angola, who succeeded him, proved yet a greater tyrant than his father; so that he soon became intolerable to his subjects. A general revolt ensued, in which his subjects called in the cannibal Giagás to their assistance. These immediately poured in like a band of hungry dogs hastening to feed upon a carcass; and having defeated and devoured the forces of the tyrant, besieged him in an inaccessible mountain; where, not being able to come at him, they resolved to reduce him by famine. Bandi Angola applied to the Quellé by king of Congo for assistance. As it was the interest of that prince to hinder the ravenous Giagás from entering into the Angolic dominions, whence they could easily pass into his own, he did not hesitate to grant the Portuguese, of whose valour he had a high opinion, and of whom he entertained a great number at his court, to march to the assistance of the king of Angola. The command of the army was given to one of the most experienced Portuguese officers; who, depending more on the handful of Europeans he had under his command than on the Congolese, attacked the rebels, though greatly superior in number; and having utterly defeated them, restored the king of Angola to his throne.\n\nThis essential piece of service so endeared the Portuguese to Bandi Angola, that he took them into his service, and even into his council. Their general became the king's great favourite of the king, but much more so of his daughter daughter, who conceived a violent passion for him. Unfortunately for them both, the amours were carried on with so little precaution on her part, that the king's general quickly discovered it; and immediately formed a resolution of exterminating the Portuguese all at once. Such violent measures, however, could not be concerted privately but the princess got some intelligence of it; and having apprised her lover of his danger, he immediately withdrew into Congo, taking with him as many of his countrymen as he conveniently could. The king of Congo expressed such strong resentment against Bandi\nBandi Angola for his ingratitude, that the Portuguese general would have probably prevailed upon him to declare war against Angola, had he not been obliged to defend his own dominions against a neighbouring prince who then made an invasion. This afforded that general a fair pretence of asking leave to return home; promising to come with such reinforcements as would enable the king of Congo to revenge himself for the affront put upon him by the Angolic monarch. His real intention, however, was, to give the king of Portugal an opportunity of seizing upon the kingdom of Angola.\n\nOn his return to Lisbon, the Portuguese general having laid his plan before the king, it was so well relished, that an armament was ordered to be fitted out, well furnished with every necessary for building fortresses, &c., and a sufficient number of men. The wind proving favourable all the way back, the Portuguese soon arrived safe at Loanda San Paulo; whence the general despatched a messenger to acquaint the king of Congo with his arrival, and to make him some rich presents. These were no sooner gone than the admiral sailed up the Coanza; and, landing without opposition in the kingdom of Angola, set about erecting a fortress in a convenient situation, which was completed in a few days.\n\nThe king being informed of the return of the Portuguese, and of their fortifying themselves on advantageous ground, gathered together a numerous army; but his forces, though upwards of 100,000 in number, were utterly defeated by the Portuguese; vast numbers killed, and many more carried into slavery. The admiral now ravaged the whole country, putting all to fire and sword, and making himself master of every advantageous spot of ground. The king, however, had still the good luck to escape all the stratagems that were laid for him; and once more got safe to his inaccesible fortress.\n\nAll this time Bandi Angola had himself tyrannized, and allowed his favourites to tyrannize, in such a manner, that his subjects were become no less weary of his government than when they formerly revolted. Being now exasperated beyond measure at the calamitous war of which he had been the occasion, they formed a design of putting an end to his life; and in order to draw him out of his retreat, where he wallowed in all manner of debauchery, they had recourse to the following stratagem: A deputation was sent, acquainting him with the revolt of one Cuculo Cabasso; who, at the head of a numerous band, committed the most cruel ravages. They besought his majesty, either to levy a sufficient number of troops, and march in person against him, or to allow them to arm themselves against him. The credulous king complied with this last proposal; and granted them leave to raise what forces might be thought necessary. Four days after, notice was sent to the king, that his subjects had attacked the rebels, and had been repulsed with loss; but that, if his majesty would but condescend to animate them with his presence, the sight of him would inspire them with such courage, that they would assuredly prove victorious. This had the desired effect; and the king set out a few days after, without any other precaution than his own guards, to head his army which was encamped on the banks of the Lucalla. He no sooner appeared in view than all the chief officers came out to meet him; and having, under pretence of paying their respects, gradually separated him from his guards, they fell upon him and dispatched him at once.\n\nBandi Angola was succeeded by his son Ngola Bandi, whose mother had been a slave, and whose title to the crown was consequently disputable, according to the laws of the country. Of this the new king being cruelly well apprised, thought proper to begin his reign by the new murdering every person who had opposed his election. He began with the Tendula, or commander of the king's rear guard; who, by his office, is the chief of the electors, and the person who governs the kingdom during the interregnum. Him he ordered to be put to death, with all his family. These were followed by the principal officers of his father's court; all his concubines, together with their parents and near relations, whom he caused to be butchered; together with his half-brother, his father's son by a favourite concubine, and then but an infant. He did not spare even the son of his foster Zingha Bandi, whom she had by one of her paramours. The interest of his sister had contributed greatly to raise this tyrant to the throne; and his ingratitude, with the murder of her son, so exasperated her, that she swore to be revenged on him in the same way.\n\nThe Portuguese were the next objects of his resentment. They he so much dreaded on account of their valour and policy, that he immediately declared war, and resolved not to lay down his arms till he had exterminated them to the last man, or driven them totally out of his dominions. His rashness, however, cost him dear. Myriads of the Angolic troopers were overthrown by a handful of Portuguese; and the king himself was forced to fly, first into the island of Chiconda in the river Coanza, and then into the deserts of Oacco. Here his conquerors, out of great clemency, allowed him to live among the wild beasts, without any other sufferance than what the deserts afforded. He had the misfortune also to lose his queen and two sisters Cambi and Fungi, who were taken prisoners by the Portuguese, but honourably treated.\n\nThe king being informed of this, sent an embassy to treat of their ransom and an exchange of prisoners. The proposal was readily agreed to; and the princesses were sent back, laden with presents. The king, however, refused to perform his part of the agreement, and thereby plunged himself into still greater difficulties. A new Portuguese viceroy being arrived about this time, Ngola was quite at a loss how to excuse the non-performance of his part of the treaty. At last he sent his daughter Zingha, as an embassy, to the viceroy. Having consented, but without forgetting her resentment, she set out, as plenipotentiary for the king of Angola, with a magnificent retinue; was received with all the honour due to her rank, and lodged in a splendid palace prepared for her.\n\nAt the first audience Zingha had of Don John (the Her high Portuguese viceroy), she was greatly surprised to find herself seated on an elbow chair prepared for him to sit upon, and for herself only a rich tapestry spread on the floor, with a velvet cushion embroidered with gold, and placed over against the chair of state. Dissembling her displeasure, however,\nAngola, however, she beckoned one of the ladies of her retinue, commanded her to lay herself down on her elbows and knees upon the carpet, and sat herself upon her back during the whole time of the audience. She behaved with such address and dignity, as to gain the admiration of the whole council. A proposal was made of entering into an alliance offensive and defensive with the king of Angola, provided he acknowledged himself the vassal of the king of Portugal, and submitted to pay a yearly tribute. To this Zingha replied, that such conditions were indeed fit to be imposed upon those who had been conquered by the sword; but not upon a great and powerful monarch, who only fought their friendship and alliance: upon which the treaty was concluded on both sides, without any other conditions than the exchange of prisoners. The audience being over, Don John took notice to Zingha, as he conducted her out of the hall, that the lady who had served her as a seat, continued still in the same posture; upon which she replied, That it did not become the ambassadors of a great monarch to make use of the same chair twice, so she looked upon her as a piece of cast-off goods not worthy of further notice.\n\nZingha was so taken with the honours done her by the Portuguese, and so intent upon observing the order, dress, arms, &c. of their troops, that she stood at Loanda a considerable time; during which she was instructed in the Christian religion, and consented to be baptized. Don John and his spouse were her sponsors: who dismissed her soon after, with all possible honours, and highly satisfied with her reception and success. At her return, she took care to have the articles ratified by her brother; who expressed his approbation of them, and the highest obligations to her. He even went so far as to desire the viceroy to send him some proper persons to instruct him in the Christian religion, which he said he was very desirous of embracing. This request was immediately granted; and Don Denis de Faria, a negro priest, a native of Angola, was despatched, along with an officer of distinction, to stand godfather to the king. These met at first with a gracious reception: but when they came to talk of baptism, Ngola altered his tone, and told them it was too much below his dignity to receive it from the son of one of his slaves, and sent them both back. This was cried up by the courtiers as a princely act; but Zingha represented, that it could not fail to exasperate the viceroy; and tried all possible means to dissuade him from it, but in vain. He suffered, however, his other two sisters, Cambi and Fungi, to be baptized; which was performed in 1625, with a splendour suited to their dignity.\n\nAs no experience seems to have been a sufficient antidote against the innate folly of Ngola Bandi, he soon after took it into his head to make war on the Portuguese, and invaded some of their territories. This last action proved his ruin: his troops were all cut off, and himself forced to swim for his life to a small island in the Coanza, about a mile long, and two bow-shots in breadth; whether the Portuguese pursued and surrounded him; so that he had no other chance, but either to fall into their hands, or be devoured by the wild beasts with which the place swarmed. From both these dangers he was relieved by a dose of poison, given him, as was supposed, by his sister Zingha. Before this time, however, he had taken care to send his eldest son to the country of the Gingas, and put him under the care of one of their chiefs, called Giaga Coza, whom he bequeathed to take care of him, and protect him from his aunt Zingha, as he rightly imagined she would not fail of attempting his life, in order to secure herself on the throne.\n\nZingha Bandi was crowned queen of Angola, without opposition, in 1627.—She was a very artful woman, crowned with great presence of mind, firm in her resolutions, of an intrepid courage, and a great mistress in the art of dissimulation. She inherited a large share of her brother's jealous and cruel temper, to which she would not hesitate to sacrifice her nearest relations, if they gave her the least umbrage.—To this jealousy, therefore, she resolved to sacrifice her nephew, as well knowing he had a better title to the crown than herself. She made use of the most solemn oaths to draw him out of the hands of his guardian, protesting that she had accepted of the throne with no other view than to preserve it for him. But Giaga, being well acquainted with her temper, was proof against all her oaths and fair speeches.—Zingha, finding this method ineffectual, pretended a desire of resigning the crown to her nephew, to which she said she had no other objection, than that she was afraid he was yet incapable of assuming the reins of government. She therefore desired an interview with him, though ever so short, that she might satisfy herself in this particular, and promised to detain him no longer than Giaga should think necessary. Giaga thought there could be no danger in consenting to a short interview; and therefore sent the unfortunate prince to her, attended by a magnificent retinue. The cruel queen no sooner got him in her power, than she murdered him with her own hand, and caused his body to be thrown into the Coanza, ridding herself, by that inhuman act, of a dangerous rival, as well as revenging herself on her brother, as she had sworn to do, for the murder of her son.\n\nZingha's next scheme was to rid herself of the Portuguese, who had established themselves in such a manner as to be almost entire masters of the country. They had built fortresses on every convenient spot that suited them, especially near her principal towns, which they could level with the ground with the greatest ease. They had engrossed all her commerce, were become very wealthy, and their numbers increased daily; so that they were dreaded not only by her subjects, but by all the neighbouring nations. As Zingha was of a martial temper, she did not long hesitate. She quickly made all necessary provisions, strengthened herself against alliances with the Giagas, and other idolatrous nations, and even with the Dutch and the king of Congo. With this combined force she attacked the Portuguese suddenly and unexpectedly, that she gained some advantages over them: and the Dutch made themselves masters of San Paulo de Loanda, and soon after of some of the best provinces in the kingdom. This happened in the year 1641; and the Portuguese did not recover these places till the year 1648, when the Dutch were entirely driven out of Angola.\n\nZingha's successes proved still more short lived. Her allies the Congos were so completely overthrown, that they were forced to sue for peace; which the Portuguese did not grant till they had obtained a sufficient\nAngola. ficient number of hostages, and obliged the Congoeze to deliver up to them some considerable pofts, upon which they immediately erected fortrefles. Zingha's troops were now defeated in every battle; and these defeats followed on another so clofe, that she was soon abandoned, not only by her allies, but by her own troops. She was now contrained to abandon her dominions, and retire to some of the eastern deferts, whether the Portuguefe did not think it worth while to follow her.\n\nZingha being reduced to such diftrefs, the Portuguefe, after giving her some time to ruminate on her situation, sent her proposals of peace, upon condition that she should become tributary to the crown of Portugal. This proposal she rejected with scorn; and let them know, that however her daftfired subjects might submitively and shamefully behave towards them, their queen disdained subjection to any foreign power. On this haughty anfwer the Portuguefe, to mortify her still more, fet up a king in her place. The person they pitched upon was named Angola Oary, or Aaru, who was of the royal family. Before he was crowned, the Portuguefe obliged him to turn Christian; and he was accordingly baptized by the name of John. The new king, however, soon died of grief, at feeling himself so hardly treated by his masters the Portuguefe. They quickly fet up another, named Philip; who bore the yoke with more patience, and lived to the year 1660.\n\nIn the mean time Zingha, exasperated at seeing herself deprived of eleven of the best provinces in her dominions, and her authority in the remaining fix greatly weakened, renounced the Christian religion, and embraced all the horrid and bloody customs of the Giagas, whom she outdid even in their own barbarity.\n\nWe have already hinted the barbarity of this nation in eating human flesh. In this Zingha not only joined them, but took pleasure in devouring the raw flesh of human victims, and drinking their blood while warm both at her sacrifices and at her public meals.—She affected a martial and heroic spirit, together with an utter aversion to the male sex; but, according to the Portuguefe, maintained a number of the strongest and luffiest youths, in whose embraces she gave a full scope to her inclinations, and managed matters with such fecrecy that her intrigues could never be discovered. At the fame time she ordered many of her own sex to be ripped up, when their incontinency was manifested by their pregnancy; and their bodies with those of the infants to be cast to wild beasts.\n\nBut what made her most admired, as well as dreaded, by her subjects, was a notion that she had by various stratagems inculcated upon them, of her being able to penetrate into the moft fecret thoughts. To keep up this apprehention she ordered the bones of her deceased brother to be brought from the island where he was poisoned, locked up in a chest covered with coarse plates of silver, and laid on a fine carpet upon a pedestal. A number of finghillos or priests were ordered to offer sacrifices to these bones, and to keep lamps continually burning before them. To this place she herself frequently repaired, to affit at thofe rites, which, as she gave out, and every body believed, engaged the spirit of the deceased to inform her of every thing that was done, said, or even designed, either in the kingdom or out of it.—To procure, however, as much real intelligence as possible, she kept vast numbers of spies all over the kingdom, who constantly gave her notice of what happened in their respective circles; and this she cunningly improved to her own ends, that her subjects looked upon her as a kind of deity from whom nothing could be concealed.\n\nBy fuch means as these, Zingha gained fuch authority over the Giagas, that they were ready, at the very first indication of her will, to follow her through the moft dreadful dangers, and to engage in the moft desperate enterprizes. She now made many strenuous and daring efforts to drive out the Portuguefe; but though she had, in all probability, more valour and skill than her enemies, their fire arms gave them fuch an advantage, that she was always defeated with great losfs. Perceiving therefore the folly of attempts of this kind, she contented herself with making continual inroads into their country, carrying off or destroying every thing that fell in her way. Though she spared neither Europeans, nor blacks, who were subjects of the Giagas, nor mock monarchs fet up by the Portuguefe, yet the fame of the former was peculiarly dreadful when they happened to be taken prisoners. They were either roasted by a slow fire, or had their flesh cut off in pieces, and devoured before their faces, in the manner related by Mr Bruce of the Abyssinian ozen*. In this manner she infefled the Portuguefe territories for 28 years, finia, scarce ever allowing them a moment's ceffation of arms. Their mock-kings were often obliged to shelter themselves from her fury in an inaccessible rock called Maopongo; and they themselves could never hope to enjoy their dominions with any kind of peace fo long as this furious queen continued alive. They in vain exhausted all their politics either to reduce her by force, or to mollify her by prefents and fair offers. The one she rejected with difdain, and always found means to baffle the other. Nor would she hearken to any terms, unlefs they confented to reign all their conquests. The refufal of this demand was fo commonly followed by fome marks of her refentment, that it was with the utmoft difficulty the Portuguefe could prevail on any body to carry their proposals to her; and as for Zingha, she difdained to make any to them, except thofe of the hostile kind. The terror of her arms procured her a free paflage wherever she directed her course; all the inhabitants of a province making no lefs haste to abandon, than she to invade it. Thus she continued to advance, till at length she was got fo far as the small island of Dangii in the river Coanza. The Portuguefe now found themfelves under the neceffity of railing an army of negroes, in order to drive her out of it. Accordingly they surrounded the island, and intrenched themfelves along the banks on both fides of the river; but while they were busy at their work, Zingha attacked them with fuch advantage, that she killed and wounded feveral hundreds of the blacks, and fome of the white men. Elated with this advantage, fhe was preparing for another attack; when fhe perceived, to her furprife, that the Portuguefe had drawn their lines fo clofe, and raised them to fuch a height, that they overlooked her whole camp, and could fire upon her naked foldiers as if they flot at a mark. Thus great numbers of her men were cut off, particularly her chief officers. The queen, now perceiving the danger\nAngola. danger of her situation, amused the Portuguese with proposals of an accommodation; and having obtained a truce for three days, crossed the river in the dead of the night, and led her forces to the province of Oacco.\n\nThe next morning, the Portuguese, seeing no human creature upon the island, began to apprehend some new stratagem; but, upon landing some of their troops, they perceived themselves over-reached, and deprived of the fairest opportunity they ever had of forcing her to surrender at discretion.\n\nZingha stood no longer in the province whither she had retired, than till she was assured that the Portuguese were retired from the Coanza; and then, crossing that river once more, marched directly towards the kingdom of Metamba, which had been invaded by some of the neighbouring princes. The speed with which she led her forces thither, and recruited her army with multitudes of Giagas, who were all emulous of fighting under her banner, quickly enabled her to recover some of her territories in that kingdom. Beginning now to think herself successful, she again attacked the Portuguese; but was defeated with great loss, so as to be obliged to send for fresh troops. To complete her misfortune, she received news that the Giaga Calfangi had taken the advantage of her absence, to enter the kingdom of Metamba with a numerous army, had carried off the greatest part of the inhabitants, destroyed all the fruits of the earth, plundered the towns of all that was valuable, and set fire to the rest, leaving that kingdom in a manner desolate. To add to all this, her troops, exasperated at the loss of their wives, children, and goods, which were carried to the farthest corner of Benguela, were all on the point of revolting.\n\nNotwithstanding these disasters, Zingha behaved with such resolution and address, that the Portuguese, who, according to character, had probably instigated the Giaga against her, were too much afraid of her joining with him in alliance against them, that they despatched one Anthony Coglio, a learned priest and an excellent negotiator, with Don Gaspar Borgia an eminent officer, under pretence of negotiating a peace between them, first to the Giaga, and afterwards to the queen. They met with a very civil reception from the first, who told them that he was very willing to live at peace with that prince, and even to let her enjoy the kingdom of Metamba, though he was the rightful heir to it, provided she would lay down her arms. This answer encouraged the priest to try whether he could prevail on him to embrace the Christian religion; but that was declined by the Giaga in such strong terms, that the priest thought proper to desist, and set out for Zingha's camp.\n\nThe ambassadors, at their first arrival, met with such a polite reception, as made them hope for success; but after she had heard their proposals, she assumed a haughty threatening tone, and told them in the conclusion of her speech, \"That it did not become her dignity to lay down her arms, till she had brought the war she had begun to an honourable conclusion: that as to the Giagas, whose feet she had embraced some years before, and who had furnished her with such a prodigious number of forces to fight in her defence, her honour and interest required that she should still keep them in her service, and under her protection: and lastly, that as to herself, she remembered, indeed, that she had formerly embraced Christianity; but that it was not now a proper reason to propose her returning to it, and they ought to remember that they themselves were the cause of her abandoning it.\"\n\nBorgia, perceiving that she was not to be wrought upon by religious motives, shifted the topic; and told her, that she had gained honour enough in war, and that it was now high time to think of granting peace and tranquillity to the subjects of two such powerful kingdoms, and accept of the favour and friendship of the king of Portugal, which was offered her by his viceroy. To this the queen made answer, that she was perfectly well acquainted with the valour and strength of the Portuguese, and should esteem it an honour to be allied to that monarch; but that the thought it just that their respective claims to the dominions which she justly inherited from her ancestors, and of which he had unjustly deprived her, should first of all be decided, either by the sword or by some equitable judges.\n\nBorgia, vainly imagining that he had now obtained enough, set off immediately for Loanda San Paulo; but left the priest, on some pretence or other, to see whether, in the time of sickness, he could make any impression on the inflexible mind of Zingha, who now laboured under a lingering disease. Coglio, however, found all his arts to no purpose; and, upon the queen's recovery, the recommenced the war with more fury than ever.\n\nFor some time hostilities were carried on with various success; Zingha being sometimes victorious and narrow sometimes defeated. In one attempt of the latter kind, before the fortresses of Massangana, she not only lost a great number of men, but had her two sisters Cambi and Fungi taken prisoners, the herself escaping with the utmost difficulty. Exasperated by this loss, she led her troops into some of the best provinces of the Portuguese, and reduced them to a mere wilderness. Still, however, she had the mortification to find her losses vastly greater than what she gained; and had now the additional misfortune of losing her sister Fungi, who was put to death by the Portuguese for treachery, and seeing her allies the Dutch totally expelled out of Angola.\n\nZingha being thus oppressed with a complication of beginnings misfortunes, and conscious of the crimes she had committed, began seriously to consider whether such a continued series of disasters was not owing to the displeasure of the God of the Christians. To this opinion she seemed to have inclined; and therefore began to treat with more lenity such Christians as fell into her hands, especially if they happened to be priests or monks. To these she now began to listen with some attention; and ordered them, under severe penalties, to be treated with all possible respect; yet without losing in the least that invincible hatred she had conceived against those who had stripped her of her dominions, or dropping her resolution never to make peace till she had recovered them.\n\nThe viceroy, Don Salvador Correa, who had driven out the Dutch, being apprised of the regard shown to the clergy by Queen Zingha, thought proper to send some Capuchins to her, in hopes that they might now find her more tractable. But Zingha was still proof against.\nAngola against their utmost art; observing, however, that if they would consent to restore what they had unjustly taken from her, she would not only return to the Christian religion, but encourage it to the utmost of her power.\n\nThe viceroy, being now afraid that Zingha might make an alliance against him with the king of Congo, first raised a powerful army, and then acquainted that monarch, that, if he designed to prevent the total ruin of his dominions, he must immediately make reparation for all the damage he had caused to the Portuguese by his alliance with the Dutch. The fame of the Portuguese valour so intimidated the king, that he submitted to a treaty almost on the viceroy's own terms; and as soon as this treaty was concluded, Don Ruy Pegado, an old experienced officer, was despatched to Zingha, offering a firm and lasting alliance with her, provided she renounced the Giaghan sect, and returned to the bosom of the church. To this embassy she returned the old answer, namely, that the Portuguese themselves had been the occasion of all that had happened; as they had not only stripped her of her hereditary dominions, but dared to proclaim one of her vassals king of Angola; but, provided these dominions were restored, she would immediately embrace Christianity.\n\nAll this time the furious Queen Zingha went on with her ravages, notwithstanding the viceroy kept plying her with letters for near three years. At last he had recourse to the artifice of taking advantage of the remorse for her crimes with which Zingha was sometimes afflicted, in order to procure the peaceable enjoyment of his own ill-gotten conquests.\n\nIt is easy to see, that had this viceroy, or the priests he employed, really intended to convert Zingha to Christianity, they ought to have far set her an example, as at least to abandon part of the countries of which they had robbed her; but, instead of this, they impiously made use of the sacred name of our Saviour, in order to deter a poor savage African from recovering what justly belonged to her.\n\nQueen Zingha, at last, came to incline so much to return to the Christian religion, that a general murmur ran through her army. But having, by various artifices, reconciled the minds of her subjects to this event, she explained her design in a few speeches; offering at the same time liberty to those who chose to abandon her on this account to go where they would; and such was their attachment to her, that even on such a sudden and important change in her resolutions they expressed no uneasiness, but on the contrary applauded her to the highest degree.\n\nThe Portuguese, after having been harassed in a terrible manner for 28 years, and at last obliged to profane the name of their Saviour to procure a peace, began now freely to enjoy the fruits of their villany. A treaty was set on foot between the viceroy and Zingha; which, however, was not easily concluded. She demanded the release of her sister Cambi, whose Christian name was Donna Barbara; and the Portuguese demanded a ransom of 200 slaves or an equivalent in money. This Zingha did not well relish; and, being pressed to a compliance, threatened them with a more furious war than any they had yet experienced. Upon this the viceroy was obliged to have recourse to the usual method of sending priests to persuade her to comply through motives of religion. These hypocrites effected their purpose; and the slaves were sent, as if Christianity required the delivering up innocent people to those who had no lawful authority over them: but not being able to conclude a lasting peace about the cession of the Angolic provinces, they were forced to conclude a short truce, and sent back her sister.\n\nThis princess was received by Zingha in a very affectionate manner: and, some time after, the queen, her mind being probably weakened through the infirmities of old age, not only was thoroughly reconciled to the Portuguese, but looked upon them as her best friends. She encouraged the Christian religion; had a church built in her capital; made several laws against Paganism; and, to encourage marriage, she herself wedded a handsome young fellow in the 75th year of her age.\n\nThe Portuguese now imagining they would at last gain their point, proposed to her the following terms, as the basis of a lasting treaty between the two nations:\n\n1. That they should yield to her, as a present, some of the countries of which they had already robbed her, together with the slaves as for other merchandises.\n\n2. That, in consideration of the said present, which should in no way be interpreted as an investiture, the queen should pay yearly a certain acknowledgement to the king of Portugal, who should be at liberty to withdraw the said present whenever she failed of making the said acknowledgement.\n\n3. That a free commerce should be opened between those two states, as well for slaves as for other merchandises.\n\n4. That the queen should molest none of the lords that were feudatory to the Portuguese, whatever damages or ravages they might have committed during the late wars between them.\n\n5. That she should restore all the Portuguese slaves that had taken refuge in her dominions.\n\n6. That she should deliver up the Giaga Colanda, who had revolted from the Portuguese, upon condition that his crime should go unpunished.\"\n\nThe queen, having now a thorough view of the deep-rooted villainy of those with whom she had to do, conceived such displeasure against the Portuguese, that she fell sick. During this sickness, Father Anthony, her chief confidant, and a creature of the viceroy, never left off soliciting her to make her peace with God, and to accept of the terms offered her by the Portuguese; but Zingha, though worn out with age and sickness, had still the good sense to perceive, that there was no connexion between making her peace with God and complying with such infamous terms; and therefore gave the following answer, which, under such circumstances, shows a magnanimity scarce equalled in any age or in any country.\n\n1. \"That as to her conversion, as it was neither owing to any desire of obtaining a peace, or other worldly motives, but the Divine grace by which she was recalled, she was resolved to persevere in it to her last breath.\n\n2. That as to her going over to the Giagan sect, she had in a great measure been forced to it by the Portuguese viceroy.\n\n3. That the king of Portugal would do a generous act in restoring some of her Angolic dominions; but it would be more so, were he to restore them all.\n\n4. That as to her paying homage to him, neither her mind nor heart were able enough to consent to it; and that as she had refused the proposal while she lived among the Giagas, much more did she think herself above...\"\nabove it now she was a Christian queen, and owed neither tribute nor homage to any but to the Supreme Power, from whom she had received both her being and her kingdom: That, nevertheless, if she could be convinced that there was any thing in her dominions that would be acceptable to his Portuguese majesty, she would voluntarily make him a present of it; and as to the rest of the articles, such was her desire of making a firm and lasting peace with them, that she should make no difficulty of consenting to them.\"\n\nThis answer was not altogether satisfactory to the viceroy; but the priest, finding it impossible to make any impression upon her mind, easily prevailed upon him to consent to the following terms. 1. \"That the river Lucalla should be the boundary between the dominions of the Portuguese and of Queen Zingha. 2. That neither side should thenceforth give any reception to the fugitive slaves of the other, but send them back without any delay, together with the prisoners which had been taken during the last year. 3. That the queen should remain wholly free and exempt from all tribute and homage whatever, provided she agreed to the other articles.\"\n\nThese terms were at last signed by the queen and viceroy in the month of April 1657, and ratified by the king of Portugal in the month of November of the same year.—The only difficulty the queen had concerning this treaty was with regard to the Giaga Colanda: and the manner in which she extricated herself from it, with her subsequent behaviour, cannot fail to give us an high idea of the mental abilities of this African heroine.\n\nThis Giagan chief, weary of the Portuguese yoke, had retired from them, at the head of 1000 stout soldiers, and a much greater number of slaves, some leagues beyond the river Lucalla, and put himself under the queen's protection. This he readily granted, as he was very able to be serviceable to her in case the perfidious conduct of the Portuguese should oblige her to renew the war. She could not therefore but look upon it as unjust and dishonourable, to deliver up a brave chief who had devoted himself to her service, and whom she had taken under her special protection, to a nation with whose perfidy she was so well acquainted. To save her honour, therefore, some time before the ratification of the treaty, she sent privately for the Giaga, and acquainted him with the demand of the Portuguese; telling him, at the same time, that though he doubted not of the viceroy's keeping his word, and forgiving his offence, yet she advised him to go out of her dominions, and settle himself and his men in some country distant from the Portuguese frontiers; but forbade him, on pain of her highest displeasure, to commit the least outrage or hostility within their dominions.\n\nThe Giaga thanked her majesty, and seemed to acquiesce with her advice, but did not follow it. On the contrary, he had no sooner reached his fortresses than he set himself about fortifying it in such a manner as looked rather like defiance than defence: and, having gathered a considerable army, soon spread a general terror around him. Of this the Portuguese failed not to complain to the queen: who immediately marched against him, surprized and defeated his army; and he himself being killed in the action, his head was cut off and sent to the Portuguese.\n\nThis was among the last memorable actions performed by this famous queen; who, now finding herself unfit for the fatigues of war, contented herself (in 1658) Giaga Colanda with dispatching an old experienced general against a neighbouring prince who had invaded her territories. He proved no less successful than herself, and quickly forced the aggressor to submit to her terms. She now gave herself up to study the best method of propagating Christianity among her subjects; and for this purpose sent a solemn embassy to Rome, to pay homage to the Pope in her name, and to request a fresh supply of missionaries. To this letter she received an answer from his Holiness in 1662; and it was read in the church, that same year, in the most public and solemn manner. The day appointed was the 15th of July; on which the repaired to the church at the head of a numerous retinue, and having the letter hanging about her neck in a purse made of cloth of gold. The concourse was so great, that the church could not contain one half of the people, so that none were admitted but persons of rank. The father having finished the mass, read the latter at the altar in the Portuguese language; and the secretary interpreted it in that of the country. The queen, who had stood all the while it was reading, went towards the altar, and on her knees received it from the father; and having kissed it, and sworn afresh upon the gospel to continue in obedience to the church of Rome, kissed the letter again, put it into the purse, and returned to the palace amidst the shouts and acclamations of a thousand of her subjects. On that day she gave a magnificent treat to the Portuguese resident, and pope, to all her court, in two great porticos, and she herself vouchsafed to eat after the European manner; that is, fitting on a stately elbow chair, with a high table before her, covered with the finest linen, and with dishes, plates, knives, and forks, all of silver gilt. She bestowed some largesses upon her chief officers, released a good number of slaves, and at night appeared at the head of her ladies of honour, both the and they drest in the Amazonian manner. They performed a kind of combat, in which the queen, though upwards of eighty years of age, behaved with all the vigour and activity of a women of thirty.\n\nHer life, however, was not lengthened in proportion to her vigour and activity: for in the month of September she was seized with an inflammation in her throat; which, in December, having seized her breast and lungs, she expired on the 17th of that month, and was succeeded by her sister Barbara.\n\nThe deceased queen was buried with extraordinary pomp; and, out of regard to her, Barbara was inaugurated a second and third time, with the greatest pomp, and the most joyful acclamations. She was a very zealous Christian, but wanted her sister's abilities, and had the misfortune of being in the decline of life, lame, and almost blind. Besides this, she had been married to a proud ill-natured husband, named Mona Zingha; who, though to her he owed all his fortune and advancement, being himself no more than the son of a slave, used her with such cruelty, even in the late queen's life, that she was obliged to take refuge in the said Mona palace, from whence he had the insolence immediately to her.\nto fetch her. This so exasperated Queen Zingha, that she had well nigh ordered him to be cut in pieces before her face; but pardoned him at the request of Father Anthony, who probably knew he was privy to some religious secrets which he might, in case of such emergency, have disclosed. On Barbara's accession to the throne, however, he not only redoubled his cruelty to her, in hopes of getting the management of affairs entirely into his own hands, but invented accusations against Anthony himself, with a design to extirpate both him and his religion. He gave out that the late queen had been poisoned by some favourite European dithers, with which Brother Ignatius used to regale her during her last illness; and attributed his wife's lameness and blindness to some sorceries or charms used by the convent against her. He had even persuaded, or rather forced, his queen to consent that some of the finghillos or priests should be brought to counter-charm her distemper.\n\nFather Anthony, far from being intimidated at the accusations brought against him, repaired immediately to the palace; where he boldly reprimanded the queen for giving ear to these jugglers, threatening at the same time to leave her dominions, and carry off with him all the croftes, and other religious utensils, from which alone they could have any benefit. The queen returned a very submissive answer; and promised to deliver up the counter-charms which she at that time had upon her, before sunset; which she accordingly did, and sent them to the convent by the hands of her secretary. This so exasperated her husband, and all the Giagan feet, that they resolved upon the destruction of all the priests and Europeans, and even the queen herself. This, however, was found improper to be attempted; and Mona Zingha was so much chagrined at his disappointment, that he retired to his own estate; giving out, that he designed to meddle no more with state affairs; but, in reality, to concert measures for engrossing the sovereignty to himself, and to deprive his wife of her life and crown.\n\nTo accomplish his purpose, he sent a messenger to her, desiring her to repair to his house, where he had something of importance to communicate; but the declining the invitation by the advice of Father Anthony, he found himself disappointed, and begged leave to retire to a neighbouring province, which was under his government. He was again disappointed, and forbid to stir out of the province of Metamba. The queen was, however, guilty of an error not long after, in sending Mona Zingha, at the head of an army, to quell a revolt on the frontiers. On his returning victorious, he thought himself strong enough to revive the ancient Giagan rites, and therefore ordered 100 slaves to be sacrificed to the manes of the deceased queen. Though the queen was immediately apprised of his intention, and despatched a messenger expressly commanding him to desist; yet Mona, by distributing some presents, particularly some European wines, among the counsellors, effected his purpose with impunity. He did not forget to send some of this wine to Father Anthony; but to prevent suspicion, presented him only with a small quantity, to be used, as he said, at the mas; adding, that if it proved agreeable, he would supply him with a larger quantity. The unsuspicious priest drank about two glasses of it; and in about a quarter of an hour was seized with violent convulsions in his bowels, and other symptoms of being poisoned. By proper assistance, however, he recovered; yet so far was he disabused by this dose, that he was obliged to abandon his mission.\n\nThe queen's infirmities in the mean time daily increased; theropposition on her part, by her death, which happened on the 24th of March 1666. Upon this, Mona Zingha made all possible haste to get himself elected king; and immediately renounced the Christian religion, raising a persecution at the same time against its professors. He even wrote to the Portuguese viceroy, acquainting him with his having renounced Christianity, which he had only embraced out of complaisance to his queen, and with his design to revive the Giagan rites. To show that he meant to be as good as his word, he ordered all the children under five years of age, that could be found, to be sacrificed in honour of their infernal deities. He also recalled the finghillos, and heaped many favours upon them; so that they became entirely devoted to his purposes. He likewise caused many of his subjects to be privately poisoned; and then gave out, that their unaccountable deaths were owing to their having abandoned the religion of their ancestors, and embraced Christianity; which he styled the religion of a parcel of famished strangers, who through their extreme misery, had been forced to leave their native country, and seek for a livelihood in the richest provinces of Africa.\n\nBy these and such like stratagems he almost entirely extirpated Christianity, and any appearances of civilization which had been introduced among his subjects. His career, however, was stopped by Don John the prince's Barbara's first husband, from whom he had been divorced on account of his having another wife. He soon compelled the usurper to fly into an island in the Comanza; but not having the precaution to reduce him entirely, Mona Zingha found means to retrieve his affairs, and at last defeated and killed Don John himself, by which he became master of the throne without further opposition. He was no sooner re-established, than he began to pursue his butcheries with more fury than ever; when on a sudden, Don Francisco, the son of Don John, appeared at the head of an army in opposition to the usurper; and in the first engagement Mona Zingha being defeated and killed, Don Francisco became sole master of the empire.\n\nIt is not known whether this prince kept to the terms of the alliance made by Queen Zingha with the Portuguese or not. These, however, have preferred their conquests, and for some time they allowed the natives to choose a king for themselves, or rather they chose him for them, as we have already noticed. These low state kings enjoyed only a mere shadow of royalty; their whole grandeur consisting in being allowed to breed peacocks, and adorn themselves with their feathers, which was forbidden to their subjects under pain of perpetual slavery. The last of these kings was named Ngola Sedeio, who, disliking an empty name of royalty, revolted from the Portuguese, and carried on a long war with them; but being at last defeated and killed, his head was cut off, salted, and sent to Lisbon in pickle. After this the Portuguese seem not to have thought it safe to trust their Angolic subjects even with the\nthe name of a king of their own, but have vested the power entirely in their viceroy; but as to the extent of his dominions, and how matters stand between him and that race of Angolic princes who have preserved their liberty, we are entirely in the dark.\n\nWhen in its greatest splendour, the kingdom of Angola contained the following provinces: Cheflama, Sumbi, Benguela, Rimba, Sietta, High and Low Bembea, Temba, Oacco, Cabezzo, Lubolo, Loanda, Bengo, Danda, Moliche, Higher and Lower Ilamba, Oraij, and Embacca. The provinces conquered by the Portuguese during the wars above mentioned were, Danda, Moliche, Bengo, the Higher and Lower Ilamba, Oraij, Embacca, Benguela, Sietta, Cabezzo, Lubolo, and Oacco.\n\nThe principal rivers are those already mentioned, viz. the Danda and Coanza. The Coanza is large, deep, and rapid. It empties itself into the Atlantic ocean about latitude 9° 20' south, twelve leagues south of Loanda the capital of the kingdom. It is navigable for 150 miles, and abounds with variety of fish. It forms several islands, has some cataracts, and one in particular which bears its name. As for its source, and the length of ground it crosses from east to west before it comes to the Portuguese settlement, it is absolutely unknown, as well as the countries through which it runs. Its mouth, which runs between the capes Palmerino and Lego, is above a league wide; the northern shore is the deepest, and along which the vessels sail. The fall of this river into the ocean is so rapid, that the sea appears quite muddy for two or three leagues below it. Its mouth is not easily perceived from the open sea, by reason of an island quite covered with high trees which lies just before it. The two principal islands formed by this river are called Mafiander and Motchiamia. The one is five leagues long, and about two miles broad: it is very fertile in maize, millet, and some other grains, which are reaped at three different seasons of the year. It produces likewise vast quantities of manioc, a root, of which they make a coarse kind of meal, which serves instead of bread. Here also grow great numbers of palm and other fruit trees of various kinds. The island of Motchiamia is four or five miles long, and one in breadth, mostly plain, and producing variety of roots and herbs. It likewise abounds in cattle; and there were formerly five or six Portuguese families settled upon it, who drove a considerable trade in these commodities, and likewise in slaves.\n\nConcerning the river Danda we know little or nothing; only, that though its mouth is not above 70 or 80 miles distant from that of the Coanza, yet their distance grows so considerably wider as you penetrate further into the inlands, as to be much above twice if not thrice that space; though how much, is not exactly known.\n\nThe manners, religion, and dress, &c. of the inhabitants, are much the same with the Congolese. See Congo.\n\nAngola Pea, or Pigeon pea. See Cyttisus, Botany Index.\n\nANGON, in the Ancient Military Art, a kind of javelin used by the French. They darted it at a considerable distance. The iron head of this weapon resembled a fleur-de-luce. It is the opinion of some writers, that the arms of France are not fleurs-de-luce, but the iron point of the angon or javelin of the ancient French.\n\nANGOR, among Ancient Physicians, a concentration of the natural heat: the consequence of which is a pain of the head, palpitation, and faintness.\n\nANGOT, a province or kingdom of Abyssinia, formerly rich and fertile, but almost ruined by the Gallas, a wandering nation in the internal parts of Africa, who dispossessed the Abyssinian monarchs of all that was worth possessing.\n\nANGOULEME, a city of France, the capital of the former duchy of Angoumois, now the department of Charente, and the see of a bishop. It is seated on the top of a hill, surrounded with rocks, at the foot of which runs the river Charente. The inhabitants are said to be about 8000, and have a considerable trade in paper, which they manufacture. E. Long. o. io. Lat. 45. 39.\n\nANGOUMOIS, formerly a province of France, now a district, bounded on the north by Poitou, on the east by Limousin and Marche, on the south by Perigord, and on the west by Saintonge. Through this province run the rivers Touvre and Charente. This last is full of excellent fish; and though it often overflows its banks, it is so far from doing any damage, that it greatly enriches the soil. The Touvre is full of trouts. The air is generally warmer than at Paris, though the country is hilly. The soil produces plenty of wheat, rye, oats, Spanish corn, saffron, grapes, and all sorts of fruits. Here are several iron mines, which yield a very good sort of iron.\n\nANGOURA, ANGORA, or ANGORI, a city of Asia, in Anatolia, formerly called Ancyrus, and still full of remarkable antiquities, which are to many marks of its ancient magnificence. It is at present one of the best cities in Anatolia; its streets are full of pillars and old marbles, among which are some of porphyry and jasper. The greatest part of the pillars are smooth and cylindrical; some are channelled spirally; but the most singular are oval, with plate bands before and behind from the top to the bottom of the pedestal. The houses are now made of clay, which is sometimes intermixed with fine pieces of marble. The walls of the city are low, with very mean battlements. The masonry of the walls is intermixed with pillars, architraves, capitals, and other ancient fragments, especially that of the towers and gates. The castle of Angora has a triple enclosure; and the walls are of large pieces of white marble, and a stone much like porphyry.\n\nThe bazaars of Angora has about 300 purifies income; and there are here about 300 janizaries, under the command of a sardar. The Turks are said to be 40,000, the Armenians 4000 or 5000, and the Greeks 600. The Armenians have seven churches, besides a monastery, and the Greeks two. They breed the finest goats in the world; and their hair, which is of a dazzling white, is almost as fine as silk, and nine inches in length: it is worked into very fine stuffs, particularly camlet. All the inhabitants are employed in this manufacture. Several large caravans pass through this city to different places. E. Long. 32. 5. N. Lat. 39. 30. See ANCYRA.\n\nANGOY, a kingdom of Loango in Africa, bound-\ned on the north by Cacongo, and on the south by Congo; from the former of which it is separated by the river Cabinda, and from the latter by the river Zaire. It is but of small extent; being only a vallal province of Cacongo, till the mani or prince, who had married a Portuguese's daughter, was persuaded by his father-in-law to make himself independent. This he effected at a favourable juncture, the king of Loango having but just before revolted from the king of Congo, and the king of Cacongo from the new king of Loango.\n\nThe country is full of woods and thickets; and has no towns of any note, except one called Bomangoy, situated on the north banks of the Zaire, and not far from its mouth. Its chief port is Cabinda, called also Kabenda, or Cabenda, situated on the mouth of a river of the same name about five leagues north of Cape Palmerino, on the north side of the Zaire's mouth. The bay is very commodious for trade, or wooding and watering along the shore. It is flat and marshy in some places; but ascends gradually about three miles inland, and then forms itself into a ridge of hills. On the ascent of these is situated a town belonging to the father-in-law of the king above mentioned, where he constantly kept a flock of wood ready cut, to sell to foreign ships at an easy rate. From these wood piles, south-west along the bay, lie scattered a number of fishermen's huts, on each side a small fresh water river which falls into the bay; and thence all the water for ships is brought in casks to the mouth of the river, which is so shallow, that even at full flood it can only be entered by a yawl carrying a cask or two. The town stands on the round point of the bay looking to the westward; and the English have a factory on the south-west of the road.\n\nThe country round the bay is mostly barren; owing chiefly to the laziness of the inhabitants, which often occasions a scarcity of provisions. The wild beasts swarm in the woods, that they destroy all the tame kinds; so there are no cattle bred here but hogs. From the woods in this country some monkeys have been brought away, which in shape and stature resembled the human species. Civet cats abound here in great plenty, and parrots may be bought for three or four ordinary knives. The coasts abound in oysters, that the sailors quickly load their boats with them; they being found lying in great heaps like small rocks. The natives follow the occupation of fishing more than any other. They fish both on the sea and in the rivers, making use of drag nets, which have long canes fixed at equal distances, instead of cords, to throw when any fish is caught. These nets are made of a peculiar kind of root, which, after being beaten, may be spun like hemp.\n\nThe dress of the inhabitants is the same with that of the Congos. They allow polygamy, and the best beloved wife hath the command of the rest; but is no less liable to be turned out, if she proves unfaithful. The ladies of the blood-royal have the privilege of choosing their husbands out of any, even the meanest rank; and have even the power of life and death over them; as likewise over their paramours, if any of them are caught tripping; but the husbands are by no means entitled to expect the same fidelity from their royal ladies. Women of the lower rank are obliged, when they receive a stranger, to admit him for a night or two into their embraces. This obliged the missionaries, who traveled through this country, to give notice of their approach to any of their houses, that none of the female sex might enter within their doors.—Their religion consists chiefly in a variety of superstitious customs; such as powdering their public and domestic idols with the dust of a kind of red wood, on the first day of the moon, and paying a kind of worship to that planet. If, on that night, it happens to shine clear and bright, they cry out, \"Thus may I renew my life as thou dost;\" but if the air is cloudy, they imagine the moon hath lost her virtue, and pay her no respect. We do not hear of their offering any sacrifices to their idols; though they commonly consult them about the success of their enterprises, thefts, or such like. The king of Congo still styles himself sovereign of Ango; but the king of this little state pays neither tribute nor homage to any foreign power.\n\nANGRA, a city of Tercera one of the Azores; the capital, not only of that island, but of all the rest, and the residence of the governor. It is seated on the south side, near the middle of the longest diameter of the island, on the edge of the sea. The harbour is the only tolerable one in the whole island, being equally secured against storms and the efforts of an enemy. It is of the form of a crescent; the extremities of which are defended by two high rocks, that run far into the sea as to render the entrance narrow, and easily covered by the batteries on each side. From this harbour the town is said to derive its name, the word Angra signifying a creek, bay, or station for shipping; and this is the only convenient one among all the Azores. The opening of the port is from the east to the south-west; and, according to Frezier, it is not above four cables' length in breadth, and not two of good bottom. Here ships may ride in great safety during the summer; but as soon as the winter begins, the storms are so furious, that the only safety for shipping is the putting to sea with all possible expedition. Happily, however, these storms are preceded by infallible signs, with which experience has made the inhabitants perfectly well acquainted. On these occasions the Pico, a high mountain in another of the Azores, is overcast with thick clouds, and grows exceedingly dark; but what they look upon as the most certain sign is the fluttering and chirping of flocks of birds round the city for some days before the storm begins.\n\nThe town is well built and populous, is the see of a bishop, under the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Lisbon. It hath five parishes, a cathedral, four monasteries, as many nunneries, besides an inquisition and bishop's court, which extends its jurisdiction over all the Azores, Flores, and Corvo. It is surrounded by a good wall, a dry ditch of great depth and breadth, and defended by a strong castle rendered famous by the imprisonment of King Alphonso by his brother Peter in 1668. Though most of the public and private buildings have a good appearance externally, they are but indifferently furnished within; but for this poverty the Portuguese excuse themselves, by saying, that too much furniture would prove inconvenient in so warm a climate.\n\nAt Angra are kept the royal magazines for anchors, cables, sails, and other stores for the royal navy, or occasionally for merchantmen in great distress. All ma-\nAngrivarii time affairs are under the inspection of an officer called Defembergrador, who hath subordinate officers and pilots for conducting ships into the harbour, or to proper watering places. The English, French, and Dutch, have each a confidant residing here, though the commerce of any of these nations with the Azores is very considerable.\n\nANGRIVARII, (Tacitus); a people of Germany, situated between the Weser and the Ems, and eastward reaching beyond the Weser, as far as the Cherufci, on which side they raised a rampart (Tacitus); to the south, having the Tubantes on the Ems, and on the Weser where it bends to the forest Bacemis; to the west, the Ems and the confines of the Bructeri; and to the north, the territory of the Angrivarii lay between the Chamavi and Anfibarii. Ptolemy places them between the Cauchi and Suevi or Catti. Supposed now to contain a part of the county of Schaumburg, the half of the bishopric or principality of Minden to the south, the greatest part of the bishopric of Osnaburg, the north part of the county of Tecklenburg, and a part of the county of Ravenberg. A trace of the name of the people still remains in the appellation Engern, a small town in the county of Ravenberg.\n\nANGUILLA, one of the West India or Caribbee islands, lying in about 1° N. Lat. It has its name from its snake-like form; and is about ten leagues in length and three in breadth. It was first discovered by the English in 1650, when it was filled with alligators and other noxious animals; but they, finding the soil fruitful, and proper for raising tobacco and corn, settled a colony on it, and imported live cattle, which have since multiplied exceedingly. But the colony not being settled under any public encouragement, each planter laboured for himself, and the island became a prey to every rapacious invader, which disheartened the inhabitants so much, that all industry was lost among them. Their chief sufferings were from a party of wild Irish, who landed here after the Revolution, and treated them worse than any of the French pirates who had attacked them before. The people of Barbadoes, and other English Caribbees, knowing the value of the soil, several of them removed to Anguilla, where they remained for many years, and even carried on a profitable trade, though without any government either civil or ecclesiastical. In 1745, their militia, though not exceeding 100 men, defended a breastwork against 1000 French who came to attack them; and at last obliged them to retire with the loss of 150 men, besides carrying off some of their arms and colours as trophies of their victory. Since that time the inhabitants have subsisted mostly by farming; though they still plant sugar, and the island is said to be capable of great improvements.\n\nANGUILLIFORM, an appellation given by zoologists, not only to the different species of eels, but to other animals resembling them in shape.\n\nANGUINA. See Tricosanthus.\n\nANGUINUM·ovum, a fabulous kind of egg, said to be produced by the saliva of a cluster of serpents, and possessed of certain magical virtues. The superstition in respect to these was very prevalent among the ancient Britons, and there still remains a strong tradition of it in Wales. The account Pliny* gives of it is as follows: \"Præterea est ovorum genus in magna Galliarum fama, omnium Graecis. Angues innumere-\n\n*Lib. xix. 3.\nAnhelatio story. Joachim Ernelt, who died in 1386, left five sons, who divided the principality among them. All of them having children, and being of equal authority, they unanimously agreed to submit to the eldest of the family, who has the supreme government, which is Anhalt Dessau. The others are, Anhalt Bernburg, Anhalt Schaumburg, Anhalt Cothen, and Anhalt Zerbst. The Saxons acknowledge that the inhabitants of these little independent sovereignties live in the land of milk and honey. These petty princes possess lands sufficient for their expenses, the revenues being reckoned about half a million of dollars. The tax on lands is four per cent, which, rating them at 20 years purchase, is not quite one shilling in the pound. Upon an emergency the subjects are able to raise half a million extraordinary. The towns in these little states are not so numerous in proportion to the extent of country as in Saxony, but better peopled. It is bounded on the south by the county of Mansfeld, on the west by the duchy of Halberstadt, on the east by the duchy of Saxony, and on the north by the duchy of Magdeburg. It abounds in corn, and is watered by the Saale and Mulda; its principal trade is in beer.\n\nANHELIATIO, or Anhelitus, among Physicains, a shortness of breath.\n\nANHINGA. See Ornithology Index.\n\nANHOLT, an island of Denmark, in North Jutland, lying in the Categat, eight miles from the coast of Jutland, ten from Seeland, and seven from Halland. It is dangerous for seamen, for which reason there is a lighthouse.\n\nANIAN, the name of a strait formerly supposed to lie between the north-east of Asia and the north-west of America; but now found to exist only in imagination.\n\nANIAN is also the name of a barren sandy desert lying on the east coast of Africa. It is excessively hot and otherwise inhospitable, that it contains but very few inhabitants, except some wandering Arabs who live in camps.\n\nANIELLO, or Massaniello. See History of Naples.\n\nANJENGO, a small town and factory, with a fort, on the coast of Malabar, in the peninsula on this side the Ganges, belonging to the East India Company. The fort is small, but neat and strong; it is a square with four bastions, having eight guns mounted on each, carrying a ball of 18 pounds. Two of these bastions face the sea, the other two the country. Besides these, there is a line of 18 or 20 guns pointing towards the sea, of 18 and 24 pounds. About a pistol shot from the back of the fort runs a river, which, besides being a security to the factory, adds much to the agreeable situation of the place. This river has its source in some distant mountains; and, descending in a course from the north and east, it afterwards turns in several pleasing meanders so far to the west as to wash the bottom of our factory's garden, and at last winding to the south, it empties itself into the sea. Several beautiful small islands too, which are washed by its current, diversify the scenery, and greatly heighten the beauty of the prospect. This settlement supplies our East India Company with pepper; and its situation is also very convenient for giving proper intelligence to our ships touching here from Europe, or from any part of India. L. Long. 76° 1', N. Lat. 7° 0'.\n\nANIL, in Botany, a synonyme of a species of indigofera. See Indigofera, Botany Index.\n\nANIMA, among Chemists, denotes the volatile or spirituous parts of bodies.\n\nANIMA, among Divines and Naturalists, denotes the soul, or principle of life, in animals. See Soul.\n\nANIMA Hepatis, is a name by which some call fal marus, or salt of iron, on account of its supposed efficacy in diseases of the liver.\n\nANIMA Mundi, a certain pure ethereal substance or spirit, diffused, according to many of the ancient philosophers, through the mass of the world, informing, actuating, and uniting the divers parts thereof into one great, perfect, organic, and vital body or animal. Plato treats at large of the Φυσική τῶν ἀρχῶν, in his Timaeus; and is even supposed to be the author of the dogma; yet are interpreters much at a loss about his meaning. Aristotle, however, taking it in the common and obvious sense, strenuously opposes it. The modern Platonists explain their master's anima mundi by a certain universal ethereal spirit, which in the heavens exists perfectly pure, as retaining its proper nature; but on earth pervading elementary bodies, and intimately mixing with all the minute atoms thereof, it assumes somewhat of their nature, and becomes of a peculiar kind.—So the poet:\n\nSpiritus intus altit, totosque infusa per artus\nMens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet.\n\nThey add, that this anima mundi, which more immediately resides in the celestial regions as its proper seat, moves and governs the heavens in such a manner, as that the heavens themselves first received their existence from the fecundity of the same spirit: for that this anima, being the primary force of life, everywhere breathed a spirit like itself, by virtue whereof various kinds of things were framed conformable to the divine ideas.\n\nANIMA Saturni, a white powder obtained by pouring distilled vinegar on litharge, of considerable use in enamelling. See Enamel.\n\nANIMADVERSION, in matters of literature, is used to signify, sometimes correction, sometimes remarks upon a book, &c. and sometimes a serious consideration upon any point.\n\nANIMAL, in Natural History, an organized and living body, which is also endowed with sensation: thus, minerals are said to grow or increase, plants to grow and live, but animals alone to have sensation.\n\nIt is this property of sensation alone that can be deemed the essential characteristic of an animal; and by which the animal and vegetable kingdoms seem to be so essentially separated, that we cannot even imagine the least approximation of the one to the other. Those naturalists, indeed, who have supposed the distinction between animals and vegetables to consist in anything else than what we have already mentioned, have found themselves greatly embarrassed; and have generally agreed, that it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to settle the boundaries between the animal and vegetable kingdoms. But this difficulty will be easily seen to arise from their taking the characteristic marks of the animal kingdom, from something that was evidently common to both. Thus Boerhaave attempted\ntempted to distinguish an animal from a vegetable, by the former having a mouth, which the latter has not; but here, as the mouth of an animal is only the instrument by which nourishment is conveyed to its body, it is evident that this can be no essential distinction, because vegetables also require nourishment, and have instruments proper for conveying it into their bodies; and where the end is the same, a difference in the means can never be essential. The fixing the difference in an animal's having a gula, stomach, and intestines, as is done by Dr Tylon, is as little to the purpose.\n\nThe power of moving from one place to another, hath by many been thought to constitute their difference; and indeed, in most cases, it is the obvious mark by which we distinguish an animal from a vegetable: but Lord Kames hath given several very curious instances of the locomotive power of plants; some of which, as he says, would do honour to an animal.\n\n\"Upon the slightest touch, the sensitive plant shrinks back and folds up its leaves, similar to a snail; which on the slightest touch retires within its shell. A new species of the sensitive plant hath been lately discovered. See Dionaea. If a fly perch upon one of its flower leaves, it closes instantly, and crushes the insect to death. There is not an article in botany more admirable than a contrivance, visible in many plants, to take advantage of good weather, and to protect themselves against bad. They open and close their flowers and leaves in different circumstances; some close before sunset, some after; some open to receive rain, some close to avoid it. The petals of many flowers expand in the sun; but contract at night, or on the approach of rain. After the seeds are fecundated, the petals no longer contract. All the trefoils may serve as a barometer to the husbandman; they always contract their leaves on an impending storm. Some plants follow the sun, others turn from it. Many plants, on the sun's receipt, vary the position of their leaves, which is styled the sleep of plants. A singular plant was lately discovered in Bengal. Its leaves are in continual motion all day long; but when night approaches, they fall down from an erect posture to rest.\"\n\n\"A plant has a power of directing its roots for procuring food. The red whortleberry, a low evergreen plant, grows naturally on the tops of our highest hills, among stones and gravel. This shrub was planted in an edging to a rich border, under a fruit wall. In two or three years, it overran the adjoining deep laid gravel walk; and seemed to fly from the border, in which not a single runner appeared. An effort to come at food in a bad situation, is extremely remarkable in the following instance: Among the ruins of Newabbey, formerly a monastery in Galloway, there grows on the top of a wall a plane tree about 20 feet high. Stratified for nourishment in that barren situation, it several years ago directed roots down the side of the wall, till they reached the ground ten feet below; and now the nourishment it afforded to those roots during the time of their defending is amply repaid, having every year since that time made vigorous shoots. From the top of the wall to the surface of the earth, these roots have not thrown out a single fibre; but are now united in a single root.\n\n\"Plants, when forced from their natural position, are endowed with a power to restore themselves. A hop plant, twisting round a stick, directs its course from south to west, as the sun does. Untwist it, and tie it in the opposite direction; it dies. Leave it loose in the wrong direction; it recovers its natural direction in a single night. Twist a branch of a tree so as to invert its leaves, and fix it in that position: if left in any degree loose, it untwists itself gradually, till the leaves be restored to their natural position. What better can an animal do for its welfare? A root of a tree meeting with a ditch in its progress, is laid open to the air. What follows? It alters its course like a rational being, dips into the ground, surrounds the ditch, rises on the opposite side to its wonted distance from the surface, and then proceeds in its original direction. Lay a wet sponge near a root laid open to the air; the root will direct its course to the sponge. Change the place of the sponge; the root varies its direction. Thrust a pole into the ground at a moderate distance from a scandent plant: the plant directs its course to the pole, lays hold of it, and rises on it to its natural height. A honeyfuckle proceeds in its course, till it be too long for supporting its weight; and then strengthens itself by flopping into a spiral. If it meet with another plant of the same kind, they coalesce for mutual support; the one forewing to the right, the other to the left. If a honeyfuckle twig meets with a dead branch, it forewings from the right to the left. The clasps of briary floot into a spiral, and lay hold of whatever comes in their way for support. If, after completing a spiral of three rounds, they meet with nothing, they try again by altering their course.\"\n\nBy comparing these and other instances of seeming voluntary motion in plants, with that share of life wherewith some of the inferior kinds of animals are endowed, we can scarce hesitate at ascribing the superiority to the former; that is, putting sensation out of the question. Muscles, for instance, are fixed to one place as much as plants are; nor have they any power of motion, besides that of opening and shutting their shells: and in this respect they have no superiority over the motion of the sensitive plant; nor doth their action discover more sagacity, or even so much, as the roots of the plane tree mentioned by Lord Kames.\n\nMr Buffon, who seems to be desirous of confounding the animal and vegetable kingdoms, denies sensation to be any essential distinction. \"Sensation (says he) more essentially distinguishes animals from vegetables: but sensation is a complex idea, and requires some explication. For if sensation implied no more than motion consequent upon a stroke or an impulse, the sensitive plant enjoys this power. But if, by sensation, we mean the faculty of perceiving and comparing ideas, it is uncertain whether brute animals are endowed with it. If it should be allowed to dogs, elephants, &c., whose actions seem to proceed from motives similar to those by which men are actuated, it must be denied to many species of animals, particularly to those which appear not to possess the faculty of progressive motion. If the sensation of an oyster, for example, differed only in degree from that of a dog; why do we not ascribe the same sensation to vegetables, though in a degree still inferior? This distinction, therefore, between the animal and vegetable, is neither sufficiently general nor determined.\"\n\"From this investigation we are led to conclude, that there is no absolute and essential distinction between the animal and vegetable kingdoms; but that nature proceeds, by imperceptible degrees, from the most perfect to the most imperfect animal, and from that to the vegetables; and the fresh water polypus may be regarded as the last of animals and the first of plants.\"\n\nIt were to be wished, that philosophers would on some occasions consider, that a subject may be dark as well on account of their inability to see, as when it really affords no light. Our author boldly concludes, that there is no essential difference between a plant and an animal, because we ascribe sensation to an oyster, and none to the sensitive plant; but we ought to remember, that though we cannot perceive a distinction, it may nevertheless exist. Before Mr Buffon, therefore, had concluded in this manner, he ought to have proved that some vegetables were endowed with sensation.\n\nIt is no doubt, however, as much incumbent on those who take the contrary side of the question, to prove that vegetables are not endowed with sensation, as it was incumbent on Mr Buffon to have proved that they are. But a little attention will show us, that the difficulty here proceeds entirely from our inability to see the principle of sensation. We perceive this principle in ourselves, but no man can perceive it in another. Why then does every individual of mankind conclude that his neighbour has the same sensations with himself? It can only be from analogy. Every man perceives his neighbour formed in a manner similar to himself; he acts in a similar manner on similar occasions, &c. Just so it is with brute animals. It is no more doubtful that they have sensations, than that we have them ourselves. If a man is wounded with a knife, for instance, he expresses a sense of pain, and endeavours to avoid a repetition of the injury. Wound a dog in the same manner, he will also express a sense of pain; and, if you offer to strike him again, will endeavour to escape, before he feels the stroke. To conclude here, that the action of the dog proceeded from a principle different from that of the man, would be absurd and unphilosophical to the last degree.\n\nWe must further take notice, that there are sensations essentially distinct from one another; and in proportion as an animal is endowed with more or fewer of these different senses, it is more or less perfect as an animal: but, as long as one of them remains, it makes not the least approach to the vegetable kingdom; and, when they are all taken away, is so far from becoming a vegetable, that it is only a mass of dead matter. The senses of a perfect animal, for instance, are five in number. Take away one of them, suppose sight; he becomes then a less perfect animal, but is as unlike a vegetable as before. Suppose him next deprived of hearing: his resemblance to a vegetable would be as little as before; because a vegetable can neither feel, taste, nor smell, and we suppose him still to enjoy these three senses. Let us, lastly, suppose him endowed only with the sense of feeling, which, however, seems to include that of taste, and he is no more a vegetable than formerly, but only an imperfect animal. If this sense is then taken away, we connect him not with the vegetable kingdom, but with what Mr Buffon calls brute matter. It is to this kingdom, and not to the vegetable, that animals plainly approximate as they descend. Indeed, to suppose an approximation between the vegetable and animal kingdoms, is very absurd: for, at that rate, the most imperfect animal ought to be the most perfect plant; but we observe no such thing. All animals, from the highest to the lowest, are possessed of vegetable life; and that, as far as we can perceive, in an equal degree, whether the animal life is perfect or imperfect: nor doth there seem to be the smallest connexion between the highest degree of vegetation and the lowest degree of sensation. Though all animals, therefore, are possessed of vegetable life, these two seem to be as perfectly distinct and incommensurate to one another as any two things we can possibly imagine.\n\nThe power of vegetation, for instance, is as perfect in an onion or leek, as in a dog, an elephant, or a man: and yet, though you threaten a leek or an onion ever so much, it pays no regard to your words, as a dog would do; nor, though you wound it, does it avoid a second stroke. It is this principle of self-preservation in all animals, which, being the most powerful one in their nature, is generally taken, and with very good reason, as the true characteristic of animal life. This principle is undoubtedly a consequence of sensation; and as it is never observed to take place in vegetables, we have a right to say that the foundation of it, namely sensation, belongs not to them. There is no animal, which makes any motion in consequence of external impulse where danger is threatened, but what puts itself in a posture of defence; but no vegetable whatever does so. A muscle, when it is touched, immediately thwarts its shell; and as this action puts it in a state of defence, we conclude that it proceeded from the principle of self-preservation. When the sensitive plant contracts from a touch, it is no more in a state of defence than before; for whatever would have destroyed it in its expanded state, will also do it in its contracted state. We conclude, therefore, that the motion of the sensitive plant proceeds only from a certain property called by physicians irritability; and which, though our bodies possess it in an eminent degree, is a characteristic neither of animal nor vegetable life, but belongs to us in common with brute matter. It is certain, that an electrified silk thread shows a much greater variety of motions than any sensitive plant. If a bit of silk thread is dropped on an electrified metal plate, it immediately erects itself; spreads out the small fibres like arms; and, if not detained, will fly off. If a finger is brought near it, the thread seems greedy to catch at it. If a candle approaches, it claps close to the plate, as if afraid of it.—Why do we not conclude that the thread in this case is really afraid of the candle? For this plain reason, That its seeming flight is not to get away from the candle, but to get towards the electrified metal; and, if allowed to remain there, will suffer itself to be burnt without offering to flit.—The sensitive plant, in like manner, after it has contracted, will suffer itself to be cut in pieces, without making the least effort to escape. The case is not so with the meanest animal. A hedgehog, when alarmed, draws its body together, and expands its prickles, thereby putting itself in a posture of defence. Throw it into water; and the same principle of self-preservation...\nAnimal preservation prompts it to expand its body and swim. A snail, when touched, withdraws itself into its shell; but if a little quicklime is sprinkled upon it, so that its shell is no longer a place of safety, it is thrown into agonies, and endeavours to avail itself of its locomotive power in order to escape the danger. In mussels and oysters, indeed, we cannot observe this principle of self-preservation so strongly, as nature has deprived them of the power of progressive motion: but, as we observe them constantly to use the means which nature has given them for self-preservation, we can have no reason to think that they are destitute of that principle upon which it is founded.\n\nBut there is no need of arguments drawn from the inferior creation. We ourselves are possessed both of the animal and vegetable life, and certainly must know whether there is any connexion between vegetation and sensation, or not.—We are conscious that we exist; that we hear, feel, &c.: but of our vegetation we are absolutely unconscious. We feel a pleasure, for instance, in gratifying the calls of hunger and thirst; but of the process by which our aliment is formed into chyle, the chyle mixed with the blood, the circulation of that fluid, and the separation of all the humours from it, we are altogether ignorant. If we then, who are more perfect than other vegetables, are utterly insensible of our own vegetable life, why should we imagine that the less perfect vegetables are sensible of it?\n\nTo illustrate our reasoning here by an example.—The direction of the roots of the plane tree mentioned by Lord Kames, shows as much sagacity, if we are to look only to the outward action, as can be observed in any motion of the most perfect animal whatever; nevertheless, we have not the least suspicion, either that the tree saw the ground at a distance, or that it was informed of its being there by the rest of its roots. If a wound is made in the body of a man, and a lot of substance is to be repaired, the same sagacity will be observed in the arrangement of the fibres, not only as if they were animated, but they will dispose of themselves seemingly with a degree of wisdom far superior to what we have any idea of; yet this is done without our having the least knowledge either how it is done, or of its being done at all. We have therefore in ourselves a demonstration, that vegetable life acts without knowing what it does: and if vegetables are ignorant of their most sagacious actions, why should we suspect that they have a sensation, let it be ever so obscure, of any of their inferior ones, such as contracting from a touch, turning towards the sun, or advancing to meet a pole?\n\nThus we may easily give Mr Buffon a reason why we ascribe sensation to an oyster, and none to a vegetable; namely, because we perceive the vegetable do nothing but what is also performed in our own bodies, without our having the least sensation of it; whereas an oyster puts itself in a defensive posture on the approach of danger; and this being an action similar to our own upon a like occasion, we conclude that it proceeds from the same principle of sensation. Here it may also be observed, that though the inferior animals are deficient in the number, they are by no means so in the acuteness of their sensations; on the contrary, though a muscle or an oyster is probably endowed with no other sense than that of feeling, yet this sense is so exquisite, that it will contract upon the slightest touch, such as we would be altogether insensible of.\n\nAs to that power of contrariety, or irritability, which is observed in some plants; our solids have it, when deprived both of vegetable and animal life: for a muscle, cut out of a living body, will continue to contract, if it is irritated by pricking it, after it has neither sensation nor vegetation.\n\nA very good moral reason may also be adduced why we do not believe vegetables to be endowed with sensation.—Had they been so, we must suppose them to suffer pain when they are cut or destroyed; and, if so, what an unhappy state must they be in, who have not the least power to avoid the injuries daily offered them? In fact, the goodness of the Deity is very conspicuous in not giving to vegetables the same sensations as to animals; and, as he hath given them no means of defense, though we had not been told it by himself, we might have known that he gave them for food to animals; and, in this case, to have endowed them with sensation would have been a piece of cruelty. Though animals without number prey upon one another, yet all of them have some means of defense; from whence we may justly conclude, that their mutual destruction was not an original appointment of the Creator, but what he foresaw would happen in a course of time, and which he therefore gave every one of them some means of guarding against. It may no doubt be here objected, that the giving some means of self-defense to every animal cannot be reckoned a sufficient proof that it was not the original design of the Creator that they should be destroyed, seeing these means are not always effectual for their preservation.—This objection, however, cannot be completely obviated without a solution of the question concerning the origin of evil among the works of a perfectly good Being. But whatever difficulty there may be in solving this question, it is certain, that, as some means of self-defense is given to every animal, it has been the original design of the Creator, that in all cases one species of animals should not be destroyed at the pleasure of any other species; and as no means of self-defense is given to any vegetable, it is plain that they have been destined for a prey to every species of animals that had access to them. Philosophers have inflamed much on the necessity of one animal's devouring another, that there might be room sufficient for all; but this, so far from being a system worthy of the divine wisdom, seems to us to be a reflection upon it, as if the Author of nature could not have found means to preserve the life of one part of his creatures, without the destruction and misery of the rest. The sacred writings leave us at no loss to see how this carnivorous disposition came in; and, in the next world, this piece of perfection (as the fangirnous philosophers above mentioned would have it to be) seems to be left out; for there, it is said, \"They shall not hurt nor destroy; the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and there shall be no more pain.\"\n\nWhen speaking of the food of plants, we took occasion to mention a certain power, totally different from that of attraction or repulsion, by which the food of a plant, after it was attracted, or otherwise brought to it, was assimilated to its substance. This power which we there distinguish by the name of transmutation, belongs\nAnimal, longs in a more eminent degree to animals. The alimentary function is changed into two kinds of matter: (1.) An excrementitious one, which passes off through the intestines; and (2.) A fluid, which is the direct pabulum of the animal. Different substances, however, are not equally changeable by this process. The human stomach is not capable of acting upon any animal substance till it has lost its vital principle: the stomachs of some animals cannot act upon creatures of their own species: some have an apparatus for grinding their food after it is swallowed, &c., and there are no animals but what are subject to death by taking certain substances into their stomach. Some substances also, though they resist the action of the stomach, and pass unchanged into the system, produce no bad effects. Thus, madder will turn the bones of animals red; rhubarb will communicate its purgative nature to the milk, and its deep yellow colour to the urine.—All these changes, however, seem to belong to the vegetative part of our system: for as every one of them are performed without our knowledge of the manner how; and not only so, but while we are absolutely unconscious of their being done; we can have no reason to suppose, that the animal life, properly so called, is at all connected with them, any farther than as they are at present the means of preserving the creature alive, and making the connexion betwixt the principle of life and this visible creation.\n\nThe description and classing of animals make a considerable part of Natural History, known by the name of Zoology.\n\nAnimal, used adjectively, denotes anything belonging to, or partaking of, the nature of animals. Thus, animal actions, those that are peculiar to animals; such are sensation and muscular motion.\n\nAnimal-Flower, in Zoology, a name given to several species of animals belonging to the genus of Actinia of Linnaeus. They have likewise been distinguished by the names of Urtica Marina, or Sea-nettle, from their supposed property of stinging; and Sea-anemone, from their claws or tentacles being disposed in regular circles, and tinged with a variety of bright lively colours, resembling the petals of some of our most beautiful flowers. As to one species particularly, mentioned by Abbé Dicquemare, (Phil. Trans. for 1773, art. 37.) the purest white, carmine, and ultramarine, are said to be scarce sufficient to express their brilliancy. The bodies of some of them are hemispherical, of others cylindrical, and of others shaped like a fig. Their substance likewise differs; some are stiff and gelatinous, others fleshy and mucilaginous; but all of them are capable of altering their figure when they extend their bodies and claws in search of food. They are found in many of the rocky coasts of the West India islands, and likewise on some parts of the coast of England.\n\nThey have only one opening, which is in the centre of the uppermost part of the animal; round this are placed rows of fleshy claws; this opening is the mouth of the animal, and is capable of great extension. The animals themselves, though exceedingly voracious, will bear long fasting. They may be preserved alive a whole year, or perhaps longer, in a vessel of sea-water, without any visible food; but, when food is presented, one of them will successively devour two mussels in their shells, or even swallow a whole crab as large as a hen's egg. In a day or two the crab-shell is voided at the mouth, perfectly cleared of all the meat. The mussel shells are likewise discharged whole, with the two shells joined together, but entirely empty, so that not the least particle of fish is to be perceived on opening them. An anemone of one species will even swallow an individual of another species; but after retaining it ten or twelve hours, will throw it up alive and uninjured. Through this opening also it produces its young ones alive, already furnished with little claws, which, as soon as they fix themselves, they begin to extend in search of food.\n\nOne of the extremities of the sea-anemone resembles, as we have said, the outward leaves of that flower; while its limbs are not unlike the flag or inner part of it. By the other extremity it fixes itself, as by a sucker, to the rocks or stones lying in the sand; but it is not totally deprived of the power of progressive motion, as it can shift its situation, though very slowly.\n\nA particular species of animal-flowers has been found in some of the islands ceded to Britain at the last treaty of peace with France; and the following account of them was published in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. 57, by Mr. Ellis, in a letter to Lord Hillsborough.\n\n\"This compound animal, which is of a tender fleshy substance, consists of many tubular bodies swelling gently towards the upper part, and ending like a bulb or very small onion: on the top of each is its mouth, surrounded by one or two rows of tentacles, or claws, which when contracted look like circles of beads.\n\n\"The lower part of all these bodies has a communication with a firm fleshy wrinkled tube, which sticks fast to the rocks, and sends forth other fleshy tubes, which creep along them in various directions. These are full of different sizes of these remarkable animals, which rise up irregularly in groups near to one another.\n\n\"This adhering tube, that secures them fast to the rock, or fleshy bottom, is worthy of our notice. The knobs that we observe, are formed in several parts of it by its infusing itself into the inequalities of the coral rock, or by grasping pieces of shells, part of which still remain in it, with the fleshy substance grown over them.\n\n\"This shows us the instinct of nature, that directs these animals to preserve themselves from the violence of the waves, not unlike the anchoring of mussels, by their fine filken filaments that end in suckers; or rather like the fleshy basis of the terpula, or worm shell, the tree oyster, and the flipper barnacle, &c., whose bases conform to the shape of whatever substance they fix themselves to, grasping it fast with their tenacious claws, to withstand the fury of a storm.\n\n\"When we view the inside of this animal dissected lengthwise, we find like a little tube leading from the mouth to the stomach, from whence there rise eight wrinkled small guts, in a circular order, with a yellowish soft substance in them; these bend over in the form of arches towards the lower part of the bulb, from whence they may be traced downwards, to the narrow part of the upright tube, till they come to the fleshy adhering tube, where some of them may be perceived entering into a papilla, or the beginning of an animal of the like kind, most probably to convey it nourishment...\"\nnourishment till it is provided with claws; the remaining part of these slender guts is continued on in the fleshy tube, without doubt, for the same purpose of producing and supporting more young ones from the same common parent.\n\n\"The many longitudinal fibres that we discover lying parallel to each other, on the inside of the semi-transparent skin are all inserted in the several claws round the animal's mouth, and are plainly the tendons of the muscles for moving and directing the claws at the will of the animal; these may be likewise traced down to the adhering tube.\n\n\"As this specimen has been preserved in spirits, the colour of the animal, when living, cannot be certainly known; it is at present of a pale yellowish brown.\n\n\"With regard to its name, it may be called Actinia sociata, or the Cliffer Animal-flower.\"\n\nThe Abbé Découmarre, by many curious, though cruel, experiments related in the Phil. Trans. for 1773, has shown that these animals possess, in a most extraordinary degree, the power of reproduction; so that scarce anything more is necessary to produce as many sea anemones as we please, than to cut a single one into as many pieces. A sea anemone being cut in two by a section through the body, that part, where the limbs and mouth are placed, ate a piece of a muscle offered to it soon after the operation, and continued to feed and grow daily for three months after. The food sometimes passed through the animal; but was generally thrown up again, considerably changed, as in the perfect sea anemone. In about two months, two rows of limbs were perceived growing out of the part where the incision was made. On offering food to this new mouth, it was laid hold of and eaten; and the limbs continually increasing, the animal gradually became as perfect as those which had never been cut. In some instances, however, he found, that, when one of these creatures was cut through, new limbs would be produced from the cut place, those at the mouth remaining as before; so that a monstrous animal was the consequence, having two mouths, and feeding at both ends. Having put some of them into a pan of water, set over a slow fire, he found that they lost their life at 50 degrees of Reaumur's thermometer. To avoid the imputation of cruelty in these experiments, the author argues the favourable consequences that have attended his operations on the sea anemones which have been so fortunate as to fall into his hands; as he hath not only multiplied their existence, but also renewed their youth; which last, he adds, \"is surely no small advantage.\"\n\nIn Hughes's Natural History of Barbadoes, an account is also given of several species of animal flowers. They are there described as only found in a bafon in one particular cave; and of the most remarkable species mentioned by him we have the following description.\n\n\"In the middle of the bafon, there is a fixed stone, or rock, which is always under water. Round its sides, at different depths, seldom exceeding 18 inches, are seen, at all times of the year, issuing out of little holes, certain substances that have the appearance of fine radiated flowers, of a pale yellow, or a bright straw colour, slightly tinged with green, having a circular border of thickset petals, about the size of, and much resembling, those of a single garden marigold, except that the whole of this seeming flower is narrower at the discus, or setting on of the leaves, than any flower of that kind.\n\n\"I have attempted to pluck one of these from the rock, to which they are always fixed; but never could effect it: for as soon as my fingers came within two or three inches of it, it would immediately contract close together its yellow border, and shrink back into the hole of the rock; but if left undisturbed for about four minutes, it would come gradually in sight, expanding, though at first very cautiously, its seeming leaves, till at last it appeared in its former bloom. However, it would again recoil, with a surprising quickness when my hand came within small distance of it. Having tried the same experiment by attempting to touch it with my cane, and a small slender rod, the effect was the same.\n\n\"Though I could not by any means contrive to take or pluck from the rock one of these animals entire; yet once cut off (with a knife which I had held for a long time out of sight, near the mouth of a hole out of which one of these animals appeared) two of these seeming leaves. These, when out of the water, retained their shape and colour; but, being composed of a membrane-like substance, surprisingly thin, it soon shrivelled up, and decayed.\"\n\nThe reproductive power of the Barbadoes animal-flower is prodigious. Many people coming to see these strange creatures, and occasioning some inconvenience to a person through whose grounds they were obliged to pass, he resolved to destroy the objects of their curiosity; and, that he might do so effectually, caused all the holes out of which they appeared, to be carefully bored and drilled with an iron instrument, so that we cannot suppose but their bodies must have been entirely crushed to a pulp: nevertheless, they again appeared in a few weeks from the very same places.\n\nPlate XXXIV. fig. 1. represents the actinia sociata, or clustered animal-flower, described by Mr Ellis, with its radical tube adhering to a rock: (a) One of the animals stretching out its claws.

See Pairing.\n\nANIMALCULE, in general, signifies a little animal; and thus the term might be applied to every animal which is considerably inferior in size to ourselves. It hath been customary, however, to distinguish by the name of animalcules only such animals as are of a size so diminutive, that their true figure cannot be discerned without the assistance of glasses; and more especially it is applied to such as are altogether invisible to the naked eye, and cannot even be perceived to exist but by the assistance of microscopes.\n\nBy the help of magnifying glasses, we are brought into a kind of new world; and numberless animals are discovered, which from their minuteness must otherwise for ever have escaped our observation; and how many kinds of these invisibles there may be, is still unknown; as they are discerned of all sizes, from those which are barely invisible to the naked eye, to such as reflect the action of the microscope, as the fixed stars do that of the telescope, and with the best magnifiers hitherto invented appear only as so many moving points.\n\nThe smallest living creatures our instruments can show are those that inhabit the waters: for though possibly animalcules equally minute, or perhaps more so, may fly in the air, or creep upon the earth, it is scarcely possible to bring such under our examination; but water being transparent, and confining the creatures in it, we are able, by applying a drop of it to our glasses, to discover, to a certain degree of smallness, all that it contains.—Some of the most curious of these animalcules, which have been described by microscopical observers, we shall here give an account of.\n\n1. The Hair-like Insect. This is called by Mr Baker on account of its shape; being extremely slender, and frequently an hundred and fifty times as long as broad. The body or middle part, which is nearly straight, appears, in some, composed of such rings as the windpipe of land animals is made up of; but in others seems rather scaled, or made up of rings that obliquely cross one another. Its two ends are hooked or bent, pretty nearly in the same degree, but in a direction opposite to one another; and as no eyes can be discerned, it is difficult to judge which is the head or tail. Its progressive motion is very singular, being performed by turning upon one end as a centre, and describing almost a quarter of a circle with the other, as represented in the figure. Its motions are very slow, and require much patience and attention in the observer. These creatures are so small, that millions of millions of them might be contained in an inch square. When viewed singly, they are exceedingly transparent, and of a beautiful green colour; but when numbers of them are brought together, they become opaque, lose their green colour, and grow entirely black.\n\nNotwithstanding the extreme minuteness of these animalcules, they seem to be fond of society; for, after viewing for some time a parcel of them taken up at random, they will be seen disposing themselves in a kind of regular order. If a multitude of them are put into a jar of water, they will form themselves into a regular body, and ascend slowly to the top, where after they have remained for some time exposed to the air, their green colour changes to a beautiful sky blue. When they are weary of this situation, they form themselves into a kind of rope, which slowly descends as low as they intend; but if they happen to be close to the side of the jar, they will descend upon it. They are so nearly of the specific gravity of water itself, that they will either remain at the bottom, float on the surface, or be suspended in the middle, according as they are originally placed, or as they themselves have a mind.\n\nA small quantity of the matter containing these animalcules having been put into a jar of water, it so happened, that one part went down immediately to the bottom, whilst the other continued floating on the top. When things had remained for some time in this condition, each of these swarms of animalcules began to grow weary of its situation, and had a mind to change its quarters. Both armies, therefore, set out at the same time, the one proceeding upwards, and the other downwards; so that, after some hours journey, they met in the middle. A desire of knowing how they would be disposed on this occasion, engaged the observer to watch them carefully; and to his surprise he saw the army considerate that was marching upwards, open to the right and left, to make room for those that were descending. Thus, without confusion or intermixture, each held on its way: the army that was going up, marching in two columns to the top, and the other proceeding in one column to the bottom, as if each had been under the direction of wise leaders.\n\nThe hair-like insect was first discovered in a ditch at Norwich, one end of which communicates with the river there, and the other end with a second ditch, into which several kernels empty themselves. The length of this ditch, when Mr Baker wrote his account of this prodigious animalcule, was at least 100 yards, and its breadth nine inches. The bottom, for more than a foot thick, was covered with a blackish green substance, in appearance like mud, made up for the most part of these insects; but, supposing only a half or a quarter part of it to be composed of them, according to the dimensions we have given, their numbers must exceed all imagination.\n\n2. Eels in pastes, &c. When paste is allowed to stand till it becomes four, it is then found to be the habitation of numberless animalcules, which may be discerned by the naked eye; and though their form cannot be perfectly distinguished, their motion is very perceptible, and the whole paste will seem to be animated.\n\nFig. 4 represents one of these anguillae magnified. The most remarkable property of these insects is, that viviparous. If one of them is cut through near the middle, several oval bodies of different sizes will be seen to issue forth. These are young anguillae, each of them coiled up and enclosed in its proper membrane, which is so exquisitely fine, as scarce to be discernible by the greatest magnifier, while it encloses the embryo animal. The largest and most forward immediately break through this covering, unfold themselves, and wriggle about in the water nimbly; others get out, uncoil, and move themselves about more slowly; and the least mature continue entirely without motion. The uterus, or vessel that contains all these oval bodies, is composed of many ringlets, not unlike the apera arteria of land animals, and seems to be considerably elastic; for as soon as the animalcule is cut in two, the oval bodies are thrust out with some degree of violence, from the springing back or action of this bowel. An hundred\nhundred and upwards of the young ones have been seen to issue from the body of one single eel, whereby the prodigious increase of them may be accounted for; as probably several such numerous generations are produced in a short time. They seem to be all prolific; and unless trial happens to be made upon one that has brought forth all its young, or when the paste has been kept for a very long time, the experiment will always succeed.—This property of these cells being viviparous renders it highly improbable that they ever become flies.\n\nAnimalcules of a similar kind are likewise found in vinegar; and, like those already described, are found to be viviparous. But it is not only in acid matters that such appearances are observed. In some fields of wheat, many grains may be observed, that appear blackish outwardly, as if scorched; but when opened are found to contain a soft white substance, which, attentively considered, appears to be nothing else than a congeries of threads or fibres lying close to each other in a parallel direction, much resembling the unruly down of some thistles on cutting open the flower heads before they begin to blow. This fibrous matter discovers not the least sign of life or motion, unless water is applied; but immediately on wetting, provided the grains of wheat have been newly gathered, the supple fibres separate, and appear to be living creatures. Their motions at first are very languid; but gradually become more vigorous, twisting and wriggling themselves somewhat in the manner of the cells in paste, but always slower than they, and with a great deal less regularity.\n\nIf the grains of wheat are grown dry by keeping, and in that condition are cut open, the fibrous matter is very indistinguishable; and, on putting water to it, will separate with great readiness, and seem like fine tubes or threads tapering at both ends: but not the least motion will be perceived till they have been in water for several hours, and sometimes they will never move at all. But if the same grains are steeped in water for three or four hours, or buried for some days in the earth, till they are fully saturated with moisture, and then opened with a penknife; on taking out a small portion of the white matter carefully, and spreading it thin upon a slip of glass, the animalcules will be seen bundled together, and extended longitudinally, but without motion: and though, upon the application of water, they will not revive so soon as those taken from fresh grains, whose moisture has never been exhaled; yet, after remaining an hour or two in water, they are constantly found alive and vigorous, even though the grains have been kept in a dry condition for several years. It is necessary, however, to adapt, in some measure, the time of continuing the grains in water or earth to the age and dryness of them: for if they are not opened before they are too much softened, the animalcules will be dead; and unless the hulls are opened to let those creatures out after they have been steeped, they inevitably perish in them: otherwise, they will continue alive in water for many months; and, should the water dry away, may be revived again by giving them a fresh supply.\n\n3. The Proteus. This animalcule has been dignified by Mr Baker with the name of Proteus, on account of its assuming a great number of different shapes, so scarce to be known as the same animal in its various transformations; and indeed, unless it be carefully watched while passing from one shape to another, it will often become suddenly invisible, as happened more than once to Mr Baker.\n\nWhen water, wherein any sort of vegetable has been where infused, or animals preserved, has stood quietly for found, some days, or weeks, in any glass or other vessel, a flimsy substance will be collected about the sides: some of which being taken up with the point of a penknife, placed on a slip of glass in a drop of water, and looked at through the microscope, will be found to harbour several kinds of little animals that are seldom found swimming about at large; among which the proteus is one. Its shape is better understood from the figure. Its shape, than from any description that could be given. Its colour, &c., substance and colour seems to resemble that of a snail; and its whole shape seems to bear a considerable resemblance to that of a swan. It swims to and fro with great vivacity: but will now and then stop for a minute or two; during which time its long neck is usually employed as far as it can reach, forwards, and on every side, with a somewhat slow, but equable motion, like that of a snake, frequently extending thrice the length of its body, and seemingly in search of food.\n\nThere are no eyes, nor any opening in the head like a mouth, to be discerned: but its actions plainly prove it to be an animal that can see; for though multitudes of different animalcules swim about in the same water, and its own progressive motion is very swift, it never strikes against any of them, but directs its course between them with a dexterity wholly unaccountable, should we suppose it destitute of sight.\n\nWhen the proteus is alarmed, it suddenly draws in its transforming itself into the shape represented in fig. 5, and 6. Transformations, its long neck, represented in fig. 7, when it becomes more opaque, and moves about very slowly with the large end foremost. When it has continued some time in this posture, it will often, instead of the head and neck it had formerly, put forth a new one, with a kind of wheel machinery, represented fig. 8. The motions of which draw a current of water to it from a considerable distance. Having often pulled in and thrust out this short head, sometimes with and sometimes without the wheel work, the creature, as if weary, will remain motionless for a while; then its head and long neck will be very slowly protruded, as in fig. 9, and it soon resumes its former agility. Sometimes it dispenses of its neck and head, as represented in fig. 10.\n\n4. The Wheel Animal, or Vorticella. This wonderful animalcule is found in rain water that has stood where some days in leaden gutters, or in hollows of lead on found, the tops of houses; or in the slime or sediment left by such water; and perhaps may also be found in other places: but if the water standing in gutters of lead, or the sediment left behind it, has anything of a red colour in it, one may be almost certain of finding them therein. Though it discovers no signs of life except when in the water, yet it is capable of continuing alive for many months after it is taken out of the water, and kept in a state as dry as dust. In this state it is of a globular shape, exceeds not the bigness of a grain of sand, and no signs of life appear: but being put into water, in the space of half an hour a languid motion begins, the globule turns itself about, lengthens itself by slow degrees,\ndegrees, assumes the form of a lively maggot, and most commonly in a few minutes afterwards puts out its wheels; swimming vigorously through the water, as if in search of food; or else, fixing itself by the tail, works the wheels in such a manner as to bring its food to it.\n\nFig. 23. and 24. show the wheel animal in its globular form; fig. 11. and 12. in its maggot state; and figs. 13., 14., 15., 16., 17., 18., 19., 20., 21., and 22., show the different appearances of its wheels, and also its various intermediate changes between the globular and maggot state.\n\nThe most remarkable part of this animalcule is its wheel work. This consists of a couple of semicircular instruments, round the edges of which many little fibrillae move themselves very briskly, sometimes with a kind of rotation, and sometimes in a trembling or vibrating manner. When in this state, it sometimes unfurls its tail, and swims along with a great deal of swiftness, seemingly in pursuit of its prey. Sometimes the wheels seem to be entire circles, armed with small teeth, like those of the balance wheel of a watch, appearing projected forwards beyond the head, and extending sidewise somewhat wider than its diameter. The teeth or cogs of these wheels seem to stand very regularly at equal distances; but the figure of them varies according to their position, the degree of their protrusion, and perhaps the will of the animal itself. They appear sometimes like minute oblong squares, rising at right angles from the periphery of a circle, like ancient battlements on a round tower; at other times they terminate in sharp points, and altogether resemble a kind of Gothic crown. They are often seen in a kind of curvular direction, all bending the same way, and seeming like so many hooks; and now and then the ends of them will be perceived to be clubbed like mallets. This figure, however, as well as the first, they assume but rarely.\n\nAs these wheels are everywhere excessively transparent, except about their circular rim or edge, where the cogs are set, it is very difficult to determine by what contrivance they are turned about, or what their real figure is, though they seem exactly to resemble wheels moving round upon an axis. It is hardly possible to be certain whether those circular bodies in which the teeth are set, are of a flat form, or hollow and conical; but they seem rather to be of a conical figure. The difficulty of conceiving how an articulation could be contrived so as to cause a real rotation, hath caused many people imagine that there was a deception in this case. But Mr Baker affirms us, that when the wheels are fully protruded, they never fail to show all the visible marks of a regular rotation; and, in some positions, the same cogs or teeth may be traced by the eye during a complete revolution.\n\nAll the actions of this creature seem to imply sagacity and quickness of sensation. At the least touch or motion in the water, they instantly draw in their wheels; and Mr Baker conjectures, that their eyes are lodged somewhere about the wheels; because, while in the maggot state, its motions are slow and blundering; but after the wheels are protruded, they are performed with great regularity, swiftness, and readiness.\n\nNotwithstanding the minuteness of this animalcule, the microscope generally discovers others in the same drop of water, compared with which the wheel animalcule may be said to be a whale. The transparency of its body, therefore, allows its internal parts to be seen, which cannot be perceived in the minute animalcules, on account of the smallness of their size. A, is the appearance of the head; and though it is everywhere transparent, a ring or circle, more particularly remarkable for its clearness, is commonly perceived about the middle of the forehead, a little above the mouth. This, Mr Baker thinks, might justly be called the seat of the brain. Many vessels which seem to take their origin from thence are discernible in the head; wherein some transparent fluid appears continually agitated by a kind of fluctuating motion.\n\nThe thorax, B, is joined to the head by a very short neck, C, and appears to be about the fifth part of the whole length of the animal. In the middle of the thorax is placed the heart, D, where its systole and diastole are plainly visible. It is seen through the back of the insect, shutting and opening alternately with great regularity and exactness. Its size is proportional to the creature's size; and its shape, during the systole, is nearly circular, being composed seemingly of two semilunar parts, which then approach each other laterally, and form between them a roundish or horfic shoe-like figure, whose upper side is flat, and the under one convex. The diastole is performed by a seeming separation, or opening, of these two semilunar parts, whereby the transverse diameter of the heart is very much enlarged. This separation begins exactly in the middle of the lower part next the tail; and opens to such a considerable width upwards, that the two parts, when at their utmost dilatation, seem only joined by an arched vessel at their anterior end. The alternate motions of contraction and dilatation are performed with great strength and vigour, in pretty much the same time as the pulsation of the arteries of a man in health. The motions of the heart are communicated to all the internal parts of the thorax, and seem to extend a great deal further; for a strict examination discovers, at the same time, throughout the whole animal, contractions and dilatations going on, that are apparently correspondent thereto. These motions of the heart, however, are sometimes suspended or imperceptible for two or three minutes; after which they are renewed, and go on again with the same regularity as before. From the under part of the thorax proceeds a small transparent horn represented at A, fig. 11. and 12. It is never visible but when the animal turns on its back or side.\n\nThe blood or circulating fluid of the wheel animal is so absolutely colourless, that the current of it through the vessel is indistinguishable by glases. A sort of irregular agitation of some fluid is indeed perceived, which is perhaps a compound motion of currents running different ways, and forming such an appearance, though no single current is anywhere distinctly visible.\n\nImmediately below the thorax is another annular division, E, joining upwards to the thorax and downwards to the abdomen, the entrance whereof it serves occasionally to enlarge or diminish. The abdomen, F, is by much the largest part of the animal, and contains the stomach and intestines. When the insect is full of food, these bowels appear opaque and of a blood-red colour, extending quite through the belly and great\npart of the tail, and exhibiting a variety of contractions and dilatations. The belly is capable of stretching out greatly in length, or being shortened very much, and widening its diameter. It assumes many shapes, and becomes occasionally a case for all the other parts of the body.\n\nBesides the above mentioned one, there are found in the waters several other species of animals furnished with wheels, some of which appear to have a rotatory, and others a vibratory motion. Fig. 25 represents a kind found in the ditch at Norwich, where the hair-like insect is produced. They differ from the foregoing only in having very long tails. Fig. 26, 27, and 28 represent a species of wheel animals, which are also covered with shells. The body of this species consists of three parts, in like manner as the other; only the thorax and abdomen, in this, are not separated by any gut, or intermediate vessel, but are joined immediately together. The heart is plainly perceived, having a regular systole and diastole, at a, as in the former species. These creatures occasionally draw themselves entirely within their shells; and the shell then appears terminated by six short spikes on one side and two on the other.\n\nThe young ones of this species are carried in oval faculi, or integuments, fastened externally on the lower part of their shells somewhere about the tail; these faculi are sometimes opaque only at one end, and seemingly empty at the other; sometimes they appear opaque in the middle, with a transparency all round, as in fig. 26. When the young one is about to burst its integuments, the parent afflicts it greatly, by wagging its tail, and striking the oval bag, so that the young one's head becomes as it were forced into the water, though the tail cannot be so soon disengaged. In this condition the young one sets its wheel a-going, and exerts all its endeavours to free itself from its confinement. When it has got clear, it swims away, wagging its tail as the old one does, and leaving the integument adhering to the shell of the parent. The old one then uses a number of efforts to get rid of this incumbrance, striking against it with her tail, fixing the end of her tail upon it, and then darting her body forward; with several very odd motions not easy to be described. This kind of wheel animals are great tormentors of the water flea, Pulex aquaticus arborecens of Swammerdam; of which a figure is given from that author (Plate XXXVI.) fig. 2 shows the natural size of the flea; and fig. 1. shows it magnified, with some of the wheel animals adhering to it. These insects are often found in great numbers in the same water: and when that is the case, it is not uncommon to discover five or six of these crustaceous wheel animals fastened by their tail to the shell or horns of the flea; causing it, seemingly, a vast deal of uneasiness: nor can they be driven away, or shaken off, by all the efforts the flea can use for that purpose.\n\n5. The Bell-flower Animal, or Plumed Polype. These animalcules dwell in colonies together, from ten to fifteen (rarely falling short of the former number, or exceeding the latter), in a slimy kind of mucilaginous or gelatinous case; which, out of the water, has no determined form, appearing like a little lump of flint; but, when expanded therein, has some resemblance to the figure of a bell with its mouth upwards; and is usually about half an inch long, and a quarter of an inch in diameter. These bells, or colonies, are to be found adhering to the large leaves of duckweed, and other aquatic plants. They may be most easily discovered by letting a quantity of water, with duckweed in it, stand quietly for three or four hours in glass vessels in a window, or other place whence a strong light comes: for then, if any are about the duckweed, they will be found, on careful inspection, extending themselves out of their cases, and making an elegant appearance.\n\nThe bell, or case, which these animals inhabit, being very transparent, all the motions of its inhabitants may be discerned through it distinctly. It seems divided internally into several apartments, or rather to contain several smaller faculi, each of which encloses one of these animals. The openings at the tops of these faculi, are but just sufficient to admit the creature's head and a small part of its body to be thrust out beyond them, the rest remaining always in the case. It can, however, occasionally retire into its case altogether; and never fails to do so when alarmed by any sudden motion of the water, or of the vessel which contains it.\n\nBesides the particular and separate motion which each of these creatures is able to exert within its own case the whole and independent of the rest; the whole colony together, has a power of altering the position of the bell, or even of removing it from one place to another; and hence this bell is sometimes found standing perfectly upright, as in fig. 29. and 33, and sometimes bending the upper part downwards, as in fig. 30. As these animalcules seem not to choose to stay together in societies whose number exceeds 15, when the colony happens to increase in number, the bell may be observed to split gradually, beginning from about the middle of the upper or anterior extremity, and proceeding downwards towards the bottom, as in fig. 32. till they at last separate entirely, and become two complete colonies independent of each other, one of which sometimes removes to another part of the vessel.\n\nThe arms of each individual of this colony are set round the head, to the number of 40, having each the appearance of an Italic f, one of whose hooked ends is fastened to the head; and all together, when expanded, compose a figure shaped somewhat like a horse's shoe, convex on one side next the body, but gradually opening and turning outwards, so as to leave a considerable area within the outer extremities of the arms. When the arms are thus extended, the creature, by giving them a vibrating motion, can produce a current in the water, which brings the animalcules, or whatever other minute bodies are within the sphere of its action, with great velocity to its mouth, situated between the arms; where they are taken in if liked, or driven away by a contrary motion. The food is conveyed immediately from the mouth or opening between the arms, through a narrow neck, into a passage seemingly correspondent to the oesophagus in land animals; down which it passes into the stomach, where it remains for some time, and then is voided upwards, in small round pellets, through a gut whose exit is near the neck. The body consists of three divisions; in the uppermost of which are contained all the above-mentioned integines, which are only to be discerned when the creature is full, at which time they become opaque. The other two divisions,\nvisions, which are probably fixed to the bell, seem to be of no other use than to give the creature a power of contraction and extension. The arms are not able to contract like those of the common polype; but when the animal retires into its case, they are brought together in a close and curious order, so as to be easily drawn in. Though their general appearance, when expanded, is that of a cup whose base and top are of an horse-hoe form, they sometimes separate into four parts, and range themselves as in fig. 36, so as to resemble four separate plumes of feathers. Though their eyes cannot be discovered, yet Mr Baker thinks they have some perception of the light: for when kept in the dark, they always remain contracted; but on being exposed to the light of the sun or of a candle, they constantly extend their arms, and show evident signs of being pleased.\n\nFig. 29 represents one complete colony or bell standing erect, with all the animals out of their kingdom, and their arms extended, exhibiting all together a very pretty appearance. \\(a\\) represents two oval bodies, supposed by Mr Baker to be eggs.\n\nFig. 30 shows all the creatures withdrawn into their cells, and the end of the bell hanging downwards.\n\nFig. 31 shows the bell erect, with only one of the animals coming out, in order to show its connexion with the bell.\n\nFig. 34 shows the head and arms of a single polype closing together, and disposing themselves in order to be drawn into the bell.\n\nFig. 35 shows one complete animal greatly magnified, to show its several parts more distinctly; viz. \\(a\\), the head, resembling a horse hoe; \\(b\\), the arms seen from one side; \\(c\\), the narrow neck; \\(d\\), the cephalogus; \\(e\\), the stomach; \\(f\\), the gut or last intestine through which the food passes after being digested in the stomach; \\(g\\), the anus, where the faeces are discharged in little pellets; \\(h\\), that part of the bell which surrounds the body of the animal, and cloths upon it when it retires down.\n\nFig. 37. The head and arms seen in front.\n\n6. The Globe animal. This animalcule, represented fig. 38, seems exactly globular, having no appearance of either head, tail, or fins. It moves in all directions, forwards or backwards, up or down, either rolling over and over like a bowl, spinning horizontally like a top, or gliding along smoothly without turning itself at all. Sometimes its motions are slow, at other times very swift; and, when it pleases, it can turn round, as it were upon an axis, very nimbly, without removing out of its place. The whole body is transparent, except where the circular black spots are shown in the figure. Some of the animals have no spots, and others from one to seven. The surface of the whole body appears, in some, as if all over dotted with points; in others, as if granulated like flagstone: but their more general appearance is, as if beiet thinly round with short moveable hairs or bristles, which probably are the instruments by which their motions are performed. These animalcules may be seen by the naked eye, but appear only like moving points.\n\n7. The Pipe animal. These creatures are found on the coast of Norfolk, living in small tubes or cases of sandy matter, in such multitudes as to compose a mass sometimes of three feet in length. Fig. 39 shows a piece of such a congeries broke off, where \\(aaa\\) represent the mouths or openings of the pipes wherein the little animals make their abode. Fig. 40 shows one single pipe, with its inhabitant, separated from the rest, and magnified nine or ten times in diameter. The pipe or case \\(b\\) is made of sand, intermixed here and there with minute shells, and all cemented together by a glutinous slime, probably issuing from the animal's own body \\(c\\), which is composed of muscular ringlets like those of a worm, capable of great extension or contraction. The anterior end or head, \\(d\\), is exceedingly beautiful, having round it a double row of little arms disposed in a very regular order, and probably capable of extension, in order to catch its food, and bring it to its mouth. Some of these tubes are found petrified, and constitute one species of syringoides.\n\n8. An Insect with net-like arms. The properties and shape of this little animal are very extraordinary. It is found only in calcareous, where the water runs very swift. There these insects are found in clusters, standing erect on their tails; and resembling, when all together, the combs of bees at the time they are filled with their aurelie. On being taken out of the water, they spin threads, by which they hang exactly in the same manner as the garden spider. Fig. 42 shows one of these insects magnified. Its body appears curiously turned as on a lathe; and at the tail are three sharp spines, on which it raises itself, and stands upright in the water; but the most curious apparatus is about its head, where it is furnished with two instruments like fans or nets, which serve to provide its food. These it frequently spreads out and draws in again; and when drawn up, they are folded together with the utmost nicety and exactness, so as to be indiscernible when brought close to the body. At the bottom of these fans a couple of claws are fastened to the lower part of the head, which, every time the nets are drawn in, conduct to the mouth of the animal whatever is taken in them. When the creature does not employ its nets, it thrusts out a pair of sharp horns, as in fig. 41, where the insect is shown magnified about 400 times.\n\nSome of these creatures being kept with water in a vial, most of them died in two days; and the rest, having spun themselves transparent cases (which were fastened either to the sides of the glass, or to pieces of glass put into it), seemed to be changed into a kind of chrysalis: but, before taking this form, they appeared as in fig. 43, which shape they likewise assumed when weary with catching their food, or when lying in wait for it. None of them lived above three days; and though fresh water was given them two or three times a day, yet, in a few hours, it would shrink to a degree scarcely conceivable, and that too at several yards' distance, though, in proportion to the water, all the property included insects were not more than as 1 to 15,000. This makes it probable, that it is necessary for them to live in a rapid stream, lest they should be poisoned by the effluvia issuing from their own bodies, as no doubt they were in the vial.\n\n9. A curious aquatic worm. This animalcule is shown, magnified, at fig. 31. It is found in ditch water; and is of various sizes, from \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of an inch in length. About the head it is somewhat of a yellowish colour; but all the rest of the body is perfectly colourless and transparent, except the intestines, which are considerably.\nconsiderably opaque, and disposed as in the figure. Along its sides are several papillae, with long hairs growing from them; it has two black eyes, and is very nimble. But the most remarkable thing in this creature is a long horn or proboscis; which, in the large ones, may be seen with the naked eye, if the water is clear, and is sometimes \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch in length: this it waves to and fro as it moves in the water, or creeps up the side of the glass; but it is not known whether it is hollow, or of what use it is to the creature itself.\n\n10. Spermatic Animals, and Animalcula Infusoria. The discovery of living animalcules in the semen of most animals is claimed by Mr Leeuwenhoek and Mr Nicholas Hartsoeker, who both say they published it about the end of the year 1677 or beginning of 1678: but Mr Leeuwenhoek having given the most particular description of, and made by far the greatest number of experiments concerning them, the discovery is commonly attributed to him.\n\nAccording to this naturalist, these animalcules are found in the semen of every kind of animal: but their general appearance is very much the same, nor doth their size differ in proportion to the bulk of the animal to which they belong. The bodies of all of them seem to be of an oblong oval form, with long tapering slender tails issuing from them; and as by this shape they resemble tadpoles, they have been frequently called by that name; though the tails of them, in proportion to their bodies, are much longer than the tails of tadpoles are: and it is observable, that the animalcules in the semen of fishes have tails much longer and more slender than the tails of those in other animals; insomuch, that the extremity of them is not to be discerned without the best glasses, and the utmost attention. Fig. 21. No 1, 2, 3, 4, represent the spermatic animalcule of the rabbit; and No 5, 6, 7, 8, those of a dog; according to Mr Leeuwenhoek.\n\nThe numbers of these animalcules are inconceivable. On viewing with a microscope the milt or semen of a living cod fish, innumerable multitudes of animalcules were found therein of such a diminutive size, that he supposed at least 10,000 of them capable of being contained in the bulk of a grain of sand; whence he concludes, that the milt of this single fish contained more living animalcules than there are to be found people living in the whole world. To find the comparative size of these animalcules, Mr Leeuwenhoek placed a hair of his head near them; which hair, through his microscope, appeared an inch in breadth; and he was satisfied, that at least 60 such animalcules could easily lie within that diameter; whence, their bodies being spherical, it follows, that 216,000 of them are but equal to a globe whose diameter is the breadth of a hair. He observed, that when the water wherewith he had diluted the semen of a cod fish was exhaled, the little bodies of the animalcules burst in pieces; which did not happen to those in the semen of a ram: and this he imputes to the greater firmness and consistency of the latter, as the flesh of a land animal is more compact than fish.\n\nThese animalcules appear to be very vigorous, and tenacious of life; for they may be observed to move long after the animal from which they are taken is dead. They have this peculiarity also that they are continually in motion, without the least rest or intermission, provided there is fluid sufficient for them to swim about in. These animalcules are peculiar to the semen; nothing that has the least token of life being discovered, by the best glasses, either in the blood, spittle, urine, gall, or chyle. Great numbers, however, are to be found in the whitish matter that sticks between the teeth; some of which are of an oval figure, and others resemble eggs.\n\nThe Animalcula Infusoria take their name from their being found in all kinds either of vegetable or animal infusions. Indeed, there is scarce any kind of water, unless impregnated with some mineral substance, but what will discover living creatures.—Mr Leeuwenhoek says, that at first he could discern no living creatures in rain water; but after standing some days, he discovered innumerable animalcules, many thousands of times less than a grain of sand, and in proportion to a mite as a bee is to a horse.—In other rain water, which had likewise stood some time, he found the smallest fort he had ever seen; and, in a few days more, met with others eight times as big as these, and almost round. In another quantity of rain water that had been exposed like the former, he discovered a kind of animalcules with two little horns in continual motion. The space between the horns was flat, though the body was roundish, but tapering a little towards the end; where a tail appeared, four times as long as the body, and the thickness of a spider's web. He observed several hundreds of these within the space a grain of sand would occupy. If they happened on the least filament or string, they were entangled in it; and then would extend their bodies into an oblong round, and struggle hard to disengage their tails. He observed a second fort of an oval figure, and imagined the head to stand at the sharpest end. The body was flat, with several small feet moving exceeding quick, but not discernible without a great deal of attention. Sometimes they changed their shape into a perfect round, especially when the water began to dry away. He met also with a third fort, twice as long, as broad, and eight times smaller than the first; yet in these he discerned little feet, whereby they moved very nimbly. He perceived likewise a fourth fort, a thousand times smaller than a loupe's eye, and which exceeded all the rest in briskness: he found these turning themselves round, as it were upon a point, with the celerity of a top. And he says, there were several other forts.\n\nThe production of animalcula infusoria is very surprising. In four hours time, an infusion of cantharides production has produced animalcula less than even the tails of these spermatic animals we have already described. Neither do they seem to be subject to the fate of other animals; but, several kinds of them at least, by dividing themselves in two, to enjoy a fort of immortality. Nor do the common methods by which other animals are destroyed, seem to be effectual for destroying their vital principle. Hot mutton gravy, secured in a phial with a cork, and afterwards set among hot ashes to destroy as effectually as possible every living creature that could be supposed to exist in it, has nevertheless been found swarming with animalcules after standing a few days. In the Philosophical Transactions, Vol. LIX., we have Mr Ellis's account of animalcules produced from an infusion of potatoes and of hempseed.\n\n\"Ouatoes.\"\nOn the 25th of May 1768, Fahrenheit's thermometer 70°, I boiled a potato in the New River water till it was reduced to a mealy consistence. I put part of it, with an equal proportion of the boiling liquor, into a cylindrical glass vessel that held something less than half a wine pint, and covered it close immediately with a glass cover. At the same time, I sliced an unboiled potato; and, as near as I could judge, put the same quantity into a glass vessel of the same kind; with the same proportion of New River water not boiled; and covered it with a glass cover; and placed both vessels close to each other.\n\nOn the 26th of May, 24 hours afterwards, I examined a small drop of each, by the first magnifier of Wilson's microscope, whose focal distance is reckoned at \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) part of an inch; and, to my amazement, they were both full of animalcula of a linear shape, very distinguishable, moving to and fro with great celerity; so that there appeared to be more particles of animal than vegetable life in each drop.\n\nThis experiment I have repeatedly tried, and always found it to succeed in proportion to the heat of the circumambient air; so that even in winter, if the liquors are kept properly warm, at least in two or three days the experiment will succeed.\n\nWhat I have observed are infinitely smaller than spermatic animals, and of a very different shape: the truth of which every accurate observer will soon be convinced of, whose curiosity may lead him to compare them; and I am persuaded he will find they are no way akin.\n\nAt present I shall pass over many other curious observations, which I have made on two years experiments, in order to proceed to the explaining a hint which I received last January from M. de Saussure of Geneva, when he was here; which is, that he found one kind of these animalcula infusoria that increase by dividing across into nearly two equal parts.\n\nI had often seen this appearance in various species a year or two ago, as I found upon looking over the minutes I had taken when I made any new observation; but always supposed the animal, when in this state, to be in coition.\n\nNot hearing till after M. de Saussure left this kingdom, from what infusion he had made his observation; his friend Dr de la Roche of Geneva informed me, the latter end of February last, that it was from hempseed.\n\nI immediately procured hempseed from different seedsmen in different parts of the town. Some of it I put into New River water, some into distilled water, and some I put into very hard pump water. The result was, that in proportion to the heat of the weather, or the warmth in which they were kept, there was an appearance of millions of minute animalcula in all the infusions; and, some time after, some oval ones made their appearance, as at fig. 3, b, c. These were much larger than the first, which still continued; they wriggled to and fro in an undulatory motion, turning themselves round very quick all the time that they moved forwards. I was very attentive to see these animals divide themselves; and at last I perceived a few of the appearance of fig. 3, a, as it is represented by the first magnifier of Wilson's microscope; but I am so well convinced by experience that they would separate, that I did not wait to see the operation: however, as the following sketches, which I have drawn from five other species, will very fully explain this extraordinary phenomenon, there will be no difficulty in conceiving the manner of the first. See figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\nThe proportion of the number of these animals which I have observed to divide in this manner, to the rest, is scarce 1 to 50; so that it appears rather to arise from hurts received by some few animalcula among the many, than to be the natural manner in which these kinds of animals multiply; especially if we consider the infinite quantity of young ones which are visible to us through the transparent skins of their bodies, and even the young ones that are visible in those young ones while in the body of the old ones.\n\nBut nothing more plainly shows them to be zoophytes than this circumstance. That when, by accident, the extremity of their bodies has been shrivelled for want of a supply of fresh water, the applying more fresh water has given motion to the part of the animal that was still alive; by which means, this shapeless figure has continued to live and swim to and fro all the time it was supplied with fresh water.\n\nI cannot finish this part of my remarks on these animals, without observing, that the excellent Linnaeus has joined the beroë with the volvox, one of the animalcula infusoria. The beroë is a marine animal, found on our coast; of a gelatinous transparent nature, and scribbled of an oval or spherical form, from half an inch to an inch diameter; divided like a melon into longitudinal ribs, each of which is furnished with rows of minute fins; by means of which, this animal, like the animalcula infusoria, can swim in all directions with great swiftness. In the same manner I have seen most of those minute animals move so swift that we could not account for it, without supposing such a provision in nature, which is really true, but cannot be seen till the animals grow faint for want of water; then, if we attend, we may with good glasses plainly discover them.\n\nI have lately found out, by mere accident, a method to make their fins appear very distinctly, especially in the larger kind of animalcula, which are common to most vegetable infusions; such as the tercibella. This has a longish body, with a cavity or groove at one end, like a gimlet; by applying, then, a small flake of the horse-tloe geranium (or geranium zonale of Linnaeus), fresh broken, to a drop of water in which these animalcula are swimming we shall find that they will become torpid instantly; contracting themselves into an oblong oval shape, with their fins extended like to many brittle tails round their bodies. The fins are in length about half the diameter of the middle of their bodies. Before I discovered this expedient, I tried to kill them by different kinds of salts and spirits; but though they were destroyed by this means, their fins were so contracted, that I could not distinguish them in the least. After lying in this state of torpidity for two or three minutes, if a drop of clean water is applied to them, they will recover their shape, and swim about immediately, rendering their fins again invisible.\n\nFig. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, represent different species of animalcula infusoria, mentioned by Mr Ellis as belonging to the genus of volvox of Linnaeus.\n\nFig. 3, represents the volvox ovalis, or egg-shaped volvox.\nvolvox; at (b) and (c) it is expressed in its natural shape; at (a) the manner in which it becomes two animals, by separating across the middle. This was found in the infusion of hempseed; but is found in other vegetable infusions, particularly that of tea seed.\n\nFig. 4. is the volvox torquilla, or wryneck. At (a) is represented its divided state; at (b) and (c) its natural state; this is common to most vegetable infusions, as is the following.\n\nFig. 5. is the volvox volutans, or the roller. At (a) the animal is separated, and becomes two distinct beings, each swimming about and providing for itself: this is often the prey of another species of this genus, especially while it is weak by this separation, not being so active for some time till it can recover itself. At (c) the animal appears to be hurt on one side; this impression in a little time is succeeded by another in the opposite side, as at (b), which soon occasions a division. At (d) is the side view, and at (e) the front view, of the natural shape of the animal.\n\nFig. 6. is the volvox unicus, or wood-louse. At (a) is the natural shape of it, as it appears full of little hairs both at the head and tail; with those at the head, it whirls the water about to draw its prey to it; the feet, which are many, are very visible, but remarkably so in a side-view at (d). At (b) it is represented beginning to divide; and at (c) the animals are ready to part: in this state, as if in exquisite pain, they swim round and round, and to and fro, with uncommon velocity, violently agitated till they get afurred. This was found in an infusion of different kinds of pine branches.\n\nFig. 7. is the volvox terrebella, or the gimlet. This is one of the largest of the kind, and is very visible to the naked eye. It moves along swiftly, turning itself round as it swims, just as if boring its way. (a) and (b) are two views of its natural shape, (c) shows the manner of its dividing. When they are separated, the lower animal rolls very awkwardly along, till it gets a groove in the upper part. (d) represents one of them lying torpid, by means of the juice of the horde-thoe geranium, with its fins extended. This animal is found in many infusions, particularly of grats or corn.\n\nFig. 8. is the volvox vorax, or glutton. This animal was found in an infusion of the Tartarian pine; it varies its shape very much, contracting and extending its proboscis, turning it to and fro, in various directions, as at a, b, c, d, e. It opens its proboscis underneath the extremity, when it seizes its prey. The less active animals, that have lately been divided, such as those at fig. 3. (a), and at fig. 4. (a), serve it as food, when they come in its way: these it swallows down instantly, as it is represented at fig. 8. h and i. At (f) it is ready to divide, and at (g) it is divided; where the hinder part of the divided animal has got a proboscis or beak, to procure nourishment for itself, and soon becomes a distinct being from the fore part.\n\nThus we have given as full an account as our limits would admit, of the most curious kinds of animalcules that have hitherto been observed. We cannot, however, dismiss this subject, without taking notice of some of the most remarkable hypotheses which have been formed concerning their nature and origin.\n\nBefore the invention of microscopes, the doctrine of equivocal generation, both with regard to animals and plants of some kinds, was universally received: but this instrument soon convinced every intelligent person, that those plants which formerly were supposed to be produced by equivocal generation arose from seeds, and the equivocal animals, in like manner, from a male and female. But as the microscope threw light upon one part of nature, it left another involved in darkness: for the origin of the animalcula infutoria, or of the spermatic animals already mentioned, remains as yet as much unknown as that of many other kinds was when the doctrine of equivocal generation reigned in full force.\n\nThe discovery of spermatic animalcules was thought to throw some light on the mysterious affair of generation itself, and these minute creatures were imagined to be each of them individuals of the same species with the parent. Here the infinite number of these animalcules was an objection, and the difficulty remained as great as before: for, as every one of these animalcules behoved to be produced from a male and female to explain their origin by animalcular generation in the same manner, was only explaining generation by itself.\n\nThis hypothesis, therefore, having proved unsatisfactory, others have been invented. M. Buffon, particularly, hath invented one, by which he at once annihilates the whole animalcular world; and in this he hath been followed by several very ingenious philosophers. For a particular account of this, so far as it concerns generation, we must refer to that article; but as he gives such a particular account of his having examined the human semen, that we cannot doubt of his accuracy, we shall here contrast his account with that of Mr Leeuwenhoek already mentioned.\n\nHaving procured the seminal vesicles of a man who died a violent death, he extracted all the liquor from them while they were still warm; and having examined a drop of it with a double microscope, it had the appearance, fig. 9. Large filaments appeared, which in some places spread out into branches, and in others intermingled with one another. These filaments clearly appeared to be agitated by an internal undulatory motion, like hollow tubes, which contained some moving substance. He saw distinctly this appearance changed for that fig. 10. Two of these filaments, which were joined longitudinally, gradually separated from each other in the middle, alternately approaching and receding, like two tense cords fixed by the ends, and drawn asunder in the middle. These filaments were composed of globules that touched one another, and resembled a chaplet of beads. After this, he observed the filament swelled in several places, and perceived small globular bodies issue from the swelled parts, which had a vibratory motion like a pendulum. These small bodies were attached to the filaments by small threads, which gradually lengthened as the bodies moved. At last, the small bodies detached themselves entirely from the filaments, drawing after them the small thread, which looked like a tail. When a drop of the seminal liquor was diluted, these small bodies moved in all directions very briskly; and had he not seen them separate themselves from the filaments, he would, he says, have thought them to be animals. The seminal matter was at first too thick, but gradually became more fluid; and, in proportion as its fluidity increased, the filaments disappeared.\nAnimalcule disappeared, but the small bodies became exceedingly numerous. Each of them had a long thread or tail attached to it, from which it evidently endeavoured to get free. Their progressive motion was extremely slow, during which they vibrated to the right and left, and at each vibration they had a rolling unsteady motion in a vertical direction.\n\nAt the end of two or three hours, the seminal matter becoming still more fluid, a greater number of these moving bodies appeared. They were then more free of encumbrances; their tails were shorter; their progressive motion was more direct, and their horizontal motion greatly diminished. In five or six hours, the liquor had acquired almost all the fluidity it could acquire, without being decomposed. Most of the small bodies were now disengaged from their threads; their figure was oval. They moved forward with considerable quickness, and, by their irregular motions backward and forward, they had now more than ever the appearance of animals. Those that had tails adhering to them, seemed to have less vivacity than the others; and of those that had no tails, some altered both their figure and their size. In twelve hours, the liquor had deposited at the bottom of the vial a kind of ash-coloured gelatinous substance, and the fluid at top was almost as transparent as water. The little bodies being now entirely freed from their threads, moved with great agility, and some of them turned round their centres. They also often changed their figures, from oval becoming round, and often breaking into smaller ones. Their activity always increased as their size diminished. In 24 hours, the liquor had deposited a greater quantity of gelatinous matter, which, being with some difficulty diluted in water, exhibited an appearance somewhat resembling lace. In the clear semen itself only a few small bodies were now seen moving; next day, these were still farther diminished; and after this nothing was to be seen but globules, without the least appearance of motion.\n\nMost of the above-mentioned appearances are shown figs. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Figs. 17, and 18 represent an appearance of the globules in another experiment, in which they arranged themselves in troops, and patted very quickly over the field of the microscope. In this experiment they were found to proceed from a small quantity of gelatinous mucilage.\n\nFrom these experiments, M. Buffon concludes, that what have been called spermatic animals, are not creatures really endowed with life, but something proper to compose a living creature; and he distinguished them by the name of organic particles. The same individual kinds of animals he declares he has found in the fluids separated from the ovaria of females; and for the truth of this appeals to the testimony of Mr Needham, who was an eye witness of his experiments. He also brings an additional proof of his doctrine from Mr Needham's observation on the milt of the calmar, a species of cuttle fish. Here the spermatic animals, at least what have the only appearance of life, are vastly larger than in any other creature, so as to be plainly visible to the naked eye. When magnified, they appear as at fig. 19, and 20. Their first appearance is at fig. 19, a and b, when they resemble springs enclosed in a transparent case. These springs were equally perfect at first as afterwards; only in time they contracted themselves, and became like a kind of screw. The head of the case is a species of valve which opens outward, and through which every thing within may be forced out. It contains, besides, another valve b, a little barrel c, and a spongy substance d e. Thus the whole machine consists of an outer transparent cartilaginous case a, the superior extremity of which is terminated by a round head formed by the case itself, and performs the office of a valve. This external case contains a transparent tube which includes the spring, a piston or valve, a little barrel, and a spongy substance. The screw occupies the superior part of the tube and case, the piston and barrel are situated in the middle, and the spongy substance occupies the inferior part. These machines pump the liquor of the milt; the spongy substance is full of this liquor; and, before the animal spawns, the whole milt is only a congeries of these bodies which have sucked up all the liquor of it. Whenever these small machines are taken out of the body of the animal, and put in water, or exposed to the air, they begin to act, as represented fig. 19, and 20; the spring mounts up, and is followed by the piston, the barrel, and the spongy substance which contains the liquor; and, as soon as the spring and the tube in which it is contained begin to issue out of the case, the spring plait, and the whole internal apparatus moves, till the spring, the piston, and the barrel, have entirely escaped from the case. When this is effected, all the rest infinitely follow, and the milky liquor which had been pumped in, and confined in the spongy substance, runs out through the barrel.\n\nAccording to this account, the milt of the calmar contains no animalcules; and therefore we may from against the analogy conclude, that the small moving bodies which are to be seen in the semen of other animals, are not really creatures endowed with life. M. Buffon extends the analogy still further; and concludes, that all the moving bodies which are to be found in the infusions either of animal or vegetable substances are of a similar nature. \"To discover (says he) whether all the parts of animals, and all the seeds of plants, contained moving organic particles, I made infusions of the flesh of different animals, and of the seeds of more than 20 different species of vegetables; and after remaining some days in clothe glasses, I had the pleasure of seeing organic moving particles in all of them. In some they appeared sooner, in others later; some preserved their motions for months, and others soon lost it. Some at first produced large moving globules resembling animals, which changed their figure, split, and became gradually smaller. Others produced only small globules, whose motions were extremely rapid; and others produced filaments, which grew longer, seemed to vegetate, and then swelled and poured forth torrents of moving globules.\"\n\nThis last observation gave rise to a new system. Baron von Munchausen, perceiving that the last-mentioned moving globules, after moving for some time, began again to vegetate, concluded that they were first animals and then plants. This strange hypothesis Mr Ellis disproved has overturned in the paper already quoted; in which by Mr Ellis he affirms, that they are no other than the seeds of that genus of fungi called mucor or moulding, and that their motion is owing to numbers of minute animalcules attacking them for food. \"Having (says he), at the request of Dr Linnaeus, made several experiments...\"\non the infusion of mushrooms in water, in order to prove the theory of Baron Munchausen, that their seeds are first animals, and then plants (which he takes notice of in his System of Nature, p. 1326, under the genus of chaos, by the name of chaos fungorum seminum), it appeared evidently, that the seeds were put into motion by very minute animalcules, which proceeded from the putrefaction of the mushroom: for by pecking at these seeds, which are reddish, light, round bodies, they moved them about with great agility in a variety of directions; while the little animals themselves were scarcely visible, till the food they had eaten had discovered them. The satisfaction I received from clearing up this point, led me into many other curious and interesting experiments.\n\n\"The ingenious Mr Needham supposes these little transparent ramified filaments, and jointed or coralloid bodies, which the microscope discovers to us on the surface of most animal and vegetable infusions when they become putrid, to be zoophytes, or branched animals; but to me they appear after a careful scrutiny with the best glasses, to be of that genus of fungi called mucor, or mouldiness; many of which Michelis has figured, and Linnaeus has accurately described.\n\n\"Their vegetation is so amazingly quick, that they may be perceived in the microscope even to grow and feed under the eye of the observer.\n\n\"Mr Needham has pointed out to us a species that is very remarkable for its parts of fructification. (See Philosophical Transactions, vol. xlv. tab. 5, fig. 3, a, A.) This, he says, proceeds from an infusion of bruised wheat.\n\n\"I have seen the same species arise from the body of a dead fly, which was become putrid by lying floating for some time in a glass of water, where some flowers had been, in the month of August 1768. This species of mucor sends forth a mass of transparent filamentous roots; from whence arise hollow stems, that support little oblong oval seed vessels, with a hole on the top of each. From these I could plainly see minute globular seeds issue forth in great abundance with an elastic force, and turn about in the water as if they were animated.\n\n\"Continuing to view them with some attention, I could just discover, that the putrid water which surrounded them was full of the minutest animalcula; and that these little creatures began to attack the seeds of the mucor for food, as I have observed before in the experiment on the seeds of the larger kind of fungi or mushrooms. This new motion continued the appearance of their being alive for some time longer: but soon after, many of them arose to the surface of the water, remaining there without motion; and a succession of them afterwards coming up, they united together in little thin masses, and floated to the edge of the water, remaining there quite inactive during the time of observation.\n\n\"As this discovery cleared up many doubts which I had received from reading Mr Needham's learned dissertation, I put into the glass several other dead flies; by which means this species of mucor was propagated so plentifully, as to give me an opportunity of frequently trying the same experiment to my full satisfaction.\n\n\"Lastly, These jointed coralloid bodies, which Mr Needham calls chaplets, and pearl necklaces, I have seen frequently very distinctly. These appear not only on an infusion of bruised wheat when it becomes putrid, but on most other bodies when they throw up a viscid scum and are in a state of putrefaction. These, then, are evidently no more than the most common mucor, the seeds of which are everywhere floating in the air; and bodies in this state afford them a natural proper foil to grow upon. Here they send downwards their fine transparent ramified roots into the moisture which they float upon; and from the upper part of the scum, their jointed coralloid branches rise full of seed into little grove-like figures. When a small portion of these branches and seeds are put into a drop of the same putrid water upon which the scum floats, many of these millions of little animalcules with which it abounds, immediately seize them as food, and turn them about with a variety of motions, as in the experiments on the seeds of the common mushrooms, either singly, or two or three seeds connected together; answering exactly to Mr Needham's description, but evidently without any motion of their own, and consequently not animated.\"\n\nM. Buffon, however, is not content with denying life to those beings where the signs of it are the most obvious or equivocal; but includes in the same rank of organic different particles, almost every animal too small to be discovered by the naked eye, and even some of those whose motions are evidently perceptible to the eye. \"Almost all microscopic animals,\" says he, \"are of the same nature with the moving bodies in the seminal fluids and infusions of animal and vegetable substances. The eels in past, in vinegar, &c. are all of the same nature, and derived from the same origin. There are, perhaps, as many beings that either live or vegetate, produced by a fortuitous assemblage of organic particles, as by a constant and successive generation. Some of them, as those of the calmar, are only a kind of machines, which, though exceedingly simple, are very active. Others, as the spermatic animalcules, seem to imitate the movements of animals. Others resemble vegetables in their manner of growth and extension. There are others, as those of blighted wheat, which at pleasure can be made alternately either to live or die, and it is difficult to know to what they should be compared. There are still others, and in great numbers, which are at first a kind of animals, then become a species of vegetables, and again return alternately to their vegetable state. The eels in past have no other origin than the union of the organic particles of the most essential part of the grain. The first eels that appear are certainly not produced by other eels; but though they are not propagated themselves, they fail not to engender other living eels. By cutting them with the point of a lancet, we discover smaller eels issuing in great numbers out of their bodies. The body of this animal seems to be only a sheath or sac, containing a multitude of smaller animals, which perhaps are other sheaths of the same kind, in which the organic matter is assimilated into the form of eels.\"\n\nThough we can by no means pretend to account for this reason the appearance of these animalcules, yet we cannot help observing, that our ignorance of the cause of any phenomenon is no argument against its existence. Though we are not able to account in a satisfactory manner for the\nthe origin of the native Americans, we suppose M. Buffon himself would reckon it absurd to maintain that the Spaniards on their arrival there found only organic particles moving about in disorder. The case is the very same with the cels in paste. They are exceedingly minute in comparison with us; but, with the solar microscope, Mr Baker has made them assume a more respectable appearance, so as to have a diameter of an inch and a half, or two inches, and a length proportionable. They swam up and down very briskly; the motion of their intestines was plainly visible; when the water dried up, they died with apparent agonies, and their mouths gaped very wide. Were we to find a creature of the size of this magnified cel, gasping in a place where water had lately been, we certainly would never conclude it to be an organic particle, or a fortuitous assemblage of them; but a fish. Why then should we conclude otherwise with regard to the cel while in its natural state, than that it is a little fish? In reasoning on this subject, we ought always to remember, that, however essential the distinction of bodies into great and small may appear to us, they are not so to the Deity; with whom, as Mr Baker well expresses himself, \"an atom is as a world, and a world but as an atom.\"—Were the Deity to exert his power for a little, and give a natural philosopher a view of a quantity of paste filled with cels, from each of whose bodies the light was reflected as when it passes through a solar microscope; instead of imagining them organic particles, the paste would appear like a little mountain; he would probably look upon the whole as a monstrous assemblage of serpents, and be afraid to come near them. Wherever, therefore, we discover beings to appearance endowed with the principle of self-preservation, or whatever else we make the characteristic of animals, neither the smallest of their size, nor the imposibility of our knowing how they come there, ought to cause us doubt of their being really animated.\n\n—At the same time, it must also be remembered, that motion is not always a characteristic of animal life, even though the moving bodies should avoid one another, or any seeming obstacle placed in their way. We know, that inanimate bodies, when electrified, will avoid others endowed with an electricity of the same kind, and adhere to those which have the opposite one. As we are by no means acquainted with the utmost powers of electricity, but on the contrary, from what we do know of it have all the reason in the world to conclude that it can produce effects utterly beyond our comprehension, it is impossible for us to know what share it may have in producing the motions observed in vegetable infusions, or in the semen of animals.—We may also further observe, that though in Mr Ellis's experiment of the boiled potato he took it for granted that every seed of animal life would be destroyed by the boiling water, yet even this cannot be proved; nay, on the contrary, it hath been proved by undeniable experiments, that the human body itself hath endured a heat of 240 degrees of Fahrenheit (28 degrees above that of boiling water) without injury. The eggs of these animalcules might therefore be strong enough to resist the heat hitherto used in Mr Ellis's or any other experiment.\n\nA considerable objection to the existence of animalcules in the semen, or any other part of animal bodies, must arise from the total exclusion of air, which is found so necessary to the life of larger animals. Some instances, however, have been observed of large animals being found in such situations as they could not possibly have enjoyed the least benefit from the air for sometimes a great number of years; and in this state they have found living not only lived, but lived much longer than they would otherwise have done.\n\nIn Toulon harbour and road, are found solid hard stones, and perfectly entire; containing, in different cells, secluded from all communication with the air, several living shell fish, of an exquisite taste, called Dactyli, i.e. Dates: to come at these fish, the stones are broken with mauls. Also, along the coast of Ancona, in the Adriatic, are stones usually weighing about 50 pounds, and sometimes even more; the outside rugged, and easily broken, but the inside so hard, as to require a strong arm and an iron maul to break them; within them, and in separate niches, are found small shell fish, quite alive, and very palatable, called Salernes or Cappe lunghe. These facts are attested by Gaffendi, Blondel, Mayol, the learned bishop of Suturara, and more particularly by Aldrovandi a physician of Bologna. The two latter speak of it as a common fact which they themselves saw.\n\nIn the volume for 1719, of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, is the following passage:\n\n\"In the foot of an elm, of the bigness of a pretty corpulent man, three or four feet above the root, and exactly in the centre, has been found a live toad, middle sized, but lean, and filling up the whole vacant space: no sooner was a passage opened, by splitting the wood, than it scuttled away very hastily: a more firm and sound elm never grew; so that the toad cannot be supposed to have got into it. The egg whence it was formed, must, by some very singular accident, have been lodged in the tree at its first growth. There the creature had lived without air, feeding on the substance of the tree, and growing only as the tree grew. This is attested by Mr Hubert, professor of philosophy at Caen.\"\n\nThe volume for the year 1731 has a similar observation, expressed in these words:\n\n\"In 1719, we gave an account of a fact, which, though improbable, was well attested; that a toad had been found living and growing in the stem of a middling elm, without any way for the creature to come out or to have got in. M. Seigne, of Nantes, lays before the academy a fact just of the very same nature, except that, instead of an elm, it was an oak, and larger than the elm, which still heightens the wonder. He judges, by the time requisite for the growth of the oak, that the toad must have subsisted in it, without air, or any adventitious aliment, during 80 or 100 years. M. Seigne seems to have known nothing of the fact in 1719.\"\n\nWith the two foregoing may be clasped a narrative of Ambroise Paré, chief surgeon to Henry III, king of France, who, being a very sensible writer, relates the following fact, of which he was an eye witness:\n\n\"Being (says he) at my seat, near the village of Meudon, and overlooking a quarryman whom I had let to break some very large and hard stones; in the middle of one we found a huge toad, full of life, and without any visible aperture by which it could get there.\"\nthere. I began to wonder how it received birth, had grown, and lived; but the labourer told me, it was not the first time he had met with a toad, and the like creatures, within huge blocks of stone, and no visible opening or fissure.\"\n\nObservations of living toads, found in very hard and entire stones, occur in several authors, particularly Baptist Fulgoia doge of Genoa, the famous physicians Agricola and Horitius, and Lord Verulam; others give very specious accounts of snakes, frogs, crabs, and lobsters, being found alive, enclosed within blocks of marble, rocks, and large stones.\n\nAn instance similar to these, of the truth of which we have no reason to doubt, was observed in this country in the year 1773, where a large toad was found in the middle of a piece of coal having not the least visible crack or fissure.\n\nUpon the whole, therefore, though philosophers are not yet able to discover how these minute creatures are produced; yet, that there really are animals much smaller than what we can discern with our naked eye, seems to be indubitable. The subject, however, is still evidently obscure, and will no doubt require the utmost attention of philosophers, as well as further improvements in the construction of microscopes, fully to investigate it.\n\nAnimalcula are said to be the cause of various disorders. The itch, from several experiments, is affirmed to be a disorder arising from the irritations of a species of animalcula found in the pustules of that ailment; whence the communication of it by contact from one to another is easily conceived, as also the reason of the cure being effected by cutaneous applications. On this foundation some have attributed the smallpox and measles, and infectious diseases; others the epilepsy, &c. to animalculae. Langus goes farther, and pretends to reduce all diseases in general to the same principle. A late writer at Paris, who assumed the title of an English physician, has done more. He not only accounts for all diseases, but for the operations of all medicines, from the hypothesis of animalculae. He has peculiar animals for every disease; scurbutic animalculae, podagrical animalculae, various animalculae, &c. all at his service.

Reason and analogy give some support to the existence of infinite imperceptible animalculae. The naked eye, say some, takes in from the elephant to the mite; but there commences a new order reserved only for the microscope, which comprehends all these from the mite to those 27 millions of times smaller; and this order cannot be yet said to be exhausted, if the microscope be not arrived at its last perfection. See further on this subject the article Microscope.\n\n**ANIMATED**, or **Animate**, in a general sense, denotes something endowed with animal life. It also imports a thing to be impregnated with vermine or animalculae.\n\n**ANIMATED Horse Hairs.** See Horse Hairs.\n\n**ANIMATION** signifies the informing an animal body with a soul.—The different hypotheses of physicians and philosophers, concerning the time of animation, have had their influence on the penal laws made against artificial abortions: it having been made capital to procure miscarriage in the one state, while in the other it was only deemed a venial crime. The emperor Charles V., by a constitution published in 1532, put the matter on another footing; instead of the distinction of an animated and unanimated fetus, he introduced that of a vital and non-vital fetus, as a thing of more obvious and easy decision, and not depending on any system either of creation, traduction, or infusion. Accordingly a fetus is said, in a legal sense, to be animated, when it is perceived to stir in the womb; which usually happens about the middle of the term of gestation.\n\n**ANIME**, in Heraldry, a term used when the eyes of a rapacious creature are borne of a different tincture from the creature itself.\n\n**ANIME**, a resin exuding from the trunk of a large American tree, called by Pilo jetaiba, by the Indians courbaril, (a species of Hymenaea). This resin is of a transparent amber colour, a light agreeable smell, and little or no taste. It dissolves entirely, but not very readily, in rectified spirit of wine; the impurities, which are often in large quantity, remaining behind. The Brazilians are said to employ anime in fumigations for pains and aches proceeding from a cold cause: with us, it is rarely, if ever, made use of for any medicinal purposes.\n\n**ANIMETTA**, among ecclesiastical writers, denotes the cloth wherewith the cup of the eucharist is covered.\n\n**ANINGA**, in Commerce, a root which grows in the Antilles islands, and is pretty much like the China plant. It is used by sugar bakers for refining the sugar.\n\n**ANJOU**, a province and duchy of France before the revolution, bounded on the east by Touraine, on the south by Poitou, on the west by Bretagne, and on the north by Maine. It is now included under the departments of the Mayne and Loire, and the Sarte and Mayenne. It is 70 miles in length, and in breadth 60. Through this province run five navigable rivers: the Loire, which divides it into two parts; the Vienne, the Toue, the Mayenne, and the Sarte.\n\nThe air is temperate, and the country agreeably diversified with hills and meadows. There are 33 forests of oak trees mixed with beech. The country produces white wine, wheat, barley, rye, oats, peas, beans, flax, hemp, walnuts, and some chestnuts. In Lower Anjou they make cider. There are fruit trees of all kinds, and pasture proper for horses. The greatest riches of the province consists in cows, oxen, and sheep. There are several coal and iron mines; and yet there are but two forges in the whole province. There are quarries of marble and of slate; as well as quarries of white stone, proper for building, on the side of the river Loire. Here are also several saltpetre works and some glass-houses. The remarkable towns, besides\nANN\n\nbesides Angers the capital, are Saumur, Brissac, Pons de Cen, La Flèche, and Beaufort.\n\nANIO, (Cicero, Horace, Priscian); ANIEN, (Statius); now il Teverone: a river of Italy, which falls into the Tiber, three miles to the north of Rome, not far from Antemine. It rises in a mountain near Treba, (Pliny); and running through the country of the Æquiculi, or Æqui, it afterwards separated the Latins from the Sabines; but nearer its mouth, or confluence, it had the Sabines on each side. It forms three beautiful lakes in its course, (Pliny). In the territories of Tibur it falls from a great height, and there forms a very rapid cataract; hence the epithet praecipitans, and hence the stream caused by its fall, (Horace). Anienus is the epithet formed from it, (Virgil, Propertius). Anienus is also the god of the river, (Propertius, Statius).\n\nANISUM or ANISE.

Long. 42° 10' on the river Euphrates, in a fruitful and pleasant soil. It has two streets, which are divided by the river. That on the Mæopotamia side is about two miles long, but thinly peopled, and by none but tradesmen; that on the opposite side is about six miles in length, and it is there that the principal inhabitants of the city dwell. Every house has some ground belonging to it; and these grounds are loaded with noble fruit trees, as lemons, oranges, citrons, quinces, figs, dates, pomegranates, olives, all very large and in great plenty. Some of the flat grounds are sown with corn and other grain, which yield likewise a considerable crop. This city is the common rendezvous of all the robbers that infest the country, and from which they disperse themselves into all parts of the desert. Here they meet to consult; here they hold their grand council, and deliberate where to rob next with success. It is with great difficulty that the Turkish aga, and the janizaries, who are kept here, can levy the tribute imposed by the Turks on all the commodities carried through this city, which is one of the great thoroughfares for the passing of the caravans that go to and from Aleppo, Tripoli, Damascus, Bagdad, and some other parts of the Turkish empire.\n\nANNA Comnena, daughter of the emperor Alexius Comnenus I. was not less distinguished by her elevated rank than by her mental qualifications. Her superiority of mind began early to display itself. Depriving and neglecting the effeminacy and voluptuousness of the court in which she was educated, she directed her attention to literary pursuits. Indulging her favorite studies, she solicited the acquaintance of the more eminent philosophers of that period.\n\nBut the pursuits of literature did not induce her entirely to abandon society; she gave her hand to Nicephorus Bryennius, a young nobleman of a respectable family. This accomplished woman was, however, actuated with unjustifiable ambition; and, during the last illness of her father, she united with the empress Irene, in attempting to prevail upon that monarch to disinherit his own son, and give the crown to her husband. The affection and virtue of the father prevailed over female address and intrigue. But the ambition of Cornelia was not diminished; for she entered into a conspiracy to depose her brother; and when her husband displayed a timidity and hesitation in this unjust enterprise, she exclaimed, that \"Nature had mistaken their sexes, for he ought to have been the woman.\"\n\nEither through the vigilance of her brother, or the timidity of her husband, the treasonable plot was discovered, and Anna punished with the confiscation of all her property. But generosity has an opportunity of displaying its real nature when an enemy is vanquished; thus was the generosity of her brother displayed on the present occasion, by returning all her property. Afflicted, however, of her safe conduct, she retired from court, and never more possessed any influence there. Disappointed ambition took shelter among the walks of literature, and she employed herself in her solitude in writing the history of her father's reign. This production of her pen is still extant, and composes a part of the collection of the Byzantine historians. The flores of rhetoric are rankled to embellish this work, and every effort made to enrich it with science; but the general complexion of it is rather like an apology, than an impartial narrative. It must, however, be acknowledged, that she is not more partial than many other Latin historians, and that her history contains many valuable facts and observations. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nANNABON.

They differ from perfect history in this, that annals are but a bare relation of what passes every year, as a journal is of what passes every day; whereas history relates not only the transactions themselves, but also the causes, motives, and springs of actions. Annals require nothing but brevity; history demands ornament.—Cicero informs us of the origin of annals. To preserve the memory of events, the Pontifex Maximus, says he, wrote what passed each year, and exposed it on tables in his own house, wherever one was at liberty to read: this they called annales.\nANNAN, the capital of Annandale, a division of Dumfriesshire in Scotland; a small town, containing 500 or 600 inhabitants, and situated on a river of the same name, in W. Long. 3°. N. Lat. 54°. 40′. This place, which is a royal borough, has some trade in wine, and exports annually between 20 and 30,000 Winchester bushels (10 and 15,000 bolls) of corn. Vessels of about 250 tons can come within half a mile of the town; and of 60, as high as the bridge; which consists of five arches, defended by a gateway. A fabric for carding and spinning of cotton has lately been erected, and the town begins to increase. Here was formerly a castle; which was built by the Bruces, after they became lords of Annandale. Upon the death of David II., the son of King Robert, in 1371, this castle (Lochmaben), and the lordship of Annandale, came to Thomas Randolph earl of Murray, and went with his sister Agnes to the Dunbars, earls of March: after their forfeiture it went to the Douglasses, who also lost it by the same fate; and then having come to Alexander duke of Albany, he, for rebelling against his brother King James III., and plundering the fair of Lochmaben in 1484, was also forfeit. Since which time it continued in the hands of the king, and became the great key of the west border.\n\nThe stewarty or district of Annandale, of which Lochmaben castle was the chief fortalice, is a fertile vale, 24 miles long, and about 14 miles broad. From its vicinity to England, and the continual incursions and predatory wars of the borderers, the greatest part of it was uncultivated and common: but since the beginning of the present century, or rather within the last thirty years, all these wastes and commons have been divided and brought into culture, and the country has assumed a new appearance; which may be ascribed not only to the division of the commons, but likewise to the improvement made in the roads, and particularly in the great western road from Edinburgh to London by Moffat, Gratney, and Carlisle, running through this vale, and carried on by some gentlemen of the country, after they had obtained an act of parliament for levying a toll to defray the expense of making and keeping it in repair.\n\nAnnandale formed a part of the Roman province of Valonia; and Severus's wall ending here, it abounds with Roman stations and antiquities. The camps at Birrens in Middlebie, and on the hill of Burnswark, are still entire, and their form is preserved; and the traces and remains of a military road are now visible in different parts of the country. The ruins of the house or castle of Auchincruas, in the neighbourhood of Moffat, once the seat of that potent baron, Thomas Randolph, earl of Murray, lord of Annandale, and regent of Scotland in the minority of David II., covers above an acre of ground, and even now conveys an idea of the plan and strength of the building. The ancient castle of Comlongan, formerly belonging to the Murrays, earls of Annandale, and now to Lord Stormont, is still in a tolerable state of preservation; but except this castle and that of Hoddam, most of the other old fortalices and towers are now taken down, or in ruins.\n\nAnnandale is a marquisate belonging to the Johnstones, and the chief of the name.\n\nANNAND, WILLIAM, dean of Edinburgh in Scotland, the son of William Annand minister of Air, was born at Air in 1633. Five years after, his father was obliged to quit Scotland with his family, on account of their loyalty to the king, and adherence to the episcopal government established by law in that country. In 1641, young Annand was admitted a scholar in University college in Oxford; and though he was put under the care of a presbyterian tutor, yet he took all occasions to be present at the sermons preached by the loyal divines in and near Oxford. In 1656, being then bachelor of arts, he received holy orders from the hands of Dr Thomas Fuller, bishop of Ardfert or Kerry in Ireland, and was appointed preacher at Weston on the Green near Bicester in Oxfordshire, where he met with great encouragement from Sir Francis Norris, lord of that manor. After he had taken his degree of master of arts, he was presented to the vicarage of Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire; where he distinguished himself by his edifying manner of preaching, till 1662, when he went into Scotland, in quality of chaplain to John earl of Middleton, the king's high commissioner to the church of that kingdom. In the latter end of the year 1663, he was instituted to the Tolbooth church at Edinburgh, and from thence was removed some years after to the Tron church of that city, which is likewise a prebend. In April 1676, he was nominated by the king to the deanery of Edinburgh; and in 1685, he commenced doctor of divinity in the university of St Andrew's. He wrote, 1.

At the Reformation they were taken from the pope, and vested in the king; and, finally, Queen Anne restored them to the church, by appropriating them to the augmentation of poor livings.\n\nANNE, queen of Great Britain, second daughter of King James II. by his first wife, Anne Hyde, was born in 1664. In 1683, she married George, prince of Denmark, by whom she had several children, but none of them arrived at the age of maturity. On the death of King William, she ascended the throne, A.D. 1702, and her reign comprehends one of the most illustrious periods of English history. Possessed, however, of a very feeble character, which did not permit her to act for herself, this period is the reign of her counsellors, and favourites; and she exhibited no decided inclination which could influence state affairs, except a strong desire for Tory principles, both in church and state. In the commencement of her reign, being entirely governed by the duchess of Marlborough, she was induced to follow out the premeditated designs of her predecessors with respect to Louis XIV. king of France, and for many years, repeated successes attended her armies with glory. These were at length after a fruitless protraction of hostilities, terminated by the peace of Utrecht, in 1713. This peace was chiefly owing to the acquired influence of a female favourite of the opposite party. By an act of the legislature in the year 1706, the union of the English and Scottish nations was formed, which event contributed more than the former towards the prosperity of the kingdom. Yet these successful events prevented not the contention of parties which prevailed during the greatest part of her reign. And about the close of it, when this spirit was just on the eve of breaking into a flame, the queen manifested an ardent desire, that the exiled part of her family should succeed to the throne, and so conducted towards the superiority of the tories, as that they were inclined to push to the utmost extremity their plans, with respect to the government both of the church and state. The death of Queen Anne in August 1714, of a dropsy, in the fiftieth year of her age, and thirteenth of her reign, was therefore, equally to the disappointment of the one, and to the triumph of the other. In her private station she supported the character of an amiable woman, and not devoid of understanding, although her indolence and yielding temper prevented her from exerting it. She was generally well beloved by her subjects, whose prejudices coincided with her own, and the title of the Good Queen Anne best expresses their sentiments. Although her own dispositions, and accomplishments had no share in the honour, yet this age was rendered a sort of Augustan age of British literature, on account of the several eminent writers who flourished under her reign (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAnne Boleyn, queen of Henry VIII. king of England, daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn, a nobleman of a powerful family, and numerous alliances. The daughter of the duke of Norfolk was her mother, and during the reign of the former king her father had been honoured with several embassies. Mary the king's sister, who married Lewis XII. king of France, carried over this lady with her at an early age, where she imbibed the freedom, the vivacity, and the openness of manners of that nation. After the death of Lewis, that queen returned to England, and Anne continued to attend her royal mistress. Having some time after left her service, she was introduced into the family of the duchess of Alençon. In addition to all her acquired accomplishments, she possessed the greatest personal elegance, and was highly famed in that age.\n\nHistory does not explicitly mention whether or not, it was on her account, but upon her return to England the king expressed his scruples concerning his union with Catharine of Arragon. Enamoured, however, of Anne, he expressed his attachment to her; but she was possessed of too much virtue and policy, to confer any improper favours. This prudent and virtuous restraint only increased the passion of Henry; and placing her at court, he distinguished her by many marks of royal favour. The impetuous king at length came to the resolution to divorce his queen, to make way for his favourite Anne. In this instance, the injury done to that queen proved the cause of the final separation of England from the dominion of the pope. Various delays and difficulties occurring to the divorce, Henry privately married Anne during the month of November 1532, and in April following he publicly declared her queen of England. The famous queen Elizabeth was the first fruits of this marriage, who was born the September following. For some time she enjoyed a considerable share of the royal favour, and she made use of that influence in subduing the haughty prelate Wolsey, and widening the breach between the king and the pope. But this favour was not of long continuance; for the king, ever varying in his temper, and disappointed at her being brought to bed of a dead male child, imbibed a new passion for Jane Seymour; and troubled at the evil inclinations of the catholics, he allowed the jealousy of conjugal affection to enter his bosom, which her thoughtless demeanour tended in\nSt Anne's a great measure to realize. The king's jealousy still increasing, she was accused of adultery with several of the household officers, and even with her own brother, Lord Rochfort. She was accordingly tried on a charge of high treason, and although proof was very scanty, yet she was condemned to be beheaded; which sentence was executed in May 1536. Her behaviour on that occasion was a singular mixture of firmness and unusual levity. She avowed being guilty of many excesses, yet to the last resolutely denied any serious guilt. Although her character has been greatly depreciated by several authors, yet a letter written by her to the king after condemnation, gives a much higher idea of her character than these partial accounts would endeavour to convey.\n\nThe important part which she and her daughter acted in the Reformation has drawn upon her memory many malignant and vicious stories, by those of the catholic party, who were likewise induced to this by the expectation of being conducive to the injury of Protestantism, by stigmatizing the various characters and motives of its promoters. These various accounts are however, for the most part refuted by facts universally known, or have no evidence or probability by which they may be supported. Respecting her innocence of the charge on which she lost her life, it is a matter of uncertainty, yet it appears to be less certain that she was guilty than that her husband was a bloody and capricious tyrant. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nSt Anne's Day, a festival of the Christian church, celebrated by the Latins on the 26th of July, but by the Greeks on the 9th of December. It is kept in honour of Anne or Anna, mother of the Virgin Mary.\n\nAnnealing, by the workmen called nealing, is particularly used in making glass: it consists in placing the bottles, &c., whilst hot, in a kind of oven or furnace, where they are suffered to cool gradually: they would otherwise be too brittle for use.—Metals are rendered hard and brittle by hammering: they are therefore made red hot, in order to recover their malleability; and this is called nealing.\n\nThe difference between unannealed and annealed glass, with respect to brittleness, is very remarkable. When an unannealed glass vessel is broken, it often flies into a small powder, with a violence seemingly very unproportioned to the stroke it has received. In general, it is in greater danger of breaking from a very slight stroke than from one of some considerable force. One of those vessels will often resist the effects of a pistol bullet dropped into it from the height of two or three feet; yet a grain of sand falling into it will make it burst into small fragments. This takes place sometimes immediately on dropping the sand into it: but often the vessel will stand for several minutes after, seemingly secure; and then, without any new injury, it will fly to pieces. If the vessel be very thin, it does not break in this manner, but seems to possess all the properties of annealed glass.\n\nThe same phenomena are still more strikingly seen in glass drops or tears. They are globular at one end, and taper to a small tail at the other. They are the drops which fall from the melted mass of glass on the rods on which the bottles are made. They drop into the tubs of water which are used in the work; the greater part of them burst immediately in the water.\n\nWhen those that remain entire are examined, they discover all the properties of unannealed glass in the highest degree. They will bear a smart stroke on the thick end without breaking; but if the small tail be broken, they burst into small powder with a loud explosion. They appear to burst with more violence, and the powder is smaller, in an exhausted receiver than in the open air. When they are annealed, they lose these properties.\n\nGlass is one of those bodies which increase in bulk when passing from a fluid to a solid state. When it is allowed to crystallize regularly, the particles are so arranged, that it has a fibrous texture: it is elastic, and susceptible of long-continued vibrations; but when a mass of melted glass is suddenly exposed to the cold, the surface crystallizes, and forms a solid shell round the interior fluid parts: this prevents them from expanding when they become solid. They, therefore, have not the opportunity of a regular crystallization; but are compressed together with little mutual cohesion: On the contrary, they press outward to occupy more space, but are prevented by the external crust. In consequence of the effort of expansion in the internal parts, the greater number of glasses drops burst in cooling; and those which remain entire are not regularly crystallized. A smart stroke upon them communicates a vibration to the whole mass, which is nearly synchronous in every part: and therefore the effort of expansion has little more effect than if the body were at rest; but the small tail and the surface only are regularly crystallized. If the tail be broken, this communicates a vibration along the crystallized surface, without reaching the internal parts. By this they are allowed some expansion; and overcoming the cohesion of the thin outer shell, they burst it, and are dispersed in powder.\n\nIn an unannealed glass vessel, the same thing takes place. Sometimes the vibration may continue for a considerable time before the internal parts overcome the resistance. If the vessel be very thin, the regular crystallization extends through the whole thickness; or at least the quantity of compressed matter in the middle is so inconsiderable as to be incapable of bursting the external plate.\n\nBy the process of annealing, the glass is kept for some time in a state approaching to fluidity; the heat increases the bulk of the crystallized part, and renders it so soft, that the internal parts have the opportunity of expanding and forming a regular crystallization.\n\nA similar process is now used for rendering kettles and other vessels of cast iron less brittle: of it the same explanation may be given. The greater number of metals diminish in bulk when they pass from a fluid to a solid state; iron, on the contrary, expands.\n\nWhen cast iron is broken, it has the appearance of being composed of grains: forged or bar iron appears to consist of plates. Forged iron has long been procured, by placing a mass of cast iron under large hammers, and making it undergo violent and repeated compression. A process is now used for converting cast iron into forged, by heat alone. The cast iron is placed in an air furnace, and kept for several hours in a degree of heat, by which it is brought near to a fluid state. It is then allowed to cool gradually, and is found to be converted into forged iron. This process is\nAnnealing is conducted under a patent; although, if Reaumur's experiments upon cast iron be consulted, it will appear not to be a new discovery.\n\nBy these experiments it is ascertained, that if cast iron be exposed for any length of time to a heat considerably below its melting point, the texture and properties are not changed; but if it be kept in a heat near the melting point, the surface soon becomes lamellated like forged iron; and the lamellated structure extends farther into the mass in proportion to the length of time in which it is exposed to that degree of heat. When it is continued for a sufficient time, and then allowed to cool gradually, it is found to possess the lamellated structure throughout.\n\nCast iron, then, is brittle, because it has not had the opportunity of crystallizing regularly. When it is exposed to cold while fluid, the surface becoming solid, prevents the inner parts from expanding and arranging themselves into regular crystals. When cast iron is brought near to the melting point, and continued for a sufficient length of time in that degree of heat, the particles have the opportunity of arranging themselves into that form of crystals by which forged iron is distinguished, and by which it possesses cohesion and all its properties.\n\nThere appears, therefore, to be no other essential difference between forged and cast iron, except what arises from the crystallization. Cast iron is indeed often not sufficiently purified from other substances which are mixed with the calx. It appears also to contain a considerable quantity of calx unreduced; for during the process for converting it into forged iron, by heat alone, a pale flame arises from the metal till near the end of the process. This is owing to fixed air which the heat forces off from the calx. The expulsion of this air reduces the calx, and thereby frees the metal from that injurious mixture.\n\nThat this explanation of the annealing of iron is probable, appears also from the well-known fact of forged iron being incomparably more difficult of fusion than cast iron. A piece of forged iron requires a very violent heat to melt it; but when it is reduced to a small powder, it melts in a much lower degree of heat. Iron diminishes in bulk when it passes into a fluid state, while most other metals increase in volume. The expansion which heat occasions in bringing them to their melting point, will be favourable to their fluidity by gradually bringing the particles to the same state of separation in which they are when the mass is fluid; but the expansion of iron by heat removes it farther from that state, and keeps it in the state which is favourable to the continuance of it in a crystallized form. It will not melt till the heat expand it so much that the cohesion of crystallization be overcome. When it is reduced to a minute powder before it be exposed to the heat, it melts sooner. The crystals having been destroyed, that cohesion has no effect in preventing it from passing into a state of fluidity.\n\nUpon the same principles may be explained the almost peculiar property of welding possessed by iron, and the conversion of forged iron into steel.\n\nBut perhaps they may also be applied to platinum, a metal which has lately gained much attention. It possesses some of the properties of iron. It is still more difficult of fusion than that metal. It is susceptible of being welded. The natural grains of it can scarcely be melted in the focus of the most powerful burning glats; but when it is dissolved in aqua regia, and precipitated by potash, it has been melted in small globules by the blowpipe. When precipitated by muriate of ammonia, it has been melted in a considerable mass in the heat of a furnace; but it is said to be hard and brittle.\n\nMany attempts have been made to procure a mass of it in a malleable state, but without success. It is said that the process is now discovered by a chemist in Spain. The treatment of the metal is probably very simple. Perhaps it only consists in precipitating it in a minute powder from aqua-regia, exposing it to a strong heat which melts it, and keeping it for some time in a state nearly fluid, that it may, like iron, crystallize regularly; by this it will possess all its metallic properties.\n\nANNECY, a city of Savoy, situated between Chambéry and Geneva, on the banks of a lake of the same name, from whence run several brooks, which flow through the town, and uniting at length, form a river.

Lat. 45° 53'.\n\nANNESLEY, ARTHUR, earl of Anglesey, and lord privy seal in the reign of King Charles II., was the son of Sir Francis Annesley, Baronet, Lord Mont-Norris, and Viscount Valentia, in Ireland; and was born at Dublin on the 10th of July 1674. He was for some time at the university of Oxford, and afterwards studied the law at Lincoln's Inn. He had a considerable share in the public transactions of the last century; for in the beginning of the civil war he sat in the parliament held at Oxford; but afterwards became reconciled to the opposite party, and was sent commissioner to Ulster, to oppose the designs of the rebel Owen Roe O'Neal. He engaged in several other affairs with great success. He was president of the council of state after the death of Oliver, and was principally concerned in bringing about the Restoration; soon after which, King Charles II. raised him to the dignity of a baron, by the title of Lord Annesley, of Newport-Pagnell, Bucks; and a short time after he was made earl of Anglesey. During that reign he was employed in some very important affairs, was made treasurer of the navy, and afterwards lord privy seal. In October 1683, his lordship was charged by one Dangerfield, in an information delivered upon oath, at the bar of the house of commons, with endeavouring to stifile evidence in relation to the Popish plot, and to promote the belief of a Presbyterian one. The unseasonable he received from this attack did not prevent his speaking his opinion freely of those matters in the house of lords, particularly in regard to the Popish plot. About the same time he answered the Lord Castlehaven's Memoirs, in which that nobleman endeavoured to paint the Irish rebellion in the lightest colours; and a sharp dispute was raised, which ended in the seal's being taken from him. He was a person of great abilities, had uncommon learning, and was well acquainted with the constitution and laws of England. He wrote, besides his Animadversions on Castlehaven's Memoirs,\nMemoirs. 1. The Privileges of the House of Lords and Commons stated. 2. A Discourse on the House of Lords. 3. Memoirs. 4. The History of the Troubles in Ireland, from the rebellion in 1641 till the Reformation. 5. Truth unveiled, in behalf of the Church of England;—and some other works. He died in April 1686, in the 73rd year of his age; and was succeeded by his son James.\n\nANNEXATION, in Law, a term used to imply the uniting of lands or rents to the crown.\n\nANNIHILATION, the act of reducing any created being into nothing.\n\nChristians, Heathens, Jews, Siamese, Persians, divines, philosophers, &c., have their peculiar systems, sentiments, conjectures, not to say dreams, concerning annihilation; and we find great disputes among them about the reality, the possibility, the means, measures, prevention, ends, &c., of annihilation.\n\nThe first notions of the production of a thing from, or reduction of it to, nothing, Dr Burnet shows, arose from the Christian theology; the words creation and annihilation, in the sense now given to them, having been equally unknown to the Hebrews, the Greeks, and the Latins.\n\nThe ancient philosophers in effect denied all annihilation as well as creation, resolving all the changes in the world into new modifications, without supposing the production of anything new, or destruction of the old. By daily experience, they saw compounds dissolved; and that in their dissolution nothing perished but their union or connexion of parts; when in death the body and soul were separated, the man they held was gone, but that the spirit remained in its original state, the great soul of the world, and the body in its earth from whence it came; these were again wrought by nature into new compositions, and entered new states of being which had no relation to the former.\n\nThe Persian brahmans hold, that after a certain period of time, consisting of 71 jogs, God not only annihilates the whole universe, but every thing else, angels, souls, spirits, and all, by which he returns to the same state he was in before the creation; but that, having breathed a while, he goes to work again, and a new creation arises, to submit 71 jogs more, and then to be annihilated in its turn. Thus they hold there have been almost an infinite number of worlds; but how many jogs are elapsed since the last creation, they cannot certainly tell; only in an almanack written in the Shan-si-fu language in 1670, the world is said to be then 3,892,771 years old from the last creation.\n\nThe Siamese heaven is exactly the hell of some Socinians and other Christian writers; who, shocked with the horrible prospect of eternal torments, have taken refuge in the system of annihilation. This system seems countenanced by Scripture; for that the words death, destruction, and perishing, whereby the punishment of the wicked is most frequently expressed in Scripture, do most properly import annihilation and an utter end of being. To this Tillotson answers, that these words, as well as those corresponding to them in other languages, are often used, both in Scripture and other writings, to signify a state of great misery and suffering, without the utter extinction of the miserable. Thus God is often said in Scripture to bring destruction on a nation, when he sends judgment upon them, but without extinguishing or making an end of them. So, in other languages, it is frequent, by perishing, to express a person's being made miserable; as in that known passage in Tiberius's letter to the Roman senate: \"Ita me dixi, deoque omnes, pejus perdant, quam hodie pervire me senio.\" As to the word death, a state of misery which is as bad, or worse, than death may properly enough be called by that name; and thus the punishment of wicked men after the day of judgment is in the book of Revelation frequently called the second death.\n\nSome Christian writers allow a long time of the most terrible torments of sinners; and after that suppose that there shall be an utter end of their being. Of this opinion Irenaeus appears to have been; who, according to M. du Pin, taught that the souls, at least of the wicked, would not suffer eternally; but that, after having undergone their torments for a certain period, they would at last cease to be at all. But Tillemont, Petit, Didier, and others, endeavour to defend Irenaeus from this imputation, as being too favourable to the wicked.\n\nIt has been much disputed among divines, whether, at the consummation of all things, this earth is to be annihilated, or only purified, and fitted for the habitation of some new order of beings. Gerard in his Common Places, and Hakewil in his Apology, contend earnestly for a total abolition or annihilation. Ray, Calmet, and others, think the system of renovation or restitution more probable, and more consonant to Scripture, reason, and antiquity. The fathers who have treated on the question are divided; some holding that the universe shall not be annihilated, but only its external face changed; others asserting, that the substance of it shall be destroyed.\n\nHow widely have the sentiments of mankind differed as to the possibility and impossibility of annihilation! According to some, nothing so difficult; it requires the infinite power of the Creator to effect it: some go further, and seem to put it out of the power of God himself. According to others, nothing so easy: Existence is a state of violence; all things are continually endeavouring to return to their primitive nothing; it requires no power at all; it will do itself; nay, what is more, it requires an infinite power to prevent it.\n\nMany authors consider preservation as a continual reproduction of a thing, which, subsisting no longer of itself, would every moment return into nothing. Gafendi on the contrary affirms, that the world may indeed be annihilated by the same power which first created it, but that to continue it there is no occasion for any power of preservation.\n\nSome divines, of which number the learned Bishop King seems to be, hold annihilation for the greatest of all evils, worse than even the utmost torments of hell flames; while others, with some of the eastern philosophers, acknowledge annihilation for the ultimate pitch of happiness human nature is capable of; that sovereign good, that absolute beatitude, so long vainly sought for by the philosophers, is found here. No wonder it had been so long concealed; for who would have thought of looking for the summum bonum, where others have placed the sum of misery?\n\nThe said prelate proposes it as a question, Whether suffering eternal torments be a greater evil than not existing? He thinks it highly probable, that the damned will\nANNI will be such fools, that feeling their own misery in the most exquisite degree, they will rather applaud their own conduct, and choose to be, and to be what they are, rather than not to be at all; fond of their condition, however wretched, like people enraged, they will persist in their former sentiments without opening their eyes to their folly, and persevere by way of indignation and revenge. Mr Bayle refutes him on this head; but might, one would think, have saved himself the trouble.\n\nThe Talapoin hold it the supreme degree of happiness to have the soul totally annihilated, and freed from the burden and slavery of transmigrations. They speak of three Talapoin, who, after a great number of transmigrations, became gods; and when arrived at this state, procured this further reward of their merit, to be annihilated. The ultimate reward of the highest perfection man can arrive at is neuregan, or annihilation; which at length is granted to those who are perfectly pure and good, after their souls have wandered many thousand years through various bodies.\n\nANNI NUBILES, in Latin, denotes the marriageable age of a woman, viz. after she has arrived at twelve.\n\nANNIVERSARY, the annual return of any remarkable day. Anniversary days, in old times, more particularly denoted those days in which an office was yearly performed for the souls of the deceased, or the martyrdom of the saints was yearly celebrated in the church.\n\nANOBON, a small island of Africa, on the coast of Loango, belonging to the Portuguese. It lies in E. Long. 5° 10'. S. Lat. 1° 50' and receives its name from being discovered on New Year's day. According to Pyrard, it is about five or six French leagues in compass; but Baudrand says, it is ten leagues round. Here are two high mountains, the tops of which being continually covered with clouds, occasion frequent rains. On the south-east of the island are two rocks; one of which is low, and upon a level with the surface of the sea; the other higher and larger, but both dangerous in the night to shipping; but between them the channel is deep and clear. These rocks are inhabited by vast numbers of birds, so tame, that the sailors frequently catch them with their hands. On the same side of the island is a convenient watering place at the foot of a rivulet, which tumbles from the mountains down to a valley covered with orange and citron trees, &c., and affording a pleasant and refreshing shade; but the road on the north-west side is difficult and dangerous, though most frequented by ships who have no intention of touching upon the continent. In either place it is difficult to take in a sufficient quantity of water, on account of the violent breakings of the sea, and a stone intrenchment erected by the negroes, from which they annoy all strangers that attempt to land. The true road for shipping lies on the north-east side, where they may anchor in seven, ten, thirteen, or fifteen fathoms, on a fine sand close to the land, opposite to the village where the negroes have thrown up their intrenchments.\n\nThe climate is wholesome, and the air clear and serene for the greatest part of the year. Every part of the island is watered by pleasant brooks, and fresh water springs, which, however, at the new and full moons, or in all high tides, acquire a brackishness. The banks of every rivulet are covered with palms, whence the inhabitants extract their wine by incision. Here are a number of fertile valleys, which produce Turkey corn, rice, millet, yams, potatoes, &c., and afford pasture for abundance of oxen, sheep, goats, &c. Poultry and fish also abound here; but the only mercurial production is cotton, which is esteemed equal in quality to any produced in India, though the quantity is small.\n\nIn the year 1603, the Dutch admiral Matelief found 200 negroes, and two Portuguese, on Anobon, most of them able to bear arms, expert in the use of them, and trained up in military discipline. La Croix says, it has a town opposite to the road that contains above 100 houses, the whole surrounded by a parapet. Most of their dwellings are cane huts. In the whole island there is not a single house built of stone, and only two of wood, which belong to the Portuguese. All the inhabitants are meanly clothed; the women go bareheaded, and have also the upper part of the body naked, modestly being defended by a piece of linen wrapped under their stomach, and falling down in the form of a petticoat, or wide apron, to the knees. As to the men, they wear only a linen girdle round the loins, with a small flat before. The women carry their children on their backs, anduckle them over the shoulder. All the inhabitants are subject to the Portuguese governor, who is the chief person in the island; at the same time that the negroes have their own chief subordinate to him. They are all rigid Catholics, having either been compelled or persuaded by the arguments of the Portuguese to embrace; and, like all other converts, they are bigotted in proportion to the novelty of the belief, and their ignorance of the true tenets.\n\nANNO DOMINI, i.e. the year of our Lord; the computation of time from our Saviour's incarnation.\n\nANNOMINATION, in rhetoric, the same with what is otherwise called paranomasia. See PARONOMASIA.\n\nANNONA, in Roman Antiquity, denotes provision for a year of all sorts, as of flesh, wine, &c., but especially of corn. Annona is likewise the allowance of oil, salt, bread, flesh, corn, wine, hay, and straw, which was annually provided by the contractors for the maintenance of an army.\n\nANNONA, the Custard Apple.

See ASTRONOMY.\n\nANNUAL Leaves, are such leaves as come up afresh in the spring, and perish in winter. These stand opposed to Evergreens.\nAnnual Plants, called also simply annuities, are such as only live their year, i.e., come up in the spring and die again in the autumn; and accordingly are to be recruited every year.\n\nANNUAL RENT is used, in Scots Law, to denote a yearly profit due by a debtor in a sum of money to a creditor for the use of it.\n\nRight of ANNUAL RENT, in Scots Law, the original method of burdening lands with a yearly payment for the loan of money, before the taking of interest for money was allowed by statute.\n\nANNUAL OF NORWAY, of which mention is made in the acts of parliament of King James III. was an annual payment of an hundred merks sterling, which the kings of Scotland were obliged to pay to the kings of Norway, in satisfaction for some pretensions which the latter had to the Scottish kingdom, by virtue of a conveyance made thereof by Malcolm Kenmore, who usurped the crown after his brother's decease. This annuity was first established in 1266: in consideration whereof the Norwegians renounced all title to the succession to the isles of Scotland. It was paid till the year 1468, when the annuity, with all its arrears, was renounced in the contract of marriage between King James III. and Margaret daughter of Christian I. king of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden.\n\nANNUITY, a sum of money, payable yearly, half-yearly, or quarterly, to continue a certain number of years, for ever, or for life.\n\nAn annuity is said to be in arrear, when it continues unpaid after it falls due. And an annuity is said to be in reversion, when the purchaser, upon paying the price, does not immediately enter upon possession; the annuity not commencing till some time after.\n\nInterest on annuities may be computed either in the way of simple or compound interest. But compound interest, being found most equitable, both for buyer and seller, the computation by simple interest is universally disused.\n\nI. Annuities for a certain time.\n\nProblem 1. Annuity, rate, and time, given; to find the amount, or sum of yearly payments, and interest.\n\nRule. Make the first term of a geometrical series, and the amount of £1. for a year the common ratio; continue this series to as many terms as there are years in the question; and the sum of these series is the amount of £1. annuity for the given years; which, multiplied by the given annuity, will produce the amount sought.\n\nExample. An annuity of £40l. payable yearly, is forborne and unpaid till the end of 5 years: What will then be due, reckoning compound interest at 5 per cent. on all the payments then in arrear?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1 & : 1.05 : 1.1025 : 1.157625 : 1.21550625 \\\\\n\\text{whose sum is } & 5.2563125l.; \\text{ and } 5.2563125 \\times 40 = 210.2525 = 211l. 6s. 6d. \\text{ the amount sought.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe amount may also be found thus: Multiply the given annuity by the amount of £1. for a year; to the product add the given annuity, and the sum is the amount in two years; which multiply by the amount of £1. for a year; to the product add the given annuity, and the sum is the amount in 3 years, &c. The former question wrought in this manner follows:\n\n| 40 am. in 1 year | 126.1 am. in 3 years |\n|-----------------|---------------------|\n| 1.05            | 1.05                |\n| 42.00           | 132.405             |\n| 40              | 40                  |\n| 82 am. in 2 years | 172.405 am. in 4 years |\n| 1.05            | 1.05                |\n| 86.10           | 181.02525           |\n| 40              | 40                  |\n| 126.1 am. in 3 years | 221.02525 am. in 5 years |\n\nIf the given time be years and quarters, find the amount of the whole years, as above; then find the amount of £1. for the given quarters; by which multiply the amount for the whole years; and to the product add such a part of the annuity as the given quarters are of a year.\n\nIf the given annuity be payable half yearly, or quarterly, find the amount of £1. for half a year or a quarter; by which find the amount for the several halves or quarters, in the same manner as the amount for the several years is found above.\n\nProb. 2. Annuity, rate, and time given; to find the present worth, or sum of money that will purchase the annuity.\n\nRule. Find the amount of the given annuity by the former problem; and then, by compound interest, find the present worth of this amount, as a sum due at the end of the given time.\n\nExample. What is the present worth of an annuity of £40l. to continue 5 years, discounting at 5 per cent. compound interest?\n\nBy the former problem, the amount of the given annuity for 5 years, at 5 per cent. is 221.02525; and by compound interest, the amount of £1. for 5 years, at 5 per cent. is 1.2762815625.\n\nAnd, \\(1.2762815625 \\times 221.02525 = 281.02525000\\) (173.179 = 173l. 3s. 7½d. the present worth sought.\n\nThe present worth may be also found thus: By compound interest, find the present worth of each year by itself, and the sum of these is the present worth sought.\n\nThe former example done in this way follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1.2762815625 & \\times 40.000000000 = 51.3410 \\\\\n1.21550625 & \\times 40.0000000 = 32.6080 \\\\\n1.157625 & \\times 40.000000 = 34.5335 \\\\\n1.1025 & \\times 40.0000 = 36.2811 \\\\\n1.05 & \\times 40.00 = 38.2952 \\\\\n\\text{Present worth} & 173.1788\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIf the annuity to be purchased be in reversion, find first the present worth of the annuity, as commencing immediately, by any of the methods taught above; and then, by compound interest, find the present worth of that present worth, rebating for the time in reversion; and this last present worth is the answer.\n\nExample.\nAnnuity.\n\n**Examp.** What is the present worth of a yearly pension or rent of £5, to continue 4 years, but not to commence till three years hence, discounting at 5 per cent.?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n0.05 \\times 1 : 75 : 1500 \\\\\n1.05 \\times 1.05 \\times 1.05 \\times 1.05 = 1.21550625 \\\\\n1.21550625 \\times 1500 = 1823.25371 \\\\\n1500 \\\\\n1234.05371 \\\\\n265.94629, \\text{ present worth of the annuity, if it was to commence immediately.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1.05 \\times 1.05 \\times 1.05 = 1.157625 \\\\\nL. s. d. \\\\\n1.157625 \\times 265.94629 = 299.7344 = 229 14 8\\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Prob. 3.** Present worth, rate, and time given; to find the annuity.\n\n**Rule.** By the preceding problem, find the present worth of 1l. annuity for the rate and time given; and then say, As the present worth thus found to 1l. annuity, so the present worth given to its annuity; that is, divide the given present worth by that of 1l. annuity.\n\n**Examp.** What annuity, to continue 5 years will 173l. 3s. 7d. purchase, allowing compound interest at 5 per cent.?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n0.05 : 1 : 1 : 201 \\\\\n1.05 \\times 1.05 \\times 1.05 \\times 1.05 \\times 1.05 = 1.2762815625 \\\\\n1.2762815625 \\times 20 = 255.25625 \\\\\n20 \\\\\n15.6705 \\\\\n4.3295 \\text{ present worth of 1l annuity.} \\\\\n4.329 \\times 173.179 = 740.1 \\text{ annuity.

The annuity or yearly rent. 2. The price or present worth. 3. The rate of interest. The questions that usually occur on this head will fall under one or other of the following problems.\n\n**Prob. 1.** Annuity and rate of interest given, to find the price.\n\nAs the rate of 1l. to 1l. so the rent to the price.\n\n**Examp.** The yearly rent of a small estate is 40l.: What is it worth in ready money, computing interest at 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent.?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n0.035 : 1 : 40 : 1142.857142 = L.1142 17 1\\frac{1}{2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Prob. 2.** Price and rate of interest given, to find the rent or annuity.\n\nAs 1l. to its rate, so the price to the rent.\n\n**Examp.** A gentleman purchases an estate for 4000l. and has 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. for his money: Required the rent?\n\nAs 1 : 0.045 : 4000 : 1 : 180l. rent bought.\n\n**Prob. 3.** Price and rent given, to find the rate of interest.\n\nAs the price to the rent, so 1 to the rate.\n\n**Examp.** An estate of 180l. yearly rent is bought for 4000l.: What rate of interest has the purchaser for his money?\n\nAs 4000 : 180l. :: 1 : 0.045 rate sought.\n\n**Prob. 4.** The rate of interest given, to find how many years purchase an estate is worth.\n\nDivide 1 by the rate, and the quotient is the number of years purchase the estate is worth.\n\n**Examp.** A gentleman is willing to purchase an estate, provided he can have 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. for his money: How many years purchase may he offer?\n\n0.025 \\times 1000 = 40 \\text{ years purchase.

Life Annuities.\n\nThe value of annuities for life is determined from observations made on the bills of mortality. Dr Halley,\nMr Simpson, and Monf. de Moivre, are gentlemen of distinguished merit in calculations of this kind.\n\nDr Halley had recourse to the bills of mortality at Breslaw, the capital of Silesia, as a proper standard for the other parts of Europe, being a place pretty central, at a distance from the sea, and not much crowded with traffickers or foreigners. He pitches upon 1000 persons all born in one year, and observes how many of these were alive every year, from their birth to the extinction of the last, and consequently how many died each year, as in the first of the following Tables; which is well adapted to Europe in general. But in the city of London there is observed to be a greater disparity in the births and burials than in any other place, owing probably to the vast resort of people thither, in the way of commerce, from all parts of the known world. Mr Simpson, therefore, in order to have a table particularly suited to this populous city, pitches upon 1280 persons all born in the same year, and records the number remaining alive each year till none were in life.\n\nIt may not be improper, however, to observe, that however perfect tables of this sort may be in themselves, and however well adapted to any particular climate, yet the conclusions deduced from them must always be uncertain, being nothing more than probabilities, or conjectures drawn from the usual period of human life. And the practice of buying and selling annuities on lives, by rules founded on such principles, may be justly considered as a sort of lottery or chance work, in which the parties concerned must often be deceived. But as estimates and computations of this kind are now become fashionable, we shall subjoin some brief account of such as appear most material.\n\nDr Halley's Table on the Bills of Mortality at Breslaw.\n\n| Age | Perf. liv. | Age | Perf. liv. | Age | Perf. liv. | Age | Perf. liv. |\n|-----|-----------|-----|-----------|-----|-----------|-----|-----------|\n| 1   | 1000      | 24  | 573       | 47  | 377       | 70  | 142       |\n| 2   | 855       | 25  | 507       | 48  | 367       | 71  | 131       |\n| 3   | 798       | 26  | 566       | 49  | 357       | 72  | 120       |\n| 4   | 760       | 27  | 533       | 50  | 346       | 73  | 109       |\n| 5   | 732       | 28  | 546       | 51  | 335       | 74  | 98        |\n| 6   | 710       | 29  | 539       | 52  | 324       | 75  | 88        |\n| 7   | 692       | 30  | 531       | 53  | 313       | 76  | 78        |\n| 8   | 680       | 31  | 523       | 54  | 302       | 77  | 68        |\n| 9   | 670       | 32  | 515       | 55  | 292       | 78  | 58        |\n| 10  | 661       | 33  | 507       | 56  | 282       | 79  | 49        |\n| 11  | 653       | 34  | 499       | 57  | 272       | 80  | 41        |\n| 12  | 646       | 35  | 490       | 58  | 262       | 81  | 34        |\n| 13  | 640       | 36  | 481       | 59  | 252       | 82  | 28        |\n| 14  | 634       | 37  | 472       | 60  | 242       | 83  | 23        |\n| 15  | 628       | 38  | 463       | 61  | 232       | 84  | 20        |\n| 16  | 622       | 39  | 454       | 62  | 222       | 85  | 15        |\n| 17  | 616       | 40  | 445       | 63  | 212       | 86  | 11        |\n| 18  | 610       | 41  | 436       | 64  | 202       | 87  | 8         |\n| 19  | 604       | 42  | 427       | 65  | 192       | 88  | 5         |\n| 20  | 598       | 43  | 417       | 66  | 182       | 89  | 3         |\n| 21  | 592       | 44  | 407       | 67  | 172       | 90  | 1         |\n| 22  | 586       | 45  | 397       | 68  | 162       | 91  | 0         |\n| 23  | 579       | 46  | 387       | 69  | 152       |\n\nMr Simpson's Table on the Bills of Mortality at London.\n\n| Age | Perf. liv. | Age | Perf. liv. | Age | Perf. liv. | Age | Perf. liv. |\n|-----|-----------|-----|-----------|-----|-----------|-----|-----------|\n| 0   | 1280      | 24  | 434       | 48  | 220       | 72  | 59        |\n| 1   | 870       | 25  | 426       | 49  | 212       | 73  | 54        |\n| 2   | 700       | 26  | 418       | 50  | 204       | 74  | 49        |\n| 3   | 635       | 27  | 410       | 51  | 196       | 75  | 45        |\n| 4   | 600       | 28  | 402       | 52  | 188       | 76  | 41        |\n| 5   | 580       | 29  | 394       | 53  | 180       | 77  | 38        |\n| 6   | 564       | 30  | 385       | 54  | 172       | 78  | 35        |\n| 7   | 551       | 31  | 376       | 55  | 165       | 79  | 32        |\n| 8   | 541       | 32  | 367       | 56  | 158       | 80  | 29        |\n| 9   | 532       | 33  | 358       | 57  | 151       | 81  | 26        |\n| 10  | 524       | 34  | 349       | 58  | 144       | 82  | 23        |\n| 11  | 517       | 35  | 340       | 59  | 137       | 83  | 20        |\n| 12  | 510       | 36  | 331       | 60  | 130       | 84  | 17        |\n| 13  | 504       | 37  | 322       | 61  | 123       | 85  | 14        |\n| 14  | 498       | 38  | 313       | 62  | 117       | 86  | 12        |\n| 15  | 492       | 39  | 304       | 63  | 111       | 87  | 10        |\n| 16  | 486       | 40  | 294       | 64  | 105       | 88  | 8         |\n| 17  | 480       | 41  | 284       | 65  | 99        | 89  | 6         |\n| 18  | 474       | 42  | 274       | 66  | 93        | 90  | 5         |\n| 19  | 468       | 43  | 264       | 67  | 87        | 91  | 4         |\n| 20  | 462       | 44  | 255       | 68  | 81        | 92  | 3         |\n| 21  | 455       | 45  | 246       | 69  | 75        | 93  | 2         |\n| 22  | 448       | 46  | 237       | 70  | 69        | 94  | 1         |\n| 23  | 441       | 47  | 228       | 71  | 64        | 95  | 0         |\n\nFrom the preceding Tables the probability of the continuance or extinction of human life is estimated as follows.\n\n1. The probability that a person of a given age shall live a certain number of years, is measured by the proportion which the number of persons living at the proposed age has to the difference between the said number and the number of persons living at the given age.\n\nThus, if it be demanded, what chance a person of 40 years has to live seven years longer? from 445, the number of persons living at 40 years of age in Dr Halley's table, subtract 377, the number of persons living at 47 years of age, and the remainder 68 is the number of persons that died during these seven years; and the probability or chance that the person in question shall live these 7 years is as 377 to 68, or nearly as 5½ to 1. But, by Mr Simpson's table, the chance is something less than that of 4 to 1.\n\n2. If the year to which a person of a given age has an equal chance of arriving before he dies, be required, it may be found thus: Find half the number of persons living at the given age in the tables, and in the column of age you have the year required.\n\nThus, if the question be put with respect to a person of 30 years of age, the number of that age in Dr Halley's table is 531, the half whereof is 265, which is found in the table between 57 and 58 years; so that a person of 30 years has an equal chance of living between 27 and 28 years longer.\n\n3. By the tables, the premium of insurance upon lives may in some measure be regulated.\n\nThus,\nAnnuity.\n\nThus, the chance that a person of 25 years has to live another year, is, by Dr Halley's table, as 80 to 1; but the chance that a person of 50 years has to live a year longer is only 30 to 1; and, consequently, the premium for insuring the former ought to be the premium for insuring the latter for one year, as 30 to 80, or as 3 to 8.\n\nProb. I. To find the value of an annuity of £1. for the life of a single person of any given age.\n\nMont. de Moivre, by observing the decrease of the probabilities of life, as exhibited in the table, composed an algebraic theorem or canon, for computing the value of any annuity for life; which canon we here lay down by way of\n\nRule. Find the complement of life; and, by the tables, find the value of £1. annuity for the years denoted by the said complement; multiply this value by the amount of £1. for a year, and divide the product by the complement of life; then subtract the quotient from 1; divide the remainder by the interest of £1. for a year; and this last quotient will be the value of the annuity sought, or, in other words, the number of years purchased the annuity is worth.\n\nExam. What is the value of an annuity of £1. for an age of 50 years, interest at 5 per cent?\n\n86\n50 age given.\n36 complement of life.\n\nBy the tables, the value is, 16,5468\n\nAmount of £1. for a year,

single life, at all the current rates of interest; and is esteemed the best table of this kind extant, and preferable to any other of a different construction. But yet those who sell annuities have generally one and a half or two years more value than specified in the table, from purchasers whose age is 20 years or upwards.\n\nAnnuities of this sort are commonly bought or sold at so many years purchase; and the value assigned in the table may be so reckoned. Thus the value of an annuity of one pound for an age of 50 years, at 3 per cent. interest, is 12.51; that is, 12l. 10s. or twelve and a half years purchase. The marginal figures on the left of the column of age serve to shorten the table, and signify, that the value of an annuity for the age denoted by them is the same with the value of an annuity for the age denoted by the numbers before which they stand. Thus the value of an annuity for the age of 9 and 10 years is the same; and the value of an annuity for the age of 6 and 14, for the age of 3 and 24, &c., is the same. The further use of the table will appear in the questions and problems following.\n\nQUEST. 1.

The reader probably may wish that the reason of the rules, which, if much be owned, are intricate, had been assigned; but this could not be done without entering deeper into the subject than was practicable in this place. See Chances.\n\n3 D\nAnnuities, (Borrowing upon;) one of the methods employed by government for raising supplies.\n\nOf this there are two methods; that of borrowing upon annuities for terms of years, and that of borrowing upon annuities for lives.\n\nDuring the reigns of King William and Queen Anne, large sums were frequently borrowed upon annuities for terms of years, which were sometimes longer and sometimes shorter. In 1693, an act was passed for borrowing one million upon an annuity of 14 per cent. or of 140,000l. a-year for 16 years. In 1691, an act was passed for borrowing a million upon annuities for lives, upon terms which in the present times would appear very advantageous. But the subscription was not filled up. In the following year the deficiency was made good by borrowing upon annuities for lives at 14 per cent. or at little more than seven years purchase. In 1695, the persons who had purchased those annuities were allowed to exchange them for others of 96 years, upon paying into the exchequer 63 pounds in the hundred; that is, the difference between 14 per cent. for life, and 14 per cent. for 96 years, was sold for 63 pounds, or for four and a half years purchase. Such was the supposed infallibility of government, that even these terms procured few purchasers. In the reign of Queen Anne, money was upon different occasions borrowed both upon annuities for lives and upon annuities for terms of 32, of 89, of 98, and of 99 years.\n\nIn 1719, the proprietors of the annuities for 32 years were induced to accept in lieu of them South Sea stock to the amount of eleven and a half years purchase of the annuities, together with an additional quantity of stock equal to the arrears which happened then to be due upon them. In 1720, the greater part of the other annuities for terms of years both long and short were subscribed into the same fund. The long annuities at that time amounted to 666,821l. 8s. 3½d. a-year.\n\nOn the 5th of January 1775, the remainder of them, or what was not subscribed at that time, amounted only to 136,453l. 12s. 8d.\n\nDuring the two wars which began in 1739 and in 1753, little money was borrowed either upon annuities for terms of years, or upon those for lives. An annuity for 98 or 99 years, however, is worth nearly as much money as a perpetuity, and should, therefore, one might think, be a fund for borrowing nearly as much. But those who, in order to make family settlements, and to provide for remote futurity, buy into the public stocks, would not care to purchase into one of which the value was continually diminishing; and such people make a very considerable proportion both of the proprietors and purchasers of stock. An annuity for a long term of years, therefore, though its intrinsic value may be very nearly the same with that of a perpetual annuity, will not find nearly the same number of purchasers. The subscribers to a new loan, who mean generally to sell their subscription as soon as possible, prefer greatly a perpetual annuity redeemable by parliament, to an irredeemable annuity for a long term of years of only equal amount. The value of the former may be supposed always the same, or very nearly the same; and it makes, therefore, a more convenient transferable stock than the latter.\n\nDuring the two last mentioned wars, annuities, either for terms of years or for lives, were seldom granted but as premiums to the subscribers to a new loan, over and above the redeemable annuity to interest upon the credit of which the loan was supposed to be made. They were granted, not as the proper fund upon which the money was borrowed; but as an additional encouragement to the lender.\n\nAnnuities for lives have occasionally been granted in two different ways; either upon separate lives, or upon lots of lives, which in French are called Tontines, from the name of their inventor. When annuities are granted upon separate lives, the death of every individual annuitant diverts the public revenue so far as it was affected by his annuity. When annuities are granted upon tontines, the liberation of the public revenue does not commence till the death of all the annuitants comprehended in one lot, which may sometimes consist of twenty or thirty persons, of whom the survivors succeed to the annuities of all those who die before them; the last survivor succeeding to the annuities of the whole lot. Upon the same revenue more money can always be raised by tontines than by annuities for separate lives. An annuity, with a right of survivorship, is really worth more than an equal annuity for a separate life; and from the confidence which every man naturally has in his own good fortune, the principle upon which is founded the success of all lotteries, such an annuity generally sells for something more than it is worth. In countries where it is usual for government to raise money by granting annuities, tontines are upon this account generally preferred to annuities for separate lives. The expedient which will raise most money, is almost always preferred to that which is likely to bring about in the speediest manner the liberation of the public revenue.\n\nIn France a much greater proportion of the public debts consists in annuities for lives than in England. According to a memoir presented by the parliament of Bordeaux to the king in 1764, the whole public debt of France is estimated at twenty-four hundred millions of livres; of which the capital, for which annuities for lives had been granted, is supposed to amount to three hundred millions, the eighth part of the whole public debt. The annuities themselves are computed to amount to thirty millions a-year, the fourth part of one hundred and twenty millions, the supposed interest of that whole debt. It is not the different degrees of anxiety in the two governments of France and England for the liberation of the public revenue, which occasions this difference in their respective modes of borrowing; it arises altogether from the different views and interests of the lenders.\n\nIn Britain, the seat of government being in the greatest mercantile city in the world, the merchants are generally the people who advance money to government. By advancing it they do not mean to diminish, but, on the contrary, to increase their mercantile capitals; and unless they expected to sell with some profit their share in the subscription for a new loan, they never would subscribe. But if by advancing their money they were to purchase, instead of perpetual annuities, annuities for lives only, whether their own or those of other people, they would not always be so likely to sell them with a profit. Annuities upon their own lives they would always sell with loss; because no man will give for an annuity upon the life\nAnnuities life of another whose age and state are nearly the same with his own, the same price which he would give for one upon his own. An annuity upon the life of a third person, indeed, is, no doubt, of equal value to the buyer and the seller; but its real value begins to diminish from the moment it is granted, and continues to do more and more as long as it subsists. It can never, therefore, make so convenient a transferable stock as a perpetual annuity, of which the real value may be supposed always the same, or very nearly the same.\n\nIn France, before the revolution, the seat of government not being in a great mercantile city, merchants did not make so great a proportion of the people who advance money to government. The people concerned in the finances, the farmers general, the receivers of the taxes which were not in farm, the court bankers, &c., made the greater part of those who advance their money in all public exigencies. Such people were commonly men of mean birth, but of great wealth, and frequently of great pride. They were too proud to marry their equals, and women of quality disdained to marry them. They frequently resolved, therefore, to live bachelors; and having neither any families of their own, nor much regard for those of their relations, whom they were not always very fond of acknowledging, they desired only to live in splendour during their own time, and were not unwilling that their fortune should end with themselves. The number of rich people, besides, who were either averse to marry, or whose condition of life rendered it either improper or inconvenient for them to do so, was much greater in France than in England. To such people, who had little or no care for posterity, nothing could be more convenient than to exchange their capital for a revenue, which is to last just as long, and no longer, than they wish it to do.\n\n**ANNUITY OF TEINDS**, in *Scots Law*, a certain proportion of the teinds of ecclesiastical benefices formerly payable to the crown, but now gone into diffe.\n\n**ANNULAR**, in a general sense, something in the form of, or resembling, a ring. It is also a peculiar denomination of the fourth finger, commonly called the ring finger.\n\n**ANNULET**, in *Architecture*, a small square member in the Doric capital, under the quarter round.\n\n**ANNULET** is also a narrow flat moulding, which is common to divers places of the columns, as in the bases, capitals, &c. It is the name member which Vitruvius calls a fillet; Palladio, a fillet or cintrure; Scamozzi, and Mr Brown, a supercilium, lift, tinea, eyebrow, square, rabbit. See Architecture.\n\n**ANNULET**, a little circle, borne as a charge in coats of arms, as also added to them as a difference. Among the Romans it represented liberty and nobility. It also denotes strength and eternity, by reason of its circular form.\n\nWhen this figure is added as a difference, some authors assert, that it serves to remind the bearer to achieve great actions.\n\n**ANNULING**, a term sometimes used for cancelling or making void a deed, sentence, or the like.\n\n**ANNUNCIADA**, **ANNUNTIADA**, or **ANNUNCIATA**, an order of knighthood in Savoy, first instituted by Amadeus I. in the year 1409: their collar was of 15 links, interwoven one with another, in form of a true lover's knot; and the motto, F. E. R. T. signifying, *Fortitudi ejus Rhodum tenuit*. Amadeus VIII. gave the name Annunciada to this order, which was formerly known by that of the knot of love; changing at the same time the image of St Maurice, patron of Savoy, which hung at the collar, for that of the Virgin Mary; and, instead of the motto above mentioned, substituting the words of the angel's salutation.\n\nAnnunciada is also the title of several religious orders, instituted at different times, and at different places, in honour of the annunciation. See the next article.\n\n**ANNUNCIATION**, the tidings brought by the angel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary of the Incarnation of Christ.\n\nAnnunciation is also a festival, kept by the church on the 25th of March, in commemoration of these tidings. This festival appears to be of very great antiquity. There is mention made of it in a sermon which goes under the name of Athanasius. Others carry it up to the time of Gregory Thaumaturgus, because there is a sermon likewise attributed to him upon the same subject. But the best critics reject both these writings as spurious. However, it is certain, this festival was observed before the time of the council of Trullo, in which there is a canon forbidding the celebration of all festivals in Lent, excepting the Lord's day, and the feast of the annunciation: so that we may date its original from the seventh century.\n\nIn the Roman church, on this feast, the pope performs the ceremony of marrying or cloistering a certain number of maidens, who are presented to him in the church, clothed in white serge, and muffled up from head to foot: An officer stands by, with purifies containing notes of 50 crowns for those who make choice of marriage, and notes of a hundred for those who choose to veil.\n\nAnnunciation is likewise a title given by the Jews to part of the ceremony of the passover.\n\n**ANNUNCIATOR**, the name of an officer in the church of Constantinople. It was his business to inform the people of the festivals that were to be celebrated.\n\n**ANODYNE**, (from a privative, and ἄνω, above; or a neg. and ὀνείρον, pain), a term applied to medicines which ease pain, and procure sleep. They are divided into three sorts, viz. 1. Parergotics, or such as afflue pain. 2. Hypnotics, or such as relieve by procuring sleep. 3. Narcotics, or such as ease the patient by stupifying him.\n\nOpiates and narcotics destroy sensation. Some hypnotics and parergotics, as nitre, camphor, &c., procure ease and sleep by removing the offending cause. Camphor is said to be the best anodyne in nervous cases and at the decline of fevers. The doses of these medicines are generally regulated by the pulse.\n\n**ANOINTERS**, a religious sect in some parts of England, so called from the ceremony they used of anointing all persons before they admitted them into their church. They founded their opinion of anointing upon the fifth of James, ver. 14, and 15.\n\n**ANOLYMPIADES**, in *Antiquity*, a name given by the Elians to those Olympic games which had been celebrated under the direction of the Pheceans and Arcadians. The Elians claimed the sole right of mana-\nging the Olympic games, in which they sometimes met with competitors. The hundred and fourth Olympiad was celebrated by order of the Arcadians, by whom the Elians were at that time reduced very low; this, as well as those managed by the inhabitants of Pifa, they called ἀναγραφές, that is, \"unlawful Olympiads;\" and left them out of their annals, wherein the names of their victors and other occurrences were registered.\n\nANOMALISTICAL YEAR, in Astronomy, the time that the earth takes to pass through her orbit; it is also called the Periodical Year. The space of time belonging to this year is greater than the tropical year, on account of the precession of the equinoxes. See ASTRONOMY.\n\nANOMALOUS, a term applied to whatever is irregular, or deviates from the rule observed by other things of the like nature.\n\nANOMALOUS VERBS, in Grammar, such as are not conjugated conformably to the paradigm of their conjugation. They are found in all languages. In Latin, the verb lego is the paradigm of the third conjugation; and runs thus, lego, legit, legit: by the same rule it should be fero, feris, fert; but we say fero, fers, fert: fero, then, is an anomalous verb. In English the irregularity relates often to the preter tense and passive participle: for example, give, were it formed according to rule, would make gived in the preter tense and passive participle; whereas, in the former, it makes gave, and in the latter given.\n\nANOMALY, in Astronomy, an irregularity in the motion of the planets, whereby they deviate from the aphelion or apogee.\n\nANOMIA, in Zoology, a genus of insects belonging to the order of vermes testacea. The shell is bivalve, and the valves are unequal. One valve is perforated near the hinge; affixed by that perforation to some other body. There are 25 species of the anomia; of which only two are natives of the British seas, viz. 1. The ephippium, with the habit of an oyster; the one side convex, the other flat; perforated; adherent to other bodies, often to other shells, by a strong tendinous ligature; colour of the inside perlaceous. Size, near two inches diameter. 2. The squamula, with shells resembling the scales of fish; very delicate, and silvery; much flatted; perforated; very small. Adheres to oysters, crabs, lobsters, and shells. This species of the genus are commonly called Beaked Cockles. No name has been given to the fish that inhabits it; for the recent shells of this kind are so very rare, that there is scarcely one to be found perfect. They are perhaps, as well as that which has given its form to the corall ammonis, inhabitants of the deepest parts of the ocean; consequently it must be some extraordinary agitation of that great body of water that can bring them at all to our knowledge in their recent state.\n\nThe fossil species of the Anomia genus are uncommonly numerous in this island, in our chalk pits and limestone quarries; and in Gloucestershire they are as common on the ploughed lands as pebbles on other places.\n\nANOMOEANS, in Ecclesiastical History, the name by which the pure Arians were called, in the fourth century, in contradiction to the Semi-Arians. The word is formed from the Greek, ἀναγραφές, different, similar: For the pure Arians asserted, that the Son was of a nature different from, and in nothing like, that of the Father; whereas the Semi-Arians acknowledged a likeness of nature in the Son; at the same time that they denied, with the pure Arians, the consubstantiality of the Word. The Semi-Arians condemned the Anomoeans in the council of Seleucia; and the Anomoeans in their turn condemned the Semi-Arians in the councils of Constantinople and Antioch, erasing the word ἀναγραφές, like, out of the Formula of Rimini and that of Constantinople.\n\nANOMORHOMBIDIA, in Natural History, the name of a genus of spars; the word is derived from the Greek ἀναγραφές, irregular, and ὅμοιος, a rhomboidal figure. The bodies of this genus are pellucid crystalline spars of no determinate or regular external form, but always breaking into regularly rhomboidal masses; easily fissile, and composed of plates running both horizontally and perpendicularly through the masses, but cleaving more readily and evenly in a horizontal, than in a perpendicular direction; the plates being ever composed of irregular arrangements of rhomboidal concretions. Of this genus there are five known species. 1. A white, bright, and shattery one; found in great quantities in the lead mines of Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and Wales. 2. A milk-white, opaque, and shattery one, found in some parts of France, and very plentifully in Germany, and sometimes in Wales and Scotland, and in the hills of Yorkshire. 3. A hard, dull, and snow-white one, found in some of the mines in Derbyshire, and in many of our northern counties. 4. A hard, gray, and pellucid one, found in the lead mines of Yorkshire, and very common in Germany. And, 5. A pellucid and colourless one; this is found in the lead mines of Derbyshire and Yorkshire. All these in some degree have the double refraction of the illand crystal. See ISLAND CRYSTAL.\n\nANONIS, in Botany. See ONonis.\n\nANONYMOUS, something that is nameless, or of which the name is concealed. It is a term usually applied to books which do not express the author's name, or to authors whose names are unknown.\n\nANONYMOUS in Commerce. Partnerships in trade in France are styled anonymous, when they are not carried on under any particular name, but wherein each of the partners trades visibly on his own account, and in his own name; after which all the partners give one another an account of their profit or loss in trade. These sorts of partnerships are concealed, and known only to the parties themselves.\n\nANONYMOUS Partnerships in Trade, are also in France, such, wherein persons of fortune and quality deposit sums of money, in order to share of the profits and losses. To this end those who furnish the capital have no trouble in carrying on the trade, nor do their names appear to be any way interested therein.\n\nANONYMOUS, in Law. The sending anonymous letters demanding money, &c. is felony by the Black Act, 9 Geo. I. cap. xxii.\n\nANOREXIA, ANOREXY, (from ἀ negative, and ἐστία, appetite;) a want of appetite, or a loathing of food. The disorder is either original or symptomatic. When it is original, its causes are bad diet, too free drinking, voraciousness, &c.: In which cases, a vomit or two of ipecacuanha may be taken; and temperance, a light but cordial nourishing diet, and daily exercise, permitted.\nperished in, will generally effect a recovery. But it is more frequently a symptom of some other disorder; and then the cure depends on the removal of the original one.\n\nANOSSI, a province of the island of Madagascar, lying between Lat. 23° 18' and 26° 0' S. It is watered by many rivers, most of which run into the Franchere, Ramevotte, or Imnour, the spring of which is in a mountain called Mangabage, and discharges itself into the sea in Lat. 25° 18' S. The mouth of this river is often flooded, and the course to the sea interrupted, unless kept open by the overflowings of great rains and high tides. The water runs fast one league above the mouth, particularly in a free communication with the sea. A lake, called Ambou, is formed at the mouth, half a league wide, with depth sufficient for any ship if the mouth of the river was kept open. Next in bigness to the Franchere, is the Mangafia, which springs from a mountain called Silivon, and empties itself into the sea, where large ships may ride at anchor. Crocodiles breed in these and all the other rivers of the island.\n\nBetween the two rivers above mentioned lies Cape St Romain, half a mile distant from the mouth of the Franchere, and which runs from the north-west six or seven leagues into the sea. When the cape is passed the coast forms a great bay, in the shape of a crofs, which extends to the mouth of a river called Dian Panonge or Pitoreb. In the middle of this bay the land runs out, and almost forms a peninsula called Tbo-langare. Fort Dauphin lies to the north of this peninsula, and Port Dauphin over against it. This province has several other peninsulas and small islands belonging to it. The country is beautiful; abounds in fruit trees; is fertile in pastures for cattle; and, if carefully cultivated, would produce all the necessaries of life. It is surrounded by high mountains, which are covered with woods and shrubs; but about four miles distant from Fort Dauphin, the adjacent hills are quite destitute of verdure. The French often dug in this neighbourhood, expecting to meet with mines of gold and silver, particularly in one mountain where several springs flow near each other and empty themselves into a neighbouring river. In this river they found several stones and heaps intermixed with yellow clay, with a great quantity of black and white spangles shining like silver, which they carefully pounded and washed, but without effect. About 60 yards above these springs the grass, and every sort of vegetable, appears half dried and yellow, from a metallic fulphur, which gives that aspect; but the top of the mountain is covered with a fresh and beautiful verdure. It is said that the Portuguese found gold at the foot of this mountain on the north side, but that the place they had dug was filled up by the chiefs of the country after the Portuguese had been driven out.\n\nThe province of Anossi is inhabited by three different forts of whites, and four forts of negroes. The whites are distinguished by the names of Rohandrians, Anacandrians, and Ondzatfi. The whites are distinguished from the negroes by the general name of Zafaramini or Rabimini; and the Rohandrians are distinguished above the other whites. When they proceed to an election of a sovereign, whom they call Ompandrian, or Dian Babuache, he is chosen from the Rohandrian race. Next to him the others hold the rank of princes, and are honoured as such by all the rest of the subjects. The Anacandrians are descendants of the chiefs, but who have degenerated, and are accounted the bastard princes, or those who are descended from a Rohandrian and any inferior white or black woman. These are likewise called by the name of Ontempafiemaca, or people from the sandy parts of Mecca, from whence, they say, came the Rohandrians. Both the Rohandrians and Anacandrians wear long hair, which hangs down in curls; and enjoy the privilege of killing beasts. The Ondzatfi, or lowest class of whites, are descended from the bastards of the Anacandrians. These are all fishermen, and are allowed to kill no land animal except a chicken.\n\nThe four classes of negroes are named Voadziri, Lohavohits, Onfoa and Ondzatfi. The Voadziri, the most powerful and the richest, are masters of several villages, and descended from the original lords of the country. They enjoy the privilege of killing beasts, when at a distance from the whites, and no Rohandrian or Anacandrian in the village. The Lohavohits are descendants from the Voadziri, and also lords; but with this difference, that the one commands a whole district, and the jurisdiction of the others extends only to their own village and family. They are also permitted to kill those beasts they intend to eat, when at a distance from the whites. The Onfoa are next to the Lohavohits, and are their near relations. The Ondzatfi are the lowest of all, being originally slaves by father and mother. The Voadziri, Lohavohits, and Onfoa, enjoy the privilege of submitting themselves, on the death of their lord or king, to any chief they please. In return for such homage, the new lord makes them a present, in consequence of which he becomes heir to all their possessions. Hence the lower classes both of whites and blacks, when death approaches, are under the greatest concern and anguish of mind, well knowing that their lords will not fail to deprive their children of every thing they possess. The Ondzatfi have not the same liberty with the others; but, in times of famine, the chiefs are obliged to supply them with necessaries; which if they fail to do, they have the liberty of submitting themselves to new masters. The inhabitants of this province have no temples, and very little appearance of religion; only they keep up a custom of immolating beasts upon particular occasions, as in sickness, planting yams or rice, on assemblies, &c. They offer the first born beast to the devil and to God, naming the devil first, in this manner, Dianbilis Aminbanabare, or \"Lord Devil and God.\"—There are several towns on the river Franchere; and near this river the Portuguese had a fort built upon a steep rock, and several buildings below, with enclosures, which furnished all sorts of necessaries for their subsistence; but they were all massacred by the natives.\n\nThis province seems originally to have been inhabited by negroes. The whites or Zafaramini settled in it about 200 years ago, and conquered the negroes. But they themselves were conquered by the French, though under the government of a king whom they honoured as a god. In 1642, Captain Rivault obtained a permission to establish a colony in this part of the island; and accordingly he took possession of it in the name of the king of France, in the month of September, that same year.\nyear. The French landed 200 men, well armed, and provided with store of ammunition and other necessaries for building a fort, which they immediately set about; but no sooner did the natives observe their intention, than they used their utmost art to prevent their design from taking effect. This created a war, in which the French were victors; and, the natives becoming in time much better reconciled to them, they intermarried, and lived up and down in several towns at some distance from one another, not above five or six in a place. This tranquillity lasted for some years; but at last the natives, growing jealous, resolved to free themselves from a foreign yoke; and accordingly formed a conspiracy to cut off all the French in one day; which they soon after effected, not leaving a single person alive. In 1644 the above-mentioned Fort Dauphin was erected in Lat. 25° 6' S. Many buildings were erected, behind the fort, adjoining to the governor's house, with great enclosures that produced every sort of fruit and kitchen herb. In 1656 it was accidentally destroyed by fire; but was soon after repaired, and still continues, notwithstanding the catastrophe above mentioned, and its garrison carries on frequent wars with the natives.\n\nANOTTA, or ARNOTTA, in dyeing, an elegant red colour, formed from the pellicles or pulp of the seeds of the Bixa, a tree common in South America. It is also called Terra Orleana, and Roucou.\n\nThe manner of making anotta is as follows: The red seeds, cleared from the pods, are steeped in water for seven or eight days, or longer, till the liquor begins to ferment; then strongly stirred, stamped with wooden paddles and beaters, to promote the separation of the red skins; this process is repeated several times, till the seeds are left white. The liquor, passed through clothe cane sieves, is pretty thick, of a deep red colour, and a very ill smell; in boiling, it throws up its colouring matter to the surface in form of scum, which is afterwards boiled down by itself to a due confluence, and made up while hot into balls. The anotta commonly met with among us, is moderately hard and dry, of a brown colour on the outside, and a dull red within. It is difficulty acted upon by water, and tinges the liquor only of a pale brownish yellow colour. In rectified spirit of wine, it very readily dissolves, and communicates a high orange or yellow with red. Hence it is used as an ingredient in varnishes, for giving more or less of an orange cast to the simple yellows. Alkaline salts render it perfectly soluble in boiling water, without altering its colour. Wool or silk boiled in the solution acquire a deep, but not a very durable, orange dye. Its colour is not changed by alum or by acids, any more than by alkalies: but when imbibed in cloth, it is discharged by soap, and destroyed by exposure to the air. It is said to be an antidote to the poisonous juice of manioc or caffava.—Labat informs us, that the Indians prepare an anotta greatly superior to that which is brought to us, of a bright shining red colour, almost equal to carmine; that, for this purpose, instead of steeping and fermenting the seeds in water, they rub them with the hand, previously dipped in oil, till the pellicles come off, and are reduced into a clear paste; which is scraped off from the hands with a knife, and laid on a clean leaf in the shade to dry. De Laet, in his notes on Margrave's Natural History of Brazil, mentions also two kinds of anotta; one of a permanent crimson colour, used as a fucus or paint for the face; and another which gives a colour inclining more to that of saffron. This last, which is our anotta, he supposes to be a mixture of the first sort with certain resinous matters, and with the juice of the root of the tree. The wax or pulp in which the seeds are enclosed is a cool agreeable rich cordial, and has been long in use among the Indians and Spaniards in America, who fill mix it with their chocolate, both to heighten the flavour and raise the colour. It is said to be a successful remedy in bloody fluxes. The roots have much the same properties with the wax; but these are observed to work more powerfully by the urinary passages; they are used by some people in their broths, and seem to answer all the purposes of the pulp, but in a more faint degree. See Bixa, Botany Index.\n\nANOUT, a small island in the Schagerrack, or that part of the sea of Denmark which has Norway on the north, Jutland on the west, and the isle of Zealand on the south; it lies in 13° 0' E. Long. and 56° 36' N. Lat.\n\nANSÆ, in Astronomy, implies the parts of Saturn's ring projecting beyond the disk of the planet.—The word is Latin, and properly signifies handles; these parts of the ring appearing like handles to the body of the planet.\n\nANSARIANS, a people of Syria, so called in the country, but styled in De l'Isle's maps Enfarians, and in those of D'Anville, Nafaritis. The territory occupied by these Anfaris is that chain of mountains which extends from Antakia to the rivulet called Nahr-el-Kabir, or the Great River. The history of their origin, though little known, is yet instructive. The following account is from the Bibliothèque Orientale de Marmi, a writer who has drawn his materials from the best authorities.\n\n\"In the year of the Greeks 1202 (A.D. 891), there lived at the village of Nafar, in the environs of Koufa, an old man, who, from his fasting, his continual prayers, and his poverty, passed for a saint. Several of the common people declaring themselves his partizans, he selected from among them twelve disciples to propagate his doctrine. But the commandant of the place, alarmed at his proceedings, seized the old man, and confined him in prison. In this reverse of fortune, his situation excited the pity of a girl who was slave to the gaoler, and she determined to give him liberty. An opportunity soon offered to effect her design. One day when the gaoler was gone to bed intoxicated, and in a profound sleep, she gently took the keys from under his pillow, and after opening the door to the old man, returned them to their place unperceived by her master: the next day when the gaoler went to visit his prisoner, he was extremely astonished at finding he had made his escape, and the more so since he could perceive no marks of violence. He therefore judiciously concluded he had been delivered by an angel, and eagerly spread the report, to avoid the reprehension he merited: the old man, on the other hand, asserted the same thing to his disciples, and preached his doctrines with more earnestness than ever. He even wrote a book, in which, among other things, he says, 'I, such a one, of the village of Nafar, have seen Christ who is the word of God, who is Ahmad, son of Mohammed, son of Hanafa, of the race of Ali; who\nAnfarians who also is Gabriel: and he said to me, 'Thou art he who readeth (with understanding); thou art the man who speaketh truth; thou art the camel which preserveth the faithful from wrath; thou art the beast which carrieth their burden; thou art the (Holy) Spirit, and John, the son of Zachary. Go, and preach to men that they make four genuflexions in praying; two before the rising of the sun, and two before his setting, turning their faces towards Jerusalem: and let them lay, three times, God Almighty! God Most High! God Most Great! Let them observe only the second and third festival; let them fast but two days annually; let them not wash the prepuce, nor drink beer, but as much wine as they think proper; and lastly, let them abstain from the flesh of carnivorous animals. This old man passing into Syria, propagated his opinions among the lower orders of the country people, numbers of whom believed in him: And after a few years he went away, and nobody ever knew what became of him.\"\n\nSuch was the origin of these Anfarians, who are, for the most part, inhabitants of the mountains before mentioned.\n\nThe Anfaria are divided into several tribes or sects; among which are distinguished the Shamia, or adorers of the sun; the Kelbia, or worshippers of the dog; and the Kadmouia, who are said to pay a particular homage to that part in women which corresponds to the priapus.\n\nMany of the Anfaria believe in the metempsychosis; others reject the immortality of the soul; and in general, in that civil and religious anarchy, that ignorance and rudeness which prevail among them, the peasants adopt what opinions they think proper, following the feet they like best, and frequently attaching themselves to none.\n\nTheir country is divided into three principal districts farmed by the chiefs called Mokaddamis. Their tribute is paid to the pacha of Tripoli, from whom they annually receive their title. Their mountains are in general not so steep as those of Lebanon, and consequently are better adapted to cultivation; but they are also more exposed to the Turks; and hence, doubtless, it happens, that with greater plenty of corn, tobacco, wines, and olives, they are more thinly inhabited than those of their neighbours the Maronites and the Druzes.\n\nANSE, an ancient town of France, in the Lyons, ten miles north of Lyons. Long. 6° 55'. N. Lat. 45° 55'.\n\nANSELM, archbishop of Canterbury, in the reigns of William Rufus and Henry I. He was born in the year 1033, at Août, a town in Savoy at the foot of the Alps. He became a monk in the abbey of Bec in Normandy; of which he was afterwards chosen prior, and then abbot. In the year 1092, he was invited over to England by Hugh earl of Chester; and in the year following was prevailed on, as we are told, with great difficulty, to accept the archbishopric of Canterbury. He enjoined celibacy on the clergy; for which he was banished by King Rufus, but recalled by Henry at his coming to the crown. He refused to consecrate such bishops as were invested by the king, according to Pope Urban's decree; flatly denying it to be the king's prerogative; for this he was ousted again; till, the pope and king agreeing, he was recalled in 1107. In short, from the day of his consecration to that of his death, he was continually employed in fighting the prerogatives of the church against that of the crown; and for that purpose spent much of his time in travelling backwards and forwards between England and Rome, for the advice and direction of his Holiness. At the council of Bari, in the kingdom of Naples, the pope being puzzled by the arguments of the Greeks against the Holy Ghost's proceeding from the Father, he called upon Anselm, who was present and he distinguished their objections with great applause. Priests call him a resolute saint; to other people he appears to have been an obstinate and inflexible priest. He wrought many miracles, if we believe the author of his life, both before and after his death, which happened at Canterbury, in the 76th year of his age, anno 1109. He was canonized in the reign of Henry VII. Anselm, though we may disregard him as a saint, deserves to be remembered as one of the principal revivers of literature, after three centuries of profound ignorance.\n\nHis works have been printed in different years, and at different places, viz. Nuremb. 1491. Paris 1544 and 1549. Venice 1549. Cologne 1573 and 1612. Lyons 1630. But the best is that of Father Gerberon, printed at Paris 1675. It is divided into three parts; the first contains dogmatical tracts, and is entitled Monologia; the second contains practical and devotional tracts; the third part consists of letters, in four books.\n\nANSER, the trivial name of a species of anas. See ANAS, ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nANSER, in Astronomy, a small star, of the fifth or sixth magnitude, in the milky way, between the swan and eagle, first brought into order by Hevelius.\n\nANSERES, the name which Linnaeus gives to his third order of birds. See ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nANSIBARII, or ANSIVARIIS, an ancient people of Germany, situated somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Chauci. All we know of their history is, that, in the reign of the emperor Nero, they were driven from their own possessions by the Chauci. Being then in a forlorn condition, they took possession of some uninhabited lands, which had been used as pasture for the horses of the Roman soldiers. They were led by one Boiocalus, a man of great valour, and of known fidelity to the Romans. He remonstrated to the Romans, who objected to their taking possession of these lands, That the territory in dispute was large; and requested, that it might be allowed to an unhappy people driven from their own habitations: that, at the same time, wide tracts might be retained for the horses and cattle of the soldiers to graze in; that it was inconsistent with humanity to famish men in order to feed beasts, &c., and at last, lifting up his eyes to heaven, he asked the celestial luminaries how they could behold a desolate soil, and if they would not more justly let loose the sea to swallow up usurpers, who had enrolled the whole earth? To this the Roman commander, Avitus, replied, That the weakest must submit to the strongest; and that since the gods, to whom they had appealed, had left the sovereign judgment to the Romans, they were resolved to suffer no other judges than themselves. To Boiocalus himself, however, he privately offered lands as a reward for his long attachment to the Romans; but this offer the brave German rejected, as a price for betraying...\nbetraying his people; adding, \"A place to live in we may want, but a place to die in we cannot.\" The Anfibari now invited the neighbouring nations to join them against the Romans; but they, dreading the power of that nation, refused to give them any assistance; upon which they applied to the neighbouring nations, begging leave to settle in their territories; but being everywhere driven out as enemies and intruders, these unhappy people were reduced to wander up and down till every one of them perished.\n\nAnsko, a kingdom of Africa, bounded on the west by the river Umbre which runs into the Zaire, the kingdom of Wangua, and the Amboes who border on Loango on the north, by some deserts of Nubia; and on the south, by Songo and Sonda, provinces of Congo. Here are great numbers of wild beasts, as lions, rhinoceroses, &c., and many copper mines. The king of Ansko, or the great Macoco, commands 13 kingdoms, and is esteemed the most powerful monarch in Africa. The inhabitants of Angola have a tradition, that this is the proper country of the Giagas, who came originally from Sierra Leona, and overrun, like a torrent, the whole coast as far as Benguela; that, being weakened by numerous battles, and unable to force the defiles in order to return to Sierra Leona, they arrived on the borders of Monomotapa, where being defeated, they were forced to remain in the provinces of Ansko. Be this as it will, the Anskans yield not in the least to the Giagas in ferocities and barbarity. They are so accustomed to the eating of human flesh, that it is asserted they have markets where it is publicly sold, and that there are no other graves for the dead than the bellies of the living. They try the courage of their prisoners of war by shooting at them as at marks, directing their arrows above or around their heads; and whoever discovers the least sign of fear, is immediately devoured without remedy. Those who appear intrepid and resolute, have their noses and ears bored, and two fore teeth of the upper jaw drawn. They are then improved in barbarity, by accustoming them to the most horrid cruelties.\n\nThe Anskans are neat, well proportioned, and strong; wandering about from place to place, without either sowing or reaping. They are dreaded for their extreme brutality, and never traded with by the Europeans. Their language is barbarous, and difficult to be learned, even by the inhabitants of Congo. The most distinguished among them wear red and black caps of Portuguese velvet: the lower ranks go naked from the waist upwards: and, to preserve their health, anoint their bodies with a composition of pounded white sandal wood and palm oil. Their arms are battle axes, and small but very strong bows, adorned with serpents' skins. Their flings are made of supple and tender shoots of trees, that will not break, and their arrows of hard and light wood. These people, who kill birds flying, shoot with such surprising swiftness, that they can discharge 28 arrows from the bow before the first falls to the ground. With equal dexterity they manage their battle axes; one end of which is sharpened and cuts like a wedge, and the other flattened like a mallet, with a handle set between, about half the length of the iron, rounded at the end like an apple, and covered with the skin of a serpent.—The current money in this country is the zimbis or shell, which is\n\nANSLQ, a sea port town of Norway, in the province of Agderhus, with a bishop's see. The supreme court of justice is held here for Norway. It is situated on a bay of the same name. E. Long. 10° 14'. N. Lat. 50° 24'.\n\nAnson, George, a gentleman whose merit and good fortune, as a naval commander, elevated him to the rank of nobility. He was the son of William Anson, Esq. of Huckborough, in Staffordshire; and, showing an early inclination for the sea, received a suitable education. The first command he enjoyed was that of the Wasp, a frigate in 1722; but the most memorable action of his life, and the foundation of his future good fortune, took place on his receiving the command of five ships, a frigate, and two victuallers, equipped to annoy the Spaniards in the South seas, and to co-operate with Admiral Vernon across the isthmus of Darien; an expedition the principal object of which failed by the unaccountable delay in fitting him out. He failed, however, in Sept. 1740; doubled Cape Horn in a dangerous season; lost most of his men by the scurvy; and with only one remaining ship, the Centurion, crossed the great Pacific ocean. If no considerable national advantage resulted from this voyage, Commodore Anson made his own fortune, and enriched his surviving companions, by the capture of a rich galleon on her passage from Acapulco to Manila; with which he returned home round the Cape of Good Hope. If he was lucky in meeting this galleon, he was no less fortunate in escaping a French fleet then cruising in the Channel, by failing through it during a fog. He arrived at Spithead in June 1744. In a short time after his return, he was appointed rear-admiral of the blue, and one of the lords of the admiralty. In April 1745, he was made rear-admiral of the white, and the following year vice-admiral of the blue; at which time he was chosen to represent the borough of Heydon in parliament. In 1747, being on board the Prince George of 90 guns, in company with Admiral Warren, and 12 other ships, he intercepted, off Cape Finisterre, a powerful fleet bound from France to the East and West Indies; when, by his valour and conduct, he again enriched himself and his officers, and at the same time strengthened the British navy, by taking six men of war and four East Indiamen, not one of them escaping. The French admiral, M. Jonquiere, on presenting his sword to the conqueror, said, \"Monsieur, vous avez vaincu l'Invincible, et la Gloire vous suit;\" \"Sir, you have conquered the Invincible, and Glory follows you;\" pointing to the ships, named the Invincible and the Glory, he had taken. For his signal services, his late majesty created him baron of Soberton in Hants. The same year he was appointed vice-admiral of the red; and, on the death of Sir John Norris, was made vice-admiral of England. In 1748 he was made admiral of the blue; he was afterwards appointed first lord of the admiralty, and was at length made admiral and commander-in-chief of his majesty's fleet; in which rank\n"}
